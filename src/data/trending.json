    "body": "4 hours agoEsyllt CarrBusiness reporterPolice officers investigating the Post Office Horizon IT scandal are now considering corporate manslaughter charges.In an update, shared with victims in the past few days, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said the investigation was currently focused on eight suspects, with five interviews conducted under caution.It said there were now 53 persons of interest, most of whom were likely to be raised to suspect status at a later stage in the probe.The NPCC said while the investigation continued to focus on offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice, they were also considering charges of corporate manslaughter.The Horizon IT system, which began operating in 1999, falsely created shortfalls in Post Office branches for which sub-postmasters were held liable.The scandal has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.More than 900 people were prosecuted and some went to prison. Some died while waiting for justice.The criminal investigation into the scandal, Operation Olympos, began in 2020. A year ago, a team of about 100 officers was launched in four regional hubs, scaling up its activity after the end of the public phase of the inquiry into the scandal.Officers are now appealing to any former sub-postmasters who may have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Post Office to come forward, after it was confirmed that the NDAs would no longer be enforced.The NPCC said: \"The primary and sole focus remains the offences of Perverting the Course of Justice and Perjury and this has not changed.\"However, as was done with fraud offences previously, advice is being sought from the CPS around the offences of Corporate and Gross Negligent manslaughter.\"The chair of the public inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, published the first part of his final report on 8 July and the second volume is expected next year.The police officer leading the investigation previously told the BBC that any criminal trials may not take place before 2028.",

    "body": "Sutton's predictions v Tailenders host Felix WhiteAston Villa are going for a fourth successive Premier League victory when they travel to Brighton on Wednesday, but should Unai Emery's side change the way they have been scoring goals on their winning run?\"There is apparently some debate about whether Villa's xG (expected goals) is unsustainable because they are scoring from long range, but that's nonsense,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\"Villa have good players who can shoot from the edge of the box, so are you seriously going to tell them not to shoot now, because of xG? Give me a break.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For the midweek fixtures in week 14, he takes on musician, author and Fulham fan Felix White.White is the guitarist with The Maccabees and 86TVs. His new book 'Whatever will be, will be: A Matter of Life and Football' is out now.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image caption, White co-presents the BBC cricket podcast, Tailenders, and the official Fulham podcast, Fulham FixWhite's book follows his journey through the 2024-25 FA Cup campaign from the extra-preliminary round to the final at Wembley.\"It started accidentally when I was on tour with 86TVs, at Kendal Calling in the Lake District,\" White told BBC Sport. \"I was having a weird day and, probably like many people reading this, when I am feeling like that I quite often go and find football or cricket. I find watching it just airbrushes me, and just changes my way of thinking about the world.\"I saw Penrith were playing down the road and we weren't on stage until after 6pm, so I worked out I'd just have enough time to get back afterwards. I watched the game in their ground surrounded by hills, and it gave me a sensation almost like I was watching football for the very first time.\"Anyway, I realised at the end that I couldn't get a taxi back to the festival so I had a bit of a panic, and I ended up getting a lift with a guy called Billy Williams, who turned out to be the chairman of Penrith.\"When I was in the car with him, all these stories came flooding out and it made me think that from a literary perspective, the FA Cup is quite a profound kind of framework.\"Because of what it means to people, I realised this was an adventure where I could write a book telling a story not just about English football, but about England itself.\"Chris Sutton and Felix White were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.Tuesday, 2 DecemberVitality Stadium, 19:30 GMTThis is a difficult one to start off with. Both teams suffered bad defeats at the weekend for different reasons.Bournemouth let a two-goal lead slip as they went down 3-2 at Sunderland and have now lost three of their past four games.At 2-2, Evanilson had a goal disallowed for offside when he tapped in a deflected cross which looked like it was heading in anyway. I was trying to think back to whether I'd have done the same thing as a striker and, yes, I would. Single-mindedness is what I'd call it.Everton have surely got to defend better than they did in their 4-1 defeat by Newcastle. I just didn't expect to see them capitulate like that.Bournemouth have started leaking a few goals recently too, so maybe there is some hope for one of Everton's less-than-prolific strikers to finally find the net - but I actually think this will be quite tight and the Cherries will edge it.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Felix's prediction: These two sides are going to level out and end up quite close to each other in the table by the end of the season, in eighth or ninth or something like that. I feel like they will closely matched on Tuesday, too. 1-1AI's prediction: 2-1Craven Cottage, 19:30I am at this game for 5 Live. We had my predictions opponent Felix on the FPL Podcast last week and I know he will go for a Fulham win here - I really like him, and I enjoy listening to Tailenders, but I'm sorry to say he's going to get this prediction wrong.Fulham's home form this season probably gives Felix some hope but their record against City is absolutely awful.City have won their past 18 meetings in all competitions since 2012, which is the longest winning run by a team against any opponent in the entire history of English football, scoring 54 goals and conceding only seven.I covered City against Leeds on Saturday and they got lucky, while away from home they have lost three times already. With the run they are on against Fulham, however, there is no way they won't win this game.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Felix's prediction: This is the only game I am going to call totally from my heart and not my head. We have beaten a lot of big teams recently, but we haven't beaten City for a long time, especially at the Cottage. That changes here, and in exactly the same way that we beat Liverpool in April. So, City are going to go 1-0 up then we will score three. They will nick one back and then there will be 10 minutes of manic defending, but we will hold on. 3-2Felix on Fulham: It's been such a weird season because the table is so tight at the moment that one bad result makes everyone worry about relegation, and a couple of good ones, like we've just had, makes you think 'oh we're only five points from being fifth'.AI's prediction: 1-3St James' Park, 20:15Tottenham boss Thomas Frank needs a result. He was so relaxed when he was at Brentford but now he just looks like a guy under pressure.Frank saying the supporters who booed Guglielmo Vicario after his mistake against Fulham \"can't be true Tottenham fans\" underlines the friction he is feeling at the moment, but he does have a point about the effect that has.As a player who has been booed a lot over the years, I can tell you that it doesn't have a positive impact on your performance. Being serious, though, I just don't get it - it just creates negativity.The Spurs players will probably be relieved to be playing away after that, but Newcastle have found a bit of form in the past week so this is not an easy trip at all.Tottenham have already lost at St James' Park this season in the Carabao Cup, and I am going for a repeat result, by the same scoreline.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Felix's prediction: It feels like Newcastle are just starting to go through the gears. In contrast, with the amount of games Spurs have got and the form they are in, they are going to be struggling. 3-0AI's prediction: 2-0Wednesday, 3 DecemberEmirates Stadium, 19:30Chelsea were down to 10 men for an hour on Sunday so I was a little bit surprised Arsenal did not go for it more.There has been legitimate criticism of Gunners boss Mikel Arteta in the past about him being too negative, and I don't think they went for the jugular at Stamford Bridge.If it was 11 versus 11 then a 1-1 draw there is not a bad result at all, because Chelsea are a good team, but are Arsenal making the most of these opportunities? I am not sure.Still, I think they will bounce back and beat Brentford, and I can see them getting a few goals this time.We know the Bees will sit in and try to hit them on the counter with balls in behind for Igor Thiago, but I don't think it will work.Sutton's prediction: 3-0Felix's prediction: Arsenal are going to win this, aren't they? They just look so professional and so solid. They are going to be absolutely cruising in the title race until February or March and then if Manchester City or Chelsea, or whoever it is, are within five or six points then they might feel the pressure. I can see them losing a game or two then, but only if anyone is still close to them. For now, though, I don't see anyone beating them. 2-0AI's prediction: 2-0Amex Stadium, 19:30Villa are playing well right now but this is a tough trip for them and with their heavy schedule it might be a game too far. Brighton are in great form too, especially at home. Their boss Fabian Hurzeler has done a great job there.The Seagulls have got plenty of firepower and a strong squad so, on that basis, I am going to back them.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Felix's prediction: Brighton are in really good form. Villa are too, but I think the games might catch up with them here. 2-1AI's prediction: 1-2Turf Moor, 19:30Manchester United did not have to play particularly well to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, and Eagles boss Oliver Glasner moaned afterwards about the club's failure to bring players in over the summer.When a manager does that, I start to wonder how long he will hang around. I get it - you have to leave when your stock is high, and Glasner's certainly is at the moment.He is right, though, because their squad is stretched. Glasner must have been listening to the Monday Night Club because I've been saying the same thing since the start of the season, about how they are going to come a cropper because it is very difficult to compete without that depth.I still think Palace will win this game though, because Burnley are in a bit of bother.Scott Parker's side don't score enough goals so it was real blow for them to get level at Brentford with five minutes to go on Saturday and still get nothing from the game.I have a feeling they will battle away here too, and then see Palace sneak it late on.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Felix's prediction: Palace also have played loads of games and I had a feeling they would struggle against Manchester United before they lost on Sunday. I still think they will win this one though. It feels like Burnley ship goals at the end of games, because they don't quite last the pace. 1-3Felix on being at Wembley when Palace won last season's FA Cup: I had so many mad journeys and adventures in the book, and it almost became about finding the game that had the story behind it that had nothing to do with football, but was about the people I met or even me personally. But I do have to say that being among the Palace fans at Wembley was honestly the closest thing I've seen to an actual religious experience. The sense that they were doing something by winning their first major trophy that their parents or grandparents who supported Palace couldn't see, was incredible. It captured the very essence of the book because I was looking for the magic of the FA Cup and I found it right there. Even talking about it now, I still get shivers.AI's prediction: 1-1Molineux, 19:30Wolves actually played all right against Aston Villa on Sunday but they still lost again.There are six months of the season left to play but, let's face it, they've had it. They still only have two points from their first 13 games, and there is no way Rob Edwards can rescue them from here. They could bring in Pep Guardiola, Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho - three of the great Premier League managers - and they still wouldn't keep them up.Wolves do have something to play for, though. I didn't think any team could be as bad as Robbie Savage's Derby County side that went down with a record Premier League low of 11 points in 2007-08, so beating that total is maybe their only aim now.Nottingham Forest's defeat by Brighton on Sunday was a bit of a sickener for Sean Dyche, because he had made such a good start there. His team should be too streetwise for Wolves, though.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Felix's prediction: It's hard to see Wolves winning a game at the moment. 1-2AI's prediction: 2-1Elland Road, 20:15Leeds lumped it in the second half against Manchester City and it almost got them a point. They were lucky to still be in the game at half-time but fair play to Daniel Farke for making the substitutes and changing the system, because he has been accused of not being proactive enough during games.As lively as Leeds were, they still ended up empty-handed, however, and it means they really need something here. You know they will give it a go but, again, it is going to be hard for them to get anything out of a Chelsea side who are in really good form.There might be a bit of an edge to this one, because going back to my time as a Chelsea player there was always a rivalry here. I don't think it will be as rough and tumble as it was when these teams met in the 1970 FA Cup final, but I'm going for the same outcome, which is a Chelsea win.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Felix's prediction: I am going to call a mad one here for the sake of it. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-2Anfield, 20:15I got Liverpool wrong at the weekend because I thought they would lose at West Ham.Instead of Mo Salah, it was a case of 'No Salah' after he was left out for their 2-1 win. I didn't mind seeing that, because Salah is no different from any other player - if he is not performing, you drop him.I was wrong about Sunderland too, but that won't surprise anyone. We are at the stage where I am thinking should I do Black Cats fans a favour by tipping them to lose again here, because we know what happens when I do that - they win.I actually think they will give a good account of themselves at Anfield and it would not surprise me at all to see them going there and winning - I really mean that, too, because we've all seen how capable Regis le Bris' side are.I am still going to go with Liverpool though. I don't think they can be as bad as they were in their last two home games, against Nottingham Forest and PSV Eindhoven.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Felix's prediction: When Sunderland came to Craven Cottage last week they let us have a lot of the ball. It was like they were thinking they could sting us on the counter-attack but they almost looked like they were going to get found out. We had 20-odd chances, so I can't believe Liverpool won't do the same. 2-0AI's prediction: 3-1Thursday, 4 DecemberOld Trafford, 20:00Manchester United fought back to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday but they didn't really deserve it.They are still a basket case of a club, and you could say the same about West Ham.How can I predict what Ruben Amorim's side will do? No-one can. I can't get my head around them.There is no reason to back them here, or West Ham either. The Hammers pushed Liverpool close on Sunday, but they did not really threaten very much despite the Reds being so vulnerable defensively at the moment.There definitely won't be many goals in this game, but I already know I am going to be wrong about it.In fact, I wish I didn't have to make a prediction here, but I've been told I have to.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Felix's prediction: I am going to say Nuno Espirito Santo gets a point. 0-0AI's prediction: 2-2How did Sutton do last time?There was a three-way tie for victory at the weekend, but Chris was not involved.He got three correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 13, for a total of 30 points.Instead, the win was shared between the BBC readers, AI and Chris' guest - rapper Kofi Stone.They all got four correct results, with no exact scores, for a total of 40 points.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud.  Bureau of Prisons records show that Gentile was released on Wednesday, less than two weeks after he reported to prison. Gentile, the former chief executive and founder of GPB Capital, was convicted last year in what federal prosecutors described as a multi-year scheme to defraud more than 10,000 investors by misrepresenting the performance of private equity funds.He's the latest in a string of white-collar criminals whose sentences Trump has commuted.Gentile was convicted in August last year of securities and wire fraud charges, and sentenced in May. His co-defendant, Jeffry Schneider, was sentenced to six years in prison on the same charges. US attorney Joseph Nocella said at the time of Gentile's sentencing that GPB Capital was built on a \"foundation of lies\" and that the company made $1.6bn (£1.2bn) while using investor capital to pay distributions to other investors. \"The sentences imposed today are well deserved and should serve as a warning to would-be fraudsters that seeking [sic] to get rich by taking advantage of investors gets you only a one-way ticket to jail,\" he said. But the White House says the Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden made multiple missteps - and that investors were aware that their money could be going towards other people's dividends.\"Even though this was disclosed to investors the Biden Department of Justice claimed this was a Ponzi scheme,\" the White House official said.\"This claim was profoundly undercut by the fact that GPB had explicitly told investors what would happen.\"The official also cited concerns from Gentile that prosecutors had elicited false testimony.Trump's commutation of Gentile's sentence does not clear him of his crimes like a full presidential pardon would, and it does not get rid of other potential penalties imposed. So far in his second term, the president has pardoned or commuted the sentences of multiple people convicted of different types of fraud, including wire, securities, tax and healthcare fraud. Last month, he pardoned Tennessee state House Speaker Glen Casada who was convicted of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentEPAResident doctors last walked out in November, demonstrating in Liverpool (pictured) as well as across EnglandThe British Medical Association has announced a fresh round of strikes in England in the long-running pay dispute.Resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, will stage a five-day walkout from 17 December.This will be the 14th strike by the doctors' union since March 2023 and is expected to cause significant disruption, particularly in hospitals.NHS bosses said it was an \"inflammatory act\" by the BMA as the lead up to Christmas was always challenging.But the union said it had been left with no choice because it had not received a credible offer from the government.Resident doctors represent nearly half the medical workforce and range from doctors fresh out of university through to those with up to a decade of experience.They will walk out of both emergency and routine care, with senior doctors brought in to provide cover.Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: \"This is an inflammatory act by the BMA.\"Everyone knows in the run-up to Christmas we need all hands on deck.\"It's really important to be able to discharge as many patients as possible so that where appropriate they can be at home with their loved ones.\"It's totally unfair to patients and to other staff working for the NHS.\"Both sides need to get back round the table to break the logjam.\"The walkout follows a five-day strike held last month and that came after talks broke down between the government and union.The government had offered doctors a deal which involved creating more training posts, improving working conditions and helping them with out-of-pocket expenses such as exam fees.But the BMA turned that down, saying any deal needed to involve an increase in pay.Health Secretary Wes Streeting has maintained he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors had received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years.But the union argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Dr Jack Fletcher, chairman of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said as the government had failed to come forward with a credible plan the union had been left with no choice.But he added: \"These [strikes] do not need to go ahead. Gradually raising pay over a few years and some common-sense fixes to the job security of our doctors are well within the reach of this government.\"Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The BMA have clearly chosen to strike when it will cause maximum disruption, causing untold anxiety. “Patients and NHS staff deserve better than this cynical attempt to wreck Christmas.”The BMA's mandate for strike action ends in early January, but it has announced it will be holding another ballot of members.",

    "body": "35 minutes agoArchie MitchellandRachel Clun,Business reportersBBC/House of CommonsRichard Hughes said he took \"full responsibility\" for the shortcomings identified in the report; Rachel Reeves thanked him for his serviceThe chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has resigned following the Budget day error which saw a key document published early.Richard Hughes said in his resignation letter he took \"full responsibility\" for the issues identified in the OBR's investigation into the mistake, which it called the worst failure in the organisation's 15-year history.This year's Budget has been surrounded by controversy, with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, accused of misleading people over the state of the public finances.Earlier on Monday Sir Keir Starmer defended the chancellor against such claims and said he was \"proud\" of the Budget.The OBR assesses the health of the UK's economy. It is independent of the government but works closely with the Treasury.The OBR's early publication effectively confirmed a number of new Budget measures - including a three-year freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds - before the chancellor announced them, throwing her Budget into chaos.On Monday the report into the mishap concluded it had \"inflicted heavy damage on the OBR's reputation\" and had been \"seriously disruptive\" to the chancellor, but added that it was inadvertent.The \"ultimate responsibility\" for the circumstances which meant people could access the report early lay with the OBR's leadership, the report added.In a letter sent to both the chancellor and the chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Dame Meg Hillier, Mr Hughes said he believed the OBR could \"quickly regain and restore the confidence and esteem\" it had earned by implementing the report's recommendations.\"But I also need to play my part in enabling the organisation that I have loved leading for the past five years to quickly move on from this regrettable incident,\" he continued.\"I have, therefore, decided it is in the best interest of the OBR for me to resign as its Chair and take full responsibility to the shortcomings identified in the report.\"Mr Hughes had been due to face questions from the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday about the Budget and the OBR's economic forecasts, but Dame Meg confirmed that he would no longer attend.In response to his resignation, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"I want to thank Richard Hughes for his public service and for leading the Office for Budget Responsibility over the past five years and for his many years of public service.\"Earlier, Sir Keir denied the chancellor had misled the public, after she gave strong indications in the lead-up to the Budget that she was planning to increase income tax rates, pointing to gloomy forecasts for economic productivity.But on Friday, the OBR revealed it had told the Treasury earlier that its downgrade to productivity would be offset by higher incomes, which would boost the government's tax receipts.Asked on Monday whether Reeves had been misleading, Sir Keir said the government had committed to a number of things including cutting borrowing which meant the government \"would always have to raise revenue\".Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch noted: \"Someone has resigned as a result of the Budget chaos... but it isn't Rachel Reeves. \"The chancellor is trying to use the chair of the OBR as her human shield. But I will not let her. Why is it always someone else's fault with Starmer and Reeves?\"Paul Johnson, the former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and provost at Queen's College, Oxford said he was not surprised Mr Hughes had resigned.\"That was a really bad mistake,\" he told BBC News, but added that Mr Hughes had been a \"very effective and very robust\" head of the OBR.\"I think it's a shame for Richard Hughes and a shame for the OBR.\"Mr Hughes had only recently started his second five-year term as OBR chairman, after being renominated by the chancellor in May.  He first took up the job during the Covid pandemic in October 2020.Prior to that, he had been director of fiscal policy at the Treasury, and earlier he was the division chief of the International Monetary Fund's fiscal affairs department for eight years.Pre-existing weaknessThe OBR brought in Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, to lead the investigation into how the OBR's forecasts were accessed early. However, the OBR concluded there was no reason to suspect the involvement of foreign actors or cyber-criminals, or of \"connivance by anyone working for the OBR\". In his investigation, Prof Martin found:the OBR analysis was available at a hidden URL between 11:30 and 12:08 on the morning of the Budget it was accessed 43 times from 32 different devicesan attempt was made to access the URL as early as 05:16this was a pre-existing weakness in the OBR publication system - someone had gained early access to the March forecasts while Reeves was delivering her Spring Statementearly publication was related to the software the OBR chose to publish to its website, which was more suitable for a small or medium company than a major publication of critical market-sensitive data While OBR staff thought they had applied safeguards to prevent early publication, there were two errors in the way in which they were set up on the publishing platform WordPress that effectively bypassed these controls.One was to do with a plug-in (an optional extra) the OBR had installed, which had the unintended effect of bypassing the need to log in to access documents intended for future publication.The second was the directory in which the file was put ahead of publication allowed anyone to download a file directly.The OBR got an exemption in 2013 from using a more secure government publishing platform for independent authorities in order to help with its autonomy. In other IT security areas, such as secure email, the OBR had adopted the secure Treasury systems.A Treasury spokesperson thanked the OBR for its report and said a minister would respond \"in due course\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterWatch: Sir Keir Starmer denies \"misleading\" ahead of BudgetSir Keir Starmer has denied his chancellor misled the public about the nation's finances ahead of last week's Budget.The Conservatives have accused Rachel Reeves of giving an overly pessimistic impression as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes, with Kemi Badenoch claiming she \"lied to the public\".The prime minister insisted there was \"no misleading\", pointing to downgraded forecasts for economic productivity which he said meant the government had £16bn less than it otherwise would have had.In a speech, Sir Keir said he was \"proud\" of the Budget, highlighting measures aimed at reducing child poverty and the cost-of living.Meanwhile, the chairman of the government's independent spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has resigned over the inadvertent early publication of its analysis of the Budget.The document contained market-sensitive forecasts and revealed key details of the chancellor's statement almost an hour before she had delivered it.In his resignation letter, Richard Hughes said this was \"a technical but serious error\" and he took \"full responsibility\" for shortcomings identified in an investigation into the incident.In the run-up to her Budget on 26 November, Reeves gave strong indications the government was planning to increase income tax rates - a move which would have broken a key manifesto promise made by Labour during last year's general election campaign.The chancellor repeatedly refused to rule this out, as she pointed to forecasts for economic productivity being weaker than expected.In a rare Downing Street news conference on 4 November, she warned this \"has consequences for the public finances too, in lower tax receipts\", in comments which were widely interpreted as laying the ground for tax rises.However, on Friday the OBR revealed it had told the Treasury before the chancellor's news conference that the downgrade to productivity was offset by higher wages, which increase the government's tax revenues.This was not made public until the Financial Times reported on 13 November that income tax rates would not go up in the Budget after all, when government sources explained the move by citing better-than-expected forecasts on wages and tax receipts.Ultimately, the Budget included £26bn of tax rises, with £8bn raised by extending the freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds for a further three years, but no increase in the rates of income tax.Taking questions from journalists after his speech, Sir Keir was asked by BBC political editor Chris Mason whether, by failing to be candid about what she knew about the public finances in her pre-Budget news conference, Reeves misled the public.In response, the prime minister said the downgrade to productivity was \"a difficult starting point\", while the government had also committed to protecting the NHS, cutting borrowing costs and bearing down on the cost of living.He added: \"Against that backdrop it was inevitable that we would always have to raise revenue. So there's no misleading there.\"Sir Keir also confirmed publicly for the first time there was a point when the government thought it would have to break its manifesto pledge on tax.However, he said that during the pre-Budget process, the numbers improved and \"it became clear to me and others that we might be able to do what we needed to do with our priorities without that manifesto breach\".He added: \"I didn't want to breach the manifesto, and that's why we came to the decisions that we did.\"Badenoch has called for Reeves to resign, saying people made \"real decisions because the chancellor was telling them that she was going to raise all sorts of taxes, only for us to find out that was not the case\".Criticising leaks of potential measures ahead of the Budget, the Conservative leader told the BBC: \"Some people drew down their pension, something that is irreversible. \"Some people left the country because they were worried about an exit tax. Others fixed their mortgages in a way they would not have done.\"While she did not call for the PM to go, Badenoch said \"if he had anything to do with those misleading briefings, he has questions to answer\".Reform UK leader Nigel Farage suggested Reeves had \"wilfully attempted to mislead the British public\".\"The wrong person has resigned today, it should have been Rachel Reeves,\" he added.In his speech, Sir Keir defended the Budget as making \"necessary\" and \"fair choices\".He acknowledged that \"tax rises do make life harder for people\" but argued the alternatives were cutting public services, ignoring child poverty or extra borrowing.The PM said the Budget \"was a moment of personal pride\", highlighting how the decision to scrap the two-child benefit cap would lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.He also promised to push ahead with reforming the welfare system, which he said had \"trapped people in poverty\" and \"wrote young people off as too ill to work\".Over the summer, the government abandoned planned benefit cuts in the face of a major rebellion by Labour MPs.Challenged over whether he could get the support of his own MPs to reform the system, Sir Keir said this was a \"moral mission\" and there was a \"strong consensus\" on the need to get young people into work.He did not give further details about potential reforms, saying two ongoing reviews into \"Neets\" - 16-24-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training - and another on health and disability benefits needed to \"complete their course\".The prime minister also insisted the Budget would boost economic growth, despite the OBR concluding that not a single measure it included would change the watchdog's growth forecast for the next five years.Sir Keir said he was \"confident we can beat the forecasts\", after the OBR predicted the economy would grow at a slower rate than previously expected from next year.He vowed to cut \"unnecessary red-tape\" and regulations to get the country building.Meanwhile, he said the Brexit deal had \"significantly hurt our economy\" and promised to \"keep moving towards a closer relationship with the EU\".However, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Keir Starmer's speech talked about boosting growth but he is refusing to do the single biggest thing to achieve that - fixing our trade with the EU through a new customs union.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSimon Jack,Business editor,Nick Triggle,Health correspondentandRachel Clun,Business reporterAFP via Getty ImagesThe UK and the US have agreed a deal to keep tariffs on UK pharmaceutical shipments into America at zero.Under the agreement the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years.This is the first time the amount that the NHS pays for medicines is due to increase in more than 20 years.The deal comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs to as high as 100% on branded drug imports, one of the UK's biggest exports to the US.Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the deal \"guarantees that UK pharmaceutical exports – worth at least £5bn a year - will enter the US tariff free, protecting jobs, boosting investment and paving the way for the UK to become a global hub for life sciences.\"The UK exported £11.1bn worth of medicines to the US in the 12 months to the end of September, making up 17.4% of all goods exports in that period, according to the Department for Business and Trade.Pharmaceuticals were not included in the wave of tariffs US President Donald Trump had announced earlier this year. But he has repeatedly threatened to raise tariffs on medicines, citing concerns about America's reliance on medicines made overseas and a desire to increase manufacturing in the US.  He has also argued that US consumers effectively subsidise medicines for other developed countries by paying premium prices for those drugs and pushed for other countries to pay more. Under the terms set out on Monday, the UK will increase the price threshold, at which it deems new treatments to be too expensive, by 25%.The UK will also increase the overall amount the NHS spends on medicines, with a target to increase that spending from 0.3% of GDP to 0.6% of GDP over the next 10 years.The amount drug companies must pay back to the NHS to ensure the health system does not overspend its allocated budget will be capped at 15% - last year, drug companies had to pay back more than 20%.In exchange, UK medicine exports will be protected from tariff increases for the next three years.White House spokesman Kush Desai said the agreement with the UK was a \"historic step towards ensuring that other developed countries finally pay their fair share\".Getty ImagesThe pressure from the US had intensified a long-running row in the UK between the government and the pharmaceuticals industry over drug approvals and the cost of medicines to the NHS.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in August that he was not prepared to let drug companies \"rip off\" the UK, after talks between the government and pharmaceutical firms over the cost of medicines broke down.But subsequently Science Minister Sir Patrick Vallance told the BBC he accepted that the NHS needed to spend more on medicines after seeing its spending on drugs shrink as a percentage of its budget over the last 10 years.The NHS advisory body NICE said the changes were likely to lead to an extra three to five medicines a year being approved - currently it assesses around 70 a year and approves 90% of them.It is not clear what this will cost the NHS - drugs currently account for around 10% of the health budget.But Sally Gainsbury, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the agreement could lead to an extra £3 billion being spent on drugs, which was \"bad news\" given how stretched budgets were.\"The extra cost will need to be fully-funded by the Treasury,\" she said, adding that it would be better to invest extra money into areas such as GP services or tackling the hospital backlog instead of new drugs.In announcing the new agreement, the UK government said it was the only country in the world to have secured a zero percent tariff rate for pharmaceutical shipments.European officials have previously said they believed their drugs exports would be protected by terms agreed over the summer, which would cap tariffs on most goods at 15%.It follows pressure on the government after the cancellation or pause of several large pharma investments in the UK over the last 18 months, as firms shift attention to the US. In mid-September, British pharmaceutical giant GSK pledged to invest $30bn (£22bn) in research and manufacturing in the US over the next five years.A week before GSK's US investment announcement, US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe – revealed it was scrapping its planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations.Shortly after, AstraZeneca also announced it was pausing a planned £200m investment in a Cambridge research facility. In July, AstraZeneca said it would invest $50bn on medicine manufacturing and research and development in the US.William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said he was pleased to see that the protections from US tariffs that UK officials had promised earlier this year had been delivered. \"This deal is a real win. It will promote exports, boost investment, and enhance UK competitiveness as a production and innovation base for world-leading medicines and treatments,\" he said. US pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb said it now anticipated being able to invest more than $500m over the next five years in areas including research, development and manufacturing. \"This agreement is a sign of progress and one that creates an environment conducive to our continued presence in the UK,\" chief executive Chris Boerner said.Getty ImagesThe White House had launched a formal investigation into pharmaceutical imports and their effect on national security in April, taking the first step towards tariffs.In September in a Truth Social post, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on branded drugs - a small subset of the medicine that the US imports - to 100%, but the White House did not put the plan into effect, citing negotiations with manufacturers.In announcing the agreement on Monday, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr said Americans \"should not pay the world's highest drug costs for medicines they helped fund\".\"This agreement with the United Kingdom strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to US–UK pharmaceutical trade,\" he said in a statement.",

After weeks of insulting each other during the mayoral campaign, Republicans and Democrats are still reacting to what turned out to be a very amicable and friendly meeting.\nTrump has promised to help Mamdani make New York City a success, and “great again”, but what does this actually mean, and will the US president do it? We also look at how Mamdani will be navigating the wider politics of being a mayor, particularly with midterm elections in 2026. In New York state, can Mamdani persuade his Democratic governor to put up taxes for the wealthiest? And how will he balance maintaining good relations with both Trump and Demoratic socialists in New York? \nMeanwhile, with Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik running for governor, how will the Republican campaign deal with the president’s new attitude towards Mamdani? \nSarah and Anthony are joined by Nick Reisman, POLITICO’s Albany Bureau Chief and New York politics expert.  \nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\n- Nick Reisman, Albany Bureau Chief for Politico \nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Adriana Urbano.

    "body": "6 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesFewer than one in 10 people who could benefit from obesity jabs like Wegovy are able to get them, warns the World Health Organization as it releases its first guidance on the drugs.With more than one billion people worldwide now obese, it is calling for more widespread and fairer access to GLP-1 medication. According to projections, more than two billion will be obese by 2030 unless action is taken. High costs, limited production capacity, and supply-chain constraints are major barriers to universal access to the injections that can help people shift significant weight, says WHO. It has already added them to its \"essential\" medicines list (for overweight patients with diabetes) that countries are advised to provide. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"Our new guidance recognises that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care.\"While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms.\"WHO says these drugs, sometime called skinny jabs, represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity, from a \"lifestyle condition\" to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease.It says the drugs can be taken long-term -  for six months or more - but must be prescribed along with advice on diet and exercise, so that people can keep the weight off. Too few people around the world can access them, says WHO. \"Our greatest concern is equitable access,\" said Tedros. Skinny jab shortageEven under the current best projected scenario, the production of GLP-1 therapies could only cover around 100 million people - less than 10% of those who need them, according to the WHO.The guideline calls on countries and companies to expand access, through strategies such as voluntary licensing - where a pharmaceutical company grants permission for others to make affordable non-brand versions of its patented drug.A patent on semaglutide - the core ingredient of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy - is due to expire in several countries in 2026, meaning other drug-makers will soon be free to produce and sell cheap versions in places like India, Canada, China, Brazil and Turkey. WHO says countries must also create healthier environments to promote good health and prevent obesity.How obesity jabs workGLP-1 drugs mimick a natural hormone to slow digestion, curb appetite and increase feelings of fullness so people eat less.In the UK, the injections are prescription only medicines, which means they can only be prescribed by a healthcare professional for a person who clinically needs it.Some are available on the NHS, but more are sold privately. There is a black market and to be safe people should avoid buying from unregulated sellers such as beauty salons or via social media. People typically start to lose weight within a few weeks of starting on the weekly injections.Research suggests people may put most of the weight back on within a year of stopping the medication though, as their normal food cravings return.Being overweight or obese increases your risk for developing health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers.Obesity affects people in every country and was associated with 3.7 million deaths worldwide in 2024, according to the WHO.",

    "body": "David Dimbleby: Can William's 'ordinary Joe' approach win back more support for the monarchy?19 hours agoDavid DimblebyPresenter, What's the Monarchy For?BBCI've spent much of my career commentating on royal occasions, and over the past two years I've been looking at the institution in close detail for a personal-view documentary series, interviewing former private secretaries and communications advisers, along with royal historians, friends of King Charles III and staunch anti-monarchists, trying to understand how it works and why it has had such a hold on Britain.Now, polls suggest public approval is in decline.When asked how important it was to continue having a monarchy, as part of the first British Social Attitudes survey back in 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\". In last year's survey, just 51% of people answered the same. The proportion of young people approving of the monarchy is lower still.That's not to say that people want an elected head of state instead - a majority don't. And finding an elected President who could unite Scotland England Wales and Northern Ireland would, I suspect, be a good deal harder than some republicans think.But the declining support marks a problem. Getty ImagesIn 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\" to continue having a monarchy, as part of a British Social Attitudes survey. In last year's survey, 51% of people answered the same\"The only way the monarchy works is by everybody either being apathetic or feeling very affectionate towards it,\" argues Anna Whitelock, a professor of the history of monarchy at City, University of London.\"If those bonds are broken, there really is no purpose or point of monarchy.\"Plenty of people might be quick to put the most recent threat to those bonds down to scandal. There is no love lost between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, and the British public. Only 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of him in a YouGov poll in October (the same month he was stripped of his titles), followed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with ratings of 30% and 21% respectively.Yet no-one I spoke to while making these films pointed to any one individual as the sole reason for the current standing of the monarchy in the eyes of the public.AFP via Getty ImagesOnly 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of Andrew in a YouGov poll in October, the same month he was stripped of his titlesI suspect the real challenge facing the Royal Family is the fundamental question of what it stands for in the modern world - a world radically different to the one Elizabeth II reigned over when she ascended the throne in 1952.Even though there is evidence that suggests change is on the agenda, as the Prince of Wales acknowledged last month, what should he do, as heir to the throne - and what should King Charles do as reigning monarch - to win back more support for the institution?Winning the 'oxygen of public support'Three monarchs have been on the throne during my lifetime, and each understood that what matters is the impression they make on their subjects: their image.As the journalist and editor Ian Hislop put it when I interviewed him for my documentary series, What's The Monarchy For? \"They thrive on the oxygen of public support\".It is, ultimately, the key to their survival.They surround themselves with people who know this too. Lord Janvrin was the private secretary to the late queen until 2007. \"If you took public support for granted it would be a very bad day,\" he told me.Prof Whitelock takes this a step further. \"The Royal family is a brand,\" she explains. \"There is always a sense of needing to keep the brand popular.\"Getty ImagesThe Prince and Princess of Wales with their children at Westminster Abbey for the 'Together at Christmas' carol serviceOne of the boldest attempts the Royal Family has ever made to redefine its public image - and keep that brand popular - came back in 1969 when, for the first time, they invited cameras into the heart of family life.The film, titled Royal Family, which was broadcast on BBC and ITV, was an attempt to try to humanise them.The late queen was filmed in colour, buying a treat for a four-year-old Prince Edward in a shop, using money from her purse. \"What are you going to have? A lolly?\" she was filmed saying, briskly. \"An ice cream,\" Edward replied. As he settled in the front seat of the car, she suggested he might make a \"gooey mess\".Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThis documentary was, at the time, one of the boldest attempts the Royal Family had made to redefine its public imageThere was a picnic scene too, with Prince Philip and the Princess Royal seen barbecuing sausages.The public lapped it up. Across both transmissions it had almost twice as many viewers as the first moon landing when it broadcast.Yet a few years later, the late queen is reported to have ordered that it should never be seen again. Some reports have suggested there were copyright claims, though the Times also reported speculation that there were concerns, or even regrets about it being made.Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesA family portrait at Buckingham Palace in 1972Certainly Princess Anne didn't mince her words about the recording. \"I never liked the idea of the royal family film,\" she reportedly once said. \"I always thought it was a rotten idea.\"But it's a good example of how the Royal Family endeavour to present themselves as they want to be seen.'The degree of control I think is staggering'In September 2022, I was at Windsor to report on the final stages of Elizabeth II's funeral. The Palace issued instructions to the broadcasters about scenes that, once shown live, should never be shown again.A number were quite small things, for example, the crown being handled, somebody looking visibly upset, Prince George touching his nose, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh's handkerchiefs, and, at the lying in state, shots of the Royal Family mouthing the Lord's Prayer.These little excisions from reality - or \"perpetuity edits,\" a kind of George Orwell speak - see them remove from the world anything they don't like.On the one hand, they have the right to grieve in private; on the other, the late queen was our head of state and this is her public funeral. Do we have a right to see it all or do they have the right to control what we see?Getty Images\"The degree of control I think is staggering,\" argues Prof Whitelock. \"If Downing Street were trying to control what's being broadcast, that would be reported upon, but if the Palace is intervening in what's being shown about certain things, why is that not seen as something that should be reported?\"However, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace has said: \"The events surrounding the funeral of Her Late Majesty were both State occasions and moments of profound personal sorrow for her loved ones. In striking the appropriate balance between those two factors, simple human decency pointed towards a sensitive and sympathetic approach so as not to intrude on elements of individual grief or personal religious observance.\"In particular, we do not believe it would have been fair or appropriate to focus on younger members of the family at a time of mourning.\"Prince William and the e-scooterRecently, Prince William joined forces with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy for an episode of his travel comedy series that aired last month.Mr Levy appeared particularly amused to see his entrance - zipping around Windsor Castle on an e-scooter.\"It gets around quite nicely,\" the Prince explained, later adding: \"I'm always late so I thought this was a way to keep my meetings on time.\" He chatted on about which of Levy's films he had enjoyed. (\"All of the American Pies!\")A bright idea - the image getting across is that William is just an ordinary Joe.'Stress around family overwhelms me', Prince William saysThe social media posts that Prince William and his family share to their 17.1 million followers have a similar approach, with many showing them off-duty, with videos shot in woods, on sand dunes. One shows the Princess of Wales sharing her relief at having finished chemotherapy treatment, and reflecting on the importance \"of simply loving and being loved\".British \"adman\" Rory Sutherland, who has spent 37 years in the heart of the advertising world, currently as vice-chairman of Ogilvy, fully approves of the Waleses' approach to striking a more modern tone.\"I think he's walked the line, which is a very narrow line between modernity and kind of absurdity extremely well,\" he says of Prince William. \"It is a very delicate path to tread.\"It is, he adds, far less crude than one memorable attempt by the generation before him, when Prince Edward, Princess Anne and Andrew took part in It's a Royal Knockout charity tournament in 1987, presiding over teams of celebrities who wore costumes and did challenges like lobbing ham at each other.And it seems to be resonating. Prince William and Catherine have public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively - higher than all other family members in last month's YouGov survey.Getty ImagesPrince William and Catherine have strong public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively,  a YouGov poll suggestsProf Whitelock, though positive about Prince William and his fellow senior Royals' attempts to seem more accessible, is less sure about whether that is enough to modernise the institution as a whole.\"If the monarchy is really to modernise in a significant way, we need to see much more transparency, much more accountability,\" she argues.Tax, politics and royal lifestylesIn talking to people as research for my documentary, there seem to me to be other factors, which are potential stumbling blocks to fuller public support.First, the fact that the monarch is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax on his personal income, because the relevant laws do not apply to the Crown, and only does so voluntarily - and that he was not legally obliged to pay inheritance tax after the death of his mother.\"I think the best way to make those concessions is voluntarily rather than under duress. It's a better look certainly,\" says Rory Sutherland.A spokesperson for Kensington Palace has also said that the Prince of Wales voluntarily pays the top rate of income and capital gains tax on all his personal income, including receipts from the Duchy. No explanation was given, when asked for the documentary series, as to why the Prince of Wales has chosen not to follow his father's example of publishing his tax returns since inheriting the role.Getty ImagesKing Charles is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax but does so voluntarilySecond, the fact that the monarch has the right to be consulted on proposed legislation that may affect the Crown and can ask to be excluded from it. The question of whether the monarch takes up this right, or the extent to which it may or may not have an impact, are other matters - some have argued that the right in itself gives any monarch potential to influence.Then there is their lifestyle - particularly  when many people in the country face a cost of living crisis.Mr Sutherland does not believe the fact the royals live in palaces to be something the public particularly cares about. But he adds: \"I always thought that skiing holidays are a bit of a bad look.\"Of course there is the economic case of the sheer amount of money that the Royal Family brings to the UK thanks to tourism - but Mr Sutherland argues that while \"you can emphatically make an economic case\", it is not the right way to justify the royal's continued existence.How European monarchies workPrince William has been forthright in stating that he has change in mind.\"I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda… Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen,\" he told Mr Levy.He also said: \"There are points when you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\"So I like to question things, is what I'm really getting at.\"Getty Images'I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda,' Prince William has saidIt remains unclear exactly what he means by this. Whether it is simply fewer courtiers, a bit less ceremony, no more people calling him sir, or bowing. Or is it possible William envisages much more of a rethink?There has been some debate over the years about whether or not there is merit in a bigger shift: in making the British Royal Family more in line with the Dutch royal family, or the Scandinavian ones with a much more informal and modest style.Prof Whitelock for one believes certain parts of it could well appeal to the prince. \"I don't think the idea of dressing up in all the stuff for the coronation is something that appeals to him.\"But it comes with risks. \"Those who really support the monarchy like all that comes with it, so if we got to a point where we it looks like the Scandinavian monarchies that don't have big coronations… some people might say 'what's the point now'?\"If people are asked what defines Britain,\" she adds, \"I'm sure before too long you do get to the monarch.\"Getty ImagesThe Dutch royal family - King Willem-Alexander attended schools in the Netherlands but finished his secondary education at Atlantic College in WalesGraham Smith, chief executive of pressure group, Republic, is one of those (albeit in a UK minority) who argue that no amount of reform would be enough to win his approval.\"You should not have that family in that position of privilege and status,\" he tells me. \"They are just a bunch of very ordinary people, who just happen to be related to people who, hundreds of years ago, built big castles and won a few battles.\"Essentially, it's a ridiculous institution, which… has no justification.\"AFP via Getty ImagesMany people find having a Royal Family consoling and representative of the United KingdomI put to him that over half the country don't think it's ridiculous - many people find it consoling and representative of the United Kingdom, maybe something better than politicians. The newspapers are full of talk about monarchy too.\"Yes there is an audience,\" he says pointedly. \"But there's also an audience for the Kardashians and David Beckham.\"A masterclass in reinventionI still remember firsthand one of the Royal Family's low points. It was a Sunday in 1997 and I received the news that Diana, Princess of Wales had been killed in the crash in Paris. I was working at the BBC at the time and we were summoned to cover what had happened.We had no inkling at the time what the public response would be - but it was soon clear that something astonishing was happening.There was an outpouring of popular grief. The press started reporting that thousands of people in London were bringing flowers to Kensington Palace but that the Royal Family had remained up in Balmoral and were not responding.Getty ImagesLord Janvrin was in Balmoral with the late queen. \"A choice had to be made between looking after the two young princes and getting back to London.\"Yet the public criticism was sharp. It was a lesson in the cruel demands of monarchy on those who belong to it. And a lesson to never again get behind the story.Support for the monarchy had already been declining. The year after Diana's death, it dipped further, with just 63.5% of people saying it was important for Britain to have a monarchy, according to the British Attitudes Survey. It took time for the approval ratings to climb back to their previous levels – but eventually they did, reaching 75% by 2012.It shows that this institution can recover from disapproval.Getty ImagesThe present and the future of the monarchy: King Charles III and the Prince of Wales\"It is highly, highly culturally adaptive,\" says Mr Sutherland, \"and obviously an 18th century monarchy might look absurd to us today but at the time it was permanently effectively adapting to changed circumstances, which is one of the reasons it is still around and lots of monarchies aren't.\"No matter what changes Prince William makes - nor Prince George after him - the bigger question of what becomes of the monarchy in the distant future may not be theirs to decide.The monarchy's existence thrives on the \"oxygen of public support\", so it is the public themselves who will decide through that support whether having this kind of head of state continues to suit us as a country.David Dimbleby's documentary series, What's the Monarchy For? starts on Tuesday 2 December on BBC1 and BBC iPlayerMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

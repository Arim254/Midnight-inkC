    "body": "3 hours agoFiona NimoniGetty ImagesJojo Moyes revealed Sophie Kinsella's support to the Desert Island Discs showThe late author Sophie Kinsella convinced fellow writer Jojo Moyes to complete her bestselling romance novel Me Before You. Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Moyes has credited Kinsella with inspiring her to keep going, when she nearly gave up on the book after writing 20,000 words. It became an international bestseller and was adapted for the 2016 film starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Kinsella, whose real name was Madeleine Sophie Wickham, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022 and died earlier this month at the age of 55.  Author Sophie Kinsella remembered as a 'wonderful, warm woman'Speaking to Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Moyes described how she almost abandoned writing her bestselling novel because she was feeling depressed after years of little commercial success. She said: \"I met up with my friend Sophie Kinsella and had lunch with her and I was broke at the time and I was feeling quite depressed because I thought my writing career was coming to an end.\"I told her the story of my 20,000 words over lunch and she just looked at me, and she said, 'You have to write this book, you do know that? You have to write this book'.\"When I got home, her husband, Henry, called me up and said, 'Jojo, Maddy... told me about this book and I think you should write it too'.\"I love her for many reasons, but that's one of them.\"The Me Before You series follows the life of Louisa Clark, a working-class girl who ends up as a carer for paraplegic Will Traynor, a wealthy man who is paralysed after a motorcycle accident.The book was based on a news story Moyes had seen about a young rugby player who had been left quadriplegic after an accident and persuaded his parents to take him to a Swiss assisted dying clinic. \"I knew I loved this book and I knew it was the best version of itself that it could be, but I had no idea it was going to resonate in the way that it did,\" she told Laverne. The full interview is available to listen to on BBC Sounds. Getty ImagesSophie Kinsella was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022",

    "body": "Dark energy just got even weirder and why the Universe may end in a 'Big Crunch'15 hours agoPallab GhoshKPNO/NOIRLabA lonely telescope in the Arizona desert tracks millions of distant galaxies to determine the ultimate fate of the UniverseThere is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space.An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by gravity, ending in what astronomers call a \"Big Crunch\".The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation.Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team's assertions.NASA/ESAThese are thousands of galaxies captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. dark energy is driving them apart at ever increasing speedWhat is dark energy?Astronomers previously thought the Universe's expansion, which began with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow due to gravity.Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down, distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other.Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms themselves apart in a \"Big Rip\".The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi).Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof Ofer Lahav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi project.\"Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of physics,\" he says.Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the weirdness of dark energy is weirder still.Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27 years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were.This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down.\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Prof Lee tells BBC News starkly.\"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"If, as Prof Lee's results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back together.\"Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a possibility.\"Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for which we still do not know the answer,\" says Prof Lee.Prof Lee's work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\"I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of supernovas,\" he says. \"The correlation with age is not very tight, so I think it is dangerous to apply a 'correction'. It looks weak to me.\"The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with almost unchanging dark energy.But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms.\"Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel that already our research is very, very significant.\"Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley LabA cathedral for the cosmos: an instrument inside this telescope can track the movement of 5,000 galaxies at a timeSince the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah. They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that dark energy was changing was so controversial.Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny.Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial ghosts.Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS's Deputy Director.\"Who doesn't want to understand how the universe is going to end and how it began?\" he says. \"Human beings have always been interested in that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific one.\"Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many billions of years, wouldn't that be extraordinary?\"",

    "body": "A cruise ship has run aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on its first trip since the death of an elderly passenger in late October. The Coral Adventurer is currently under investigation over the death of Suzanne Rees, 80, who died on a remote Australian island after being left behind by the ship. On Saturday, the vessel suffered a \"grounding incident\" off the eastern coast of PNG, around 30km (18 miles) from the city of Lae, a spokesperson for the ship said. All passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship have been reported safe, and initial inspections have not revealed any damage to the hull. Further inspections will take place on Sunday. A spokesperson for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) told the BBC in a statement that it had not received a distress call from the Coral Adventurer.It added it was monitoring the situation and would support PNG authorities if necessary. No decisions have been made about the current 12-day voyage, which was due to finish on 30 December.There were 80 passengers and 43 crew members aboard the ship at the time of the incident.The Coral Adventurer is currently the subject of a joint investigation by Amsa and Queensland Police, Ms Rees was found dead on Lizard Island on 26 October.She had been hiking on the island with fellow passengers, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The ship was just two days into a 60-day voyage at the time of Ms Rees's death. The remainder of the cruise was cancelled with full refunds offered to all passengers.  The CEO of Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.Mr Fifield added that the cruise operator was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Amsa was not able to comment on the status of the investigation, and told the BBC that it was \"not in the practice of making the results of its investigations public\".

    "body": "4 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystThe number of executions in Iran in 2025 is estimated to have more than doubled compared to the number that took place across the country in 2024. Norwegian-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group told the BBC it had verified at least 1,500 executions up until the start of December, adding that many more have taken place since.Last year, IHR was able to verify 975 executions - although the exact number is never completely clear as Iranian authorities do not give official figures.However, the analysis shows another significant annual rise, and the figures chime with those provided by other monitoring groups.Iran's government has previously defended its use of the death penalty, saying it is limited to only \"the most severe crimes\".Execution figures were already on the rise before mass demonstrations broke out across the country in 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Kurdish woman was detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab \"improperly\".That protest movement represented the biggest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran's theocratic leadership for many years.In response, authorities intensified the rate of executions from around 520 in 2022 to 832 the following year - according to the figures verified by IHR.There have been some executions for protesters or alleged spies - but 99% of those executed have been for murder or drug offences - a ratio which has remained constant.Activists have said that the rate of executions in Iran increases when the regime feels under threat and that the aim is to forestall internal opposition by instilling fear in the population.It seems to be borne out by the fact that since the 12-day war with Israel in June, as well as major setbacks for Iran's proxy forces across the region, there's been another big surge.",

Further north, regional utility company Hemab said one of its employees died in an accident while out working.Police also said a man in his 60s was taken to hospital after being hit by a tree while working in a forest in Hofors, east-central Sweden, and later died of his injuries.Tens of thousands of homes in Sweden, Norway and Finland have been left without power as a result of the storm.In Sweden, more than 40,000 homes were affected by power outages and numerous rail services were cancelled, Swedish news agency TT reported.Several flights, rail and ferry services across parts of the Nordic nations have been cancelled. Roads and rail services have also been disrupted due to the storm conditions.In Norway's Nordland region, one of the most northerly counties in the country, the fire department responded to more than 200 weather‑related incidents, broadcaster NRK reported.Storm Johannes cut power to around 23,000 homes in Nordland and a further 9,000 were without electricity in the Inland region, according to NRK.In Finland, the storm - known there as Hannes - subsided on Sunday morning but had left more than 60,000 homes without power, according to public broadcaster Yle.Flights at Kittila airport in northern Finland were grounded after heavy winds pushed a passenger jet and a smaller plane off the runway and into a bank of snow, the Helsinki Times reported.The Swiss Air jet, carrying about 150 passengers, had just landed from Geneva and was taxiing when it veered off, the paper said. The smaller jet, a 400XT model, was on the ground at the same time and was also pushed off course by the wind, it added.There have been no reported injuries.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterAn evening surge in shoppers keen on Boxing Day bargains drove a decade-high increase in footfall for the annual sales, figures suggest.It was up by 4.4% across all UK retail destinations including high streets and shopping centres compared to the same day last year, according to data from MRI Software.Footfall also remained strong on Saturday, and MRI anticipated the strong post-Christmas shopping momentum to continue into the new year.But higher footfall does not necessarily translate into higher spending, and Barclays has forecast that consumers would spend £1bn less on this year's Boxing Day deals.By 3pm on 26 December, it appeared there had been a muted reaction to the sales, according to early MRI data with high street visits down 1.5% compared to 2024 and shopping centre visits down 0.6%.MRI counts footfall in more than 660 retail locations across the UK and retail analyst Jenni Matthews said that as the day progressed, it became clear that shoppers were deciding to head out but just a bit later in the day.\"The boost in activity was driven by a peak in visits across all UK retail destinations from 5pm - 11pm averaging +9.6% versus an average increase of +3.1% from 6am-5pm,\" she said.With many stores not reopening until 28 December, Ms Matthews said it was likely that hospitality and leisure venues would have benefited from the increase in foot traffic.\"This is an early indicator that the retail sector may well end the year on a positive note given the challenging times faced at the beginning of the year,\" she said.Shoppers were also out in force on Saturday, according to the MRI data, with footfall across retail destinations up by 1.6% compared to 27 December last year.Ms Matthews said that with family gatherings ending and the new year looming, MRI anticipates footfall will continue to rise over the coming days.\"Consumers [will be] likely shopping the sales, making the most of the festive events and attractions within towns and cities, and stocking up on New Year's Eve essentials, keeping the festive retail period firmly in motion,\" she said.Analysts say 2025 has been a challenging year for people as rising prices and other factors have squeezed household finances.Barclays' consumer spend report suggested that fewer people planned to take advantage of the sales, forecasting shoppers to spending £3.6bn, down from £4.6bn last year.Recent retail spending data from the Office for National Statistics showed that many shoppers resisted the lure of November's Black Friday sales, with only a 0.1% lift in sales volumes.",

    "body": "The incoming Archbishop of Canterbury has been urged to scrap plans to spend £100m over the Church of England's historical links to slavery.  In a letter seen by the Sunday Times, a group of Conservative MPs and peers has urged Dame Sarah Mullally to stop the Church from spending the money. They claim the funds can only legally be spent on churches and the payment of clergy wages. In a statement, the Church Commissioners said that arrangements for the fund were being \"developed transparently - in line with charity law\". Mullally, who currently serves as the Bishop of London, will take up her new role as the first-ever female Archbishop of Canterbury next month. The Church of England's slavery links proposal was announced in January 2023 following the publication of a report into the Church's historical links to transatlantic slavery.The report, requested by the Church's financing arm - the Church Commissioners -  found that a fund established by Queen Anne in 1704 to help poor Anglican clergy was used to finance \"great evil\".According to the report, the fund, known as Queen Anne's Bounty, invested in African chattel enslavement and took donations derived from it.After the report's publication, the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the links and said action would be taken to address the Church's \"shameful past\".The Church Commissioners announced a new £100m fund, committed over a nine-year period, to be spent on \"a programme of investment, research and engagement\" in communities damaged by the enslavement of African people during the transatlantic slave trade. However, in their letter to Mullally, MPs and peers have urged the Church to focus on \"strengthening parishes\" rather than on pursuing what they describe as \"high-profile and legally dubious vanity projects\".The letter, whose co-authors include MPs Katie Lam, Chris Philp and Claire Coutinho, adds: \"By law, the endowment must be used to support parish ministry, maintain church buildings, and care for the Church's historic records.\"At a moment when churches across the country are struggling to keep their doors open — many even falling into disrepair — it's wrong to try and justify diverting £100 million to a project entirely separate from those core obligations.\"A spokesperson for the Church Commissioners said: \"The Church Commissioners, as a 320-year-old Christian in-perpetuity endowment fund, has committed £100 million to set up a new investment fund to support healing, justice and repair, in response to the discovery of its historic links with transatlantic African chattel enslavement.\"This is consistent with the Church of England's Fourth Mark of Mission: to 'seek to transform unjust structures of society, to challenge violence of every kind and pursue peace and reconciliation'. \"Governance arrangements are being developed transparently — in line with charity law, our fiduciary duties, and our moral purpose — to ensure proper oversight and accountability.\"Mullally will formally replace Welby in a ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral in January before being enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral in March.A former NHS chief nurse, the 63-year-old became a priest in 2006 and was appointed as the first female Bishop of London in 2018 - the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.The Church has been without someone in the top job for almost a year after Justin Welby resigned over a safeguarding scandal.",

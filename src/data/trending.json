    "body": "7 hours agoFiona NimoniGetty ImagesJojo Moyes revealed Sophie Kinsella's support to the Desert Island Discs showThe late author Sophie Kinsella convinced fellow writer Jojo Moyes to complete her bestselling romance novel Me Before You. Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Moyes has credited Kinsella with inspiring her to keep going, when she nearly gave up on the book after writing 20,000 words. It became an international bestseller and was adapted for the 2016 film starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Kinsella, whose real name was Madeleine Sophie Wickham, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022 and died earlier this month at the age of 55.  Author Sophie Kinsella remembered as a 'wonderful, warm woman'Speaking to Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Moyes described how she almost abandoned writing her bestselling novel because she was feeling depressed after years of little commercial success. She said: \"I met up with my friend Sophie Kinsella and had lunch with her and I was broke at the time and I was feeling quite depressed because I thought my writing career was coming to an end.\"I told her the story of my 20,000 words over lunch and she just looked at me, and she said, 'You have to write this book, you do know that? You have to write this book'.\"When I got home, her husband, Henry, called me up and said, 'Jojo, Maddy... told me about this book and I think you should write it too'.\"I love her for many reasons, but that's one of them.\"The Me Before You series follows the life of Louisa Clark, a working-class girl who ends up as a carer for paraplegic Will Traynor, a wealthy man who is paralysed after a motorcycle accident.The book was based on a news story Moyes had seen about a young rugby player who had been left quadriplegic after an accident and persuaded his parents to take him to a Swiss assisted dying clinic. \"I knew I loved this book and I knew it was the best version of itself that it could be, but I had no idea it was going to resonate in the way that it did,\" she told Laverne.

    "body": "The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued two amber health alerts for parts of the country as cold weather is set to ring in the new year.The alerts, which warn of a rise in deaths particularly among elderly and vulnerable people, cover the North East and North West of England from 20:00 GMT on Sunday to 12:00 on 5 January. Temperatures in these regions are expected to fall to around -4C, with snow predicted in the North West on 3 and 4 January. The low temperatures are likely to affect health and care services, the agency added.Overnight into Monday, temperatures are expected to fall to as low as -1C in Penrith, with northern areas of Scotland set for temperatures of -6C.Other impacts include temperatures inside hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks, and challenges for people keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C, the UKHSA said.Staffing issues, due to travel delays, may also arise from the cold spell. Most of England will be cloudy overnight, and there will be patches of frost and fog which could mean \"tricky travelling conditions\" on Monday morning, the forecaster said.Brisk northwesterly winds could bring wintry showers to the areas of northern England and drizzle in the lead up to New Year's Day. Between 2 and 11 January, cold northerly winds in Scotland are expected to become dominant across the UK, bringing snow showers mainly to coastal areas that will work south, the Met Office said. Inland locations across central and southern areas will remain mostly dry but cold.On Friday, temperatures in the the North East and North West will feel colder due to the wind chill - a temperature of -4C could feel more like -8C, the Met Office said. The agency also issued less serious yellow cold health alerts for the rest of England, covering the East Midlands, West Midlands, South East, South West, East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and London.Temperatures in areas covered by the yellow warning are expected to fall to around highs of 6C and lows below freezing from New Year's Day.Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said it was \"vital\" to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are vulnerableThe predicted temperatures can have a \"serious impact\" on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions, he warned. Cold health alerts and weather warnings were issued for parts of the UK on Christmas Day, forcing several annual open water swimming events to be cancelled. ",

    "body": "Dark energy just got even weirder and why the Universe may end in a 'Big Crunch'19 hours agoPallab GhoshKPNO/NOIRLabA lonely telescope in the Arizona desert tracks millions of distant galaxies to determine the ultimate fate of the UniverseThere is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space.An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by gravity, ending in what astronomers call a \"Big Crunch\".The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation.Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team's assertions.NASA/ESAThese are thousands of galaxies captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. dark energy is driving them apart at ever increasing speedWhat is dark energy?Astronomers previously thought the Universe's expansion, which began with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow due to gravity.Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down, distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other.Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms themselves apart in a \"Big Rip\".The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi).Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof Ofer Lahav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi project.\"Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of physics,\" he says.Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the weirdness of dark energy is weirder still.Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27 years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were.This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down.\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Prof Lee tells BBC News starkly.\"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"If, as Prof Lee's results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back together.\"Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a possibility.\"Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for which we still do not know the answer,\" says Prof Lee.Prof Lee's work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\"I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of supernovas,\" he says. \"The correlation with age is not very tight, so I think it is dangerous to apply a 'correction'. It looks weak to me.\"The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with almost unchanging dark energy.But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms.\"Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel that already our research is very, very significant.\"Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley LabA cathedral for the cosmos: an instrument inside this telescope can track the movement of 5,000 galaxies at a timeSince the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah. They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that dark energy was changing was so controversial.Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny.Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial ghosts.Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS's Deputy Director.\"Who doesn't want to understand how the universe is going to end and how it began?\" he says. \"Human beings have always been interested in that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific one.\"Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many billions of years, wouldn't that be extraordinary?\"",

    "body": "Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has received a medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, his medical team has said.Saturday's treatment \"went well\", according to one of his doctors. Another, Claudio Birolini, added that the procedure - which he stressed was not a surgery - lasted for \"about an hour\".The far-right former leader is currently serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the Latin American nation's 2022 presidential election to left-wing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.This latest procedure comes after the 70-year-old successfully underwent surgery for a double hernia earlier this week, after being granted permission to be transferred to hospital.Ahead of the surgery, Bolsonaro also endorsed his son Flávio to run against Lula in Brazil's 2026 presidential election. His statement - a handwritten letter - was read out by the younger Bolsonaro outside the hospital.Following the successful surgery, his medical team deemed it necessary to treat his recurrent hiccups, which he had been suffering from for months.\"It's been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups,\" Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, said on Saturday.She explained in a social media post that her husband's procedure had \"blocked\" one of his phrenic nerves.The phrenic nerves contract and expand the diaphragm, which allows the lungs to inhale and exhale. Hiccups are caused by the involuntary spasming of the diaphragm, typically as a result of an irritated phrenic nerve.His doctors later confirmed they had treated the right phrenic nerve and had scheduled to work on the left nerve on Monday.Once discharged from hospital, the former president will return to a cell in the federal police headquarters to continue serving his sentence. Bolsonaro was found guilty of the coup plot in September. He was placed under house arrest pending appeals, but was taken into police custody last month after being deemed a \"concrete flight risk\".Court officials said he had attempted to break his ankle monitor and planned to use a rally outside his house as cover for an escape attempt. Bolsonaro insisted he had no intention of fleeing.Also on Saturday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in his coup attempt. All of them had served in his government.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystThe number of executions in Iran in 2025 is estimated to have more than doubled compared to the number that took place across the country in 2024. Norwegian-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group told the BBC it had verified at least 1,500 executions up until the start of December, adding that many more have taken place since.Last year, IHR was able to verify 975 executions - although the exact number is never completely clear as Iranian authorities do not give official figures.However, the analysis shows another significant annual rise, and the figures chime with those provided by other monitoring groups.Iran's government has previously defended its use of the death penalty, saying it is limited to only \"the most severe crimes\".Execution figures were already on the rise before mass demonstrations broke out across the country in 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Kurdish woman was detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab \"improperly\".That protest movement represented the biggest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran's theocratic leadership for many years.In response, authorities intensified the rate of executions from around 520 in 2022 to 832 the following year - according to the figures verified by IHR.There have been some executions for protesters or alleged spies - but 99% of those executed have been for murder or drug offences - a ratio which has remained constant.Activists have said that the rate of executions in Iran increases when the regime feels under threat and that the aim is to forestall internal opposition by instilling fear in the population.It seems to be borne out by the fact that since the 12-day war with Israel in June, as well as major setbacks for Iran's proxy forces across the region, there's been another big surge.",

    "body": "The incoming Archbishop of Canterbury has been urged to scrap plans to spend £100m over the Church of England's historical links to slavery.  In a letter seen by the Sunday Times, a group of Conservative MPs and peers has urged Dame Sarah Mullally to stop the Church from spending the money. They claim the funds can only legally be spent on churches and the payment of clergy wages. In a statement, the Church Commissioners said that arrangements for the fund were being \"developed transparently - in line with charity law\". Mullally, who currently serves as the Bishop of London, will take up her new role as the first-ever female Archbishop of Canterbury next month. The Church of England's slavery links proposal was announced in January 2023 following the publication of a report into the Church's historical links to transatlantic slavery.The report, requested by the Church's financing arm - the Church Commissioners -  found that a fund established by Queen Anne in 1704 to help poor Anglican clergy was used to finance \"great evil\".According to the report, the fund, known as Queen Anne's Bounty, invested in African chattel enslavement and took donations derived from it.After the report's publication, the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the links and said action would be taken to address the Church's \"shameful past\".The Church Commissioners announced a new £100m fund, committed over a nine-year period, to be spent on \"a programme of investment, research and engagement\" in communities damaged by the enslavement of African people during the transatlantic slave trade. However, in their letter to Mullally, MPs and peers have urged the Church to focus on \"strengthening parishes\" rather than on pursuing what they describe as \"high-profile and legally dubious vanity projects\".The letter, whose co-authors include MPs Katie Lam, Chris Philp and Claire Coutinho, adds: \"By law, the endowment must be used to support parish ministry, maintain church buildings, and care for the Church's historic records.\"At a moment when churches across the country are struggling to keep their doors open — many even falling into disrepair — it's wrong to try and justify diverting £100 million to a project entirely separate from those core obligations.\"A spokesperson for the Church Commissioners said: \"The Church Commissioners, as a 320-year-old Christian in-perpetuity endowment fund, has committed £100 million to set up a new investment fund to support healing, justice and repair, in response to the discovery of its historic links with transatlantic African chattel enslavement.\"This is consistent with the Church of England's Fourth Mark of Mission: to 'seek to transform unjust structures of society, to challenge violence of every kind and pursue peace and reconciliation'. \"Governance arrangements are being developed transparently — in line with charity law, our fiduciary duties, and our moral purpose — to ensure proper oversight and accountability.\"Mullally will formally replace Welby in a ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral in January before being enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral in March.A former NHS chief nurse, the 63-year-old became a priest in 2006 and was appointed as the first female Bishop of London in 2018 - the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.The Church has been without someone in the top job for almost a year after Justin Welby resigned over a safeguarding scandal.",

    "body": "8 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterAn evening surge in shoppers keen on Boxing Day bargains drove a decade-high increase in footfall for the annual sales, figures suggest.It was up by 4.4% across all UK retail destinations including high streets and shopping centres compared to the same day last year, according to data from MRI Software.Footfall also remained strong on Saturday, and MRI anticipated the strong post-Christmas shopping momentum to continue into the new year.But higher footfall does not necessarily translate into higher spending, and Barclays has forecast that consumers would spend £1bn less on this year's Boxing Day deals.By 3pm on 26 December, it appeared there had been a muted reaction to the sales, according to early MRI data with high street visits down 1.5% compared to 2024 and shopping centre visits down 0.6%.MRI counts footfall in more than 660 retail locations across the UK and retail analyst Jenni Matthews said that as the day progressed, it became clear that shoppers were deciding to head out but just a bit later in the day.\"The boost in activity was driven by a peak in visits across all UK retail destinations from 5pm - 11pm averaging +9.6% versus an average increase of +3.1% from 6am-5pm,\" she said.With many stores not reopening until 28 December, Ms Matthews said it was likely that hospitality and leisure venues would have benefited from the increase in foot traffic.\"This is an early indicator that the retail sector may well end the year on a positive note given the challenging times faced at the beginning of the year,\" she said.Shoppers were also out in force on Saturday, according to the MRI data, with footfall across retail destinations up by 1.6% compared to 27 December last year.Ms Matthews said that with family gatherings ending and the new year looming, MRI anticipates footfall will continue to rise over the coming days.\"Consumers [will be] likely shopping the sales, making the most of the festive events and attractions within towns and cities, and stocking up on New Year's Eve essentials, keeping the festive retail period firmly in motion,\" she said.Analysts say 2025 has been a challenging year for people as rising prices and other factors have squeezed household finances.Barclays' consumer spend report suggested that fewer people planned to take advantage of the sales, forecasting shoppers to spending £3.6bn, down from £4.6bn last year.Recent retail spending data from the Office for National Statistics showed that many shoppers resisted the lure of November's Black Friday sales, with only a 0.1% lift in sales volumes.",

    "body": "Aryna Sabalenka lost in straight sets to Nick Kyrgios in a Battle of the Sexes-style match that lacked the intensity and entertainment promised in the build-up.Sabalenka, the women's world number one, was beaten 6-3 6-3 by 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Kyrgios, who is now ranked 671st after seeing the past few seasons decimated by career-threatening injury.Both players hyped up the Dubai contest like a pair of boxers flogging a fight.Sabalenka, 27, promised to \"kick Nick's ass\" as she promoted the event on US television chat shows, while 30-year-old Kyrgios insisted the razzmatazz of the occasion would bring new eyes to the sport.Ultimately, though, the match was played out as an off-season exhibition.Four-time Grand Slam champion Sabalenka showed flashes of the emotion she demonstrates in competitive matches, bearing a mischievous grin when she won points.\"I felt great. I think I put up a great fight. He was struggling, he got really tired,\" Sabalenka said afterwards.\"I think it was a great level, I made a lot of great shots, moved a lot to the net, drop shots. I really enjoyed the show. Next time when I play him, I already know the tactics, his strengths and weaknesses, and it will be a better match for sure.\"I love to challenge myself and I'd love to play again.\"Critics had questioned Kyrgios' suitability as the male protagonist in the match, given he admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2021 and has made a series of comments which have been considered misogynistic.The Australian, who was ranked 13th in the world at his peak, played with an air of insouciance throughout. His movement was limited as he worked to shorten points where possible. He will be delighted to have secured victory in little over an hour as he looks to build fitness for what he hopes will be a fuller return to the ATP Tour in 2026.The pair, whose friendship appears genuine and was demonstrated by their japes throughout the match, shared an affable embrace at the net.\"Honestly, it was a really tough match, she is a hell of a player and such a great champion,\" said Kyrgios.\"I didn't really know what to expect. Whatever role I was to play, it was just another great opportunity to go out here.\"",

    "body": "47 minutes agoHenry Zeffman,Chief Political CorrespondentandNick Eardley,Political CorrespondentBBCThe Conservatives have called for a British-Egyptian activist to be deported and his UK citizenship to be revoked after social media messages emerged of him calling for Zionists to be killed. Sir Keir Starmer has been criticised for saying he was \"delighted\" by Alaa Abdel Fattah's arrival in the UK after being freed from prison in Egypt, but it is understood he was unaware of the messages before this week.Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said Fattah should \"be made to live in Egypt or frankly anywhere else in the world\".He told the BBC it was wrong for Fattah to have been granted citizenship in the first place - something that took place in 2021 when the Conservatives were in power.The Foreign Office said it had been \"a long-standing priority under successive governments\" to work for Fattah's release and see him reunited with his family in the UK, but condemned his \"abhorrent\" posts.Fattah arrived in the UK this week after being convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" in Egypt for sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country. His family has been approached for comment. He was granted citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother.Jenrick said he did not consider it \"defensible\" that Fattah received citizenship when his social media showed that he had \"extremist views that are completely incompatible with British values\".Conservative governments, including ones in which Jenrick served, also repeatedly campaigned for Fattah's release and the shadow justice secretary said the case was a \"major failure of the British state\". Jenrick said:  \"Successive governments and civil servants at the Foreign Office and the Home Office have advised ministers that this is a consular case to be supported, when in fact a cursory examination of... social media shows that he is a man with not just extremist views - but absolutely abhorrent views who hates our country and should not be receiving the support and generosity of people here in the UK.\"He urged the government to \"rectify this situation by being clear that they distance themselves and our country wholeheartedly from his views and begin proceedings to revoke his citizenship and have him removed from the UK\".Speaking earlier on GB News, Jenrick criticised senior ministers for \"rejoicing at the fact this man was coming here, bragging that they'd achieved some kind of diplomatic coup\".The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the case was of  \"profound concern\".Adrian Cohen, the board's senior vice-president, said: \"His previous extremist and violent rhetoric aimed at 'Zionists' and white people in general is threatening to British Jews and the wider public.\"The cross-party campaign for such a person, and the warm welcome issued by the government, demonstrate a broken system with an astonishing lack of due diligence by the authorities.\"Fattah is also accused of saying the police do not have rights and \"we should kill them all\".PA MediaRobert Jenrick urged the government to start proceedings to revoke Alaa Abdel Fattah's British citizenshipFattah's release in September followed a long campaign by his family - backed by celebrities such as actresses Dame Judi Dench and Olivia Colman - and lobbying by the British government.He had spent more than a decade of his life behind bars, including being handed a five-year sentence in December 2021 following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith signed a cross-party letter in December last year urging the government to secure his release in Egypt.Writing on X on Sunday, Sir Iain said: \"I do, however regret signing the letter calling for the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, given his views, that have since come to light, are utterly abhorrent. \"Had I known of these I would not have signed the letter. I urge the police to investigate the nature of these extremist comments.\"A Labour source accused Jenrick of trying to rewrite history for his own political advantage.A writer, intellectual and software developer, Fattah rose to prominence during an uprising in 2011 that forced the former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to resign.In 2014, Fattah was nominated for a European human rights award, the Sakharov Prize, but this was withdrawn over tweets about Israel he posted in 2012.He said his comments had been part of a \"private conversation\" that took place during an Israeli offensive in Gaza and had been taken out of context.After being removed from a travel ban list imposed by Egyptian authorities that kept him in the country for three months after his release from jail, Fattah has now reunited with his 14-year-old son, who lives in Brighton.Speaking to the BBC from Cairo in October after his release, he said:  \"I'm learning how to get back into life.\"He added: \"I'm doing much better than I would have expected. Much better than most people would have expected.\"",

    "body": "19 hours agoCharlie JonesDanny KaanJoe Tracini has always struggled with his mental health but feels like he can finally look to the future after starting ADHD medicationActor Joe Tracini has always felt uncomfortable in his own skin. Growing up in Great Yarmouth, as the son of comedian Joe Pasquale, he was self-conscious and prone to depressive thoughts.\"I told my first joke on stage at 18 months at one of my dad's gigs,\" he recalls. \"But a lot of my confidence growing up was a front.\"The only way he could engage with his peers was through his skill for magic tricks. He was relentlessly bullied at school.\"I was like a little old man. I used to speak like a grown-up. I wore three-piece suits and couldn't converse with other children,\" the 37-year-old says.GettyJoe Tracini was born as Joe Pasquale, the same name as his father, but he changed it aged 12At the age of 11, he changed his surname from Pasquale to Tracini, after narrowly missing out on the role of Harry Potter to Daniel Radcliffe.\"I did six auditions for it. It was a big rejection but I don't think I would have survived making those films. The casting director sent me a letter which I've still got.\"I changed my name because I wanted to do things off my own back, I didn't want to have something to live up to. I love my dad very much and we have a good relationship but I wanted people to like me for me,\" he says.Tracini went to musical theatre college and secured various acting and TV presenting roles, including as a series regular on the soap Hollyoaks.But he turned to drink, drugs and self-harm as a way to quieten the negative voice in his head, that he calls \"Mick\".Tracini was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) a decade ago, which came as a huge relief.The diagnosis prompted him to kick his addictions. He has been sober for 10 years, after several trips to rehab.\"I felt less guilty because I knew the drink and drugs were a symptom of my BPD. I thought Mick would go away but the medication made me feel numb and changed my personality so I came off it,\" he says.During the pandemic, he gained tens of thousands of social media followers by posting comedy dance routines, dressed in a leotard.He also went viral for a video about his BPD, describing symptoms including mood swings, impulsiveness, paranoia, fear of abandonment and chronic feelings of emptiness.Tracini has filmed several videos representing his BPD as two different people - himself and the negative voice inside his head, whom he calls Mick.But around the same time, he stopped going to auditions and working because his mental health was so bad.\"I lost so many months where I felt paralysed by fear. I started writing a one-man show called 10 Things I Hate About Me, all about my life.\"But during that period I was so low and I was having so many panic attacks, I thought I'd never be able to perform it,\" he says.The turning point came last summer, when he decided to explore the possibility that he might have ADHD.Tracini looked through his list of followers on social media and found an ADHD psychiatrist who was able to diagnose him and prescribe medication.\"The drugs don't help with my BPD but I feel like I get to start again. It has cleared my brain and I can function again. I can work again and I can write. \"This time last year I thought 'this might be it. This might be who I am for the rest of my life'. \"I had no idea how life changing the diagnosis would be - people don't take ADHD seriously enough - finding out has saved my life.\"Joe has performed his one-man show in Edinburgh and is taking it on tour after rave reviewsIn the summer, Tracini performed his one-man show to rave reviews at the Edinburgh Fringe. He is now taking it on his first ever tour, starting at the Norwich Theatre Playhouse, just up the road to where he grew up.Tracini spent so many years obsessing over the show that he felt he owed it to himself to perform it.\"Even if it had gone badly, I was doing myself a kindness to put it to rest and gain some closure,\" he says.\"It covers so many years of my life and so much stuff that I held on to that destroyed me. It's my past but it doesn't have to be a part of me any more.\"Mick will always be there, he believes, but he has learned to live with the voice inside his head. \"It has been like getting used to a flatmate. I hope he buggers off one day but we're doing OK.\"I was always living in the past and worrying about things I've done but now I'm looking to the future. I'm looking at weeks and months ahead, which is something Mick can't argue with.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

    "body": "The annual food fight festival ''Els Enfarinats'' has left the Spanish town of Ibi covered in flour and egg shells. Every year participants wear military-style costumes and stage a fake coup using eggs, flour and firecrackers.The eggers go around asking for \"taxes\" - donations to charity - from local people and if you don't pay you could end up getting splatted.The festival, held in the province of Alicante, is more than 200 years old and takes place on the 28 December each year to coincide with the Day of the Innocents - Spain's equivalent of April Fools' Day.Video edited by Zahra Fatima and Jack Burgess",

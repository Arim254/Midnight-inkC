    "body": "Man charged with terrorism over attack targeting Aboriginal Australians at protest2 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyCason Ho/ABC NewsA 31-year-old man has been charged with a terrorist offence after throwing a homemade bomb at an Aboriginal protest in Perth.A man has been charged with terrorism after he allegedly threw an explosive device at a crowd protesting the celebration of Australia Day in Perth last month.The 31-year-old man was detained after hurling a homemade bomb into a throng of around 2,500 people who had gathered in support of the Aboriginal community. The device, which was filled with ball bearings and screws, failed to explode, but authorities said it could have turned into a \"mass casualty event\".Australia Day - a national holiday on 26 January - marks the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet in Sydney Cove and the start of colonisation. For many Indigenous Australians and their supporters, it is known as Invasion Day.Police had already charged the man - whose identity has been suppressed by the courts for his safety - with committing an unlawful act with intent to harm and one count of making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances.West Australian Premier Roger Cook on Thursday told reporters it is alleged \"the attack on Aboriginal people and other peaceful protesters was motivated by hateful, racist ideology\".\"Thankfully [the device] did not detonate but for that we could have seen a mass casualty event with injuries and potential loss of life,\" Cook said.The fresh charge - which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment - is the first time terrorism charges have been laid in the state, police say.\"I know this event has impacted people Australia-wide and it is deeply felt by our Indigenous communities,\" Cook said. \"I know that there is anger. We have every right to be angry.\"West Australian Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the bomb had a fuse which had been lit, adding: \"It should have gone off.\"He said police had no prior intelligence of the attack, and that the man was \"self-radicalised\" and acted alone. During their investigation, detectives had found evidence the man had accessed \"pro-white male, pro-white material online\", he allegedAustralian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters federal police and Asio, Australia's domestic intelligence agency, had been called into the investigation 36 minutes after the device was thrown and worked around the clock to establish whether there was any ongoing threat. The man, who is remanded in custody, is next due to appear in Perth Magistrates Court on 17 February. ",

    "body": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.There is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.Dealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.The jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.The 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.They are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.Stanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.For Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\"The fear comes in training;  when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"Zoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.It gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.Zoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"She heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"Atkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.GB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.The 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.She knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.In December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.Muir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.Muir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.The key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"In the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?Atkin thinks of nothing at all.\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"GB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.According to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"In the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.Atkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"Muir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoKelly NgReutersTrump and Xi last met in October, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in South KoreaChina's leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in China-US relations during a phone call with US President Donald Trump  on Wednesday. Xi had told Trump to be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the island, state media reported, adding that he \"attaches great importance\" to ties with Washington and hoped both sides will find ways to resolve their differences.Trump cast the call as \"excellent\" and \"long and thorough\".Wednesday's call follows a flurry of visits by Western leaders, including UK's Keir Starmer, to China in recent months, hoping to reset relations with the world's second-largest economy.Trump himself is due to visit China in April, a trip he says he \"very much looks forward to\". He added that Beijing is considering buying 20 million tonnes of US soybeans, up from the current 12 million tonnes.\"The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post. The two leaders last spoke over the phone in November about a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to Trump and China's foreign ministry.Apart from Taiwan and soybeans, Trump and Xi also discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, the current situation in Iran, and China's purchase of oil and gas from the US in the call on Wednesday, the US president wrote.On Taiwan, Xi said the self-governed island was \"China's territory\" and that Beijing \"must safeguard [Taiwan's] sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\"The United States must handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence,\" he warned, according to the state's Xinhua news agency.China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to do so.The US has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan, and has walked a tight diplomatic rope for decades. But it remains a powerful ally of Taiwan's and is the island's biggest arms supplier.In December, the Trump administration announced a huge arms sale worth around $11bn (£8.2bn) to Taiwan, which included advanced rocket launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles.Beijing said at the time that this \"attempt to support [Taiwan's] independence\" would only \"accelerate the push towards a dangerous and violent situation across the Taiwan Strait\".\"Just as the United States has its concerns, China for its part also has concerns,\" Xi told Trump on Wednesday.\"If the two sides work in the same direction in the spirit of equality, respect and mutual benefit, we can surely find ways to address each other's concerns,\" he said.Hours before his call with Trump, Xi held a virtual meeting with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin, in which both hailed the strengthening of ties between Beijing and Moscow.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJack Fenwick,Political correspondentandLauren Tavriger,Political reporterUS Department of JusticeLord Mandelson offered to help Jeffrey Epstein obtain a Russian visa, which the paedophile financier planned to use to meet young women in Moscow, documents released by the US government suggest.There is no indication that the politician knew why Epstein wanted the visa, and further emails suggest the trip was cancelled because it couldn't be obtained.Epstein was awaiting charges of trafficking minors from around the world for sex when he died in his prison cell in 2019.Lord Mandelson, a senior minister in the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments, resigned from the House of Lords this week after newly released files on Epstein revealed the extent of their relationship.It is not known what the primary reason was for Epstein's planned trip to Moscow in 2010, but emails suggested he was going to meet women while there.On 9 November 2010, Epstein emailed Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate and modelling agent, to let him know he was thinking of travelling to Moscow the following week.Brunel, who killed himself in 2022 while being investigated for the trafficking of minors for sexual exploitation, appeared to reply and said: \"I am getting my visa\".Emails from the same day show that Epstein asked Mandelson, who had left government six months before, if he could help in acquiring a Russian visa.Epstein, who was in France, emailed Mandelson and said: \"I do not have a visa for Russia, it is a bank holiday in paris today... any ideas how i can get one.\"The documents released by the US Department of Justice suggest that Lord Mandelson replied hours later indicating that he was willing to help.At this point, Epstein had already served a prison sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor.BBC News has seen no evidence to suggest that Mandelson asked why Epstein needed a visa to visit Russia at short notice.The following day, Mandelson emailed Epstein again and said that an associate of his was \"helping on visas\".The days that Epstein wanted to travel to Moscow match up with email exchanges regarding obtaining a visa.On the same day that Epstein asked Mandelson for help, the financier sent an email to a woman in Russia asking if they had any \"news?\".She replied later that day and said: \"I really want to have someone very nice soon for you, working on it!\"She added: \"I have around 10 friends I'm working on now\".She also discussed a woman who they said would be \"back in Moscow in a few days\".Three days later Epstein said to the woman he would be \"back next week// any luck\".She replied and referred to what appears to be a 22-year-old woman who Epstein had previously indicated he had no interest in.She said: \"I know you didn't like photo of [redacted] 22, however if you change your mind let me know, she is a very very nice and sweet girl, just from Moscow. I'm 90 percent sure she will be interested.\"She went on to describe another \"gorgeous\" woman who was \"really interested\". They said they had \"told her everything and she is completely fine\".Later that day she was sending a picture of another woman who \"wants to be an actress, study design, was a gymnast\".She added that she had \"interviewed\" this woman, who she said was \"really nice and interesting\" and said they were \"getting friendly with her and will have a talk soon!\".She also referenced a planned brunch with another person, who it appears Epstein had already received a photograph of.The email said: \"she is bringing her girlfriend along, hopefully a good looking one! Will make photos.\"She asked Epstein to \"let us know what day you arrive so I'll come with [redacted].\"The email ended: \"I am very excited about your guests, going to the gym now to be prepared!!!\".Epstein replied to say there was \"no picture attached\" and received a response: \"sorry...here's the picture! not the best one, so I also found some others on her facebook page.\"Multiple emails suggest that Epstein planned to fly from Paris to Moscow in the days following this exchange.Emails also indicate that Mandelson visited Epstein in Paris on the day this exchange was sent.On 11 November, Epstein emailed his close friend Jes Staley to say that \"petie [Mandelson], and others in paris this weekend\".On 12 November, Mandelson received an email with the subject \"Paris\" which read: \"Hi peter, Valdson, Jeffrey's driver, will be picking you up today from the train station... see you this evening!\"There is no suggestion that Mandelson knew the reason Epstein wanted to visit Russia.The documents also show that the Moscow trip was ultimately cancelled because of delays in obtaining the necessary visas.On 15 November, an associate of Mandelson's, who had been advising Epstein's assistant on Russian visas, emailed to ask if they had obtained them yet.Epstein's assistant replied and said the Moscow trip was no longer going ahead because it was \"going to take too long to get visas in paris\".They added: \"Thank you very much for all your help in this matter and sorry that it didn't work out in the end!\"Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment. He has previously said he was not complicit or culpable in Epstein's crimes and has apologised to the women and girls who suffered.Jean-Luc Brunel always denied any wrongdoing.Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication wrongdoing.",

    "body": "Robbie Williams: British people are good at devaluing ourselves8 hours agoCharlotte GallagherGetty ImagesAfter more than three decades in entertainment, Robbie Williams is back on the road and ready to celebrate.The singer, whose Long 90s tour begins this week, is taking a moment to mark his achievement. \"I think as British people we're very good at piercing the balloon of our own success and undercutting it and devaluing ourselves,\" he tells BBC News. \"It's what we do best. In many ways it's why we're great.\"But with this one, I really want to let it sink in and I really want to stand in the middle of it and go, 'OK, success, do your thing to me'.\"The tour will take in smaller venues, the kind he would have played at the start of his solo stardom. The 51-year-old says Britpop is the album he wanted to make when he first left Take That. It sees him collaborate with former bandmate Gary Barlow, Gaz Coombes from Supergrass and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.But he looks back at the Britpop era with mixed feelings - he experienced professional huge success, but was also deeply depressed. Getty ImagesRobbie pictured with Liam Gallagher at Glastonbury in 1995, at the height of BritpopHe recalls: \"I was going through my own mental illness and anything good that's happening to somebody that is in the throes of depression... they can't experience joy and there were lots of incredible things happening and I couldn't experience joy from any of it.\"But now I look back at it and think, what a decade. The last great decade for popular culture because everything since then has become quite vanilla.\"You don't know 2007 from 2023, but you know the '50s, you know the '60s, you know the '70s you know the '80s and you know the '90s and so I look back and with a wry smile and say that the '90s was an amazing time to have a bad time.\"Robbie has spoken openly about suffering from stage fright in the past, experiencing terror before walking on stage. He tells me that everything \"clicked into place\" for him when his first child, daughter Theodora, known as Teddy, who was born in 2012. \"The world started to make sense because I'd been running away from responsibility and I should have been running towards it. \"And when things stopped being about me and started to become about precious souls, I started to realise I've got the best job in the world.\"Getty ImagesRobbie with Ayda and eldest daughter Teddy, who was born in 2012Williams says he also feels much happier being back in the UK, after a torrid experience with the British press, particularly in the early stages of his solo career. \"I think that everybody knows, because we've seen it countless times, that if you are on the crest of a wave, the media comes to bring you down and attack you and malign you at every opportunity they can. And that is heavy and brings its own problems.\"But that was then, I'm in a different place now,\" he continues. \"I'm left alone just to put my songs out and be married. \"There isn't anybody at my door trying to get pictures of me 24 hours a day or trying to pop microphones and bug my house or trying to hack my phone. There isn't any of that stuff that's happening anymore. This is what I thought it would be like when I set out on my journey when I was 16, I'm having an amazing time.\"Williams, pictured with the BBC's Charlotte Gallagher, says he's glad social media was not around earlier in his careerOne thing the singer did not have deal with back then was social media, and he tells me he thinks it would have \"seen him off\". \"I get way too invested in finding the negative things, everybody does,\" he says. \"I wonder if there's something wired in us where we go, ‘let's find the problem, let's find a threat and then we'll negate the threat’.\"Then, of course, there is the eternal question, will Robbie ever rejoin Take That? The band that launched his career.Williams has spoken of them \"riding again\" and says he \"absolutely loved\" the documentary, adding that he had \"overwhelming feeling of how much I love the boys\".Getty ImagesTake That were recently the subject of a Netflix documentary, which examined their successOn February 13 it will be 30 years since Take That split (the first time), it's also Robbie's birthday. So what was he doing that day in 1996? \"Buying a Scalextric from Harrods,\" he laughs. Not the rock'n'roll answer I expected.After breaking a record held by The Beatles and winning more Brit Awards than anyone else, I ask Robbie what he wants to do next.\"I want to build hotels with my own venues in and then I want to play my own hotels,\" he replies.\"I want to do a university of entertainment and I've got the syllabus in my mind and it would be a great revenge on education for somebody that left school with nothing higher than a D to go in and revolutionise education.\" Sign us up for the university of Robbie Williams.Britpop by Robbie Williams is out now. The Long 90s tour began earlier this week. ",

    "body": "15 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesRyan Routh was taken into custody shortly after being fired upon by a Secret Service agent during the incident in West Palm Beach, Florida. Ryan Routh has been sentenced to life in prison for attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump on a Florida golf course in September of 2024. Routh, 59, was found guilty last year of trying to kill Trump, then still a presidential candidate, at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. A US Secret Service agent in the area spotted a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes and fired at Routh, who then fled the scene. He was arrested nearby. In a sentencing memorandum, Judge Aileen Cannon said Routh's crimes \"undeniably warrant a life sentence\".\"[H]e took steps over the course of months to assassinate a major Presidential candidate, demonstrated the will to kill anybody in the way, and has since expressed neither regret nor remorse to his victims,\" she wrote. Routh's lawyer, Martin Ross, said they would be appealing the case. Routh pleaded not guilty and elected to represent himself during the trial, which began on 8 September. A native of North Carolina who lived in Hawaii prior to his arrest, Routh repeatedly acted erratically during the court proceedings, including challenging Trump to a game of golf and making references to Adolf Hitler and Russian President Vladimir Putin. After a jury found him guilty, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before US marshals quickly escorted him out of the courtroom. While Routh is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point during the incident, federal agents told jurors they later recovered a semiautomatic rifle with a scope and an extended magazine in the spot where he had been hiding. Additionally, jurors were told that Routh left behind a list of places where Trump was likely to appear, as well as a note for a friend which described the incident as \"an assassination attempt\". In his closing statement during the trial, Routh spoke in the third person and touched on a wide variety of unrelated topics, including US history, the Russia-Ukraine war and his intention to buy a boat - prompting the judge to repeatedly interrupt him and send the jury away. The lead prosecutor in the case, John Shipley, said that a \"mountain of evidence\" was presented which points to \"how close he got to actually pulling this off\". The incident in Florida was the second attempt on Trump's life in 2024, after a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. That shooting left one person dead and several wounded, including Trump. The shooter, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was killed by officers at the scene. ",

    "body": "11 hours agoBrian Wheeler,Political reporterandRianna Croxford,Investigations correspondentUnited States District Court Southern District of New YorkPeter Mandelson's friendship with Jeffery Epstein was known before he became US ambassadorPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said Peter Mandelson misled him about the extent of his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein before he was appointed US ambassador.Emails released by the US Department of Justice illustrate the depth of that friendship and appear to confirm that it continued, and even flourished, after Epstein's 2008 conviction.In April 2009, while Epstein was still serving a prison sentence, he messages Lord Mandelson to say: \"ahh... here we go again\".A few minutes later, Lord Mandelson picks up his Blackberry and replies: \"Meaning? At least I am not involved.\"Epstein replies: \"Your romantic complexities\".On the day Epstein is released from jail, in July 2009, the two friends appear to have been in a jubilant mood.\"Free and home,\" Epstein emails the then Labour peer at 08.37am on 22 July.\"How shall we celebrate?\" writes back Lord Mandelson, who at the time was business secretary under Gordon Brown.\"With grace and modesty (those are the names of two strippers),\" Epstein replies.\"From now on, grace and modesty sd [should] be discovered in London,\" Lord Mandelson appears to joke back a few hours later, before adding: \"How is freedom feeling?\"\"She feels fresh, firm and creamy,\" Epstein says.Lord Mandelson responds with two words: \"Naughty boy.\"The tone of the messages from this time is often jokey and indiscreet, occasionally veering into excruciatingly frank.They also suggest that the pair were in frequent phone contact in addition to emails, with one or the other saying \"call me\".The veteran Labour politician appears to have valued his wealthy friend's advice and support, on his political career as well as his private life.When Lord Mandelson tells Epstein he is out of government in May 2010, and is at Labour Party headquarters for a \"farewell\" event for Gordon Brown, the disgraced financier offers a \"big hug\".Lord Mandelson jokingly replies \"you won't leave me will you?\"In November 2009, the pair are discussing pressure on Gordon Brown to resign as prime minister.\"What does tony [sic] say?\" Epstein emails, in what appears to be a reference to Sir Tony Blair, the previous prime minister.\"Talking to him tonight but he has said I sd [should] facilitate not initiate,\" Lord Mandelson writes back.Epstein responds, \"tell gb [Gordon Brown] you see the winds blowing and you are loyal, first second and third […] I don't suggest you tell him to step down…tell him you are his friend and am frustrated as much as he\".\"He will immed[iately] push panic button,\" replies Lord Mandelson.\"He would be stressed not knowing what you really think,\" Epstein responds, before emailing a bawdy joke about Lord Mandelson's judgement.\"Are you sure the backpressure from you[sic] lack of sex is not turning your brain into fois gras,\" Epstein writes.\"It's certainly a serious problem,\" Lord Mandelson seems to joke back. \"Cure coming to London from S'hai [Shanghai] next weekend.\"After his departure from government in May 2010, Lord Mandelson seeks Epstein's opinion on a draft of his memoir, The Third Man, which chronicles his role in New Labour's rise to power and his relationships with Brown and Blair.Epstein seems to be concerned about the impact the book could have on Lord Mandelson's future business plans, which are the subject of several other exchanges.\"I have finished my first read […] The deals you want to be involved in require discretion, trust, handshakes, privacy. This book announces that you are willing to sell all of these for a farthing,\" Epstein wrote as part of an email exchange dated 16 May 2010.\"Your friend, and boss, tony [sic], is more often described as frail, flustered, tired, weak, and Gordon, flawed, demanding, pig-headed, irrationally determined.\"Epstein adds: \"It is not uplifting, it is gossipy and defensive,\" saying he found the draft book \"troubling\" and recommending that Lord Mandelson look at his manuscript again.Lord Mandelson seems put out by his friend's assessment, saying: \"You have read it too fast. It is not those things. But nor is it yet finished.\"By 2012, the friendship between the two men appears to have soured somewhat.In one exchange, Epstein expresses his \"disappointment\" that their relationship has been a \"one way street\".\"… jeffrey can I have, jeffrey can you give jeffrey can you organize… can you call, can you arrange .. you have yet to offer real assistance, sign of gratitude or appreciation. …sorry.\"Lord Mandelson is apparently stung by Epstein's criticism and tells him in a reply \"how much I appreciate your support,\" adding \"during your trials and tribulations I never left your side, I was always there with advice and moral support, and I never turned away\".Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBBCMany of the papers focus on the political fallout from revelations about former Labour minister Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. \"Shaken PM abandons plans to withhold some documents detailing disgraced peer's appointment\" as UK ambassador to Washington, writes the Independent. A group of Labour MPs, including former deputy leader Angela Rayner, \"forced\" Sir Keir Starmer into a \"climbdown over the full release of vetting documents relating to Peter Mandelson's appointment\". Months after he stepped down from the post, UK police opened an investigation into whether Lord Mandelson passed on sensitive information to Epstein. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Metro reports the prime minister \"is facing a growing crisis over his leadership after admitting he knew of concerns at Lord Mandelson's long friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein – but still gave him a crucial government job.\" Headlining with \"liar, liar, pants on... hired!\", the paper refers to a photo appearing to show Lord Mandelson in his underwear, as revealed in a recent release of the Epstein files. Lord Mandelson has previously expressed regret for \"ever having known Epstein\". \"Rayner turns on Starmer\" is the Daily Telegraph's take on the pressure for the prime minister to reveal documents about Lord Mandelson's appointment. It writes \"Rayner and senior Labour MPs insisted No10 should not decide what material is published\" relating to the ex-ambassador's vetting.\"Starmer in grave peril\" writes the Daily Mail, which also focuses on the role of Angela Rayner in spearheading a \"revolt against his handling of the Peter Mandelson scandal\". The Guardian quotes Labour MPs who say \"it's over\" for Starmer's leadership. An unnamed MP who won their seat in 2024 tells the paper: \"The most terminal mood is among the super loyal.\"\"Sir Keir Starmer and his chief of staff (Morgan McSweeney) are fighting for their political futures\", according to the Times's top story. It follows Starmer telling the Commons that he and McSweeney were aware that Lord Mandelson stayed at Epstein's Manhattan apartment while he the American was \"in jail for child prostitution offences\".The i Paper also leads with \"Labour MPs losing confidence in the Prime Minister\" adding that \"allies acknowledge he's facing a sharp mood shift\". \"Revolting\" is the Sun's key takeaway as \"Epstein files outrage mounts\". The paper writes that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's staff at his new property on the Sandringham Estate \"refuse to serve him\", while the prime minister was also \"rocked by a Labour rebellion\". \"Ghislaine Maxwell email appears to say this photo of Andy Windsor with accuser Virginia Giuffre is real, and not faked,\" the Daily Star reports, next to a photo of Mountbatten-Windsor, Maxwell, and Guiffre. The former prince told the BBC in a 2019 interview the photo was doctored, saying he had been at a pizza express at the time. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied wrongdoing.Meanwhile, the Financial Times reports European spy officials \"believe two Russian space vehicles have intercepted communications with at least a dozen key satellites over the continent\". The paper writes the move \"risks compromising sensitive information\" as tensions deepen \"between the Kremlin and the west following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine\". \"Cancer patients will get personalised plans to help them cope with the psychological toll of their diagnosis\", the Daily Express reports, citing its own campaign for \"better mental health support for sufferers\".\"Snooker great John Virgo's widow paid tribute to her husband\", writes the Daily Mirror, reporting the \"legend\" of the cue sport died suddenly at 79. \"It's over for Starmer\", is the message from Labour MPs in the Guardian, after what the paper calls a \"day of fury\" over the appointment of Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the United States. \"Starmer fights for future over Mandelson scandal\", is the headline in the Times. One minister is quoted as saying the situation for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is \"terminal\".\"Starmer in grave peril as Rayner twists the knife,\" declares the Daily Mail. In what's described as a \"dramatic move\", the former deputy prime minister forced Sir Keir into a climbdown over the release of documents about Lord Mandelson's appointment. The Daily Telegraph says it's a \"severe blow\" to the prime minister's authority that the process will now be handled by parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.The editorial in the Daily Express says Sir Keir's career as prime minister is \"dangling by a thread\" - while the Sun says the \"toxic\" fallout from the Lord Mandelson scandal has left the PM \"seriously, if not fatally, wounded\". The i Paper claims even loyalists \"are starting to question how long he can last\" - but the paper points out he \"lives on\" as there is not an \"obvious challenger waiting in the wings to take over\".The Sun reports that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is facing a revolt from staff on the Sandringham estate where he is now living. The paper says staff have been told they can reject serving the former prince if it makes them feel uncomfortable. A source tells the Sun there's already a \"long list\" of those who have taken up the offer. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson has declined to comment.The Daily Mirror mourns the former snooker player and broadcaster, John Virgo, after his death at the age of 79. A tribute from his widow, \"I can't imagine a life without John\", is the paper's headline. The Daily Express says his life \"was as colourful as his trademark waistcoats\". According to the Daily Telegraph, he had a \"truly eclectic set\" of fans including George Best and Margaret Thatcher - despite being a self described \"dour northern socialist\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "8 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentEPAInterest rates are expected to remain on hold as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets for the first time this year.The Bank rate is the primary tool for the committee to try to keep inflation - which charts the annual rate of rising prices - as close to 2% as possible.It heavily influences the interest charged by lenders for loans and mortgages, and what banks and building societies give in returns to savers.The majority of analysts are predicting the MPC keeps the Bank rate on hold at 3.75% when it announces its latest decision at 12:00 GMT on Thursday.Inflation remains above target at 3.4%, according to the latest data for the year to December.The nine-member committee only narrowly voted for a cut in December and gave a fairly cautious view of the situation.Analysts say there has been little data so far this year to change the balance between persistent inflation and weak economic growth.There is also an expectation that the Bank will be vague about when or by how much it will cut the Bank rate during the year as it awaits a clearer picture on inflation.Some analysts are suggesting one rate cut during 2026, while others believe the MPC could decide on two cuts.How rates affect your financesAround a third of households have a mortgage. Of those, about one million have tracker or variable mortgages that tend to change when the Bank rate changes.The vast majority of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments are not immediately affected by a rate change, future deals can be.Fixed mortgage rates, for those renewing or signing up to a new deal, fell at the start of the year as lenders competed for customers.However, broader pressures faced by lenders have shown signs of going up, with commentators saying that could stall any further cuts.The Bank rate cut in December and conditions thereafter have led to cuts in the interest paid by savings account providers to their customers.Rachel Springall, from financial information service Moneyfacts, said: \"The slaughter of savings rates will sadden hard-pressed savers. Since the start of this year, more than two-thirds (70%) of savings providers have cut their rates. \"As inflation remains well above target, real returns on cash savings are weak and this can lead to a dangerous attitude of apathy.\"The MPC has eight meetings a year and, after the latest meeting, it will also publish its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, which sets out its economic analysis and projections on which it bases its decision.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentBBCA BBC investigation found asylum seekers in hotels were taking taxi journeys costing hundreds of poundsA ban on asylum seekers using taxis to attend medical appointments has come into force.The government changed the policy after a BBC investigation which showed people travelling long distances at high cost.In one case, an asylum seeker said he went on a 250-mile cab journey to a GP, costing the Home Office £600.The ban will not stop the use of taxis completely and there will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy-related needs.These cases will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules.Taxis can also still be used for other reasons - such as travelling between accommodation. The Home Office is continuing to review that situation.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"I have ended the wasteful use of taxis for medical appointments to protect the taxpayer's purse.\"I will stop at nothing to remove the incentives that draw illegal migrants to Britain, to restore order and control to our borders.\"It was revealed in November that an average of £15.8m had been spent a year on taxis for asylum seekers.Earlier this year, BBC Radio 4's File on Four found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used.One driver told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south-east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said.Another taxi driver, who gave the name Steve, claimed firms would purposely increase the mileage on trips by dispatching drivers to another distant town to carry out short journeys.He said that on one occasion he was sent from Gatwick Airport to Reading - a round trip of about 110 miles (175km) and costing more than £100 - to take an asylum seeker from their hotel to a dentist appointment which was 1.5 miles away.Steve said that while working for a subcontractor he was sent from Gatwick to Southampton \"more than once\", and that he drove an average of 275 miles a day - half of which was without a passenger in his car.He claimed that some journeys were completely wasted.\"I'd be sitting there and [would be told] 'oh look don't worry, [the asylum seekers] don't wanna go' and they basically refused to move. It just logistically wasn't thought out very well and I think it was left open to abuse,\" he said.",

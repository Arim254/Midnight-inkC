    "body": "2 hours agoBethany BellandRachel HaganAn ex-nurse convicted of murdering 10 patients in western Germany may be linked to more than 100 additional deaths, an official has said.The chief public prosecutor in Aachen, Katja Schlenkermann-Pitts, told the BBC  that there was \"a correspondingly high number of suspicious cases\" under review.She cautioned that the cases represented preliminary suspicions and that some could be dismissed following forensic examination.In November last year, a regional court in Aachen convicted the former palliative care nurse, who has not been publicly named, of 10 counts of murder and 27 counts of attempted murder, sentencing him to life imprisonment.The court found that during night shifts at a hospital in Würselen, the man had administered excessive doses of sedatives and painkillers to seriously ill patients without medical justification.Prosecutors said the drugs were sometimes given repeatedly and that the defendant was aware of the potentially fatal consequences. Judges concluded that the actions were driven by personal unease and a desire to impose order during night shifts.The defendant denied the charges during the trial in Aachen, stating that he had intended to help patients sleep and had not believed the medication posed a lethal risk given their underlying illnesses. But prosecutors told the court that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\".The offences examined in the initial trial occurred between December 2023 and May 2024 at the Rhein-Maas hospital in Würselen, where the nurse had worked since 2020.The newly identified suspected cases relate largely to earlier periods.As part of the expanded inquiry, investigators have ordered around 60 exhumations. Twenty seven have already been carried out, with roughly 30 more pending.Schlenkermann-Pitts said autopsy results were still outstanding in many cases and would determine whether further charges could be brought.\"Of course, they may still be dropped,\" she cautioned.Prosecutors in Cologne are also examining deaths linked to hospitals where the nurse worked before his transfer to Würselen, 65km (40 miles) away.Two exhumations have taken place so far, including the remains of a 94 year old woman who died in 2018, and a 78 year old patient who died in 2015. Further exhumations have been ordered.Prosecutors in both Aachen and Cologne said preparations for potential new charges were under way, but officials said that any further proceedings were unlikely to begin before 2027.The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany.Högel is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.",

    "body": "6 hours agoIsaac AsheEast MidlandsGetty ImagesThe Serious Fraud Office said the charges were a \"critical step\" in its investigationsTwo people have been charged following the collapse of a pre-paid funeral firm that left tens of thousands of people out of pocket.About 46,000 customers lost thousands of pounds when Safe Hands Plans Ltd collapsed in 2022 and went into administration.The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has charged two men - Richard Wells and Neil Debenham - with conspiracy to defraud. It said Wells was the former director of SHP Capital Holdings Ltd - the parent company of Safe Hands - with Debenham described as a \"fellow senior executive\".Wells and Debenham are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 5 February.The SFO said the charges of Wells, 39, residing in Spain, and Debenham, 43, of Norwich, were a \"critical step\" in its investigation.Emma Luxton, director of operations, added planholders were left \"exposed, out of pocket and uncertain about their funeral arrangements\".Pre-paid funeral plans are designed to allow people to pay for their own funeral in advance, in order to help their families financially when they die.Since July 2022, pre-paid funeral providers have required approval to operate from the Financial Conduct Authority.Safe Hands was one of dozens of companies operating in the previously unregulated sector, and collapsed four months before the measures came in.Overall, planholders like Denise Hudson are owed an estimated £70.6m in totalThe administrator for Safe Hands, FRP Advisory, initially said planholders could receive repayments of between 8.5p and 12.5p for every pound they lost by June 2025.But after a six-month delay, the amount repaid to those affected by the funeral firm collapse proved to be much less - about 4p for every pound.Planholders are owed an estimated £70.6m in total.Among them are Denise Hudson, from Derby, who paid nearly £2,500 for a Safe Hands plan after seeing a TV advert in 2019, and was last year given a cheque for less than £100 by administrators.\"That was my savings. I gave it in good faith. I actually thought what it said on the tin, it is in safe hands,\" she said.Hudson told the BBC she might \"frame\" the cheque for £96.50, using it as a reminder to keep fighting.David and Sandie Beatty said they were \"angry\" and \"disappointed\" when Safe Hands collapsedIn 2017, Sandie and David Beatty, from Bingham in Nottinghamshire, paid Safe Hands £3,395 to cover the funeral costs for the first of them to die.Sandie said they felt \"angry, disappointed, sick\" when the firm collapsed.Aimee Geary, an NHS worker from Anstey in Leicestershire, paid £3,000 to Safe Hands in 2017.Geary said: \"Other people thought I was young [to be planning my funeral]. I'm very organised, and I didn't want anyone else to have a job when I'm not here.\"It's sad that you try to plan something and it has been taken away from you.\"Aimee Geary paid £3,000 for a Safe Hands plan in 2017Related internet links",

    "body": "20 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC NewsBBCNicky spent 10 years as a hostage negotiator for the Metropolitan PoliceBeing a parent and working as a hostage negotiator don't immediately appear to have a lot in common, but someone who has been both says tricks she learnt in her profession can help you at home.Nicky Perfect spent over 30 years as a Metropolitan Police officer, including 10 years as an international hostage and crisis negotiator, in the elite New Scotland Yard Hostage and Crisis Negotiation Unit.At times, she says, knowing what to do or say as a parent, can feel high-stakes - the difference between keeping the peace and a full-on meltdown or argument.Here are the three techniques from her high-pressure career which will help you stay calm and in control as a parent, she told the BBC's Parenting Download podcast, 1. Give them a 'no choice choice'Getty ImagesKids regularly push boundaries and often want to do the opposite of what you ask them.In situations like these rather than asserting your authority and using the \"because I said so\" phrase, try the \"no choice choice\", trick, says Nicky.This means reframing the situation by continuing to enforce one choice, but doing so in a manner that still gives your child a sense of control and influence. So, asking a child whether they want to put their coat on in the house or when they go outside, for example, can help them feel heard, respected and involved - all while leading to the same outcome.Another example could be giving a child that is refusing to eat vegetables the option between broccoli or sprouts.This may not work every time, but it can help limit immediate resistance.2. Wait 90 seconds before respondingGetty ImagesWhen dealing with sensitive topics, Nicky advises not responding for 90 seconds to  stop you responding emotionally.As an FBI agent once told her: \"your job in life is not to change people… you can't… the only thing you can choose is how to respond.\"It is important to remember this choice exists even when emotions threaten to overwhelm the logical side of our brain.\"The response might just be, 'do you know what? I'm being quite emotional now. I need to go away and think about this',\" says Nicky. \"Or it might be you just don't say anything, and you listen to what they've got to say.\"As a co-parent, she had to put this into practice herself when her stepdaughter admitted she wanted to spend Christmas Day with her dad and siblings after they moved further away.Internally, Nicky desperately wanted her to stay. But, she says, \"somewhere along the line you have to press the pause button... and say this is your Christmas. It's a day in my life. What do you want?\"Accepting this made it easier for her to decide how to spend the day herself - as well as plan a new way of celebrating together with her stepdaughter, either before or after.3. See their perspective Getty ImagesSeeing the world from the other person's point of view, be they big or small, is key, says Nicky.This way you can sell the benefits of your outcome to the other person, while also making them feel heard.\"It's called the 'power of' negotiation, because if you give people reasons why something should or shouldn't happen, they're more likely to accept it,\" says Nicky.\"It's about recognising it and being really honest with people. People are far more receptive to your honesty than you think they're going to be,\" she says.Take the common problem of tantrums over bedtime. Children can often struggle with the loss of autonomy that a sudden bedtime announcement brings.A solution, says Nicky, is to consider how the child feels in that moment, rather than view it as an adult.  If they're enjoying playing and then you suddenly say it's time to go to bed, this can feel abrupt and naturally upset them.Instead, her suggestion is to prepare the child as soon as they get home - weaving the night time routine naturally into the conversation and reinforcing it regularly throughout the evening. Something like \"we'll have dinner, then watch some TV and then it's bedtime\" acts as a good framework.The child then feels more involved and aware of what is coming, even if they don't necessarily like it - meaning hopefully fewer tantrums.",

    "body": "5 minutes agoKerena Cobbina & Maia DaviesPool/Getty ImagesBarron Trump, the president's fifth child, said he met the alleged victim on social mediaDonald Trump's youngest son contacted UK police saying he witnessed a friend in London being \"beat up\" during a video call, a court has heard.Barron Trump, 19, told police he had friends call 999 from the US so that he could report the alleged attack in January 2025.Matvei Rumiantsev, 22, is on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court accused of assault and two counts of rape, among other charges, against the alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasonsHe denies assault, actual bodily harm, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation and perverting the course of justice by pressuring the woman to withdraw her complaints.Trump called the alleged victim on 18 January last year, the court heard.Shortly after placing the call, the US president's fifth child contacted the police and said she was being assaulted.\"I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up,\" he said, according to a transcript of the call released by the Crown Prosecution Service.\"This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone. Uh, uh it's really an emergency.\"When asked by the operator how he knows the woman, he said: \"I don't think these details matter, she's getting beat up but OK fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters.\" The operator responded: \"Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?\"Trump was later asked by police to provide a witness statement and said in an email on 2 May that what he saw had been \"very brief indeed but indeed prevalent\".He said he had not expected that his call to the woman would be answered because of the time difference, but it was picked up by \"a shirtless man with darkish hair\".\"This view lasted maybe one second\", he said, adding the view then flipped to the victim getting hit while crying.\"This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds.\"He continued: \"I made two of my friends call the Met Police in the UK, even though they are in the US.\"As per evidence I do not have any, I was told by the victim who I am very close with that this individual was giving her difficulty for a long time.\"Rumiantsev denies the charges, which date between November 2024 and January 2025. Prosecutors allege Rumiantsev strangled the woman the evening of 17 January last year.She later called the police, and the Russian national was arrested on the morning of 18 January and taken into custody.The defendant told jurors that the two had been drinking together that night and into the early morning, and had consensual sex during that time.Giving evidence on Thursday, Rumiantsev said an argument broke out and that the woman was \"completely hysterical, crying, screaming, shouting at me\".He said he had held her arms in self-defence to prevent her from hitting him.\"I noticed her phone next to me on the sofa and it was ringing with a Barron Trump face call,\" the defendant told the court.He said he was not sure why he answered the call, but that maybe he hoped \"that she wouldn't behave like this in front of someone else.\" Earlier, the Russian national told the court that he learned about the woman's friendship with Trump in October 2024 - when she asked him to take a photograph of a chat between them on her phone. The court also heard he and the alleged victim had had a disagreement in November 2024.Rumiantsev said that he had felt \"upset\" about her talking to Trump.But he said: \"I was in no way controlling but I was trying to make her know that if she feels unwell seeing messages I had with girls 10 years ago, she could maybe understand how I felt when she was sat there this moment texting someone else.\"The trial continues.",

Nora's owners said it had been a three-day \"ordeal\" not knowing what had happened to her.The footage showed the delivery driver, who was wearing a high-vis jacket, ringing the doorbell while holding a parcel.The driver was then seen to wait at the door for several seconds with Nora visible in the background, before he turned round, picked up the cat and walked off.Watch as doorbell camera captures delivery driver 'taking cat'In a statement, Crowther, together with his partner Sarah and their two daughters, said they had adopted Nora from the RSPCA in 2022.\"We are delighted, and very much relieved, that Nora is now back home,\" they said.\"She is a very friendly cat who doesn't normally stray far from home, which is why we were so worried on Sunday evening when she wasn't home.\"They added that it had been \"very difficult to function in your normal day-to-day life\" while Nora was missing.However, they said that Nora \"does not seem fazed by the events of the past few days, and is happily enjoying the extra treats and cuddles\".Carl CrowtherThe family say Nora (pictured with 18-year-old Kyla) is happily enjoying some \"extra treats and cuddles\" now she is homeThe family said they were leaving further investigation into what had happened to the police.Meanwhile, they said they would like to thank people who had liked and shared social media posts about Nora's disappearance.A West Yorkshire Police spokesperson said the force had received a report of a cat being stolen from outside the property.They added: \"A crime of theft has been recorded and inquiries remain ongoing.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentThe government is to radically reduce the number of police forces in England and Wales as part of what sources have called the largest reform of policing in decades.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will announce plans for police reform next week.She will pledge to \"significantly\" cut the number of forces from its current level of 43, and tell them to focus on serious and organised crime. Police chiefs have been calling for the creation of 12 \"mega forces\" to save money and boost crime-fighting efforts.It could be years before changes are implemented, with government sources saying only that it will happen by the end of the next parliament, around 2034.Mahmood will argue in a policy proposal that the current model of 43 forces is bureaucratic and wastes money, with each force running their own headquarters, management teams and backroom staff.Ministers also believe the performance of local forces varies too widely across England. They believe smaller forces are less well equipped to deal with serious crime and respond to major incidents.Mahmood is expected to say new, larger forces should focus on tackling serious and organised crime, as well as complex cases like murder and drugs.Ministers will also announce plans for new Local Policing Areas, with local officers focusing on neighbourhood policing.It is proposed these will be set up in every borough, town or city across in England, and will be tasked with working with communities and fighting what the government calls \"local crime\", such as shoplifting, phone theft and drug dealing.Government insiders acknowledge there is an \"epidemic of every day offences\" going unpunished, and say they believe criminals think they can \"cause havoc on our streets with impunity\" because people are forced to wait hours or days for police to investigate crimes.A government source said: \"Where you live will no longer determine the outcomes you get from your force.\"Ministers will not say next week exactly how many forces will exist under the new framework. Instead, an independent review will be announced to looking at precise details.Similar cuts have been proposed as long as 20 years ago, when then Home Secretary Charles Clarke suggested cutting the number of forces to 12.Scotland also merged its forces in 2013 to create Police Scotland.The home secretary's allies will sell these reforms as part of her \"modernising agenda\".A source said: \"For decades, people have called for forces to be merged. Mahmood is a politician who is not scared of bold reform and a political fight.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"Keir Starmer's forced police reorganisation will undermine efforts to flight crime across England and Wales, inevitably leading to centralised control and reduced policing in towns and villages across the country.\"Some police chiefs have called for a revamp of policing in England and have backed reducing the number of forces.Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: \"Crime is changing, technology is evolving, and we need to be set up in the best possible way to tackle crime in the modern world, relentlessly focused on good quality neighbourhood policing alongside national threats.\"I know the home secretary shares this ambition. We look forward to seeing the government's white paper and working with them to ensure policing delivers outstanding results and rebuilds confidence with the communities we serve.\"A spokesman for the Policing Federation, which represents officers from the rank of constable to chief inspector, said: \"Fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities. \"Skills, capabilities and equipment need significant investment if the public and officers are going to see reform deliver in the real world.\"Any proposals must be driven by evidence and best practice, not lowest cost, and must strengthen rather than weaken frontline, investigative and specialist capability, neighbourhood policing and public confidence.\"",

    "body": "France says it has seized an oil tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of being part of Russia's sanction-busting \"shadow fleet\".French President Emmanuel Macron said the tanker, named the Grinch, was \"subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag\".The French navy, with the assistance of allies including the UK, boarded the vessel on Thursday morning between Spain and Morocco. French maritime authorities said that a search of the vessel had \"confirmed the doubts as to the regularity of the flag\".Russia's embassy in Paris said it had not been informed of the seizure.Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by shipping the oil on aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance.The Grinch was travelling from the Arctic port of Murmansk in northern Russia when it was intercepted, French authorities said. The vessel had been flying a Comoros flag, according to ship tracking websites marinetraffic and vesselfinder.Announcing the seizure on X, Macron said: \"We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions.\"The activities of the \"shadow fleet\" contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine,\" he said, adding that the vessel had been \"diverted\".Defence Secretary John Healy said the UK navy had provided \"tracking and monitoring\" support, with HMS Dagger monitoring the tanker through the Straits of Gibraltar.He added: \"Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels to choke off the funds that fuel Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine.\"The UK has imposed sanctions on 544 Russian shadow fleet vessels. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the action, saying it was \"exactly the kind of resolve needed to ensure that Russian oil no longer finances Russia's war\".\"Vessels must be apprehended. And wouldn't it be fair to confiscate and sell the oil carried by these tankers?\" he said on X.Speaking at Davos earlier, Zelensky exhorted Europe to do more to ensure its own security, saying: \"Europe loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action\".Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia. Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later.Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

    "body": "US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained a 5-year-old boy on Tuesday during an immigration enforcement operation, Minnesota school officials and the family's lawyer have said.Pre-schooler Liam Ramos was with his father - named by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias - when Conejo Arias was approached by agents on his driveway. In a statement posted on X, the DHS said \"ICE did NOT target a child\", but was conducting an operation against his father, an \"illegal alien\" who \"abandoned\" his son when approached.Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public Schools superintendent, asked: \"Why detain a 5-year-old? \"You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.\"Photos provided to the BBC by the school district show a boy, identified as Liam Ramos, wearing a bunny-shaped winter hat, standing outside as an officer holds onto his backpack.The Columbia Heights Public Schools authority described these as bystander photos. The district did not identify the individuals who took the pictures, referring to them as \"known and confirmed community members\".Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, told journalists that Liam and his father were likely being held at a detention centre in Texas. School officials said that the father had an active asylum case with no deportation order.The son had just arrived home from pre-school at the time of the apprehension, Stenvik said during a press conference on Wednesday.Around the time of the incident, school officials were present at the Ramos house to provide support, according to the schools superintendent.Stenvik said that ICE had recently detained a total of four students in her school district, including a 10-year-old, and two 17-year-olds.The DHS did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the incident.In its post on X, the DHS described the arrest as a \"targeted operation\". It added: \"For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.\"Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administration's immigration enforcement.\"According to Stenvik, another adult living in the home did ask to take the young boy inside but was refused. It was not clear why. Instead, the school officials allege, an agent asked the child to knock on the door of the home to see if anyone else was there.Columbia Heights Public Schools Board of Education Chair Mary Granlund said in a statement: \"Our children should not be afraid to come to school or wait at the bus stop.\"Their families should not be afraid to drop off or pick up their children from school.\"The DHS has previously said it is arresting the \"worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota.At a DHS press conference on Tuesday, Gregory Bovino of the US Border Patrol discussed the wider operation and said: \"Our operations are lawful, are targeted, and are focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community.\"The mission, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul, and other cities in the state.On 7 January, a federal officer fatally shot a woman named Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protest and condemnation from local and state officials.The Trump administration alleged the woman was using her vehicle as a weapon and the officer acted in self-defence.Vice President JD Vance was scheduled to visit the state on Thursday amid ongoing protests against ICE's operations.Vance told reporters he hoped to \"to calm the tensions\", CNN reported.\"The number one way where we could lower the mistakes that are happening, at least with our immigration enforcement, is to have local jurisdictions that are cooperating with us,\" Vance said.",

He died at Southmead Hospital on 6 December.Dr Simon Fox KC, assistant coroner for Avon, reached a conclusion of accidental death on Thursday, noting Lumber had consumed alcohol before his fall.Coroner's officer Andrew Eastwood said in a statement he had spoken to Lumber's wife Michelle who told him he had \"been to watch Bristol City play football and had consumed several alcoholic drinks\".He returned home at 19:30 GMT and took the key to his van – where he kept his work ladder – before leaving their home.Paramedics notes recorded that Mr Lumber had left his home \"to put up flags around the neighbourhood\", the statement added.Michelle Lumber later became aware of sirens across the road and went out to find her husband being treated by paramedics, with his ladder nearby and a Union Jack flag on a lamppost.The inquest heard he suffered extensive head injuries, including a skull fracture, and underwent two operations but surgeons were unable to save him.Recording a conclusion of accidental death, the coroner said: \"Mr Lumber fell from a ladder while tying a Union Jack flag to a lamppost at night after consuming alcohol.\"His cause of death was recorded as traumatic brain injury and a fall.Lumber, of Duckmoor Road, was a well-known fan of Bristol City FC and authored two books about his experiences.The two volumes, titled It All Kicked Off In Bristol, explored football hooliganism.",

    "body": "Met Office weather warnings - including a more severe amber warning - have been issued for rain in parts of the UK.Heavy rain in eastern Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of England and Wales will bring significant rainfall totals and the risk of flooding.Strong winds will accompany the rain, particularly in north-east Scotland.Into Friday, Storm Ingrid - named by the Portuguese weather service - will bring rain and strong winds into south-western areas of England and Wales with further warnings issued here.Heavy rain and strong winds have continued in eastern Scotland, where there is a Met Office amber warning in force for Grampian, Angus, and Perth and Kinross until 18:00 GMT.Rainfall accumulations of 60-80mm are likely, with as much as 100-120mm over high ground. Totals since Wednesday evening may exceed 150 mm in a few places. This is expected to lead to some surface water and river flooding across the area.There is also a wider yellow warning across the rest of eastern Scotland where rainfall accumulations of 30-60mm will be seen widely.The Met Office warns that with the ground already saturated from recent rain and and snow thaw, this may lead to some flooding in places.A strong south-easterly wind in north-east Scotland will also make it feel particularly unpleasant.Additional yellow warnings are in force on Thursday across south-east Wales, Somerset and Devon from 08:00 to 16:00 and Northern Ireland from 10:00 to 23:59.Persistent and heavy rain in these areas through the day falling on saturated ground could lead to some flooding and transport disruption.On Thursday morning there were nearly 160 flood warnings in force across England, Scotland and Wales.Weather warningsFlood warningsElsewhere, the weather remains generally cloudy and breezy, with rain and drizzle.On Friday, the UK will be impacted by Storm Ingrid, which was named by the Portuguese weather service due to the impacts expected there from strong winds and heavy rain.The centre of Ingrid will move close to the south-west of England and north-west France. Winds in the UK will strengthen on Friday, with gusts up to 60mph expected in south-west England and Wales along with further heavy rain at times.A Met Office yellow warning will come into force here from 02:00 GMT Friday to 09:00 Saturday.While the winds won't be as powerful or dangerous as the near 100mph winds experienced in south-west England during Storm Goretti, there could still be some impacts.With saturated ground, flooding is possible and, with coastal gales, there will be large overtopping waves.It will likely stay windy through Saturday morning as the centre of Ingrid stalls to the south-west. Winds will gradually ease as the day progresses.The rest of the UK will avoid any impacts associated with Storm Ingrid, but the rain in eastern Scotland will continue, with some snow over higher ground.While Storm Ingrid will affect south-western parts of England, for the rest of the UK, we will start to see a brisk south-east to easterly wind.Drawing in colder air from north-east Europe, temperatures will start to drop over the weekend and next week with a cold snap.By Monday, temperatures will fall to 4 to 6C below the average for the end of January.The easterly wind will also likely bring occasional wintry showers, with snow for some parts of the UK.Where exactly, and how much snow, is not yet certain, but wintry hazards are likely.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesAmerican singer-songwriter Neil Sedaka, who wrote and performed hits through the 1950's and 60's, including Oh! Carol, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do, Bad Blood, Laughter in the Rain and Calendar Girl, has died at the age of 86.\"Our family is devastated by the sudden passing of our beloved husband, father and grandfather,\" his family confirmed in a statement.  \"A true rock and roll legend, an inspiration to millions, but most importantly, at least to those of us who were lucky enough to know him, an incredible human being who will be deeply missed.\"Sedaka, a skilled pianist nominated for five Grammy awards, also wrote hits for several other famous musicians in his six-decades-long career. His family did not disclose his cause of death or where he died.The Brooklyn native and student of the famed Julliard School in New York was a founder of the doo-wop group The Tokens in the late 1950's. After producing several hits through the early 1960s, he later returned to Billboard's Top 10 chart in 1975 after writing the song Love Will Keep Us Together for duo Captain & Tennille. He also recorded several albums for Elton John's record label in the 1970's.He wrote his first hit song with his neighbour while still a teenager. Connie Francis recorded and released \"Stupid Cupid\" in 1958. Sedaka's popular music faded from the spotlight later in the 1960's, as the British Invasion era took hold of the US.\"It's wonderful for the soul to be able to play classical music,\" he said.\"But to travel around, playing your own lyrics and music is a very rewarding feeling and I chose that, and I have no regrets.\"",

Early voting has begun in the primaries and Democrats are hopeful they could win a Texas senate seat for the first time in over 30 years. \nThe election will have national consequences - Texas is one of America’s political power centres, and Republicans from here have dominated the national agenda from immigration, to the courts, to reshaping electoral districts.  Taking back Texas could help Democrats take back the House, the Senate, and check Trump’s executive power in a way they have so far been unable to do in his second term.  It could also realign the presidential election in 2028.  \nJustin and Anthony - who grew up in Texas and knows its politics well - unpack the primaries, which are fast becoming the most expensive in modern US history.  On the Republican side, there is meltdown and infighting, as Senator John Cornyn faces a serious challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton.  The US president - who is campaigning in Texas - hasn’t yet endorsed one candidate. \nOn the Democrat side, two of its biggest stars are fighting for the nomination.  Jasmine Crockett, well known for her fiery public battles with the Trump administration and James Talarico, who is tipped as a future Democrat presidential candidate.  We look at what their realistic chances are, and what it tells us about the future of the party.  \nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Grace Reeve, Sophie van Brugen and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "24 minutes agoLabour's \"crushing by-election defeat\" leads the Times, which reports that pressure grows on Primer Minister Sir Keir Starmer to shift the party to the left after losing in Gorton and Denton to the Greens. It adds that ministers are saying \"they believe it is now 'inevitable' that Starmer will not lead Labour into the election\". Sir Keir has said he would not step down and would continue to fight \"for as long as I've got breath in my body\", it reports.The fallout from Labour's loss in Gorton and Denton features on the front page of the Daily Mail. It reports that after the result of the by-election, police are being \"urged to investigate 'clear evidence' of voter fraud\", which comes \"Amid warnings that Britain is 'sleepwalking into sectarian politics'\". \"Green delight sparks nightmare for Labour\" runs across the top of the Guardian. Its main front page story says: \"Keir Starmer is facing an ultimatum from his own party to change direction of face a leadership challenge within months.\" It describes the  loss to the Greens in the by-election as a humiliation that plunges Labour politicians into \"renewed despair\".The Daily Telegraph frames its coverage of the by-election with a report that opens: \"Labour must push ahead with a crackdown on migration despite the Green party's by-election victory, Shabana Mahmood will urge next week.\" Under a large image of Hannah Spencer, the new Greens MP in Gorton and Denton, are an article saying Britain closes its embassy in Iran and another headlined: \"Millions of electric car drivers spied on through their phones\".The FT Weekend opens its coverage of the by-election by reporting: \"Sir Keir yesterday saw his political strategy shattered.\" It also says there are calls from within Labour to shift the party to the left. The front page carries a report saying the US, UK and other countries have ordered some citizens and diplomats to leave the Middle East over fears \"a Trump administration attack on Iran could spiral into a regional conflict\".Intense pressure mounts on Sir Keir to move the Labour party to the left \"or resign\" after the by-election result, the i Weekend reports. Its headline says Angela Rayner \"leads new threat\" to the prime minster, with MPs warning \"it's terminal\". Calling the former deputy prime minister a \"leadership rival\", the i Weekend runs quotes from her on the front page in which she \"openly calls on party to 'wake up' and 'be braver'\".Referring to the job of Hannah Spencer, the plasterer and plumber who won Gorton and Denton for the Greens, the Daily Star runs a large headline reading: \"Plaster la vista Starmer\". A smaller headline running underneath states: \"Labour throws in trowel as Greens win\".  \"Wake-up call\" runs as a large headline across the front page of the Daily Mirror, which is also leading with coverage of the \"by-election blow\". It opens its report on the Gorton and Denton by-election: \"Keir Starmer vowed to keep fighting for change after the Green Party stunned Labour in a crucial by-election.\" A large image of a vandalised statue of Winston Churchill sits next to a prominent headline reading: \"How dare you!\" splashed across the front of the Daily Express. An underlined subheading sates: \"Arrests as vile vandal defaces statue of British hero who helped save our freedoms\". A story about child killer Ian Huntley's condition dominates the front page of the Sun. It is headlined \"He's battered beyond recognition\" above a report that says his mum visited him in hospital secretly and told friends he was \"unrecognisable\" after being attacked in prison with a metal pole and left with a crushed skull.Related Internet Links",

We are being bled dry.\"And I don't think it's extreme or radical to think working hard should get you a nice life.\"She added: \"I think that absolutely everybody should get a nice life.\"Palestinian flags featured on Spencer's leaflets and she made clear during the campaign that she believed a \"genocide\" was taking place in Gaza.Spencer, who used a campaign video to say she spends her \"life fixing things that are broken\", also said she wanted to end privatisation in the NHS and nationalise water companies.Spencer worked as a plumber after leaving education aged 16, and started 2026 with the ambition of \"new year, new trade\".She explained she had returned to college to start a full-time plastering course, but within weeks she was combining this training - commuting by car to a college in Stoke - with her campaigning efforts in Gorton and Denton.Spencer posted on LinkedIn about how she had \"slowly taught myself and done bits\" of plastering in recent years, but had signed-up for an intensive course to ensure she could \"cover more parts of a project\".Spencer added: \"Plus, I just really love trying something new and not stopping until I crack it.\"ReutersHannah Spencer and Green Party leader Zack Polanski believe the party will make more electoral gainsWhile Spencer noted in her victory speech that she \"didn't grow up wanting to be a politician\", the House of Commons will not be Spencer's first experience of working in politics.She currently leads the Greens on Trafford Council, where she has represented the Hale ward since May 2023. Spencer also stood as the Green Party's mayoral election candidate for Greater Manchester in 2024.Now she'll be the Green Party's fifth MP, sitting alongside Siân Berry, Adrian Ramsay, Carla Denyer and Ellie Chowns.'Hugely blighted'When announced as the party's by-election candidate, the Green Party highlighted Bolton-born Spencer's ties to the area and how she has \"lived in Greater Manchester all her life\".Spencer, regarded as straight-talking and authentic, once wrote that she was \"glad\" to move out of Gorton and Denton.During the campaign, media attention focused on a post by her on Mumsnet in 2021 in which she said Levenshulme has been \"hugely blighted\" by \"(supposedly) money laundering takeaways\" and that independent businesses \"can't get a look in\".The Greens responded by saying the post made clear Spencer's \"affection\" for the area and her \"disappointment\" that independent businesses were being crowded out.Spencer also describes herself as a marathon runner and \"housemate to four rescued greyhounds\", with the dogs spotted campaigning with her in the constituency.PA MediaSpencer describes herself as \"housemate to four rescued greyhounds\"In the aftermath of her victory, Spencer said \"this is only the beginning\" for the Greens.She told a press conference: \"This was number 127 on the list of Green Party target seats. There are at least 126 seats where we can win with a smaller swing than we saw here, but actually we can win anywhere.\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski added: \"What happened last night is despite the fact that the other parties threw the kitchen sink at us, we had Hannah the plumber.\"And ultimately Hannah has demonstrated the complete opposite. You can be absolutely true to your values and you must be true to your values.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoBrian Wheeler,Political reporterandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterReutersParty observers watch as votes are counted for the Gorton and Denton by-electionNigel Farage has reported allegations of \"family voting\" at the Gorton and Denton by-election to Greater Manchester Police and the Electoral Commission.The Reform UK leader is urging an investigation into reports by independent election observers of \"extremely high\" levels of family voting.Family voting is where a family member is seen to be influencing somebody else's vote, for example by entering the polling booth with them.Concerns were raised by Democracy Volunteers, a group of voluntary election observers who check voting processes are being followed correctly.The Electoral Commission said it took the claims \"very seriously\" and would \"carefully consider\" the report.A statement from the organisation, which oversees elections in the UK, said: \"We are in close contact with the returning officer and Greater Manchester Police to speedily and carefully review the concerns that have been raised and all the information available.\"Greater Manchester Police said in a statement: \"We can confirm a report has been made. We are in the process of reviewing this report and will provide a further update in due course.\"Reform UK were beaten into second place by the Green Party by more than 4,000 votes at the by-election but Farage has claimed it was \"a victory for sectarian voting and cheating\".He said: \"Reform has today reported the many cases of 'family voting' to the Electoral Commission and the police.\"What was witnessed yesterday is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas.\"If this is what was happening at polling stations just imagine the potential for coercion with postal votes.\"If action isn't taken now, then we will ensure it is after the next general election.\"In a letter to the elections watchdog, Farage urged them to launch a full investigation and to work with police \"with a view to prosecutions\" and to \"assess whether the extent of the irregularities is such that the validity of the election result may be called into question\".Earlier, the Green Party hit back at Reform's criticisms, with a spokesman saying: \"This is an attempt to undermine the democratic result and is straight out of the Trump playbook.\"We've just won a historic by-election by a comfortable margin.\"We've shown the country that Greens can beat Reform, despite their big business donations.\"Gorton and Denton by-electionThe Conservative Party, which came a distant fourth in the by-election, have also written to the Electoral Commission to ask for a full investigation into the Democracy Volunteers' allegations.In a letter to the watchdog, shadow communities secretary James Cleverly said: \"There is clear evidence that electoral offences were committed and a blind eye was turned to corruption and criminal activity.\"Family voting was effectively made illegal through the Ballot Secrecy Act 2023, which made it a criminal offence to be in or near a polling booth with another person in order to influence them to vote in a particular way.While Tower Hamlets in east London has been the focus of multiple allegations of family voting in recent years, Democracy Volunteers has repeatedly described the issue as \"widespread\" across all parts of the UK in its reports.Democracy Volunteers director John Ault issued a statement after polls had closed on Thursday, saying observers had seen \"the highest levels of family voting at any election in our 10 year history of observing elections in the UK\".He said: \"We rarely issue a report on the night of an election, but the data we have collected today on family voting, when compared to other recent by-elections, is extremely high.\"In the other recent Westminster parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby we saw family voting in 12% of polling stations, affecting 1% of voters. \"In Gorton and Denton, we observed family voting in 68% of polling stations, affecting 12% of those voters observed.\"The group said four observers attended 22 of the 45 polling stations in the constituency, spending 30 to 45 minutes in each.Of the 22 polling stations observed, volunteers reported potential family voting in 15.They observed a sample of 545 individuals casting their vote and saw 32 cases of family voting in total, including nine cases in one polling station.The official responsible for running the by-election rejected the claims, saying no reports of family voting had been made by polling station staff.A spokesperson for the acting returning officer said polling station staff are trained to \"look out for any evidence of undue influence on voters\" and said \"no such issues\" were reported on Thursday.They said: \"If Democracy Volunteers were so concerned about alleged issues they could and should have raised them with us during polling hours so that immediate action could be taken. \"We have operated a central by-election hub which has been rapidly responding to reported issues during the day, in liaison with the police - who had a presence at every polling station - where necessary.\"It is extremely disappointing that Democracy Volunteers have waited until after polls have closed to make such claims.\"Democracy Volunteers responded by saying it followed the \"international best practice of not interfering with the electoral process\" and issued its findings after voting closed to \"ensure we did not disrupt the administration of the election\".The group signalled it was not planning to report incidents to the police, telling the BBC \"it is not our job to administer the elections, purely to observe\".They added: \"We saw police present in many polling stations yesterday to check whether staff were having any issues.\"Labour Party chairwoman Anna Turley told BBC Newsnight reports of family voting in the Gorton and Denton by-election were \"extremely worrying and concerning\". \"We need to see the evidence and the report, and then make due decision about what authorities should look into this,\" she added.",

    "body": "13 hours agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondent andJamie WhiteheadPA MediaIan Huntley is serving a life sentence for the murders of the two schoolgirlsSoham double murderer Ian Huntley remains in hospital in a serious condition after being attacked with a makeshift weapon by another inmate. The BBC understands that triple killer Anthony Russell, 43, is suspected of attacking Huntley.Huntley, 52, has suffered significant head trauma from his injuries and is undergoing treatment. He is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 40 years for murdering schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in August 2002.In an update on Friday, Durham Constabulary said there had been \"no change in the 52-year-old man's condition overnight - he remains in hospital in a serious condition\". Previously police said a male prisoner in his mid-40s suspected of carrying out the attack was \"in detention\" but had not been arrested \"at this stage\".The force also confirmed a police investigation is under way and that detectives are liaising with staff at the prison.Sources have told the BBC Huntley was found lying in a pool of blood after being bludgeoned with a makeshift weapon at a prison workshop at HMP Frankland - the high security prison in County Durham.Russell is serving a whole-life prison term for murdering Julie Williams, her son David Williams and Nicole McGregor, whose body was found in woodland near Leamington Spa.He had admitted the murders during a week-long spree in October 2020.This is not the first time Huntley has been attacked at the prison - he was slashed across the throat in 2010 - and needed 21 stitches. The prison - nicknamed Monster Mansion- houses some of the most dangerous criminals including murderers and rapists.Huntley was also attacked in 2005 by a convicted murderer who threw boiling water over him at HMP Wakefield.As Huntley lies in hospital with serious injuries from the attack, many will be remembering the horror of what he did more than 20 years ago.In the commuter town of Soham in Cambridgeshire, Ian Huntley killed two ten-year-old girls in the summer of 2002.Holly and Jessica had been at a family barbeque. It is believed they were on their way to buy sweets when Huntley, then aged 28, lured them back to his home and killed them.The photo of the girls he killed - in their red Manchester United football kits - is etched in the minds of many who vividly remember their disappearance and murder.It was taken by Holly's mum Nicola just an hour-and-a-half before they were last seen. It dominated news reports at the time as a nationwide search for them took place.Four hundred officers worked full-time on the case. Hundreds more volunteers joined the search but nearly a fortnight after they disappeared – the girls' bodies were found in a ditch in Suffolk.Huntley was arrested the same day. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to a minimum of 40 years for the double murders - with the judge saying \"in your lies and manipulation up to this very day, you have increased the suffering you have caused the two families\".His girlfriend Maxine Carr was also jailed in 2003 after being found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice for giving him a false alibi. She has since been released.",

    "body": "10 hours agoHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentLightRocket via Getty ImagesThe Green Party's winning candidate Hannah Spencer addressed the press after winning the by-electionThere are so many implications of the Gorton and Denton by-election that are essential to understand, but it's best first to dwell on the winner: the Greens.The closest they had come to winning a Westminster by-election before was in 2023 in a seat in Somerset where they got about 10% of the vote and finished third.Blasting away one of Labour's biggest majorities shows that under the more left-populist leadership of Zack Polanski, the Greens are now playing in a different political league.Polanski and the party's new MP, Hannah Spencer, were explicit that they do not see this as a self-contained local contest but as the blueprint for all sorts of other parts of the country.The fear among plenty of Labour MPs is that they are right. Labour politicians have over the past year or so become comfortable with the idea that Reform UK could usurp the Conservatives as the main force on the right of British politics.Now they are confronted with the niggling possibility that something similar could be happening on their side of the political spectrum too.It is much too soon to assert that this is likely or even plausible. But it certainly is possible, and that is part of the reason why this by-election may linger long in the memory.As it stands - and that is an important caveat - there are no signs that result in Greater Manchester will precipitate another Labour leadership wobble in the immediate term. Getty ImagesGreen Party leader Zack Polanski was also present to celebrate the win with SpencerEven a Labour MP who messaged me about Sir Keir Starmer in the aftermath of the result simply saying \"time to go\" took the view that any change should happen after the May elections rather than now.Nevertheless, the call from Angela Rayner, Sir Keir's former deputy, for Labour to take this as a \"wake up call\" and become \"braver\" was notably forthright.A word about the Conservatives. Gorton and Denton was not their natural terrain and tactical voting was rife, but even so getting just 700 or so votes and losing their deposit is a bleak omen. The party which was in government less than two years ago ended up about 14,000 votes behind the winner and only 547 votes ahead of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party's \"Sir Oink A-Lot\".It's worth remembering that this is the second by-election since the 2024 general election. Yes, it is fairly typical for governing parties to get a kicking in by-elections. But taken together, along with the Conservatives' political no-shows in both contests, these by-elections point to a new dynamic of surging political forces to the traditional parties' left and right.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentPA MediaShabana Mahmood visited a removals centre in Denmark this week to examine how its policies workHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood is to press ahead with reforms to the asylum and immigration system, despite the loss of a once-safe Labour seat to the Greens in the Gorton and Denton by-election.The Green Party of England and Wales has criticised Labour's stance on immigration – with its leader Zack Polanski recently accusing the party of echoing \"the racist rhetoric of the far right\". The Greens have also called for asylum seekers to be given the right to work.But a source close to Mahmood has told the BBC that the government should not learn the wrong lessons from the by-election result - and that it was \"wrong\" to assume Muslim voters were deserting Labour over immigration. If some in Labour are now queasy about the home secretary's approach, sources are suggesting that the alternative is the \"far right raising up the drawbridge\" and putting in jeopardy the future of the asylum system - and even of the Labour Party itself.Shabana Mahmood herself has said that illegal immigration was putting immense strain on the country and undermining the contract between the government and its citizens.This week, Mahmood visited reception and removal centres for asylum seekers near Copenhagen, the Danish capital, to examine how a tougher set of policies were working in practice. Danish government policies influenced Labour's proposals for asylum reform last autumn,  and the home secretary is expected to begin implementing some of them from next week.These include making most migrants wait for up to 10 years - rather than the current five – before being able to apply for permanent residence, with refugees waiting for up to 20 years. The proposals also included offering only temporary protection to those whose asylum claims have been accepted - and reducing the number of appeals that unsuccessful applicants can lodge. 'All talk'Mahmood is expected to double down on her approach in a speech next week.She will seek to make a \"Labour case\" for \"firm and fair\" Danish-style immigration policies, which are aimed at reducing incentives for people to enter the UK illegally.Left-wing Labour MPs have called for a change of approach.Richard Burgon – of the Socialist Campaign Group – told the BBC it was time to \"ditch the approach of aping Reform and kicking the left which has alienated so many people who have voted Labour previously\".Imran Hussain, from the Refugee Council, a charity, was sceptical about proceeding with new asylum and immigration rules.He said that \"the big lesson of recent years was that tough talking\" did not lead to \"smart action\" and the government should instead focus on the \"basics\" - swifter asylum decisions, swifter appeals and help for refugees to integrate.Reform UK's home affairs spokesman Zia Yusuf said Mahmood was \"all talk and no action,\" and the government could not fix the immigration system while it was \"chained\" to the European Convention on Human Rights (EHCR).He said a Reform government would leave the ECHR immediately and \"completely abolish indefinite leave to remain\", as well as imposing visa bans on countries refusing returns and \"criminalise aiding illegal entry, regardless of intent\".

    "body": "60 minutes agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesRenters are paying an average of at least £1,000 a month for a new tenancy in more than half of British neighbourhoods, according to data shared with the BBC.In 2020, average rent in only 23% of local authority areas in Britain broke the £1,000 barrier, but five years on that figure had risen to 52%, the research from property portal Zoopla shows.Average wages have risen over the same period, but many tenants say renting has become unaffordable.Landlords are warning of cost pressures to come, although Zoopla's data suggests  rent rises have slowed sharply. Our interactive graphic shows where the £1,000 a month rental zone has extended, principally from London. The average rent figures are nominal, so do not account for inflation.Use the tool to see how the cost of privately rented homes has risen in your council area in England, Scotland, and Wales.The cost of renting soared when Covid pandemic restrictions eased, with Zoopla calculating an increase of 36% between 2020 and 2025, adding to cost-of-living pressures for people who may prefer to rent or cannot afford to buy a home.Average rent of more than £1,000 had become the norm, rather than the exception, in southern England and major cities, it said.Although rent inflation is now easing, it is still a problem for renters in some areas where there is a shortage of available properties.Victoria FearVictoria is facing a big rent riseNurse Victoria Fear, 51, contacted the BBC's Your Voice to highlight the situation in her area. She said that available rental properties in Dumfries and Galloway were extremely scarce.Her landlord has told her the rent, in the home where she has lived for eight years, will rise from £950 a month to £1,300.\"All my money goes on rent, bills and food,\" she said. \"We've not had a holiday in years.\"Temporary rent controls were put in place in Scotland during the Covid pandemic, but those expired in April 2025. New long-term measures will allow ministers to designate parts of the country as rent control areas by 2027.She said she understood her landlord's thinking, but felt she was seriously disadvantaged as a single mum-of-three with a solitary income. \"I don't have an issue with market-value rent, but it is not an affordable proposition,\" she said. With two of her children working towards exams, she said she would have to find a way to manage.Renters getting olderProhibitively high rents have meant people are moving into flat shares later in life and are staying on longer, according to website Spareroom.com.It said under-25s now made up just over a quarter (26%) of the flat share market, down from almost a third (32%) a decade ago.Meanwhile, renters aged 45 and over now account for 16% of the market, up from 10% in 2015, creating more multi-generational house shares.The good news for renters is that cost pressures for new tenancies have started to ease, according to Zoopla. Its data shows:At 1.9% a year, rent growth for new tenancies was now at its lowest level for four yearsSome 14% more homes were now available to rent than a year ago, so renters were less likely to face bidding warsDemand for rented homes was at its weakest at the start of a year for seven years, reflecting a decline in international migration for work and study and improved conditions for first-time buyersRichard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, said rents were expected to rise by between 2% and 3% over 2026.\"While renting has become more expensive and is an important cost for household budgets, the market is shifting in renters' favour,\" he said. \"Cost-of-living pressures from rent are easing rather than intensifying.\"However, Chris Norris, chief policy officer at the National Residential Landlords' Association (NRLA), said that landlords faced ongoing cost pressures that could drive up rents.He said there were signs landlords were adding 4% to 5% to rent to \"future-proof\" them as they faced changing tenancy rules under the Renters' Rights Act in England. Many landlords with older properties were having to invest in better energy efficiency because of new rules. In addition, they face an increase in income tax on rental income in 2027.Interactive by Jess Carr and Tommy Lumby",

    "body": "7 hours agoPouya GhorbaniBBC PersianGetty ImagesMany Iranians fear that a collapse of the talks could trigger catastrophic consequencesAcross Iranian cities, many are living through sleepless nights and anxious days amid the continued speculation that the United States could be about to carry out military strikes. Some young people in particular are obsessively checking plane- and ship-tracking platforms - some fearful of external intervention, others quietly or openly hoping for it since the violent suppression of anti-establishment protests more than 50 days ago. For many, hopes that outside pressure might shift the balance dimmed when US President Donald Trump - who previously encouraged demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and promised that \"help is on the way\" - appeared to pivot toward diplomatic engagement instead.The human toll of the unrest remains deeply contested. The US‑based human‑rights organisation HRANA reports 7,007 people killed, with thousands more cases still under investigation - far exceeding Iran's official figure of 3,117 and revealing the heavy opacity surrounding the crackdown. UN experts, including the special rapporteur on human rights for Iran Mai Sato, stress that internet restrictions and widespread detentions make it \"impossible to determine the true scale of the violent crackdown\" at this stage.With a third round of US-Iran negotiations in Geneva ending this week without a final agreement but with the faint signs of progress, Iran is once again entering a phase of profound uncertainty. Many Iranians fear that a collapse of the talks could trigger catastrophic consequences. Some analysts warn that Iran's leaders have previously indicated they would risk \"a regional war\" rather than concede. Some intelligence observers suggest the Islamic Republic could adopt a \"madman\" posture if confronted militarily, threatening to leave behind \"burnt land\" rather than allow an uncontested fall.These concerns are reinforced by reports of ongoing domestic repression. Mai Sato has warned of rising pressure on human rights lawyers and says arrests, intimidation and surveillance have continued long after the major protest wave waned - contributing to what she calls one of the darkest human rights periods in Iran's recent history. Her repeated calls for \"transparency and accountability\" reflect the growing international alarm.On pro-government social media channels, two competing narratives dominate. One camp expresses cautious optimism, hoping the negotiations will prevent another conflict, and evoking memories of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war and the more recent 12-day escalation war with Israel, which left more than 1,200 people dead and more than 6,000 injured in Iran. Twenty-eight people were killed and dozens injured in Israel in the hostilities. The other side embraces an apocalyptic framing, insisting that a full‑scale clash between \"good and evil\" is inevitable, regardless of diplomacy.Meanwhile, state media have sharply increased broadcasts showcasing missile capabilities - a familiar tactic during periods of heightened tension.Economically, the country is entering what should be its busiest shopping season ahead of Nowruz - the Persian New Year - yet the atmosphere is not like it normally is at this time. With Iran suffering under US sanctions and inflation soaring above 62%, the market is paralysed by uncertainty. Traders report minimal foot traffic, and investors appear hesitant, delaying major moves that now look more like gambles than strategic decisions.Getty ImagesHopes that outside pressure might shift the balance inside Iran dimmed when Donald Trump appeared to pivot toward diplomacyAnother trend visible across social networks is one of growing emergency preparedness: people stockpiling canned food, torches and water bottles, and assembling emergency backpacks. Although some opposition figures frame the possibility of a US intervention as a targeted strike, others warn of the potential for a broader and more devastating military operation.The sense of uncertainty is not confined to Iran. Several countries have advised their citizens to leave - and as regional tensions escalate, the stakes of the next round of talks feel existential. For millions inside Iran, the coming weeks promise little clarity - only the hope that diplomacy prevails before fear turns into reality.With no clear path out of crisis, the emotional landscape inside Iran is shaped by exhaustion, social polarisation and hyper‑vigilance. As the next round of talks approaches, the public oscillates between faint hopes for diplomacy and an acute awareness that events far beyond their control may reshape their future overnight. To many, Iran now seems to be hovering in a tense limbo where everything - and nothing - could change at once.",

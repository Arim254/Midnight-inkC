    "body": "6 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media Editor, Los AngelesBBCTwo-time Oscar winner, Sir Anthony Hopkins tells the BBC that he can't \"take credit\" for his successNot many people can say they've been given a private piano recital by Sir Anthony Hopkins. But that's exactly what happened when our four-strong BBC team went to interview the double Oscar-winning actor in Los Angeles.We were in the same room as the man who terrified as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, shattered as a butler in The Remains of The Day and devastated as a dad with dementia in The Father.An actor who was cast by Oliver Stone as President Nixon because - according to Sir Anthony - the director said \"you're nuts like Nixon\".At a grand piano in a hotel in Beverly Hills, as he plays us a piece he calls Goodbye, it's clear an artistic soul exudes from his every pore. Haunting notes of music, lines of poetry and Shakespearean verses cascade out of him.A private piano recital with Sir Anthony HopkinsWe were meeting because Sir Anthony's publishing his autobiography, We Did OK, Kid, an honest and at times upsetting account of a loner who was bullied and written off as a child in Wales and became one of Britain's finest acting exports.He puts his success down to sheer luck, telling me: \"I couldn't take credit for any of it, I couldn't have planned any of this - and now at 87, about to turn 88, I get up in the morning and I think, 'Hello, I'm still here,' and I still don't get it.\"From the outside, it looks less about luck and more about his deep understanding of human emotion, as his performances testify. I ask what makes him such an instinctive actor.\"It's such a miracle being alive,\" he says. He finds the complexity of human beings \"fascinating... I mean, how can you produce Beethoven, Bach and then Treblinka and Auschwitz?\"Sir Anthony has always understood the duality of being human, and it explains his acting range.He got his first break on film when the actor Peter O'Toole suggested he audition for the 1968 movie The Lion in Winter, in which O'Toole was playing Henry II.At that point, Sir Anthony had been a member of Sir Laurence Olivier's National Theatre company for several years. But, he recalls: \"I couldn't fit into the British theatre style, I just felt out of it.\"He also \"didn't want to be standing on stage holding a spear for the rest of my life, in wrinkled tights, I just wanted to have a bit of a life\".He was cast as Richard the Lionheart and couldn't believe that a baker's son from Port Talbot was working with Katharine Hepburn.The actress, playing his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, gave him \"the best advice I've had\" as they rehearsed their first scene together. She told him to \"just speak the lines... Don't act, just do it\". She also said he was \"real good\".Hepburn was right, of course. Some classically trained theatre actors, particularly back then, didn't appreciate how much they needed to adjust their performance for the intimacy of a camera. He did.He doesn't much care for talking about the craft of acting, or certainly the reverence there can be around it, but he shares his method with me: \"Be still. Be economic. Don't act or twitch around, you know, 'showing off' acting... simplify, simplify, simplify'.\"Hollywood PicturesDirector, Oliver Stone (L) told a reluctant Sir Anthony that he wanted him to play Nixon because he was \"nuts\" like President NixonHis performances stand out because he's an actor of huge emotional depth and psychological insight. Think of him as Dr Treves, the friend and protector of John Hurt's Elephant Man. Or as Lecter, still for me the most terrifying of characters more than 30 years on. The serial killer is a monster but Sir Anthony understood that less is more, on screen.Getty ImagesSir Anthony and Jodie Foster both won Oscars for their roles in The Silence of the LambsInstead of playing Lecter as obviously monstrous, \"you go the opposite way, you draw back\", he explains. He realised as soon as he had read a few pages of the script that the role was \"a life-changer\". He writes in his memoir that he \"instinctively sensed how to play Hannibal. I have the devil in me. We all have the devil in us, I know what scares people\".Watch: Sir Anthony Hopkins on playing the infamous Hannibal LecterHe tells me he played Lecter still - and deadly. So when he was in character opposite other actors, he decided, \"Don't take your eyes off the person. That's terrifying.\" He puts on Lecter's metallic rasp for me and appears to enjoy repeating his character's words to Jodie Foster's Clarice. \"You're not real FBI,\" he almost hisses.\"That's scary,\" he says. He's not wrong. Even in an upmarket LA hotel on a warm autumn afternoon, I'm feeling chilled.And what about the famous line - \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which he follows with that vampire-like hiss? He explains as a child he'd seen the Hungarian-American actor Bela Lugosi do the same when playing Count Dracula in the 1931 movie. Sir Anthony decided in the moment of filming to copy it and The Silence of the Lambs director, Jonathan Demme, kept it in.Getty ImagesBela Lugosi's portrayal of Count Dracula in the 1931 horror film influenced Sir Anthony when playing Hannibal Lecter What is startling about the memoir is the disconnect between how the world viewed the young actor and how much it was clearly missing about him. He was bullied at school for what other kids saw as his large \"elephant\" head. He was slapped around by teachers who deemed him a complete dunce. Even his parents pretty much wrote him off.He believes it was the making of him. It \"gave me a core of anger, resentment and revenge\", he says.But why hadn't they all noticed his talents? This was a child who was given the 10 volume Children's Encyclopaedia when he was six (\"I was so captivated, I read every one of them\") and became fascinated by astronomy. A boy who played the piano, made art and loved Dickens and Shakespeare, quoting from them extensively.A school report in 1955 when he was 17 marked \"the turning point\" in his life. It was terrible, as usual. \"What's going to happen to you?\" Sir Anthony recalls his father lamenting. \"I said: 'One day, I'll show you, both of you'.\"Sir Anthony HopkinsSir Anthony, a \"little confused boy\" by his own recollection, with his father at Aberavon Beach in 1941Sir Anthony HopkinsSir Anthony Hopkins, here in 1953, says he was bullied at school, where teachers thought he was \"thick\"He's pleased his parents lived long enough to see him succeed. When he won his first best actor Oscar, for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992, 11 years to the day after his father died, he rang his mother in Wales and said: \"I guess I did OK.\"But it was a rough ride in the early days. He was an alcoholic who picked fights with directors and others. He wasn't always a good husband to his first two wives. Booze turned him nasty. \"That's the ugly side of alcoholism,\" he writes. \"It brought out a brutal side of me. I'm not proud of it at all.\"The anger, he believes, came \"from inside, my own insecurities, being bullied at school and all the rest of it. I didn't like authority\".ShutterstockSir Anthony (seen with co-star Kate Nelligan) played an alcoholic actor, Theodore Gunge, in the 1974 TV drama The Arcata PromiseThen one night in LA in December 1975, almost 50 years ago, he drove his car while in \"a complete alcoholic blackout\". When he came to, he realised that he was \"out of control\" and could have killed someone. He made a phone call to ask for help.\"Suddenly, something said 'it's all over, now you can start living'... the craving left and it's never come back.\"At his first meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, he had a realisation about everyone else in the room.\"They're all misfits like me. Like all of us. We feel we never belong. We feel self-hatred. All of us are the same. I'm not alone.\"It's that feeling of disconnection that shines out of the book. He writes that his wife Stella believes he is on the autism spectrum which is \"likely right, given my proclivity for memorisation and repetition... and my lack of emotionality\" but he says he prefers the term \"cold fish\". I want to know why.It seems to have begun as a reaction to the bullying and screaming at him through school and National Service. \"I'd just stare them out, and that drove them mad,\" he recalls. \"You withdraw into yourself and think, 'OK you can't hurt me, can you?\" It was, he says, his \"only defence... and that's a power, you see: I don't care.\"Of course, Sir Anthony does care and we talk a little about the state of the world. It's at this point in our interview that he becomes his most passionate. He grew up in Port Talbot surrounded by people who had been impacted, even brutalised, by war. He played Sir Nicholas Winton, the man who saved hundreds of mainly Jewish children from the Nazis, in the film One Life.Warner Bros.In One Life, Sir Anthony played Sir Nicholas Winton, a stockbroker who helped to save nearly 700 mainly Jewish children from the NazisWhen I ask him about whether he worries about increasing polarisation now, he becomes very animated and intense.\"The world has always been a place of utter turmoil. But I think if we go on in this way of hatred... we are dead.\"Nobody's allowed to have an opinion. Nobody can have a different view. That's fascism. And it's insanity.\"If he has any advice about it all, it's to say \"'Come on, stop this rubbish, beating each other up over ideas. They're only ideas and we're only going to be dead one day'.\"Sir Anthony Hopkins' best performances  ShutterstockBrooks FilmsSir Anthony played President Nixon, but told us that, if offered the role of President Trump, he'd say noSir Anthony played the role of Dr Frederick Treves with compassion and said of his character that he \"wrestled with his goodness\"I ask him, as he looks back at his long life, what his biggest regrets are and he's quick to answer. \"People I've hurt over the years, the stupid things I did.\"He's estranged from his only child, his daughter Abigail, who he walked out on when she was just one and he was in the depths of alcoholism.He writes that \"after realising I was unfit as a father for Abigail, I vowed not to have any more children... I couldn't do to another child what I'd done to her\".He has tried to repair their relationship over the years.Getty ImagesSir Anthony with his daughter, Abigail  (here at the premiere of Little Man Tate in Los Angeles in 1991), describes his estrangement as \"a tremendous source of pain\"When he took on the role of King Lear in his 80s, in Sir Richard Eyre's 2018 film, Lear's words to his daughter Cordelia struck a painful chord. He writes in his new book: \"The line that hit me harder than perhaps any other I've ever spoken was 'I did her wrong'. Saying those words, I felt deeply, perhaps for the first time in my life, how I had hurt my own daughter.\"I remembered how as a baby she'd lit up when I walked into the room. I remembered how I said goodbye to her the night I walked out. I remembered how I had tried and failed to win her back later. I remembered how I had given up. And as Lear, but also as myself, I began to cry.\"He didn't want to talk about it in our interview. Poignantly, in this section of the book, he writes: \"I hope my daughter knows that my door is always open to her.\"I couldn't help feeling moved reading this. It's as if he is trying to send a message to her, hoping against hope that there might be a reconciliation before it is too late.Playground TelevisionSir Anthony (pictured with Florence Pugh) says playing King Lear made him reflect on the hurt he caused his own daughter, AbigailAt 87, he is looking back, aware he has lived many years longer than he has left to live. \"Most of my friends have died, they're gone, God bless them,\" he says. \"I hope to be around a little longer. But even that, I'm thinking, 'oh well, I had a good time'.\"He certainly still appears to be having fun. After some early reserve when we first met, he quickly relaxed. When he played the piano, he shared how he had lost two much-loved pianos when his house burnt down in the LA fires earlier this year. \"They were all under the rubble\".As we walked through the hotel lobby together, he was spotted by guests and waved happily to them. \"I like to say hi because people think actors are special. We're not at all,\" he smiles.ReutersSir Anthony credits his third wife Stella Arroyave with helping him overcome \"feelings of anxiety in a way that set [him] free\"Whatever he says, it was special to spend a few hours in his presence. He's an acting legend who's given us six decades of memorable performances. He's also a genuine heavyweight who is steeped not just in musical knowledge, but culture, history and philosophy.And we end the interview on a philosophical note - as he recites \"They are not long, the days of wine and roses\" from an Ernest Dowson poem and muses on the fleeting nature of life.\"What are we doing here, what are we?\" he asks. \"We can't explain anything about ourselves. We may have fancy ideas, religious ideas, philosophical ideas, scientific ideas... what's that all about? We're nothing finally, and yet we're everything\".We Did OK, Kid by Sir Anthony Hopkins is published on 4 November.",

    "body": "The president of Spain's Valencia region, Carlos Mazón, has resigned after months of pressure over his handling of flash floods last year.A total of 229 people died in towns in the Valencia region on 29 October 2024, with a further eight dying in neighbouring regions, in Spain's worst natural disaster for decades.Many in Valencia blamed Mazón for the scale of the tragedy because of how he and his government responded that day. It emerged that the regional president had spent nearly four hours in a restaurant with a journalist, Maribel Vilaplana, while the floodwater was wreaking havoc and he did not attend emergency meetings during much of the day.Mazón's government also failed to issue an emergency alert to the phones of Valencia residents warning them of the floods and providing advice until after 20:00, by which times dozens of people had already died.\"I can't go on anymore... I know that I made mistakes, I acknowledge it and I will live with them for the rest of my life,\" Mazón said as he announced his decision, adding that he should have cancelled his schedule for that day to take charge of the crisis. \"I have said sorry and I say it again, but none of [the mistakes] were due to political calculation or bad faith.\"Polls had shown that the vast majority of people in Valencia wanted Mazón, of the conservative People's Party (PP), to step down because of his management of the floods. Monthly protests were held demanding his resignation, most recently on 25 October, when an estimated 50,000 people turned out on the streets of Valencia. Mazón had been making fewer public appearances in recent months because of the abuse he received from members of the public.However, his insistence on attending the memorial service for victims on the first anniversary of the tragedy last week angered relatives of those who died and a number of them barracked him during the ceremony. Mazón seemed shaken by the experience, which appeared to prompt his decision to resign.His announcement came the same day that Maribel Vilaplana, the journalist with who he had lunch on the day of the floods, testified before a judge who is investigating possible negligence.According to Spanish media reports, Vilaplana told the magistrate that Mazón \"was constantly texting on his phone\" and that at one point he received \"a lot of calls\".Mazón will continue as a member of the regional parliament, meaning he will have immunity from prosecution.During his resignation announcement, Mazón criticised the left-wing central government of Pedro Sánchez, accusing it of blocking aid to his region \"purely to cause us political damage\".Mazón has become an increasingly problematic figure for the PP over the last year, with concerns that his unpopularity threatened to undermine the party's electoral prospects not just in the Valencia region but nationwide. However, his replacement has been complicated by the fact that the PP relies on the parliamentary support in the region of the far-right Vox. That party, which has been gaining ground on the PP in polls there, will have to agree to his successor.",

    "body": "3 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBC/Getty ImagesBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni have been at loggerheads since starring together in It Ends With UsJustin Baldoni's $400m (£295m) lawsuit against his former co-star Blake Lively has been formally ended by a judge, who said the actor and director had failed to meet a deadline to continue his claim.The pair, who starred in the 2024 film It Ends with Us, have been locked in a bitter legal battle since Lively sued Baldoni last December accusing him of sexual harassment and waging a smear campaign against her.In response, he filed a lawsuit against her as well as her husband Ryan Reynolds, their publicist and the New York Times, claiming civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.Baldoni's case was dismissed in June, but he had a chance to file an amended complaint. However, Judge Lewis Liman said he had failed to do.ReutersBaldoni also named Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds in the lawsuitThe judge said he had contacted all of the parties on 17 October to give them warning that he would enter a final judgement to conclude the case.Only Lively responded, asking for the final judgement to be declared, but for her request for legal fees to remain active. The judge agreed.Her original lawsuit against Baldoni is also ongoing.After Baldoni's case was dismissed in June, the actress's lawyers called it \"a total victory and a complete vindication\".At the time, Baldoni's lawyer said Lively's \"predictable declaration of victory is false\", and that \"with the facts on our side, we march forward\".He added: \"While the court dismissed the defamation related claims, the court has invited us to amend four out of the seven claims against Ms Lively, which will showcase additional evidence and refined allegations.\"However, those amended claims were not filed, according to the latest ruling. Baldoni and Wayfarer have not commented.ReutersJustin Baldoni directed and starred in It Ends With Us, based on the Colleen Hoover novelIn June, Judge Liman explained that Baldoni's lawsuit centred on two claims: that Lively \"stole the film\" from him and his production company Wayfarer by threatening not to promote it, and that she and others promoted a false narrative that Baldoni sexually assaulted her and launched a smear campaign against her.But Baldoni and his production company \"have not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion rather than legally permissible hard bargaining or renegotiation of working conditions\", Judge Liman wrote at that time.Additionally, the judge wrote, Baldoni and his company did not prove defamation because the \"Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements\" in her lawsuit, which are privileged.The judge also determined that evidence did not show that the New York Times \"acted with actual malice\" in publishing their story, dismissing that $250m suit as well.\"The alleged facts indicate that the Times reviewed the available evidence and reported, perhaps in a dramatised manner, what it believed to have happened,\" he wrote. \"The Times had no obvious motive to favour Lively's version of events.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoTiffany Wertheimer and Katy Watson,Australia correspondent, SydneyAFP via Getty ImagesErin Patterson is serving one of the longest ever jail terms given to a female offender in Australia - life in prisonErin Patterson, the Australian serving life for the mushroom murders,  has officially lodged an appeal against her convictions.The 51-year-old was found guilty of murdering three relatives and trying to kill another with a toxic mushroom meal at her home in the state of Victoria in 2023.Under Australian law, appeals are not an automatic right, and Patterson's legal team had to convince the Court of Appeal that there might have been legal errors in her trial.Patterson's appeal was officially lodged on Monday, after the court gave her lawyers the green light to challenge the convictions. The grounds of the appeal have not yet been disclosed.Throughout the 11-week trial, Patterson maintained her innocence, arguing that it had all been a terrible accident, and she had not intentionally included toxic mushrooms in the beef Wellington meal she cooked and served for lunch.Her in-laws Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, died after eating the meal. Heather's husband Ian Wilkinson, a local pastor, survived after recovering from a coma, and still has ongoing health issues related to the poisoning.After seven days of deliberations, the panel of 12 jurors delivered their unanimous decision - guilty on all charges.Nine weeks of evidence that gripped a courtroomTrue crime fans obsessed with mushroom killerShe was handed one of the longest ever jail terms given to a female offender in Australia - life in prison, with no chance of release for at least 33 years. That means Patterson will be in her 80s before she can apply for parole.Now she will have the chance to challenge the jury's conviction.The 28-day window to lodge an appeal expired on 6 October, however a new procedural rule, giving legal teams an extension without needing to explain why, gave her lawyers more time to lodge the paperwork.Last month, prosecutors filed their own appeal against the sentencing, saying it was \"manifestly inadequate\".Watch: Police release interview with Australian mushroom murdererThere was intense public interest in the toxic mushroom case, and a media frenzy swirled around the small courtroom in the country town of Morwell during the trial.Over nine weeks of testimony, the jury heard evidence suggesting Patterson had foraged death cap mushrooms in nearby towns and lured her victims to the fatal meal under the false pretence that she had cancer - before trying to conceal her crimes by lying to police and disposing of evidence.Her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, had also been invited to the lunch but cancelled at the last minute, in part due to his belief that his wife had been trying to poison him for years.Following the trial, it was revealed that he had become so violently ill after eating several of her meals in the past that he had been in a coma, a large part of his bowel had been surgically removed, and his family had been told to say goodbye to him twice as he was not expected to survive.Patterson is currently in a female maximum security prison - the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in Melbourne. During her sentencing, Justice Christopher Beale told the court she spent 22 hours a day in her cell, with no contact with other inmates due to her \"major offender status\".The judge noted that Patterson's reputation and the huge media and public interest in the case meant she would likely \"remain a notorious prisoner for many years to come, and, as such, remain at significant risk from other prisoners\".Erin Patterson separated from her husband Simon in 2015",

    "body": "5 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterRental payments will be reflected in credit scores, one of the UK's main credit ratings agencies has said. Experian said it was overhauling its scoring system to better reflect \"more of the everyday financial behaviours that matter\" which included things \"like paying rent or reducing overdraft use\". The new system will see the maximum credit score someone can have go from 999 to 1,250, and will also give more guidance on how borrowers can improve their creditworthiness. Credit scores are used as a broad indicator of a borrower's ability to pay back a loan. A low credit score can make it more difficult to take out a mortgage, get a loan, or enter into a hire purchase agreement on a car. Names of Experian's different scoring bands have also been overhauled, with the categories \"poor\" and \"very poor\" eliminated, as well as the use of the colour red.  The bands will now be named Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair and Low. For customers in the low band, instructions are given on how they can increase their score. The new scoring system will begin being rolled out this month, with a view to making it available to all customers by the end of the year, and will be available on the free version of Experian's service. A spokesperson for Experian said tenants would have to opt in for their rent payments to count. \"As with other data we'll soon be including in the updated score, this reflects that more lenders are now factoring in a positive rent history in their decisions,\" they said. \"Great news for renters who are paying on time, every month.\"They added that missing rent payments would have an adverse effect on someone's credit score. Other behaviours the new system is taking into account are cutting overdraft use, avoiding credit card advances and making mortgage overpayments. It will also take a more detailed look at regular payments on mobile phone contracts and how often a customer may switch provider.Experian stressed the changes would not affect someone's ability to get credit, while eligibility for mortgages, loans or credit cards remains unchanged.However, the changes mean that borrowers are likely to change the credit bands they are in. The new system means 44% of customers are likely to drop down a score band after the changes, 42% are likely to move up a band, while 14% will see their score band remain the same, Experian said.In the UK, there are three credit ratings agencies, the other two being TransUnion and Equifax - neither of whom have changed how they score credit.

    "body": "Nearly a quarter of Labour MPs have signed a petition urging the chancellor to hike taxes on gambling companies and use the money to lift benefit restrictions on families with more than two children.The campaign - which has the backing of 101 Labour MPs - says a levy on gambling could raise £3bn which could lift half a million children out of poverty.Rachel Reeves has come under pressure from her own party, including former prime minister Gordon Brown, to scrap the two-child benefit cap when she sets out her Budget on 26 November.The UK's Betting and Gaming Council has said raising taxes on the industry could see billions wiped off the economy, and thousands of job losses.Writing on the Politics Home website, head of the council Grainne Hurst said large tax rises would \"drive customers towards the unsafe, unregulated black market where there are no safer gambling standards, no age verification, and no tax receipts for the exchequer\".Almost immediately after winning the 2024 general election, the Labour government faced calls from its own MPs to lift the cap, which restricts child tax credit and universal credit (UC) to the first two children in most households.At the time, the government argued it did not have enough money to remove the cap but set up the Child Poverty Taskforce to consider measures to alleviate child poverty. The taskforce had been due to produce its conclusions in the spring, but publication has been delayed.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has strongly opposed lifting the cap arguing that taxpayers \"many of whom are struggling to raise their own children or choosing not to have them in the first place\" should not have to \"fund unlimited child support for others\".However senior voices in the Labour party have continued to push for a change  including Treasury select committee chair Dame Meg Hillier, who argued it was \"the only way we'll lift children out of poverty in this parliament\".The chancellor is facing a £20bn gap in meeting her tax and spending rules and may be wary of committing the £3.5bn experts have said lifting the cap would cost. She has already hinted that she is considering tax rises and spending cuts to give herself financial breathing room.The government is currently consulting on plans to merge different betting taxes from October 2027 in a bid to adapt the system to the era of online gambling.The Social Media Foundation think tank has argued against merging taxes and instead suggested that \"higher rates which are more harmful and contribute less to the British economy, such as online slots, should be taxed more\".\"Sectors which are less harmful and provide more to the economy such as traditional horse racing betting, should be taxed less,\" it said.Gordon Brown has backed proposals from the IPPR think tank that taxes on online gambling should be raised from 21% to 50%. The IPPR has also said taxes on slot machines should rise from 20% to 50% and levies on non-racing bets should be increased from 15% to 25%. ",

    "body": "25 minutes agoJennifer MeierhansBusiness reporterPA MediaThere will be increased visible patrols at mainline stations over the coming days, the Transport Secretary saidThere will be a review of rail security in the UK following a mass stabbing on a train, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has said.A man has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder after the knife attack on a Doncaster to London service on Saturday night.Alexander told the BBC the government would \"review security arrangements\" and respond \"swiftly and in a proportionate way\".But she did not think airport scanning technology \"is the right solution for stations in the UK\".Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is expected to make a statement about the attack to MPs in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon.Questions about passenger safety on the UK's rail network have been raised after a a black British national, who boarded a train at Peterborough station, attacked passengers with a knife.Eleven people were treated in hospital including a member of train staff who is said to be in a \"critical but stable condition\".Anthony Williams, 32, from Peterborough has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of a bladed article, British Transport Police (BTP) said on Monday morning.Follow live updates on this storyWhat do we know about man charged over train stabbings?Alexander told BBC Breakfast that BTP officers would increase visible patrols at mainline stations over the coming days \"because I do understand that people will want to feel reassured following what happened\".\"Thankfully incidents like this on the public transport network are very, very rare,\" she added.She said the rail network in the UK was a \"low crime environment\" and for every one million passenger journeys only 27 crimes were committed.Asked what steps the government would take to improve security on trains, she said: \"We are investing in improved CCTV in stations and the Home Office will soon be launching a consultation on more facial recognition technology which could be deployed in stations as well.\"Asked about luggage scanners similar to those used in some major train stations abroad she said: \"At the moment that type of airport scanning technology I don't think is the right solution for stations in the UK.\"'Real concerns'Andy Trotter, former British Transport Police Chief Constable told BBC Breakfast Saturday's attack illustrates \"people's real concerns about being trapped with an offender or with someone causing disorder\".\"I hope this results in a broader review of security, the need for more British Transport Police, the need for more security from the rail companies themselves.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was calling for \"a dramatic increase in the use of stop and search to take knives off the streets and potentially prevent attacks like the one was saw on the train\".When asked for what reason the suspect in Saturday's stabbing should have been stopped and searched before boarding the train when only his age, gender and ethnicity was known, he said \"it would depend if there was an indication of suspicion\".\"But in high crime hot-spot areas there should actually be stop and search undertaken without suspicion,\" he added.Asked if he was suggesting the man should have been stopped and searched purely based on the colour of his skin he said \"categorically not I am absolutely not saying that\".The Conservative government in 2024 described laws on knife crime in England and Wales as \"already among the toughest in the world\".Challenged on why these same laws were no longer good enough, he said: \"We need to go further with tougher knife crime laws, with more stop and search, and the use of technology like live facial recognition to identify wanted criminals and dangerous people so they can be arrested.\"Senior Reform UK politician Zia Yusuf on Sunday said he would not like to see increased security at train stations.He told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme it would impose \"enormous friction\" on the lives of law-abiding people \"as a result of the actions of a tiny minority\".He argued for a significant increase in the use of stop-and-search powers \"to saturation\", saying this would remove deadly weapons from circulation. There is no single knife crime statistics publication in the UK but as far as England and Wales goes, police recorded 51,527 offences across both nations in the year to June 2025, according to the latest figures, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).However, these figures show knife crime is falling by 5% compared with the same period last year and 7% compared with five years ago. Homicides involving a knife also fell by nearly a fifth in the latest year to 196 offences, compared with 239 the year before.",

    "body": "12 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC News Getty ImagesWe all think we know how to brush our teeth - a scrub morning and night, a rinse with water and maybe a minty mouthwash for good measure.But according to dental experts, even the most diligent brushers might be making a few mistakes that could be undoing their good work.Dr Praveen Sharma, from the school of dentistry at the University of Birmingham, says that half of adults in the UK will have gum disease at some point and an early sign is bleeding gums.\"If your gums are bleeding or swollen it's a sign you need to brush better,\" he says. As well as regular dentist visits, here are four things he and BBC's What's Up Docs podcast hosts Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, say many of us are currently getting wrong which if we change could improve the health of our teeth.1. Brushing once well is better than twice quicklyIt's one of the great dental commandments - brushing twice a day - and that's what the NHS recommends.But Dr Sharma says the real key is quality, not quantity.\"If you can find time, then yes, twice a day,\" he says. \"But it's better to do it once a day well rather than twice quickly.\"If you are brushing once a day then he recommends it be in the evening and make sure you also floss.Of course, no one likes flossing, but Dr Sharma says using interdental brushes, particularly rubber ones, can make it easier and less painful. When it comes to the method, each tooth has an outer, biting and inner surface and all three need to be brushed. Dr Sharma advises small circular motions over each surface without applying too much pressure. He also says to pay particular attention to the junction between the tooth and the gum as that's where gum disease can occur.Dr Xand says it's important to \"focus on the sensation of the bristles\" and approach tooth brushing mindfully, not scrolling on your phone at the same time.2. Brush before breakfast, not afterMany people brush their teeth right after eating, but that might not be doing your enamel any favours.\"Ideally, brush before breakfast,\" Dr Sharma says. \"You don't want to do it after something acidic. \"If you do brush after, then you need to leave some space between eating and brushing.\"That's because acids from foods and drinks, especially fruit juice or coffee, can soften tooth enamel and brushing too soon afterwards can wear it away.Dr Chris suggests rinsing your mouth with water after eating to get rid of some acid and then waiting at least 30 minutes if you are brushing after breakfast. 3. Don't rinse after brushingIf you've been spitting, rinsing and gargling after every brush, you might want to rethink that last step.\"You spit but don't rinse,\" Dr Sharma advises. Rinsing your mouth washes away the concentrated fluoride in the remaining toothpaste.That means simply spitting out the excess toothpaste and leaving the thin layer of fluoride behind to continue protecting your teeth.4. Expensive toothpaste isn't betterWith shelves full of whitening, charcoal, and enamel-boosting pastes, it's easy to assume the pricier options will give you a healthier smile. But according to Dr Sharma, it doesn't really matter which brand you choose, as long as it contains one key ingredient.\"As long as your toothpaste has fluoride, it doesn't make much difference,\" he says, adding that he tends to buy whatever is cheaper or on offer. Fluoride helps protect enamel and prevents decay, and that's what really counts.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

She answered \"yes\".Throughout the hearing she kept looking at her mother and exchanging smiles, until she was let free from the court and the pair, both crying with happiness, embraced.ReutersMiss Culley, who is eight months pregnant, left court with her mother Lyanne KennedyLawyers representing the teenager have been locked in negotiations with judicial authorities in Georgia, with details expected to be released later.Her family had recently paid £137,000 to reduce her sentence to two years.Miss Culley previously pleaded guilty to bringing drugs into Georgia, flying from Thailand via Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.But said she was forced to do so by gangsters who tortured her with hot iron.She had initially gone missing while travelling in Thailand and her lawyer said Georgian police had launched a separate criminal investigation into her coercion allegations.At a previous hearing, she told the court: \"I just wanted to travel.\"I am a good person. I am a student at university. I am a clean person. I don't do drugs.\"Miss Culley had been held in pre-trial detention since May, first in stark conditions in Georgia's Rustavi Prison Number Five before being transferred to a \"mother and baby\" unit.Mr Salakaia said he planned to appeal to the president of Georgia to pardon her after finalising the plea deal.More on this story",

    "body": "5 hours agoDearbail Jordan and David GrittenReuters/Hostages and Missing Families ForumCol Asaf Hamami, Staff Sgt Oz Daniel and Capt Omer Neutra were killed during the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on IsraelIsrael has confirmed the identities of three deceased hostages whose bodies it received from Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza on Sunday.Forensic tests showed the remains were those of Israeli soldiers Col Asaf Hamami, 40, Capt Omer Neutra, 21, and Staff Sgt Oz Daniel, 19, the prime minister's office said.The confirmation means eight dead Israeli and foreign hostages are still in Gaza.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel that started more than three weeks ago, Hamas agreed to return all 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on any of the substantive issues in the second phase of the ceasefire deal, including plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and how to organise the reconstruction of a territory left devastated by two years of war.Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, handed over the remains of the three hostages to the Red Cross on Sunday night after saying they had been found \"along the route of one of the tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip\".The bodies were transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza before being transported to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.On Monday morning, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that the remains belonged to Col Hamami, Capt Neutra and Staff Sgt Daniel.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Hamami, Neutra and Daniel families, and all the families of the deceased hostages,\" a statement said.\"The Hamas terrorist organisation is required to uphold its commitments to the mediators and return them as part of the implementation of the agreement. We will not compromise on this and will spare no effort until we return all of the hostages, every last one of them,\" it added.Col Hamami was commander of the Southern Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Gaza Division. The IDF said the father-of-three was among the first troops to reach the combat zones following the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and was \"the first to declare war\". He was killed fighting near Kibbutz Nirim and his body was then taken to Gaza by Hamas as a hostage, it added.Capt Neutra, an Israeli-American dual national who was born in the US and emigrated to Israel, was serving as a platoon commander in the IDF's 7th Brigade. The IDF said he was killed in battle near the Gaza perimeter and that his body was abducted by Hamas.Staff Sgt Daniel was serving in the IDF's 7th Armoured Brigade. He was also killed during a battle with Hamas gunmen near the Gaza perimeter and his body was taken by them as a hostage, according to the IDF.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel, which represents many hostages' relatives, said it \"bows its head in sorrow and shares in the profound grief\" of the three men's families.\"There are no words to express the depth of this pain. The hostages have no time. We must bring them all home, now!\"EPA/ShutterstockHamas has denied Israeli accusations that it is delaying the recovery of the remaining hostages' bodiesHamas and Israel have accused each other of repeated violations of the ceasefire since it took effect on 10 October.On Sunday, an Israeli air strike killed a man in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control, and was posing a threat to its troops.Under the deal, Hamas agreed to return all the hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has so far handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 18 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Six of the eight dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKoh Ewe and Mahfouz Zubaide,BBC ProducerAfghans dig through rubble after earthquake destroys housesAt least 20 people have died after an earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, local authorities say, with the toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continue. Hundreds have also been left injured, local officials told the BBC.The earthquake struck near Mazar-e-Sharif, one of the country's largest cities that is home to about 500,000 people, at around 01:00 local time on Monday, (20:30 GMT on Sunday).It had a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 28km (17 miles), according to the US Geological Survey, and was marked at the orange alert level, which indicates \"significant casualties\" are likely. More than 530 people have been injured, according to the Taliban government health ministry.Provincial officials earlier told the BBC that casualties were likely to rise as rescue efforts continued.Getty ImagesAuthorities expect the death toll to rise as search and rescue efforts continueHaji Zaid, a Taliban spokesman in Balkh province wrote earlier on X that \"many people are injured\" in the Sholgara district, south of Mazar-e- Sharif. He said they had received \"reports of minor injuries and superficial damages from all districts of the province\". \"Most of the injuries were caused by people falling from tall buildings,\" he wrote.Many of Mazar-e Sharif's residents rushed to the streets when the quake struck, as they feared their houses would collapse, AFP news agency reported.The quake led to a power outage across the country including in the capital city Kabul, after electricity lines from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan - major suppliers of power to Afghanistan - were damaged. The Taliban spokesman in Balkh also posted a video on X appearing to show debris strewn across the ground at the Blue Mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif, revered by Shia Muslims.The mosque, built in the 15th Century, is believed to house the tomb of the first Shia Imam, the son-in-law and cousin of Prophet Mohamad. It is now a site where pilgrims gather to pray and celebrate religious events.Khalid Zadran, a Taliban spokesman for the police in Kabul, wrote on X that police are \"closely monitoring the situation\". Numerous fatalities were also reported in Samangan, a mountainous province near Mazar-e-Sharif, according to its spokesman. The quake on Monday comes after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan's mountainous eastern region in late August, killing more than 1,100 people.That earthquake was especially deadly as the rural houses in the region were typically made of mud and timber. Residents were trapped when their houses collapsed during the quake.Afghanistan is very prone to earthquakes because of its location on top of a number of fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.Poor communication networks and infrastructure - buildings there are not earthquake-resistant, for example - have often hampered rescue efforts following disasters like this.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSebastian UsherJerusalemIDFMajor General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned on Friday, admitting her role in leaking the videoThe former top lawyer in the Israeli military has been arrested, as a political showdown deepens over the leaking of a video that allegedly shows severe abuse of a Palestinian detainee by Israeli soldiers.Maj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned as the Military Advocate General of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last week, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak.On Sunday, the story took a darker turn when she was reported as missing, with police mounting an hours-long search for her on a beach north of Tel Aviv.She was subsequently found alive and well, police said, but was then taken into custody.The fallout from the leaked video is intensifying by the day.Broadcast in August 2024 on an Israeli news channel, the footage shows reserve soldiers at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel taking aside a detainee, then surrounding him with riot shields to block visibility while he was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object.The detainee was subsequently treated for severe injuries.Five reservists were subsequently charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee. They have denied the charges have not been named.On Sunday, four of the reservists wore black balaclavas to hide their faces as they appeared at a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Jerusalem along with their lawyers, who demanded the dismissal of their trial.Adi Keidar, a lawyer from the right-wing legal aid organisation Honenu, claimed his clients were subject to \"to a faulty, biased and completely cooked-up legal process\".Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe leaked surveillance video was filmed at the Sde Teiman military base in southern IsraelLast week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leaking of the video.Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was put on leave while the inquiry took place.On Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said she would not be allowed to return to her post.Shortly after that, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned.In her resignation letter, she said she took full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from the unit.\"I approved the release of material to the media in an attempt to counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities,\" she said.That is a reference to efforts by some right-wing political figures in Israel to claim that the allegations of severe abuse of the Palestinian detainee had been fabricated.She added: \"It is our duty to investigate whenever there is reasonable suspicion of acts of violence against a detainee.\"After her resignation, Katz issued a fierce condemnation of her conduct.\"Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army's uniform,\" he said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed his defence minister's words on Sunday, saying that the incident at Sde Teiman was \"perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the State of Israel has experienced since its establishment\".Hours later, the first reports began appearing in the Israeli media that Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was missing, sparking fears that a political scandal had taken a turn towards tragedy.A massive search effort was launched. Several hours later, she was found \"safe and in good health\" in the coastal area of Herzliya, Israeli police said.Overnight, a police spokesperson announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of \"leaking and other serious criminal offences\" as part of an investigation.Israeli media reported that the pair were Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi and the former chief military prosecutor, Col Matan Solomosh.ReutersIsraeli forces mounted an hours-long search for Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi when she went missing on SundayThe Sde Teiman incident has been a lightning rod for the division between the left and right in Israel.On the right, the leaking of the video is denounced as a defamation of the Israeli military, all but amounting to an act of treason.After Israeli military police went to Sde Teiman to question 11 reservists over the incident in July 2024, far-right protesters - including at least three lawmakers from Netanyahu's governing coalition - broke into the facility to show their support.On the left, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi's decision to enable the footage to be released is seen as the one time she lived up to the responsibilities of her post.The video is regarded by the left as concrete evidence backing up multiple reports of abuse of Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.Last October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been \"subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence\".Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was \"fully committed to international legal standards\". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint.",

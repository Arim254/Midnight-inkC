    "body": "Chris Rea: The car enthusiast whose love of driving inspired his songs13 hours agoEmma PetrieGetty ImagesChris Rea: \"Most of the songs are different people's love stories inside cars\"Rock and blues singer Chris Rea spent countless hours on the road, and his love of cars and driving was the inspiration behind many of his songs. He recorded 25 solo albums, two of which topped the UK albums chart. His distinctive gravelly voice and slide guitar-playing are preserved in songs such as Road to Hell, Auberge, On the Beach and Driving Home for Christmas.Christopher Anton Rea was born in Middlesbrough in the north-east of England in 1951 to an Italian father and Irish mother and was one of seven children. The family was known locally for Camillo's Ice cream factory and cafes, owned by his father Camillo Rea.Driving Home for Christmas singer Chris Rea dies aged 74Chris worked in the cafes as a teenager and took his driving test in one of his dad's ice cream vans. When he was asked to do an emergency stop, the examiner fell off the box he was sitting on and cut his leg. Rea said: \"I had to take him to the hospital but he still passed me.\"He was still working for his father when he bought his first guitar, a 1961 Hofner V3 in his early 20s.Rea said that at the time he was \"meant to be developing my father's ice cream cafe into a global concern, but I spent all my time in the stockroom playing slide guitar\".Getty ImagesChris Rea: \"The road always becomes a metaphor for where we are going in life.\"He played with local groups The Elastic Band, and Magdalene, but it was The Beautiful Losers which shone the spotlight on Rea, and he secured a solo recording deal with Magnet Records.His first studio album was Whatever Happened to Benny Santini?, released in 1978. The lead single, Fool (If You Think It's Over), was a big hit in the US, reaching number one on the (adult) contemporary singles Billboard chart, earning him a best new artist  nomination at the Grammy Awards.Michael Levey, co-founder of Magnet records, remembers him as \"more of a thoughtful, introspective poet than a natural pop performer\".One of Rea's childhood dreams had been to write and compose music for films. He achieved both with his movie La Passione in 1996. Rea also wrote the score and title track for the Soft Top Hard Shoulder film and starred in the comedy Parting Shots in 1999.Getty Images\"Music and cars fit together very well\" Rea explainedRea was building a reputation for his slide guitar playing when his record company insisted on releasing Driving Home for Christmas in 1986. He said: \"I didn't need a Christmas song hanging around at that point. I did everything I could to get them not to release that record. Thankfully they did!\"The song's inspiration dates back to a difficult year for him personally.  In 1978 Rea had come to the end of his record contract and had parted ways with his manager. The record company wouldn't pay for a train ticket for him to get from London to his home to Middlesbrough so his wife drove down to pick him up in her old Austin Mini.On the way back up, it started snowing and they kept getting stuck in traffic and Rea said: \"I'd look across at the other drivers, who all looked so miserable. \"Jokingly, I started singing - We're driving home for Christmas... then, whenever the street lights shone inside the car, I started writing down the lyrics.\"Getty ImagesRea began learning to play guitar at the age of 21\"It's one of those moments that songwriters get - sometimes you can spend years and years writing. That one was five to 10 minutes. When you have a successful song, you don't remember thinking about it - it just comes out.\"He didn't sing the song live until December 2014 after his crew badgered him to do it. He hired 12 snow cannons and let them off during the song.\"We put three feet of artificial snow in the stalls. The venue charged me £12,000 to clean it up!\"Getty ImagesRea released his first solo album in 1978Bad traffic on the intersection between the M4 and the M25 was also the inspiration for Road to Hell.Rea's musical journey was brought to a temporary stop when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer aged 33.He had a procedure which resulted in the removal of part of his pancreas, the duodenum, the gall bladder and part of his liver. He was also a type 1 diabetic and had problems with his kidney.His health problems made him reassess his career - he never toured America despite his popularity.  \"I was never a rock star or pop star and all the illness has been my chance to do what I'd always wanted to do with music,\" he said.In 1997, that included recording Let's Dance with his good friend Bob Mortimer for Middlesbrough Football Cub's FA Cup Final. In one of Mortimer's appearances on the BBC's comedy series Would I Lie to You, Mortimer claimed that Rea cracked an egg into a bath for him after they'd finished recording it at his studio. The clip about whether that was a truth or lie went viral.Rea was happy to admit that he was a vehicle addict with a huge love of cars, and travelling in them helped inspire some of his music. He owned and raced various vintage cars including a 1957 Morris Minor 1000 police car. He was friends with Eddie Jordan, owner of the Jordan Formula 1 team, and once helped out in the pit lane.\"I had the whole uniform. He put me in charge of the tyre-warmer for the rear right tyre of Eddie Irvine's car\".Getty ImagesRea on his European tour of Road Songs For Lovers in 2017In 2016 he suffered a stroke, but still recovered enough to record and tour his 24th album: Road Songs for Lovers.Rea said he spent an awful lot of time on the road travelling to London.  \"I see couples in cars - are they married, workmates, having an affair?\" he mused.The musician liked to write about the simple things in life: \"You get ideas for songs and you're actually on a road - the road always becomes a metaphor for where we're going in life,\" he once said.",

    "body": "Vince Zampella, who co-created the widely-popular video game series Call of Duty, has died in a car crash in California, aged 55. Zampella's death was confirmed by Electronic Arts, which owns Respawn Entertainment, a game studio he co-founded.The influential video game developer was travelling in a Ferrari with another person, when it crashed and caught fire on a highway in Los Angeles on Sunday. \"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,\" a spokesperson for Electronic Arts told the  BBC.Officials said the person on the vehicle's passenger seat was ejected while the driver remained trapped. It is unclear if Zampella was driving the car and who the other person inside was. Both people inside the vehicle died. \"For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,\" the California Highway Patrol said in a statement to the BBC. Zampella created Call of Duty with his long time collaborators Jason West and Grant Collier in 2003. Partly inspired by events in World War II, the game has sold more than 500 million copies making owners Microsoft's Activision one of the most profitable gaming companies. It has also spawned an upcoming live-action film.The Call of Duty franchise was not his only success. He was also behind other widely popular games including the Medal of Honor, Titanfall and Apex Legend.\"He really cared about the player experience, he cared about making games, he cared about how people felt when they played and that really came across whenever you spoke to him,\" Keza MacDonald, the Guardian's video games editor told BBC Newshour.In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which publishes the Call of Duty games, and the pair were subsequently locked in a long dispute with the company which they settled out of court in 2012.At Electronic Arts, Zampella worked on Battlefield 6, which is seen as a direct competitor to Call of Duty.Infinity Ward, the American company that developed Call of Duty, said Zampella \"will always have a special place in our history\".\"Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable,\" the company said in a statement on X.",

    "body": "2025 likely to be UK's hottest on record, says Met Office4 hours agoMark PoyntingClimate researcherEPAThis year is on course to be the UK's hottest since records began, according to the Met Office, as climate change continues to drive temperatures to new heights. With just over a week still to go, the average UK air temperature across 2025 is on track to end up at about 10.05C.A cooler Christmas could affect final figures, but it is likely that 2025 will edge out the current record of 10.03C from 2022, the Met Office says.Along with a lack of rainfall, the persistent warmth left the country vulnerable to droughts and wildfires through the spring and summer, with temperatures peaking at 35.8C. While temperatures vary naturally from year to year, scientists could not be clearer that human-caused climate change is driving the UK's rapidly warming trend.By the end of 2025, the UK's 10 warmest years on record will all have taken place in the last two decades, in measurements going back to the late 1800s.\"Anthropogenic [human-caused] climate change is causing the warming in the UK as it's causing the warming across the world,\" said Amy Doherty, a climate scientist at the Met Office.\"What we have seen in the past 40 years, and what we're going to continue to see, is more records broken, more extremely hot years [...] so what was normal 10 years ago, 20 years ago, will become [relatively] cool in the future,\" she told BBC News.The Met Office's projection uses observed temperatures up to 21 December and assumes that the remaining days of the year follow the long-term December average. As a result, the Met Office cannot say with certainty that 2025 will be the hottest year, but it is the most likely outcome. It would be the sixth time this century that the UK has set a new annual temperature record, following 2002, 2003, 2006, 2014 and 2022.\"In terms of our climate, we are living in extraordinary times,\" said Mike Kendon, also of the Met Office. \"The changes we are seeing are unprecedented in observational records back to the 19th Century,\" he added.The expected new record of 2025 has been built on persistent heat through the spring and summer.Those long, hot, sunny days may feel like a distant memory as we head towards Christmas, but both spring and summer were the UK's warmest ever recorded.Each month from March to August was more than 2C above the long-term average between 1961 and 1990.And while temperatures may not have reached the peaks of 40C seen in July 2022, hot spells happened repeatedly.Four separate - albeit relatively short-lived - heatwaves were declared across much of the country. The UK Health Security Agency also issued several heat-health alerts through the summer.Spring and summer were also marked by low rainfall. Spring was particularly dry - the UK's sixth driest since 1836. Combined with the warm weather helping to dry out the soils, this lack of rainfall pushed large parts of the country towards drought. Through the summer, official droughts were declared across several regions in England and Wales, by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales respectively. Parts of eastern Scotland also entered \"significant water scarcity\", according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.Recent rainfall has eased the situation across much of the country and most areas are no longer in official drought. But water levels are still below average in some places.\"There's a huge deficit to be made up, and there's a huge implication, not just for people who are farming the land [and] growing food, but our rivers, our aquifers, our availability of drinking water,\" said Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.The repeated swings between drought and flooding were making it very hard for communities to adapt to increasing weather extremes, she added.The prolonged dry, warm weather created ideal conditions for wildfires too.By late April, the area of the UK burned by wildfires had already reached a new annual record, according to data from the Global Wildfires Information System going back to 2012.More than 47,100 hectares (471 sq km or 182 sq miles) has now been burned throughout 2025 - smashing the previous high of 28,100 hectares of 2019.As the UK continues to heat up - driven by humanity's greenhouse gas emissions - scientists expect the UK to experience more weather extremes. \"The conditions that people are going to experience are going to continue to change as they have in the last few years [with] more wildfires, more droughts, more heatwaves,\" said Dr Doherty.\"But also it's going to get wetter in the winter half-year, so from October to March [...] the rain that does fall will fall more intensely, and in heavier rain showers, causing that kind of flooding that we've been seeing this year as well,\" she added.The UK has not been alone in experiencing extreme heat this year. The world is on course for its second or third warmest year ever recorded, according to the European Copernicus climate service.But the international consensus on tackling climate change is also being tested, with the US and some other leading producers of fossil fuels rowing back on their net zero commitments.

    "body": "Manchester United are still evaluating the full extent of the injury captain Bruno Fernandes sustained during the 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa.Manager Ruben Amorim thinks the midfielder is set for a spell on the sidelines - but will be hoping the damage is not too bad. Fernandes pulled up at the end of the first half and felt his hamstring, before continuing and coming off at the break.Any absence would be particularly notable given the Portuguese playmaker's remarkable availability record since joining from Sporting in January 2020.From his debut in a goalless draw against Wolves to the Villa defeat, United have played 221 Premier League games - and Fernandes has featured in 212, including 208 starts.Of the nine matches Fernandes has missed, two were because he was rested ahead of key European matches, including last season's defeat at Brentford in May. Four were because of suspension - so just three have been a result of injury or illness. His longest absence was two games in a row at the end of the 2023-24 campaign, but he still recovered before the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.The bad news for Amorim is United have lost the past four league games Fernandes has missed and five of the past six.While we still do not know how long Fernandes will be out, here are United's next seven games:26 December (20:00 GMT) v Newcastle (h)30 December (20:15 GMT) v Wolves (h)4 January (12:30 GMT) v Leeds (a)7 January (20:15 GMT) v Burnley (a)11 January (1630 GMT) v Brighton (h) - FA Cup third round17 January (12:30 GMT) v Man City (h)25 January (16:30 GMT) v Arsenal (a)So what are Amorim's options if his talisman is ruled out?Amorim has stressed all season Mainoo is in direct competition with Fernandes as they are most similar in styles. In theory, this is the chance for the 20-year-old to show his manager he has been wrong to leave him out so often. However, Amorim said Mainoo missed the defeat at Villa with a calf problem and was unlikely to be fit to face Newcastle. Conspiracy theorists had suggested Mainoo was left out as a result of the \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\" T-shirt his half-brother wore during the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.Yet this course of action would be to ignore Amorim's admission his own brother did something similar during his own career, which led to him having to apologise and distance himself from what had happened. Amorim has not said how long Mainoo will be out for.On the assumption veteran Brazil midfielder Casemiro, 33, will return from suspension against Newcastle, there is a chance Manuel Ugarte will partner him. Yet, like Mainoo and Fernandes, Ugarte and Casemiro have tended to compete for the same position. The last time the pair started together in the league was last season in a 0-0 draw against Manchester City in April. There is also an unhappy statistic to consider United have not won any of the past nine league games in which Uruguay midfielder Ugarte has started - a record beaten at the club only by Brazilian Kleberson. Lisandro Martinez replaced Fernandes at half-time at Villa Park. Primarily a defender, Amorim previously said he would only consider Martinez as a midfield option \"in an emergency\".This situation probably meets the criteria, and Martinez was arguably Amorim's most effective performer at Villa Park. Still, neither Ugarte nor Martinez have the creative qualities that would ideally fit in alongside Casemiro.When Mount arrived from Chelsea, Erik ten Hag felt he could operate as a number eight. Mount can create and playing him alongside Casemiro could offer Joshua Zirkzee a chance to fit in as a number 10. Amorim feels Mount is better in the number 10 role but, as with Martinez, needs must in an emergency. The England man has also played at wing-back, so the United head coach clearly admires his flexibility. The other key element is Mount is in form, having scored against Crystal Palace and Wolves recently.Fletcher made his debut at Villa Park and has the attributes Amorim needs. Like his dad Darren - the former United and Scotland midfielder - Fletcher has lots of energy. He also has a good passing range and has made big strides over the past few months. However, it would be asking a lot to put the 18-year-old England youth international into the cauldron of a Premier League game from the start.Since Amorim's arrival, he has attempted to get United playing his specific system, rarely straying away from his philosophy.By taking a system-first approach, Amorim looks for specific qualities from his players in each position, asking them to adapt to what he wants, rather than altering his system to fit the players at his disposal.Looking at his system and what he wants from his midfielders may help explain how he navigates the next few months.Amorim opts for a 3-2-4-1 shape that does not rely on having the majority of the ball.At the start of his tenure, Amorim looked to build-up short, but to his credit has opted to play long from the keeper more often - which suits the players he has. This requires players able to cover distance and win second balls.His side are asked to carry out passing routines too with patterns of play often ending in United's midfielders playing through-balls over the top for attackers running in behind.The midfield duo therefore need to be able to carry out these instructions.Amorim's preferred midfield duo of Casemiro and Fernandes provides clues to what he asks from his midfielders.Casemiro's role is more positionally strict - screening the defence, breaking up play and getting up and down the pitch to close the distance between defence and attack when the ball is played long.Fernandes is given licence to contribute in attack but, like Casemiro, has the ability to run hard up and down the pitch, getting back to defend when needed.Both players have a tendency to play direct passes into attackers running in behind whilst taking few touches in midfield - qualities that fit Amorim's tactical plan.The other midfield options must therefore fit into either Casemiro or Fernandes' roles, with Ugarte being the most likely back-up to Casemiro while Mount, Martinez and Mainoo possess some of the quality to do Fernandes' job.Given the constraints around the Africa Cup of Nations and United's injuries, the other option is for Amorim to tweak his system. This is not something he has done yet at Old Trafford, but - when asked about a shortage of wing-backs - he hinted he could, depending \"on the way we play in that particular week, if we have to change for a back four, we change for a back four\".The shortage of midfielders could force his hand in the same way.If United are to move to four at the back, with three in midfield, the obvious player to benefit would be Mainoo. The England man has struggled to displace either Casemiro or Fernandes given the specific tactical demands Amorim asks for in this system. And the United boss believes Mainoo's strengths and weaknesses are more suited to a midfield three.\"The problem is that we are playing with two [midfielders] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way to what I am seeing,\" he said.\"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two. But with three, Kobbie will have more minutes.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoAndy Verity,Financial investigations correspondent andEmma Simpson,Business correspondentThe Post Office and Fujitsu agreed a deal 19 years ago to fix transaction errors in sub-postmasters' accounts caused by bugs in the Horizon IT system, a document has revealed.An agreement was in place in 2006 for errors caused by bugs in the software to be corrected, or for Fujitsu to pay the Post Office up to £150 per transaction if it failed to do so.The revelation directly contradicts the Post Office's claims during criminal prosecutions - which led to hundreds of wrongful convictions and civil cases that destroyed livelihoods - that no bugs existed capable of causing accounting shortfalls.It also shows the Post Office knew almost two decades ago that Horizon could not always be relied upon to record transactions accurately.Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT system made it look like money was missing from branch accounts.Some sub-postmasters went to prison, while many more were financially ruined and lost their livelihoods. Others died.It has been described as the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history and has led to a long-running public inquiry into the scandal.Countless evidence and testimonies have been heard, examined and reported during the inquiry, but a document which emerged in material published this month contained new, previously unknown, information.The document shows that unbeknown to sub-postmasters, the two parties had a financial framework in place to manage discrepancies and for Fujitsu to fix problems or pay for them.The Post Office denied throughout the criminal trials of sub-postmasters that errors or bugs could cause transaction shortfalls in branch accounts. It also denied in court that branch accounts could be remotely altered without the knowledge of sub-postmasters.The document indicates the formal commercial arrangement was drawn up to deal with potential mismatches or \"discrepancies\" and where Fujitsu's system was responsible, it was expected to correct false transactions or pay \"liquidation damages\".The disclosure also undermines the Post Office's claim to the media and before Parliament in 2015 that it was not possible for Fujitsu to alter sub-postmasters's transactions without their knowledge.\"The Post Office conducted both the criminal trials of postmasters and the group litigation of 2019 on the basis that it knew of no substantial problems with the Horizon system,\" said Paul Marshall, senior barrister for sub-postmasters.\"Yet this shows that in 2006 there was a very big, recognised problem with Horizon maintaining data integrity between Post Office branch offices and Fujitsu,\" he added.\"The Post Office, for 20 years, was saying the only explanation for shortfalls in branch accounts was postmaster incompetence or dishonesty. \"But the maintenance of data integrity was fundamental to the Post Office-Fujitsu contract - Fujitsu were unable to provide or assure this.\"The document implicitly acknowledges that data held on Horizon's servers at Fujitsu's headquarters could fail to match the transactions sub-postmasters had carried out at their branches.It also adds to evidence that the Post Office was aware that the branch accounts of sub-postmasters could be remotely accessed. In the landmark Alan Bates vs Post Office case, for example, the organisation insisted that the software could not be accessed remotely by any other party.Under the arrangements set out in the document, Fujitsu agreed to carry out a \"reconciliation service\" with the Post Office's approval, where it was required to correct errors caused by bugs or defects or pay up to £150 per transaction in penalties known as \"liquidated damages\".The document is dated four months before the Post Office started legal action against sub-postmaster Lee Castleton OBE pursuing him to recover £25,000 of cash it alleged was missing from his branch in East Yorkshire.  He represented himself in court, arguing that problems with Horizon were to blame, but lost and was landed with £321,000 in legal costs and ended up bankrupt as a result.Mr Castleton is now suing the Post Office and Fujitsu for damages and said the document would help his battle.\"It's a disgusting document. It's another example of the truth being hidden for two decades. All the pain and punishment the victims have taken all these years and it was buried,\" he told the BBC.\"It makes me feel physically ill to think they were doing that and not telling anyone...it's time they were held accountable for all those actions.\"The document, first discovered by Post Office scandal campaigner Stuart Goodwillie, supports what whistleblower Richard Roll told BBC Panorama in 2015. The former Fujitsu worker said the team working on Horizon would sometimes correct thousands of transactions per night because the firm could be forced to pay cash to the Post Office if it failed to do so.The agreement also notes that Fujitsu can and will amend transactional data, with the need for the Post Office to approve the entries. A later version of the contract has been found where this stipulation has been changed to \"where this is possible\".The document is listed in an annexe in two corporate witness statements provided by Fujitsu's current European chief executive, Paul Patterson, in 2024 but has only recently been published.Mr Patterson will face questions by MPs on the Business and Trade Committee on 6 January about the Horizon scandal. Post Office chair Nigel Railton will also appear.The material document has shocked experts on the scandal such as Second Sight forensic accountant Ron Warmington, who described the document's implications as \"dynamite\".A Fujitsu spokesperson said: \"These matters are the subject of forensic investigation by the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry and it's not appropriate for us to comment while that process is ongoing.\"A Post Office spokesperson said: \"We apologise unequivocally for the hurt and suffering which Post Office caused to so many people during the Horizon IT Scandal.\"Today, our organisation is focused on working transparently with the ongoing public inquiry, paying full and fair financial redress to those impacted, and establishing a meaningful restorative justice programme, all of which are important elements of the ongoing transformation of Post Office.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoKwasi AsieduandOsmond ChiaThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy, according to pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.It is the first pill of its kind to receive approval from the regulator, marking a new era for weight-loss drugs.Wegovy's Danish makers Novo Nordisk said the once-daily pill was a \"convenient option\" to the injectable and would provide the same weight loss as the shot. It comes after Wegovy was approved by the FDA specifically for weight loss.Others like Ozempic, which has similar weight-loss effects, were primarily approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.The BBC has contacted the FDA for comment.The Wegovy pill showed an average weight loss of 16.6% during Novo Nordisk's trials, the firm said on Monday.A third of around 1,300 participants experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the same trial, it added.The pill is expected to be launched in the US in early January 2026.\"Patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy injection,\" said Mike Doustdar, the firm's chief executive.The pill version of Wegovy could give Novo Nordisk's sales a boost after a challenging year which saw its shares slide as it warned over its profits.The company has faced intense competition in the weight-loss market from rival drugmakers like Eli Lilly.Novo Nordisk's shares rose by almost 10% in after-hours trade in New York after the announcement.",

    "body": "Baby followed by BBC back in Gaza hospital after treatment abroad9 hours agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondentBBCSiwar Ashour spent six months in Jordan after being evacuated from GazaA one-year-old Palestinian girl evacuated from Gaza with severe nutritional problems is back in hospital in the territory after being returned there from Jordan. Siwar Ashour, whose story the BBC has followed for several months, was repatriated to Gaza on 3 December after completing her medical treatment in Amman.She'd spent six months in hospital there under a medical evacuation programme run by the Kingdom of Jordan. Her grandmother, Sahar Ashour, said she became ill three days after coming back.\"She started having diarrhoea and vomiting and her situation keeps getting worse. The diarrhoea won't go away,\" she told a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering Gaza independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago.Siwar is being treated at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza Strip where Dr Khalil al-Daqran told the BBC she is \"receiving the necessary treatment, but the situation is still bad for her\". The doctor said Siwar was suffering from a gastro-intestinal infection. She has an immune system deficiency which makes it hard for her to fight bacteria. She also struggles to absorb nutrition, meaning she requires specialised baby formula.Dr Khalil al-Daqran said poor hygiene conditions had disease to spreadDr Daqran said that hospitals in Gaza - many of which were badly damaged by Israeli bombing and fighting nearby with Hamas before a ceasefire took effect in October - were seeing an increase in child admissions. Poor hygiene conditions caused by the destruction of vital infrastructure have led to the spread of infections and disease.\"Since the ceasefire was announced, the number of child patients arriving at Gaza Strip hospitals is three times the capacity… The situation at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is no different from other hospitals in the Gaza Strip.\"It suffers from a severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies, and a major shortage regarding electric generators, which are the main artery to keep a hospital going.\"The World Health Organization (WHO) described humanitarian needs in Gaza as \"staggering, with current assistance addressing only the most basic survival requirements\".Siwar was evacuated to Jordan in June after the BBC reported on her case and raised it directly with the Jordanian authorities.Jordan's Minister of Communications, Dr Mohammed al-Momani, told us that Siwar was among 45 children returned to Gaza after completing their treatment. Under the evacuation scheme all patients are sent back after medical attention.I put it to Dr al-Momani that people might find it hard to accept that a child in such a vulnerable condition could be sent back to Gaza in the current conditions.\"No patient is sent back before they finish their medical treatment… the first reason [why they are returned] is that this will allow us to bring more patients from Gaza. We cannot take all of them at once. We have to take them in batches. So far we have taken 18 batches. \"The second reason is that we don't want to contribute in any shape or form to the displacement of Palestinians from their land and all patients are told… after treatment you are sent back so other patients and other children can be brought in for treatment.\"Dr Mohammed al-Momani says patients are sent back from Jordan after medical treatment to allow authorities to bring in new patients from GazaJordan also treats war wounded at its field hospital in Gaza and has supplied aid via air drops and road convoys. The kingdom hosts more than 2 million Palestinian refugees, who fled conflicts with Israel since 1948, and 500,000 refugees from other countries, mostly Syrians.Since last March some 300 sick and wounded children and 730 parents and guardians have been brought to Jordan out of 2000 scheduled for treatment. Other countries in the region like the United Arab Emirates and Turkey have treated thousands of sick civilians from Gaza.The specialised formula milk Siwar needs was either not available or in very short supply during the ongoing conflict. In March, Israel imposed a total blockade on aid into Gaza that was lifted partially after 11 weeks. Since the ceasefire there has been a surge in aid deliveries, although the UN and aid agencies say not enough humanitarian supplies are flowing.Siwar's family are trying to get her evacuated once more due to her conditionThe Jordanian authorities gave Siwar's family a supply of 12 cans of the hypoallergenic Neocate formula on their departure for Gaza. However her mother Najwa told us that Israeli officials confiscated much of what they'd been given -  nine of their 12 cans were taken. \"They told us, 'It is forbidden to take more than these cans,'\" said Siwar's mother, Najwa Ashour. \"Even though it is therapeutic milk and they said that treatment is allowed, yet they took them.\"She also said that extra clothing the family had been given in Jordan was taken. \"They searched us from top to bottom. When they saw us wearing clothes over each other [layered] they refused to let us out, and told us, 'You must take off all the clothes, down to one outfit.'\"I asked the Israeli government why the milk formula and clothing were confiscated? They replied that limits were placed on what could be taken back for \"security considerations.\"They said only minimal luggage was allowed and this had been conveyed to the Jordanian authorities and the returning families. \"In cases where the luggage exceeded the approved scope, its entry was denied.\"The WHO has appealed for more countries to offer medical evacuation to patients who cannot get the necessary treatment in Gaza.It has also called on the Israeli government to allow patients to be treated in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank \"which is the most time and cost effective route.\" Israel stopped allowing such evacuations after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.Cogat, the Israeli military bosy in charge of aid, said the process for Gazan residents' departure to third countries had been substantially eased.Siwar's family has been given Neocate milk formula since returning to Gaza. There have also been donations of money, including funds raised from online appeals. Jordanian representatives in Gaza have also visited the family to provide assistance.The Ashours are trying to have Siwar evacuated once more - a process that has begun with the issuing of a permit by Palestinian health officials. It will be managed by the WHO which deals with all evacuation requests from a place the UN calls \"a wasteland\". With additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh, Suha Kawar and Alice Doyard.",

Some of them basically live at the spa. \"We'll have fluid that comes up and [then] shower down, or trickle down, onto a component,\" says Jonathan Ballon, chief executive at liquid cooling firm Iceotope. \"Some things will get sprayed.\"In other cases, the industrious gizmos recline in circulating baths of fluid, which ferries away the heat they generate, enabling them to function at very high speeds, known as \"overclocking\".\"We have customers that are overclocking at all times because there is zero risk of burning out the server,\" says Mr Ballon. He adds that one client, a hotel chain in the US, is planning to use heat from hotel servers to warm guest rooms, the hotel laundry and swimming pool.Without cooling, data centres fall over.In November, a cooling system failure at a data centre in the US sent financial trading tech offline at CME Group, the world's largest exchange operator. The company has since put in place additional cooling capacity to help protect against a repeat of this incident.Currently, demand for data centres is booming, driven partly by the growth of AI technologies. But the huge amounts of energy and water that many of these facilities consume mean that they are increasingly controversial.More than 200 environmental groups in the US recently demanded a moratorium on new data centres in the country. But there are some data centre firms that say they want to reduce their impact.They have another incentive. Data centre computer chips are becoming increasingly powerful. So much so that many in the industry say traditional cooling methods – such as air cooling, where fans constantly blow air over the hottest components – is no longer sufficient for some operations.Mr Ballon is aware of rising controversy around the construction of energy-devouring data centres. \"Communities are pushing back on these projects,\" he says. \"We require significantly less power and water. We don't have any fans whatsoever – we operate silently.\"IceotopeIceotope says its tech can cut the cost of cooling by up to 80%Iceotope says its approach to liquid cooling, which can soothe multiple components in a data centre, not just the processing chips, may reduce cooling-related energy demands by up to 80%.The company's technology uses water to cool down the oil-based fluid that actually interacts with computer tech. But the water remains in a closed loop, so there is no need to continually draw more of it from local supplies.I ask whether the oil-based fluids in the firm's cooling system are derived from fossil fuel products and he says some of them are, though he stresses that none contain PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, which are harmful to human health.Some liquid-based data centre cooling technologies use refrigerants that do contain PFAS. Not only that, many refrigerants produce highly potent greenhouse gases, which threaten to exacerbate climate change.Two-phase cooling systems use such refrigerants says Yulin Wang, a former senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research firm. The refrigerant starts out as a liquid but heat from server components causes it to evaporate into a gas and this phase change soaks up a lot of energy, meaning it is an effective way of cooling things down.In some designs, data centre tech is fully immersed in large quantities of PFAS-containing refrigerant. \"Vapours can get out of the tank,\" adds Mr Wang. \"There could be some safety issues.\" In other cases, the refrigerant is piped directly to the hottest components, computer chips, only.Some companies that offer two-phase cooling are currently switching to PFAS-free refrigerants.Yulin WangYulin Wang warns of safety issues with some cooling chemicalsOver the years, firms have experimented with wildly different approaches to cooling, in a race to find the best means of keeping data centre gadgets happy.Microsoft famously sank a tube-like container full of servers into the sea off Orkney, for example. The idea was that cold Scottish seawater would improve the efficiency of air-based cooling systems inside the device.Last year, Microsoft confirmed that it had shuttered the project. But the company had learned much from it, says Alistair Speirs, general manager of global infrastructure in the Microsoft Azure business group. \"Without [human] operators, less things went wrong – that informed some of our operational procedures,\" he says. Data centres that are more hands-off appear more reliable.Initial findings showed the subsea data centre had a power usage effectiveness, or PUE, rating of 1.07 – suggesting it was far more efficient than the vast majority of land-based data centres. And it required zero water.But in the end, Microsoft concluded that the economics of building and maintaining subsea data centres weren't very favourable.The company is still working on liquid-based cooling ideas, including microfluidics, where tiny channels of liquid flow through the many layers of a silicon chip. \"You can think of a liquid cooling maze through the silicon at nanometre scale,\" says Mr Speirs.Researchers are coming up with other ideas, too.In July, Renkun Chen, at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues, published a paper detailing their idea for a pore-filled membrane-based cooling technology that could help to cool chips passively – without the need to actively pump fluids or blow air around.\"Essentially, you are using heat to provide the pumping power,\" says Prof Chen. He compares it to the process by which water evaporates from a trees' leaves, inducing a pumping effect that draws more water up through the plant's trunk and along its branches to replenish the leaves. Prof Chen says he hopes to commercialise the technology.New ways of cooling down data centre tech are increasingly sought-after, says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a machine learning company. This is partly due to demand for AI – including generative AI, or large language models (LLMs), which are the systems that power chat bots. In previous research, Dr Luccioni has shown that such technologies eat up lots of energy.\"If you have models that are very energy-intensive, then the cooling has to be stepped up a notch,\" she says.Reasoning models, which explain their output in multiple steps, are even more demanding, she adds.They use \"hundreds or thousands of times more energy\" than standard chat bots that just answer questions. Dr Luccioni calls for greater transparency from AI companies regarding how much energy their various products consume.For Mr Ballon, LLMs are just one form of AI – and he argues they have already \"reached their limit\" in terms of productivity.More Technology of Business",

    "body": "5 hours agoJames Landale,Diplomatic correspondentandRachel HaganWatch: BBC asks Trump what the new appointment to Greenland entailsDonald Trump has sparked a fresh row with Denmark after appointing a special envoy to Greenland, the vast Arctic island he has said he would like to annex.In response to a question from the BBC about the new role of Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana, Trump said the US needed Greenland for \"national protection\" and that \"we have to have it\".Landry, he said, would \"lead the charge\" as special envoy to Greenland, a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark.The move has angered Copenhagen, which said it would call the US ambassador for \"an explanation\". Greenland's prime minister said the island must \"decide our own future\" and its \"territorial integrity must be respected\".Gov Landry said in a post on X that it was an honour to serve in a \"volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US\".Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has revived his long-standing interest in Greenland, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth. He has refused to rule out using force to secure control of the island, a stance that has shocked Denmark, a Nato ally that has traditionally enjoyed close relations with Washington.\"We'll have to work that out,\" Trump added. \"We need Greenland for national security, not minerals.\"Trump specifically mentioned Chinese and Russian ships as potential threats in the nearby seas.Greenland, home to about 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.Watch: Trump's appointment of Greenland envoy sparks fresh row with DenmarkDenmark's Foreign Minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, described the appointment of Landry as \"deeply upsetting\" and warned Washington to respect Danish sovereignty.He told Danish broadcaster TV2: \"As long as we have a kingdom consisting of Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, we cannot accept actions that undermine our territorial integrity.\"Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the territory was willing to cooperate with the US and other countries, but only on the basis of mutual respect.He said: \"The appointment of a special envoy does not change anything for us. We decide our own future. Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected.\"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X that the EU stands in \"full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland\". Writing on social media earlier, the US president said Landry understood how \"essential Greenland is to our national security\" and would advance US interests.Getty ImagesUS President Donald Trump and Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry in a file photo in MarchThe significance of this appointment is both the US presumption that Greenland is separate to Denmark and the new appointee's assertion that he will help the island become part of the US. Envoys are informal appointments and unlike official diplomats, do not have to be approved by the host country.What this appointment shows is that Trump's ambition to control Greenland remains undimmed. As with his military and rhetorical aggression towards Venezuela, it indicates Trump is determined to gain greater control over what his recent National Security Strategy called \"the Western hemisphere\", a sphere of influence that he hopes will cover the whole of the Americas.Trump tried to buy Greenland during his first presidential term. Both Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"Landry has previously voiced his opinion on Greenland, writing on his personal X account in January: \"President Donald J. Trump is absolutely right! We need to ensure that Greenland joins the United States. GREAT for them, GREAT for us! Let's get it done!\"Landry is a military veteran and former police officer who was a US Congressman and Louisiana's attorney general before being elected governor in 2023.  He said his new role would not affect his duties as governor. The dispute over his appointment comes as strategic competition in the Arctic grows, with melting ice opening new shipping routes and increasing access to valuable mineral resources. Greenland is located in the Arctic between North America and Europe, which also makes it central to US and Nato security planning. ReutersThe US has maintained a base in Greenland since World War Two, after invading to establish military and radio stations across the territory after the Nazis occupied Denmark during the conflict.Vice-President JD Vance visited the base in March as he asked Greenland's people to \"cut a deal with the US\".The US reopened a consulate in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, in 2020 - during Trump's first term - after closing it in 1953. A number of European countries, as well as Canada, have honorary general consulates in Greenland.Additional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr in Mar-a-Lago",

    "body": "4 hours agoZoe ConwayNews CorrespondentFamily tells the BBC of the ongoing impact of botched insulationTony and Becs Wadley say they can't spend Christmas at home after insulation installed under a government scheme has caused black mould in several rooms, and their asthmatic son can't be inside the property.Mr Wadley says the situation is tearing the family apart: ''It's awful. Elliott can't come into our house, it's as if he's been ostracised from his own home.''The couple are among more than 300 people who have contacted the BBC in recent weeks to tell us about insulation that has gone wrong in their homes. The government has been contacted for commented. Becs WadleyBlack mould in one of the Wadley's bedrooms earlier this year. It spread under internal wall insulation which was installed in 2024.Mr and Mrs Wadley got a government grant to have energy efficiency measures fitted in their Gower Peninsula house because they hoped a warmer home would help Elliot's asthma. The grant covered the cost of insulating his bedroom walls.But months after the work was completed, the Wadleys discovered black mould was growing behind the insulation boards. It was removed by the installer and replaced with a new insulation system. But this also had to be removed along with all the plaster after it became damp. Elliott, 19, hasn't entered the house since April, instead staying with his grandmother during university breaks.''I miss him like you wouldn't believe',\" says Mrs Wadley.The family are going to stay with Mr Wadley's sister for Christmas so they can all be together.Billions of pounds of public money has been spent on insulating homes over the last 15 years. The Wadley's home was insulated under a government scheme known as ECO4.  In October, the National Audit Office (NAO) spending watchdog found that 29% of internal wall insulation carried out under ECO4 had been so poorly installed it needed to be repaired.It said there had been \"weak\" government oversight and regulatory ''failure''.In response to the NAO report, Energy Consumer Minister Martin McCluskey, said at the time: \"We are fixing the broken system by introducing comprehensive reforms to make this process clear and straightforward, and in the rare cases where things go wrong, there will be clear lines of accountability, so consumers are guaranteed to get any problems fixed quickly.\"Becs WadleyBecs and Tony Wadley with their three sons Felix, Freddie and Elliott.In the downstairs rooms of the Wadleys' home the insulation has also failed and has had to be removed. There is black mould on the walls while electric sockets hang loose with the wires exposed. The family says it has been in this condition for months. The installer, Stellar Energy, says it has ''no record of any immediate safety hazards being flagged.'' It says the descriptions of the exposed wires and sockets was \"highly inconsistent\" with their standard operating procedures, which required all such  work to be made safe.Building surveyor, David Walter, says the insulation wasn't fitted correctly and says the installer ''didn't understand what they were doing and what they were doing to the building which is why we've got these problems.''Stellar Energy told the BBC the design was ''technically correct for a stone house and was installed...in strict accordance with the mandatory technical specifications of ECO4.''Mr Wadley says he wouldn't have signed up for the grant if he'd known what would happen. ''You wouldn't put your family through this. Nobody would. Somebody needs to take responsibility.''Stellar Energy says it ''sincerely regrets any distress this situation has caused the family'' and says its priority is ''providing a final resolution to ensure the home meets the high standards'' it strives for.Scott Proudman had external wall insulation fitted to his family's home in 2021 under a government scheme. He is facing a £20,000 bill to get it replaced.Scott Proudman contacted the BBC about the botched external wall insulation fitted to his Bristol home in 2021.His family had been eligible for a government grant because of his eight-year-old daughter's disabilities. Born 24 weeks premature, she has cerebral palsy, a partial visual impairment and a shunt. She was recently diagnosed with autism.''I feel like a failure every time I come home because this was meant to be something to look after my family, to make life easier, and it hasn't,\" he says.When the work was done, insulation boards were fixed to the outside of the house and render was applied to make it waterproof.  But the render has been falling off for years.Scott ProudmanRender is falling off Scott Proudman's home. As a result, the insulation underneath it is no longer waterproof and damp and mould could grow inside the house.Building surveyor Mr Walter, says poor design and poor workmanship has caused the render to disintegrate. He says rainwater will very likely get under the cracked render and behind the insulation and will likely cause dampness inside.  ''It's like a timebomb. It's going to get worse and worse, affecting the inside of the property,\" he says.Mr Walter says all of the render and insulation will have to come off and will cost tens of thousands of pounds to put right.Right now the family is stuck with the repair bill because the installer, SPMS Wales, is being liquidated and Mr Proudman says they weren't given the required guarantee for the work. Trustmark, the organisation responsible for overseeing quality, says it can't help because the company lost its accreditation soon after the work was completed.Mr Proudman says he chose the company ''because it was on a government website and was Trustmark registered. I can't believe how few rights consumers have.''Brett Langdon, a director at SPMS Wales says he is ''very sorry the Proudmans have ended up in this situation'' and says all works ''were done to the manufactures specification.'' He says he gave a guarantee to the Proudmans but has told the BBC he can't remember who the guarantee is with. He says the delamination of the render was \"due to a failure of the system\".In a statement TrustMark said it was ''very sorry to hear about what's happened to Mr and Mrs Proudman and Mr and Mrs Wadley and the conditions both families' homes have been left in. It is totally unacceptable and we are in discussions with the relevant Scheme Providers and guarantee providers to help resolve these situations.'' And it said it underlined ''the need for reform to the current system''.",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA top Amazon executive has said the US technology giant has blocked more than 1,800 job applications from suspected North Korean agents.North Koreans tried to apply for remote working IT jobs using stolen or fake identities, Amazon's chief security officer Stephen Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post.\"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" he said, adding that this trend is likely to be happening at scale across the industry, especially in the US.Authorities in the US and South Korea have warned about Pyongyang's operatives carrying out online scams.Amazon has seen a nearly one-third increase in job applications from North Koreans in the past year, said Mr Schmidt in his post.He said the operatives typically work with people managing \"laptop farms\"  - referring to computers based in the US that are run remotely from outside of the country.The firm used a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and verification by its staff to screen job applications, he said.The strategies used by such fraudsters have become more sophisticated, Mr Schmidt said.Bad actors are hijacking dormant LinkedIn accounts using leaked credentials to gain verification. They target genuine software engineers to appear credible, he said, urging firms to report suspicious job applications to the authorities.Mr Schmidt warned employers to look out for indicators of fraudulent North Korean job applications, including incorrectly formatted phone numbers and mismatched education histories.In June, the US government said it had uncovered 29 \"laptop farms\" that were being operated illegally across the country by North Korean IT workers.They used stolen or forged identities of Americans to help North Korean nationals get jobs in the US, said the Department of Justice (DOJ).It also indicted US brokers who had helped secure jobs for the North Korean operatives.In July, a woman from Arizona was sentenced to more than eight years in jail for running a laptop farm to help North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at more than 300 US companies.The DOJ said the scheme generated more than $17m (£12.6m) in illicit gains for her and Pyongyang.",

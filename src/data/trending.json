    "body": "13 minutes agoBBCThere will be \"boots on the ground\" in Ukraine after the war, heralds the i Paper as the UK and France pledge military bases \"to keep peace\" in the event of a deal to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has celebrated the commitment as a \"huge step forward\".The Times echoes the Metro with \"boots on the ground in Ukraine\" in its main headline. The paper carries quotes from PM Keir Starmer saying an end to the conflict with Russia is \"closer than ever\". A photo of a dancing President Trump is splashed across the front page. The president claims deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro copied his moves before he was seized, the paper notes. The Guardian says European leaders have \"dramatically rallied together\" in support of Denmark over Greenland, as the Trump administration underlines its interest in acquiring the Arctic territory. The paper also says British and French troops posted to Ukraine after any future peace deal would be \"unlikely to engage directly with Russian forces should Moscow relaunch an invasion\".The Independent also leads with the possibility of British troops in Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, noting that US envoy Jared Kushner said Trump \"strongly, strongly, strongly\" supports the deal.The Sun leads with \"one for the road\" with the government set to propose tighter drink-driving limits in England and Wales, to bring them in line with Scotland. Lowering the threshold from its current 35mcg of alcohol per 100ml of breath to 22mcg would be the first change to the limit since 1967, the paper notes.\"Drink-drive changes to kill off rural pubs\" declares the Daily Telegraph. It says Labour is planning to cut the alcohol limit \"after raising taxes and minimum wage\". Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for the West Midlands Police Chief to resign following the banning of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a Birmingham football match.The Daily Mirror takes a different tack to the Telegraph, calling government plans to tighten alcohol limits part of a \"drive to safety\". The changes will \"cut crashes and save lives\", it says. Also on the Mirror's front, ex-Little Mix star Jesy Nelson's call for expanded testing of babies for a rare muscle condition has been praised by Health Secretary Wes Streeting.Following a car crash in which one teen died and another survived, police mixed up the fates of the two boys telling the wrong family about the death in a \"blunder to defy belief\", the Daily Mail writes. South Yorkshire Police realised their error when the badly injured survivor woke up and told them his name.Venezuela's oil output now faces collapse, the Financial Times says, as the US naval blockade \"chokes exports\". Two businessmen involved in the Wirecard fraud scandal have been handed the longest prison sentences connected to the case - one for 10 years and another for six and a half years.It is \"Groky horror show\" for Metro, after two cabinet ministers have become victims of deepfake sexualised images on X. Ofcom has said it is having \"urgent talks\" with the platform on the basis of \"serious concerns\".For the Daily Star \"Kaleb's true grit\" leads as Jeremy Clarkson's \"pal\" is \"on snow patrol\". The paper also hints at a \"secret Traitor exclusive\". The \"major snow storm blast\" approaching Britain also tops the Daily Express. Storm Goretti is a rare \"multi-hazard\" event of that will lash the nation with wind, snow and rain. Also on the front, there is \"fury over PM's plan to unpick our Brexit\", the paper declares.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "9 hours agoOlivia IrelandWatch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysThe Swiss bar that was the scene of a fire which killed 40 people and injured 116 had not undergone safety checks for five years, authorities have said.The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, told a Tuesday news conference that he could not explain why Le Constellation bar had not been checked in so long, but that the council was \"profoundly sorry\". The venues should have been checked annually.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019.Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: \"I have no answer for you today.\"\"We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families.\" \"I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to,\" he later added. Feraud said it would be \"down to the judges\" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors.ReutersPeople in the area have been leaving tributes to the victims of the deadly New Year's Day fireWhen the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate.Feraud said the maximum capacity was 200 people, with emergency exits designed to cater for 100 people on each side of its two levels. However he did not know if the exit on the basement level was working.Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers under criminal investigation, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. Swiss national broadcaster RTS has shown footage from 2019 of partygoers holding bottles with sparklers. An employee warns them to be careful of the \"mousse\" - the French word for the acoustics foam panelling. Questioned on the video, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images and he wished it had been brought to his attention at the time as he would have investigated. More on this storyFeraud said while inspections of the facility were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, there were none from 2020 to 2025. He told the press conference in 2015 the owners renovated the bar and it did not require a permit, which was when the sound insulation foam was stuck on the ceiling. \"There were never any checks on this soundproofing foam. Our security agents did not consider it necessary,\" Feraud said. Investigators will be assessing several elements, including the nature of the foam, compliance with standards for access and emergency exits in the basement. Accounts from reported scenes include that people pushed and shoved, notably on the staircase leading to the basement. Under Swiss regulations, doors are required to open in the direction of the exit and be clearly signposted. Under Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities. The Crans-Montana's failure to adhere to fire safety regulations by not inspecting Le  Constellation from 2020 to 2025 may point to a potential fault with the system. ",

Sarah's body was found later that evening, with police still searching for Grace.As Humberside Police released more details, James Dick OBE - the King's representative for the county - said: \"I am investigating the most appropriate way to recognise Mark Ratcliffe's selfless act of bravery\".Phillip Norton/BBCPolice continue their efforts to try to locate Grace Keeling Dick, the lord-lieutenant for the East Riding of Yorkshire, added: \"It is a very tragic situation where three people have lost their lives.\"My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of those involved and also to the community of Withernsea, which is feeling such a tragic loss.\"His office would be \"contacting people involved in the awards process to understand which award is the most appropriate\", he added.Mark was from Withernsea while Sarah and Grace were from Nottinghamshire, police said.Paying tribute, Mark's family previously described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".On Tuesday, Ch Insp Tom Stevens gave further details of the circumstances of the deaths.He said: \"From trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses who were in the area at the time, it is understood that Grace and her friend were on the steps near to the rocks when Grace is believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave.\"Grace's mum, Sarah, and three other members of the public who were nearby at the time, including Mark, immediately entered the water in an effort to save Grace.\"'Finding Grace is priority' Stevens said that two of those three who also entered the water in an attempt to assist with the rescue managed to exit safely.He added: \"Our priority now is to find Grace, and we are doing everything we can to locate her. This includes extensive searches along the shoreline and drone searches from Withernsea to Easington directed by our specialist search teams.\"Stevens said its underwater search unit had also been deployed and officers had consulted with an oceanographer.Both families continue to be supported by officers, Stevens said.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "2 hours agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentCampaigners for assisted dying will ask the House of Lords to sit late or start early in order to pass the legislation in time.Concern is growing among supporters of the bill that it won't pass all its parliamentary hurdles in the allotted days.A motion in the Lords asks peers to agree that \"further time should be provided for consideration of the bill\".Extending the usual Friday debates is one likely option but that would anger some Jewish peers because the weekly religious Shabbat ceremony begins at sunset.Lord Shinkwin, who is disabled, has also previously said that because of his travel arrangements, sitting later on a Friday would be a \"a feeble fig leaf for discrimination against me\".If the House of Lords agrees to the motion, private negotiations between peers would then begin over when and how much extra time would be granted.Any decision would require agreement from the different sides in the Lords.Sources close to those opposed to the bill have suggested they would not agree to extra time.Members of the House of Lords have proposed more than 1,000 amendments to the bill – which experts believe is a record number for a bill proposed by a backbench MP.Supporters believe this is a delaying tactic. They argue peers, who are not elected, should respect the will of the House of Commons which passed the bill last year.Critics deny they are deliberately stalling the bill. They believe the bill does not protect vulnerable people and needs significant changes before becoming law.It must complete all its parliamentary stages before the next King's Speech, which the BBC revealed is expected in early May.If it does not pass all its hurdles before then, the bill will fall.However those behind the bill believe rarely used powers to limit the Lords' ability to block legislation could bring the bill back for a second time.The Parliament Acts mean that a bill can become law without the approval of peers, if it is rejected by the House of Lords in two consecutive parliamentary sessions.However, this would rely on either the government offering its own parliamentary time for the bill, or an MP willing to bring an identical bill being drawn near the top of a ballot for Private Members Bills at the start of the new session.The effect would be to delay the bill's passage into law until 2027.A source close to Kim Leadbeater – the backbench MP who introduced the bill – said: \"This issue has to be resolved. The time has come for Parliament to decide its view. It is far better for that to be now than we have to go through it all again.\"Thursday's motion, tabled by the bill's lead backer Lord Charlie Falconer, says that \"in order to allow the House to complete its scrutiny of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and return it to the Commons in reasonable time before the end of the current parliamentary session, further time should be provided for consideration of the Bill.\"Supporters believe it will put pressure on peers to speed up their debates. But many, including the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, remain implacably opposed.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "13 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaThe US military action in Venezuela was the right thing to do \"morally\", Kemi Badenoch has said.The Conservative leader told the BBC that while she did not understand the legal basis for Donald Trump's operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from the country, he was overseeing a \"brutal regime\" and she was \"glad he's gone\".However, she added that the move did \"raise serious questions about the rules-based order\".The UK government has so far avoided criticising the US move or saying whether it breached international law, instead arguing that Maduro was an \"illegitimate president\".However, some Labour MPs and opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and SNP have called on the government to condemn Trump's actions and brand them illegal.Badenoch told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the US action was \"extraordinary\" but she understood why it was taken.\"Where the legal certainty is not yet clear, morally, I do think it was the right thing to do,\" she said.The Tory leader, who spent her childhood in Nigeria before moving back to the UK at the age of 16, added: \"I grew up under a military dictatorship, so I know what it's like to have someone like Maduro in charge.\"However, she said it was right to tell Trump not to intervene in Greenland because \"there is a big difference between democratic states\" and the \"gangster state in Venezuela\".\"What happens in Greenland is up to Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" she added.In recent days Trump has repeated his threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory which has a strategic location and is rich in minerals - arguing it is vital for US national security.The UK has issued a joint statement with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark insisting it is for Denmark and Greenland alone to decide on matters concerning the territory's future.Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast the UK's approach to Greenland was different to Venezuela as Denmark was a member of the Nato military alliance and it was not in the UK's national security interests to question the territory's future.Streeting also defended the prime minister's response to the developments in Venezuela, arguing he was acting in the UK's national interest, as well as the \"best interests of the people of Venezuela\".\"I appreciate there are others who have been more strident and have been more critical of the United States,\" he said.\"The prime minister has a different responsibility, and he is choosing his words carefully and wisely to try and influence how events unfold from here on.\"Critics of the government's approach, including Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have argued the US action risks emboldening Russia and China and that the UK should be clear the operation breached international law.In a statement in the House of Commons on Monday evening, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had reminded her US counterpart Marco Rubio of his obligations under international law.However, she reiterated the prime minister's position that it is for the US to set out the legal basis for its actions.Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife were seized from Caracas on Saturday in an operation by US forces which also saw strikes on military bases in the country.The pair have been taken to New York where they have been charged with weapon and drug offences, accused of enriching themselves from a violent crime ring smuggling cocaine to the US.Maduro has long rejected the allegations as a pretext to force him from power and both have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.Trump has vowed to \"run the country\" until there is a \"proper\" transition of power, with Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as interim president.",

    "body": "19 hours agoJeremy BallEast Midlands social affairs correspondentBBCJoan Scourfield forgave the man whose single punch caused her son's deathJoan Scourfield understands why people find it extraordinary to see her hugging the man who caused her son's death.James Hodgkinson never recovered from a serious head injury after he was punched to the ground in Nottingham.Now his mother, a nurse in Derby, campaigns with the man who threw that single punch in 2011.Her story of forgiveness in the face of a heartbreaking tragedy has become a sell-out theatre show in both London and New York.Joan ScourfieldJoan's son, James Hodgkinson, 28, was training to be a paramedic in SouthamptonJoan says James, 28, was a loving son who dreamt of becoming an ambulance paramedic and enjoyed adventure sports such as wakeboarding.\"His adrenaline for the sports was a big worry, people would say 'we'll do a fun run and raise money', he would do it in a sumo suit,\" she says.James lost his life after going to watch cricket in fancy dress, when England played a Test match at Trent Bridge in July 2011.His group went on to a city centre bar, where a drunken stranger took one of their pirate hats.James was punched in the mayhem that followed, and died nine days later.Jacob Dunne, then 19, from The Meadows in Nottingham, admitted manslaughter at Nottingham Crown Court.In November 2011, he was sentenced to 30 months in a young offender institution.\"People were getting more for stealing a television and all you get back is 'that was with intent',\" says Joan.\"I thought James's life was worth more... what justice had James got?\" Joan ScourfieldJames died from a head injury after a single punchBut 14 years on, Joan describes Jacob as a friend and sometimes meets him for lunch or coffee.They have joined forces to highlight the dangers of \"one-punch\" attacks and the benefits of what is known as restorative justice.Restorative justice is a voluntary opportunity for the victim and the offender to share with each other how the crime has affected them - which can be face-to-face, by writing, or through recorded interviews.That process offered Joan and her ex-husband, David, the opportunity to write to Jacob while he was still serving his sentence.They wanted him to explain why he threw the fatal punch that took their son's life.Jacob Dunne met Joan through a restorative justice programme Joan describes how those letters eventually led to a nervous face-to-face meeting after Jacob was released from jail.\"All I'd seen was that mugshot, so I was expecting this evil person to walk in, and this vulnerable young man walked in the room,\" she says.She says Jacob was shocked that she cared enough to ask what he was going to do with his life.\"I didn't want this revolving door of him going in and out of prison, getting worse and worse, and maybe other families going through what I'm going through.\"I cared about him, because I wanted him to stop the violence,\" she adds.Joan then told Jacob she forgave him, and offered to give a reference to help him turn his life around.\"He said he was going to university for us,\" she says. \"I said 'don't go to university for us, if you're going to university you're going for yourself'.\"I haven't got the same bitterness, because I feel we have done more for Jacob than if he'd been 20 years in prison.\"I'm asking him to give up the friendships he knew and change his life, that's a big ask for anybody, isn't it?\"Nottingham PlayhouseJoan and ex-husband, David, joined Jacob on stage after performances of PunchJacob went on to achieve a first-class degree in criminology at Nottingham Trent University and published a book called Right from Wrong: My Story of Guilt and Redemption.The award-winning Nottinghamshire playwright, James Graham, adapted that book into a play called Punch, which returns to Nottingham Playhouse this year, after runs at the Apollo on London's West End and the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre in New York.Joan says it was strange to watch her part played by former Coronation Street star Julie Hesmondhalgh.\"Some bits are obviously quite painful, when she has to do the life support machine bit and meeting Jacob bit, and talking about James, it is very hard hearing all that from somebody else,\" she says.Nottingham Playhouse/Marc BrennerJulie Hesmondhalgh, left, plays the part of Joan in Punch Joan and Jacob have appeared on stage together for Q&A sessions after recent performances, where she agrees that people can find it extraordinary to see them hug each other.\"It is - but I've got to move forward and I didn't want to be consumed with grief and this is my way forward, to get some good out of him,\" says Joan.\"Other people in his gang have changed their life around because of it, so surely some good's coming out of it.\"Now Joan, who lives in South Derbyshire, wants restorative justice to be offered routinely to victims and perpetrators of traumatic crimes, and she is convinced her son would approve.She says: \"I think James would be honoured and amazed, because he was one to help youngsters, so to me that's coming full circle.\"More on this story",

    "body": "Is AI taking the fun out of fantasy football?14 hours agoJack GrayandYasmin Malik,BBC NewsbeatPA WireAI tools offer \"expert management\" that could help you top your mini-leagueFor years, fantasy football has given every armchair manager the space to back up claims they \"could do a better job\" than the real thing.Whether you're competing against workmates, family members or strangers, the ability to pull together your own dream team is irresistible to millions of football fans.The competitive pastime has spawned a whole industry of content creators offering weekly tips for anyone looking to gain an edge as they sift through stats and manage transfers.Recently, more players have been turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for advice - but not everyone agrees they have a place in the virtual dugout.Ryan JordanContent creator Ryan Jordan posts fantasy football tips and advice to TikTokFantasy Premier League (FPL) is the UK's most popular fantasy league, and claims to have more than 11 million players taking part.Users select squads of 15 footballers, who each earn points based on their weekly on-pitch performance. The catch? A £100m budget, constant price changes, and a strict limit on how many players you're allowed from each side. Content creator Ryan Jordan, who posts fantasy football tips and advice to his 15,000 followers on TikTok, says FPL makes the real-life game \"more engaging to watch\".The Bristol City fan says it encourages him to pay attention to teams he might not usually follow, and makes \"every match really matter\".  \"So even a team lower in the table that you might not want to watch on TV each week, you'll watch it because you've a player from their team in your FPL team,\" he says.\"It brings the community together to watch a lot more.\"Fantasy Football HubFantasy Football Hub gives players advice, including possible transfersRyan tells BBC Newsbeat he uses Fantasy Football Hub, an app which offers AI tools, including one that rates a manager's squad. He says it gives advice on transfers, predicts how many points a certain player will achieve each week, and when it's best to play or bench them.Fantasy Football Hub's founder Will Thomas told Newsbeat the app has attracted about 793,000 members since it launched in 2019, with about 59,000 of those paying a subscription to access AI features.Of those paid members, he said, about 28,000 signed up in 2025, with about 381,000 joining as free members.Fantasy Football Fix, another popular app, told Newsbeat it had also seen user numbers climb.It now has 690,000 members overall, up from about half a million in 2022.The company believes one of its key features, an AI-powered chatbot the company says is trained on \"FPL-specific\" data, has contributed to the increase.Newsbeat understands the Premier League is set to add features to its official Companion app, which uses Microsoft's Copilot, to help users pick fantasy teams and strategies later in the season. But do AI tools actually do what they claim?Ryan says he mostly finds Fantasy Football Hub reliable. \"A lot of the time, some of the players they put in there are spot-on,\" he says.\"I'm not going to lie, there are some times I see a player and I think: 'What's he doing in there?'\"In groups dedicated to fantasy football on Reddit and other platforms, some users argue that the subscription apps don't provide insights or data which players can't get elsewhere. And one of the biggest complaints is that they remove the elements of gut instinct and luck that keep people hooked on fantasy leagues.Ryan says he understands why some people are against AI use, but he sees it as similar to getting advice from YouTube or podcasts.\"At the end of the day, I think people should play FPL in whatever way they enjoy most,\" he says.\"AI tools don't replace skill, they just support decision-making.\"Villa fan Jake reckons AI should stay on the benchTwo-thirds of FPL players who replied to a survey from Virgin Media O2 published in August said they were planning to use AI this season.However, many respondents told the company it \"takes the fun out of the game\" and others felt it was \"outright cheating\".It's a view that Newsbeat encountered among fans travelling for the Aston Villa v Manchester United match in Birmingham last month.Supporters told us they felt puzzled by others using AI to help them pick their squads.When we spoke to Jake Thomas O'Donnell, a long-time FPL player, in Birmingham city centre, he was also unimpressed.\"I think AI ruins the banter a little bit,\" the Aston Villa fan said.\"People that use AI have no clue what they're doing and automatically become these great people.\"It should be done by the person.\"Other players we spoke to say they weren't too fussed about it - and some didn't even know AI was used by others. 'I don't really see it spoiling the game'Dani GonçalvesDani Gonçalves co-created Aerial Fantasy which follows the Women's Super LeagueDani Gonçalves is a co-creator of Aerial Fantasy, one of several unofficial fantasy games developed for the Women's Super League after England's Lionesses won the 2022 Euros.It opened the 2025-26 season with more than 30,000 users.Dani argues there is little difference between following advice from an AI chatbot and a fantasy football \"expert\", such as a podcaster.\"People have always been trying to game the system and figure out a way to get the edge,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"I don't really see it spoiling the game.\"Dani admits there is a risk that widespread AI use could lead to lots of similar-looking teams as \"everyone's using the same data\".But she says those running fantasy leagues can use incentives to encourage players away from obvious or popular picks.Aerial Fantasy, for example, offers \"visionary points\", or bonuses, boosting rewards for those who choose lesser-picked squad members.Dani says there can also be a benefit for players who do enjoy the old-fashioned method of trawling stats and spreadsheets to optimise their teams.\"Some players really enjoy digging through all the data and finding that gem, and obviously using AI does make that faster,\" she says.\"They're almost more engaged than the person who is rolling the dice and just picking a random person.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this ",

    "body": "12 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterSinger and actress Ashley Tisdale has spoken out about being \"brought to tears\" by being a member of a \"toxic mom group\", which she ultimately decided to leave.The US actress rose to fame as a child star on the Disney Channel and later appeared in the High School Musical films as Sharpay Evans.The 40-year-old has previously discussed the benefits of having support from a \"village of moms\" following the birth of her first daughter in 2021.But she said the changing dynamic of the group, which reportedly includes several other celebrities, ended up reminding her of high school cliques and left her feeling \"frozen out\" at a vulnerable time.The star, who has two young daughters with husband Christopher French, made the comments in an article for the Cut, which was adapted from her own blog post on the subject.She said the response to her blog about how \"mom groups can turn toxic\" had made her phone \"blow up like no other\" topic, with messages from women who had experienced similar things.In her case, the singer said she had noticed that some mothers in the group had started socialising without her, and had felt a \"growing distance\" from them at events they did attend together.\"I was starting to feel frozen out of the group,\" she said, \"noticing every way that they seemed to exclude me.\"Tisdale said it reminded her of an earlier stage of the group's friendship, when she had \"picked up on hints of a weird dynamic\" involving \"another mom who often wasn't included\".\"It seemed that this group had a pattern of leaving someone out,\" Tisdale reflected. \"And that someone had become me.\"She added that the interactions \"took me back to an unpleasant but familiar feeling I thought I'd left behind years ago\" that maybe she was not \"cool enough\".Tisdale ultimately decided to cut ties with the group and said she sent a message to the other members explaining: \"This is too high school for me and I don't want to take part in it anymore.\"She said her message \"didn't exactly go over well\", but noted that some of the mothers did then try to \"smooth things over\".She added: \"To be clear, I have never considered the moms to be bad people (maybe one) but I do think our group dynamic stopped being healthy and positive - for me anyway.\"The actress discouraged readers from trying to guess exactly who she was referring to in the post, adding: \"Whatever you think is true isn't even close.\"She added that the feedback she's had from other women on the subject has shown \"I'm far from the only mother who's been brought to tears by members of a group that's supposed to lift everyone up\".As a singer, Tisdale released three studio albums, while her acting credits also include the Scary Movie and Bring It On franchises.",

    "body": "7 hours agoArchie MitchellandEsyllt Carr,Business reportersParliament TVFujitsu's European boss Paul Patterson answered questions from the Business and Trade CommitteeFujitsu is \"not a parasite\" for continuing to profit from government contracts in the wake of the Post Office Horizon scandal, its boss told MPs.European chief executive Paul Patterson said Fujitsu had been given £500m of contract extensions despite its faulty software being at the centre of the huge miscarriage of justice.\"We are not a parasite, the government has got an option as to whether they wish to extend those contracts or not,\" he said, adding it would not bid for new business.Patterson also repeatedly refused to say how much Fujitsu would contribute to the £1.8bn redress scheme for victims of the scandal, currently funded by taxpayers.More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted after the faulty Horizon computer system made it look like money was missing from their branch accounts.Hundreds of others poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution.It is widely considered one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history.Patterson was answering questions from the Business and Trade Select Committee two years after telling the same group of MPs Fujitsu had a \"moral obligation\" to contribute to compensation for those affected by the scandal.Arriving to hear the evidence, former sub-postmaster and prominent campaigner for justice Jo Hamilton said she wanted Fujitsu to \"just pay.\"\"Taxpayers have lost a lot of money over this,\" she said. \"They should give a chunk of their earnings back to them, to put in the pot, to help pay everybody,\" she added.Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set aside £1.8bn of taxpayers' money to compensate victims of the scandal, £1.4bn of which has been paid out, with Fujitsu having promised to contribute towards the fund.But, despite repeated questioning from MPs on Tuesday, Patterson refused to say how much Fujitsu would pay.He said the firm was waiting for the final report of the official Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry, led by judge Sir Wyn Williams.\"Our commitment is 100%. We will make a contribution to redress, to the government, when we've seen the report,\" he told MPs.The committee's chair, Labour MP Liam Byrne, said he \"just can't believe the company has changed\".He cited the firm's role in the scandal and its ongoing work for the British government.And he said: \"Your refusal to tell us how much Fujitsu will pay into a £1.8bn bill for taxpayers leads people to the conclusion that, frankly, Fujitsu is behaving like a parasite on the British state.\"Patterson said: \"We're not a parasite. The government has got an option as to whether to extend those contracts or not. If you wish us to walk away from those contracts, we'll walk away from those contracts.\"He stressed Fujitsu's \"proud\" 40-year history of investment in the UK, highlighting its 5,000 employees and the hundreds of sub-contractors it uses in the country.He was questioned about why Fujitsu, which is a publicly listed company in Japan, had not made a provision in its own accounts for a potential future payout.Patterson said the firm's auditors had advised him it was not necessary until the exact figure was known.Fujitsu has said it will not bid for UK public contracts until Sir Wyn's inquiry into the scandal has ended.But as recently as November, the Post Office agreed to extend a deal to use its controversial Horizon system for another year.Patterson said the firm had extended its contract with the Post Office at the government's request.",

    "body": "8 hours agoChloe AslettYorkshireBBCThe incident occurred on the road between Dinnington and TodwickA police force has admitted mixing up the identities of an 18-year-old killed in a car crash with another teenager who survived the collision.South Yorkshire Police said officers had wrongly told relatives of Trevor Wynn, 17, that he had died in the crash near Rotherham in December.Meanwhile, the force incorrectly identified Joshua Johnson, 18, as having survived the collision, which also resulted in the death of a 17-year-old girl.Assistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) since identifying the error, adding that he was aware of \"the additional trauma this may cause\".Police were called to Todwick Road between Dinnington and Todwick in the early hours of 13 December after a silver Toyota Corolla crashed off the road.At the time the force said a 17-year-old girl, who was driving, and a 17-year-old boy had been pronounced dead at the scene, while an 18-year-old male had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.Wynn's family were subsequently told he had died while it was believed that Johnson was the male in hospital receiving treatment.However, in a statement issued on Tuesday, the force said \"concerns\" had been raised about the identities of those killed.A spokesperson said \"information came to light\" on Sunday which prompted \"further formal identification processes, including forensics, to be undertaken\" and resulted in the mistake being identified.South Yorkshire PoliceAssistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the IOPCMcFarlane said he had since offered to meet with both sets of parents to discuss the matter.He said: \"This has obviously come as a huge shock to everyone and we recognise the additional trauma this may cause. \"We are supporting Trevor and all the families through this and have engaged specialist agencies to help provide that support. \"I have also offered to meet with both sets of parents as I am sure they will have many questions, most of which we are not able to answer yet but we are absolutely committed to understanding how this happened so it cannot happen again.\"He said South Yorkshire Police would fully cooperate with any subsequent investigation by the police watchdog.Wynn was not named publicly by police at the time of the crash, but was widely identified on social media and in local news outlets as having died in the collision.The 17-year-old girl has not been formally named.An 18-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 19-year-old arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in connection with the crash both remain on bail pending further enquiries.The IOPC said it was assessing the referral to determine whether an investigation was required.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "12 hours agoAlice Cuddy,reporting from Cúcuta, on the Colombia-Venezuela borderandVanessa Buschschlüter,Latin America editor, BBC News OnlineReutersPolice guarded the National Assembly where Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in MondayAt least 14 members of the press were detained in Venezuela on Monday as they were covering the aftermath of the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by US forces. The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported. Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country. Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would \"run\"  Venezuela.The union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas.At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service.They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added. A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta.The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said. The union called the incidents \"alarming\" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country. The repression has not been confined to media workers.One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were \"hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses\".Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as \"colectivos\", wearing masks.A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was \"so much fear in the streets and in our homes\".Members of the government appeared keen to show that the security forces were visible in communities, with the Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, posting a photo of himself on Monday night posing with armed police.Their presence has struck fear in people critical of the government. One woman described how there are \"military people on every corner and groups of armed civilians supporting the government who are causing fear among the population\".Another person who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC that \"the regime is not allowing news to come out of here.\" They added that \"there are uniformed personnel on the streets stopping people and checking their phones\".Instagram/@Minsjustice_VEInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello (shown right-of-centre wearing a black cap with red writing) posted this photo on InstagramThe journalist detentions come at a volatile time in Venezuela, where just days ago the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife were seized by US forces in a pre-dawn raid in which dozens of his bodyguards and security detail were killed.While the seizure prompted celebrations among Venezuelans who oppose Maduro and who have left the country, there were no public displays of joy in Venezuela.Opposition Venezuelans have long denounced the repression they face if they speak out against the Maduro government. More than 2,000 people were arrested during protests in the wake of the 2024 presidential election.The government-dominated electoral council declared Maduro the winner of that election but voting tallies collected by the opposition and verified by independent media suggest that it was won by the opposition candidate. In the crackdown which followed the election, members of the security forces checked people's phone for messages critical of Maduro, prompting many Venezuelans to erase their social media accounts and message history. Many of those arrested at the time were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences after being sentenced for \"treason\".According to pressure group Foro Penal, there are more than 800 political prisoners being held in Venezuela as of 5 January.",

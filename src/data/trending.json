    "body": "15 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterThe prime minister has said Chancellor Rachel Reeves will face no further action over the failure to obtain the correct licence when renting out her family home.However, Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"regrettable\" Reeves did not share all the relevant emails when she first told him about the issue on Wednesday evening.The chancellor initially said neither she nor her husband were aware a licence was needed but later found correspondence between her husband and the letting agent showing he was told one was required but the agency would apply on their behalf.The letting agent has said an \"oversight\" meant it had never ultimately applied for the licence.Reeves has apologised for the \"inadvertent mistake\" but said she accepted full responsibility.Conservative Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake called for a full investigation, saying the chancellor's story \"keeps on changing\".\"On Wednesday, the independent adviser on ministerial standards said he was simply willing to take Rachel Reeves's word and the case was closed,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\"The next day some more evidence came to light, which meant Rachel Reeves's story on Wednesday was a false narrative of the event.\"Reeves put her four-bedroom south London home up for rent in July 2024, when Labour won the general election and she moved into 11 Downing Street.The house falls in an area where Southwark Council requires private landlords to obtain a selective licence at a cost of £945. Reeves or her letting agent could face an unlimited fine if the council takes the matter to court.Southwark Council has refused to comment on Reeves's case but said it only takes enforcement action against landlords who do not apply for a licence within 21 days of receiving a warning or where a property is found to be in an unsafe condition.Reeves says she has now applied for a licence.The chancellor said she first became aware that her property did not have the correct licence on Wednesday when the Daily Mail, who first reported the story, contacted her.After consulting his ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus, who decided against launching an investigation, Sir Keir accepted Reeves's apology and said he was happy the \"matter can be drawn to a close\".However, the release of the emails between her husband and the letting agent on Thursday reopened the row.After reviewing the emails, Sir Laurie said he still believed Reeves made an \"unfortunate but inadvertent error\".While he did not rule on whether the ministerial code had been broken, he said he found \"no evidence of bad faith\".In a letter to Reeves on Thursday evening, Sir Keir said he agreed with his ethics adviser and saw \"no need for any further action\".He accepted the emails from the estate agent were only found by her husband on Thursday morning and Reeves was \"acting in good faith\".However, he added: \"It would clearly have been better if you and your husband had conducted a full trawl through all email correspondence with the estate agency before writing to me yesterday.\"Defending his colleague, Trade Minister Chris Bryant said he did not think the fault lay with Reeves and she would be \"entitled to feel a bit grumpy\" about the situation.\"She realised that her husband had actually had some emails, some correspondence with the estate agent - and the estate agent had said categorically in terms we will sort out this licence for you and then subsequently it didn't happen,\" he told the BBC.The revelations come at a politically awkward time for Reeves, who is preparing for a Budget at the end of the month amidst speculation the government is planning to break a manifesto commitment not to raise income tax.In a statement, Gareth Martin, owner of Harvey & Wheeler, the estate agent which rented out the property on behalf of Reeves, said: \"In an effort to be helpful our previous property manager offered to apply for a licence on these clients' behalf, as shown in the correspondence. That property manager suddenly resigned on the Friday before the tenancy began on the following Monday.\"Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply. We have apologised to the owners for this oversight.\"At the time the tenancy began, all the relevant certificates were in place and if the licence had been applied for, we have no doubt it would have been granted.\"Our clients would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.\"",

    "body": "Former England goalkeeper Mary Earps announces 'happy' same-sex relationship6 hours agoJosh ParryLGBT & Identity reporterThe FA via Getty ImagesFormer England goalkeeper Mary Earps has told the BBC she \"feels ready and happy to share\" that she is in a same-sex relationship.The 32-year-old has chosen to disclose details about her sexuality ahead of the upcoming publication of her memoir, in which she discusses her \"really happy relationship.\"The BBC understands Earps has decided to publish a statement confirming her sexuality so that it's shared on her own terms and doesn't distract from other themes in the book, including her struggles with mental health.Her manager, Tina Taylor, said Earps hopes that being open about her life off the pitch will \"inspire people around the word to find the confidence to live authentically\".Earps, who now plays her football in France for Paris Saint-Germain, exclusively told the BBC she had always tried to keep her personal life separate from her professional one, but that it would've felt \"inauthentic\" not to share details of something she sees as \"so important to her.\"Her manager told the BBC the former Manchester United player wanted to share her story \"in her own way\".\"After the World Cup, the outpouring of love and support really showed Mary the impact she's had, and she was deeply touched by it,\" she said.\"By sharing details of her life away from football - something she's never done before - Mary is telling her story in her own way. It's honest and authentic.\"The FA via Getty ImagesEarps moved to Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer last July, having previously played for Manchester United (pictured)In comparison to the men's game, women's football has many more openly gay players.There were no openly gay or bisexual players in the 2022 men's World Cup.In contrast, the 2023 Women's World Cup had more than 40 openly lesbian or bisexual players.Earps is said to have been encouraged and supported by her former Lionesses teammates after recently opening up about her relationship to them.Giving a statement to the BBC, Earps said: \"I've always tried to keep my personal life separate from my professional one, but it would have felt inauthentic not to include something so important to me in this book.\"I'm in a really happy relationship. The people closest to me have always known, and I feel ready and happy to share that with everyone else now.\"The keeper, who grew up in Nottingham, was a key part of the Lionesses side which won the Women's Euros in 2022 and was the team's vice captain during the Women's World Cup in 2023, which saw England lose in the final to Spain.She was also crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2023, which she described as an \"incredible\" experience.In May 2024, she was awarded an MBE by Prince William.She has publicly spoken many times about the importance of being a \"trailblazer\" and role model.In an interview in August 2024, she said: \"I'm a very ambitious person, a very hard-working person, and I think to try and push boundaries and try and be a pioneer for change, in many ways, is something that I really enjoy doing, and hopefully I can do for the rest of my career.\"As Lionesses, one of the things that really sets us apart from other teams is how strong we are in our values and what we stand for.\"The FA via Getty ImagesEarps said she wanted to tell her story \"in her own way\" and hopes it will inspire others (file photo)In the era of social media, celebrities often have power over how and when they make their sexuality public - or even if they do so at all.In decades gone by, pop stars, actors and footballers suffered terrible consequences from press intrusion into their sexuality.But that kind of intrusion is not something that is just confined to history.In 2023, when actor Rebel Wilson first shared details of her same-sex relationship, there was a reckoning for the Australian media after it became apparent she had done so because a journalist had planned to reveal details of the relationship in a gossip column.For most people from the community, \"coming out\" isn't something that you only do once - indeed Earps's statement says she was already open about her sexuality with those closest to her.So the decision to come out to her fans, particularly the young people who see her as a role model, is something she has clearly thought a lot about.In her own words, the goalkeeper says it simply would've felt \"inauthentic\" to not go public with something that is \"so important\" to her.",

    "body": "French actor Tchéky Karyo, who had a starring role in the film Nikita and the TV series The Missing, has died aged 72.Karyo, who was born in Turkey but grew up in Paris, died of a cancer on Friday, AFP news agency reported. Known largely for supporting roles, Karyo acted in films for nearly four decades, finding a second career in TV series in his final years.Karyo's wife, actress Valérie Keruzoré, and their children announced his death in a statement to the news agency. Karyo first made his mark in crime thriller La Balance (1982) and he played the handler Bob in Luc Besson's assassin film Nikita (1990).BBC audiences might best remember him for his role in The Missing (2014).The first eight-part series, about the search for a missing boy in France, starred Karyo as French detective Julien Baptiste. James Nesbitt and Frances O'Connor played the boy's parents.The second eight-part series, about a missing girl in Germany, was brodcast in 2016. Karyo returned as Baptiste, with David Morrissey and Keeley Hawes as the girl's parents.Both series received positive reviews, with critics praising the cast, especially Karyo's performance. In February 2019, a spin-off series titled Baptiste was broadcast on BBC One. Lindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama, said: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Tchéky Karyo. He was a truly brilliant and much loved actor and he will be fondly remembered by BBC viewers for his roles in The Missing, Baptiste and most recently Boat Story. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this time.\"Karyo was born on 4 October 1953 in Istanbul, the son of a Turkish lorry driver of Spanish-Jewish origin and a Greek mother, Le Monde newspaper writes.After several years as a theatrical actor, he saw his role in La Balance earn him a nomination for the César Award for Best Male Revelation.With his strong jaw and penetrating stare, he went on to star in dozens of films of all kinds. Other French films included Besson's Joan of Arc (1993) and the anti-war epic A Very Long Engagement (2004). He was also cast in Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) and in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995).One of his starring roles was as the medieval prophet Nostradamus in the 1994 film of the same name, while his tiniest role was undoubtedly in Amélie (2001) where he only appeared as a face on an ID photograph in an album.",

    "body": "13 hours agoKaty Austin,transport correspondent and Emer Moreau,business reporterA proposed plan to trial free bus passes for under-22s in England will not go ahead as it is \"unaffordable\" at the moment, the government has said.The trial was one of a number of recommendations put forward by the Transport Committee, a cross-party group of backbench MPs, in a report this August - with the suggestion it would boost access to jobs and education. In its response, published on Friday, the government said no money was available for such a scheme during the current spending review period, which runs until 2028/2029. Responding to the government's decision, committee chair Ruth Cadbury accused the Department for Transport of \"lacking in ambition\".\"Throughout our inquiry we heard about the consequences of poor connectivity,\" Labour MP Cadbury said. \"Young people unable to get their first jobs or taking exhausting journeys to reach school or college. Older and disabled people feeling isolated and depressed, and high streets starved of customers.\"\"It is hard to shake the feeling that an opportunity may be missed, particularly to improve services in rural and underserved communities.\"  Since January 2022, everyone in Scotland aged between five and 22 has been entitled to free bus travel.Gracie Moore is 22 and lives in Slough. She spends £120 a month to get the bus to and from work every day.Gracie said the government's decision was \"disappointing\".\"It would have been so beneficial, considering that under 22s are so negatively impacted by inflation,\" she said. \"Things like buying our first house or affording bills are already difficult, so this would have taken the pressure off for us.\"Gracie previously lived in Madrid, where she enjoyed unlimited travel on bus, train, tube, and tram for only €8 (£6.90) a month with a young person's travel card.England, she said, \"seem[s] to be one of the only countries who cannot effectively subsidise travel costs\".The announcement of the government's plans on under-22 bus travel in England comes in the week when the Bus Services Act has become law. Welcomed by the committee, it will place tougher requirements on operators that wish to cancel certain services and give local authorities more control, including through franchising. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the new law would make it \"easier for local leaders to take control of their buses\" and was \"putting passengers first\". Cadbury said while the new law is \"positive and necessary\" it cannot be \"the last word\". Of the other recommendations put forward by the committee, some were received positively. These included a suggestion that funding should be laid out over a longer period, and should be weighted to take account of rural needs. However, along with free travel for under-22s, other points of action were rejected - including a call for minimum service levels for buses. The government argued that \"significant differences in demographics, need and geography\" would make minimum levels of service \"very challenging to implement at a national level, whilst also ensuring value for money\".The number of bus journeys taken in England has dropped in recent years, while fares have risen faster than inflation.The committee found that this was a barrier to opportunity and growth in some areas.Bus passengers spend £39.1bn in local businesses every year, according to research from KPMG.But experts told the Transport Committee that the bus sector's contribution to the economy declined by around £8.9bn between 2011 and 2023.The committee's report said: \"The current deregulated nature of the bus sector can encourage commercial operators to \"deprioritise\" less profitable routes, often leaving vulnerable communities without a service.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoTessa Delaunay-Martinat the Old BaileyMetropolitan PoliceShaine March pleaded guilty to murdering Alana Odysseos partway through his trialA man who murdered his pregnant girlfriend while on licence for a previous murder conviction has been sentenced to life with a minimum term of 42 years.Alana Odysseos, 32, grew up in Suffolk and was about eight weeks pregnant when she died outside her flat in Walthamstow, east London, after being stabbed 19 times with a kitchen knife on 22 July 2024.Shaine March, 47, of Surrey Quays, south-east London, initially admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility and denied murder, but pleaded guilty partway through the trial.When sentencing March earlier at the Old Bailey, judge Mr Justice Murray said he may never be released \"given his age\" and the length of the minimum term. \"I am sure you intended to kill her,\" Mr Justice Murray told March, who appeared via video link from HMP Belmarsh having refused to attend the sentencing hearing in person.Family Handout/PAMother-of-two Alana Odysseos, 32, died after she was stabbed 19 timesThe court heard Ms Odysseos was in a tumultuous relationship with March for four months before she was killed, during which neighbours heard constant arguments but no outward signs of violence. The probation service in London had arranged for safeguarding checks to be conducted, but when March told them the relationship between him and Ms Odysseos had ended amicably no further action was taken.March was 21 when he fatally stabbed Andre Drummond, 17, through the neck and was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in July 2000.He was released in early 2013 and recalled to jail later that year after he was convicted of assaulting his then-pregnant girlfriend and was released again in February 2018.Jasmine Yates, Ms Odysseos' sister, told the court she had noticed her sister's mental health had become \"erratic\" and had tried to encourage her to leave March when he made her delete all male contacts from her phone.Ms Yates added that while March promised Ms Odysseos he would go to therapy and change, he also left her sister voice notes telling her to get an abortion.Ms Odysseos confided in a friend that she was frightened after March had smashed a glass in her face, the court heard. In a victim impact statement, Ms Yates said she told her sister: \"If he can glass you, he can kill you. I am haunted by these words and what happened after.\"Karen Cronin, Ms Odysseos' mother, told the court: \"I used to love going to church and singing in the choir, but the anger I feel towards [March] doesn't feel Christian so I no longer go to church.\"I want him to die in prison with no hope of doing this to anybody else.\"Police camera captures killer saying 'I regret nothing'During the trial, the court was shown CCTV footage of March as he walked away from Ms Odysseos' flat after attacking her and disposing of evidence including mobile phones and clothing.Police recovered March's phone from a drain and found a voice note he recorded just after 03:00 BST that said: \"Mum I just killed a woman and I'm going back to jail.\"CCTV and police bodycam footage from March's arrest showed him repeatedly admit to killing and stabbing Ms Odysseos. He also referred to himself as \"scum\" who deserved to be put in jail.While March was in custody at Barking Police Station in London, he said: \"I stabbed her multiple times with a long kitchen knife. \"I think the last stabbing was by the back of her shoulder blade, probably puncturing her heart.\"  Forensic pathologist Dr Matt Cieka told the court the post-mortem analysis showed that Ms Odysseos was stabbed in the heart from behind.He added the attack was with such \"severe force\" that five of the 19 stab wounds she suffered would have been fatal in their own right.More on this story",

    "body": "8 hours agoMayeni Jones,Africa correspondent, Bernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Natasha BootyThe South African government has criticised the US's decision to prioritise refugee applications from white Afrikaners, saying claims of a white genocide have been widely discredited and lack reliable evidence.It highlighted an open letter published by prominent members of the Afrikaner community earlier this week rejecting the narrative, with some signatories calling the relocation scheme racist.The limited number of white South African Afrikaners signing up to relocate to the US was indication that they were not being persecuted, it added.On Thursday, the administration of US President Donald Trump announced its lowest refugee annual cap on record - to just 7,500.The exact figures of the number of white South Africans who have been admitted through the US scheme are not available. South Africa's latest crime statistics do not indicate that more white people have fallen victim to violent crime than other racial groups. Earlier this year President Trump offered refugee status to Afrikaners - who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers - after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances. Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Unpacking the South African land law that so inflames TrumpOn the road incorrectly identified as a 'burial site' by TrumpMost private farmland is owned by white South Africans who make up just over 7% of the population.Several months ago, South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".President Trump held up a photo purporting to show body bags containing the remains of white people in South Africa, but the Reuters news agency later identified the photo as one of their own - taken thousands of miles away in the war-struck Democratic Republic of Congo.Washington did not comment on the claim that they had misidentified the image.The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.",

    "body": "10 hours agoEthan GudgeSouth of EnglandA second solid gold toilet is to be auctioned off, after the first casting was stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019.America, created by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, is a fully functional toilet, fashioned from more than 15st 13lb (101.2kg) of solid 18-carat gold.The first version of the work was initially installed in a public bathroom at the  Guggenheim museum in New York in 2016 but hit the news again three years later when a gang of thieves stole it from Blenheim in Oxfordshire. Now the existence of a second golden toilet has been revealed, which is due to go under the hammer at Sotheby's in New York City on 18 November.It is estimated more than 100,000 people used the first toilet while it was at the Guggenheim before it was moved and exhibited at Blenheim Palace.It was there that in the early hours of 14 September 2019, five men smashed their way in, ripped out the £4.8m solid gold installation and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.The heist and the trial that followed made news across the world.    James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024. Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary in March. Both were both jailed earlier this year.Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was also convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property and given a suspended sentence.Sotheby's has revealed that Cattelan created three toilets in 2016, with work number two now up for sale.The second version will be on display in a bathroom at New York's Breuer Building until it goes under the hammer.The auction house described it as a \"cultural phenomenon\" and an \"incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value\".David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's New York, said: \"America is Maurizio Cattelan's tour de force.\"\"Holding both a proverbial and literal mirror to the art world, the work confronts the most uncomfortable questions about art, and the belief systems held sacred to the institutions of the market and the museum,\" Mr Galperin explained.The auction house said that in a world first, the starting bid on the artwork would be determined by the exact price of its weight in gold when the sale begins.That means, if sold at today's rate, bidding on the solid gold toilet would begin at around $10m (£7.6m).",

    "body": "12 hours agoRachel Hagan and Imogen Foulkes,Geneva CorrespondentEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe UN's human rights chief has condemned US military strikes on vessels allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific, saying the lethal attacks violate international law and amount to \"extrajudicial killing\".Volker Türk said on Friday that more than 60 people have reportedly been killed in US strikes since early September.Calling the attacks \"unacceptable\", he said Washington must halt them immediately and conduct prompt, independent and transparent investigations.President Donald Trump has said the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US and he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters.Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth has said strikes are being carried out on vessels operated by drug-trafficking groups designated as terrorist organisations by the US, saying this week that \"the Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans\".Türk, while acknowledging the challenges of tackling drug trafficking, said in a statement that the circumstances for the deadly strikes \"find no justification in international law\".\"Countering the serious issue of illicit trafficking of drugs across international borders is - as has long been agreed among States - a law-enforcement matter, governed by the careful limits on lethal force set out in international human rights law.\"Under law, the intentional use of lethal force \"is only permissible as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life\", he said.He added that based on \"very sparse information provided publicly by the US authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to lives of others\".He called on the US to use law enforcement methods including intercepting boats and detaining suspects, and if necessary, prosecuting individuals.Watch: What we know about US strikes targeting alleged drug boatsMost strikes have taken place off the coast of South America in the Caribbean, though attacks in the Pacific this week killed at least 18 people, according to Hegseth.In the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area.The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government does not \"agree with these attacks\" and has called for meetings with the US ambassador, insisting that \"all international treaties be respected.\"BBC NewsThe US actions have also heightened tensions between Washington and the governments of Colombia and Venezuela.The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\". Petro has responded that he has been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\".Trump has also accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies.Venezuela's attorney general told the BBC there is \"no doubt\" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.",

    "body": "Andrew's move out of Royal Lodge may not happen until new year5 hours agoRuth ComerfordGetty and BBCAndrew Mountbatten Windsor will not have to leave Royal Lodge immediately and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year, the BBC understands. On Thursday, King Charles stripped his younger brother of his titles and honours, and moved to force him out of his Windsor mansion. He will be moving to a property on the King's Norfolk estate, paid for by the monarch.The dramatic statement came after months of pressure over Andrew's private life, as his ties to disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein continued to dog the royals. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.Meanwhile, the government has said it had no plans to pass a law to formally remove Andrew from the line of succession.Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne, the only significant position he still holds - but there have been calls to bring in legislation to stop any chance of him becoming King.It would take an act of Parliament to formally remove him which would be complex and would need to be agreed with all the Commonwealth realms, including Australia and Canada.How will Andrew's titles be removed and what happens next?Why Sarah Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie can't escape the taint of family scandalKing's statement on Andrew in fullWhere might Andrew live on the Sandringham estate?Buckingham Palace has said Andrew's move from Royal Lodge in Windsor to Sandringham will take place \"as soon as possible and practicable\".But according to royal sources, a delay in Andrew moving until the new year would avoid the embarrassment of him being in Sandringham at Christmas - where the Royal Family traditionally gathers for the festive season.Andrew will move to an undisclosed property on the privately-owned estate, with the accommodation funded by the King who will also make private financial provisions for his brother.Sandringham was bought in 1862 by the then Prince of Wales, who later became Edward VII, as a private country retreat. The historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.On Friday, fresh court documents were published in the US showing Andrew said in 2010 it would be \"good to catch up in person\" with Epstein, after the convicted sex offender was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.In an email on dated 15 April 2010, Epstein suggested the then-prince should meet American banker Jes Staley, which Andrew said he was not able to do due to his schedule.\"I have no immediate plans to drop by New York but I think I should at some stage soon,\" he told Epstein.\"I'll look and see if I can make a couple of days before the summer.\"It would be good to catch up in person.\"The pair were later pictured together in Central Park in New York in December 2010 in a meeting that Andrew claimed in his 2019 Newsnight interview was to break off their friendship. Virginia Giuffre's family speak to BBC: \"She'd be so proud\"Read the King's statement in fullWatch: Question Time audience reacts to newsIs this finally rock bottom for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?It is understood the move to remove Andrew's titles was taken by the King in light of the serious lapses of judgement his brother made, and that his decision was supported by the wider Royal Family. The public also seems to back the decision - according to a YouGov poll published on Thursday, 79% of people backed taking away the title and 53% thought the King had now done all that he could.There were 58% who thought this response should have come sooner, with concerns that the royals had been too slow to take action over the links to Jeffrey Epstein.Sir Keir Starmer also \"fully supports\" the Palace's decision, Downing Street said, and echoed Buckingham Palace's statement of support for Epstein's victims.Emily Michot/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty ImagesVirginia Giuffre holds a photo of herself as a teenager, when she says she was abused by Jeffrey EpsteinThe controversy around Andrew has been rumbling on for years, but came to a head when he was accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations. In 2022 he paid millions to settle a civil case with her, despite insisting he did not remember meeting her.Virginia Giuffre's family said she had \"brought down a prince\" following the King's decision. Her brother Sky Roberts called for Andrew to be \"investigated\" and said the King's decision to remove his titles was \"not enough, in the sense that he's still walking around a free man\".\"I mean, let's not be naive, that he's not going to be living on the side of the road here, he's still in a very, let's say, cushy spot... He should be investigated, let's put it that way,\" he told Sky News.The UK trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC Andrew should, if asked, go to the US to answer questions about the crimes of Epstein.\"I think that, just as with any ordinary member of the public, if there were requests from another jurisdiction of this kind, I would expect any decently minded person to comply with that request,\" he said.Gloria Allred, who has represented victims of Jeffrey Epstein, said Andrew losing his title and grand home was \"long overdue\" and \"definitely welcome\".\"This is a man who should no longer walk with honour. He should be ashamed of himself,\" the American lawyer said.Ms Allred has long called for Andrew to speak to US law enforcement about his former friend Epstein \"under oath\" - something he has \"declined\" to do so far, she said.The Metropolitan Police has previously said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Ms Giuffre through his police protection.

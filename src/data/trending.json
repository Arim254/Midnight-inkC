    "body": "Families of people killed in the protests in Iran have told the BBC that the authorities are demanding large sums of money to return their bodies for burial. Multiple sources have told BBC Persian that bodies are being held in mortuaries and hospitals and that security forces will not release them unless their relatives hand over money. At least 2,435 people have been killed during more than two weeks of protests across the country.  One family in the northern city of Rasht told the BBC that security forces demanded 700 million tomans ($5,000; £3,700) to release the body of their loved one. It was being held at the Poursina Hospital mortuary, along with at least 70 other dead protesters, they said. Meanwhile in Tehran, the family of a Kurdish seasonal construction worker went to collect his body, only to be told they must pay a billion tomans ($7,000; £5,200) to receive it. The family told the BBC that they could not afford the fee and were forced to leave without their son's body. A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month. In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds. BBC Persian has been told about a woman - who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff. They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release. BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her. The woman then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body.  She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him. \"I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat,\" she told her London relative. BBC Persian has also received reports that officials at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra mortuary are telling families that if they claim their child was a member of the Basij paramilitary force and was killed by protesters, the body will be released without charge.The family member told the BBC in a message: \"We were asked to participate in a pro-government rally and portray the body as that of a martyr. We did not agree to this.\"In another case in Tehran, a source told BBC Persian that several families broke into a mortuary to retrieve bodies out of fear they would be taken away by the authorities. \"Several families, fearing that the authorities might keep the bodies or bury them without their knowledge, broke open the morgue door and pulled the bodies out of  ambulances,\" the source told the BBC. The families then guarded the bodies for several hours on the ground in the hospital courtyard to prevent them from being taken away until they could find private ambulances to transport them, the source said. An internet and communications blackout has made it difficult to get a full picture of what is happening on the ground. International human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is not allowed by the Iranian government to report on the ground.Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers and security forces launched a violent crackdown. The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities. According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,435 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 13 children and 153 people affiliated with the security forces or government. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.Meanwhile, arrests have continued across the country. Security forces and Revolutionary Guard intelligence units have detained activists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens. ",

    "body": "8 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesFast-food chain Leon will open more restaurants in service stations, airports and train stations, after it closes 20 on the High Street, its boss has said.John Vincent said the upcoming rises in business rates along with overall cost increases means the High Street is no longer as profitable. Leon has been losing £10m a year.Vincent, an original co-founder of the chain, bought the company back from Asda last year. But last month the firm appointed administrators and announced a major restructuring of its 71 restaurants, which employ 1,000 people.The government says it is backing hospitality businesses with a support package to limit bill rises.Vincent told the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast tax rises were \"incredibly toxic\" for the hospitality industry.If taxes on businesses increase further, he said, \"the only people that are going to survive are those selling... food that's not very good quality\".In April, business rates relief for the hospitality sector which came in during Covid will end. At the same time, increases in the rateable value of premises take effect. The Treasury has indicated it will announce further assistance for pubs in the coming days but has faced a backlash from other hospitality businesses over why they are not included. Chancellor Rachel Reeves told a press conference on Wednesday she was \"working with the hospitality sector\".LeonJohn Vincent told the BBC Leon had moved away from its original mission of good-quality fast food for the massesVincent said that traditionally, \"the more fast food units you have, the better the operations, the better the supply chain, the better you can buy, the better your systems can be\".However, he added: \"I'm not sure this is true anymore because of pressure on the market.\"Vincent said Leon would close its restaurants outside London, but added the high costs of operating in the capital was making business there \"incredibly difficult\" with \"incredibly high upward-only rents\".He said even though airports in particular take a large slice of a retailer's takings, a 2% profit margin there \"is worth the same as a 6% on the High Street\".\"You might be doing two or three times the revenue in that airport than you might in a High Street location,\" Vincent said.Responding to Vincent's comments, a Treasury spokesperson said: \"We're backing hospitality businesses with a £4.3bn support package to limit bill rises.The spokesperson said this was in addition to \"capping corporation tax at 25%, cutting red tape and taking action on the cost of living to boost high streets\".Purpose and missionAside from rising costs, Vincent feels Leon is struggling because it has drifted from its original mission of good-quality fast food for the masses.The menu started out simple: meatballs, a superfood salad and tapas - relatively healthy offerings at a time when fast food was dominated by burgers, fried chicken and kebabs, Vincent said.But Leon \"lost chutzpah, leadership and confidence\" after it was sold in 2021, which resulted in \"a lack of clarity about what it wants the menu to be\", he said.He has previously said he sympathises with the company's previous owners, because of the challenges that restaurants have faced since the pandemic.\"I think Leon needs to make sense again,\" he said. \"We don't always make sense to people at the moment.\"He plans to bring simplicity back with menu changes this year: \"We do have to, as a brand, realise and remember, we were always about the best food for the most people. \"We were not about posh fast food for posh people. That was never our intention.\"",

    "body": "Work to fix hospitals built using unsafe concrete will not be completed in time to meet the government's target, a new report has warned.Seven hospitals built using Raac, or reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, were prioritised for remedial work last year, with the government setting a deadline of 2030.The new buildings are now expected to open in 2032 and 2033 - but some are already facing pressure to meet the revised timetable, the National Audit Office (NAO) said.In a number of hospitals, roofs are being supported by metal props and some areas have been closed as unsafe.Meanwhile, affected health trusts face huge maintenance bills to keep their aging buildings safe.Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the original New Hospitals Programme - 40 new hospitals by 2030 - promises \"that were never going to be met\".  In January 2025 he revised the scheme, prioritising 20 of the projects, including Raac hospitals, with more funding and later dates of completion.The NAO report says the 2025 review did put the programme on a \"more realistic, stable, long-term footing\". Standardising the design for some of the new buildings should speed up delivery and reduce costs, for example. But some of the new dates for completion have slipped. Torbay, Kettering and Musgrove Park hospitals are all delayed – they are estimated to be open nine to ten years later than under the previous plan.Raac is less durable than reinforced concrete as the \"bubbly\" structure can let water in, weakening the building material which can crumble and collapse. All of the seven \"prioritised\" schemes to replace Raac now won't be completed until 2032-33 and with \"significant operational and clinical risk and cost \", says the NAO.In the meantime, hospitals including the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds and The Queen Elizabeth Hospitals in Kings Lynn are facing huge maintenance bills to keep their sites open. By 2025 the seven hospitals will have required more than £500 million of investment to prevent structural failure.The NHS aims to remove all Raac concrete from its estate by 2035. The Department for Health and Social Care says so far there are 20 sites where it has been eradicated and that it is investing £1.6 billion across the next four years. Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown says the delays in addressing crumbling Raac must now be addressed \"as a matter of urgency.\"But the report warns that there is a tight construction schedule overall with little contingency in the next five years, so delivery dates could slip further.Mr Tim Mitchell, President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: \"A steadier plan is better than drifting, but patients cannot wait a decade for capacity that we need now. \"NHS trusts will be pouring scarce funds into patching up old buildings for longer, when that money should be used to create extra operating theatres, securing ring‑fenced beds and making sure that there is enough staff to run them.\"A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We've confirmed a sustainable funding plan and an achievable timetable to deliver all schemes in the programme. We are now getting on with building these much-needed facilities as quickly as possible.\"",

    "body": "In the middle of the night on Monday, Rachel Bloor stirred in her bed to find a heavy weight curled up on her chest.Half asleep, she reached out for her dog - and instead found herself petting a smooth, slithering object.As Bloor retreated further under the covers and pulled them up to her neck, her partner switched on the bedside lamp and confirmed the Brisbane couple's fears.\"He goes, 'Oh baby. Don't move. There's like a 2.5m python on you,\" Bloor told the BBC.Her first words were expletives. The second, an order to evacuate the dogs.\"I thought if my Dalmatian realises that there's a snake there... it's gonna be carnage.\"The dogs secured outside the room - and her husband wishing he was with them - Bloor began carefully extricating herself.\"I was just trying to shimmy out from under the covers... in my mind, going, 'Is this really happening? This is so bizarre'.\"She believes the carpet python - which is non-venomous - had squeezed itself through the shutters on her window and onto her bed below.Once freed from the python, she began casually feeding it back out the way it came in.\"It was that big that even though it had been curled up on me, part of its tail was still out the shutter.\"\"I grabbed him, [and] even then he didn't seem overly freaked out. He sort of just wobbled in my hand.\"The same couldn't be said for her stunned husband, but Bloor herself was barely fazed, having grown up on acreage around snakes.\"I think if you're calm, they're calm.\"Though if it had been a cane toad - one of the country's most damaging, and ugly pests - that would be another story, she said.\"I can't stand them, like they make me dry retch. So if it was a cane toad, it would have scared me.\"All animals and humans escaped from the interaction unharmed.Carpet pythons are constrictors that are common in coastal areas of Australia, and usually eat small animals such as birds.",

    "body": "Robert Jenrick joining Reform UK is the focus of almost all of the front pages.The Daily Mail says with Jenrick's announcement he \"threw a hand grenade into the politics of the British right\", while the i Paper describes it as a \"day of poison and betrayal\". The Sun draws parallels between Jenrick's defection and a certain television programme;  its headline is \"Trai-Tories\".Many of the papers look at how the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, came to know about Robert Jenrick's plans. Tory sources are quoted in The Times as saying that her team had been \"monitoring\" him for months. The Guardian reports that senior figures within her office were sent screenshots of his resignation speech on Monday. There's also plenty of praise for the way she responded. The Daily Express says she appeared \"defiant\" after sacking Jenrick. Camilla Tominey writes in The Daily Telegraph that Kemi Badenoch \"showed her mettle\".The Guardian focuses on Jenrick's attack on the Conservative party in which he called it \"rotten\" and \"failed\".  The paper also quotes a senior Reform source saying that after a series of Tory defections, Robert Jenrick was the one they'd all wanted believing he'd bring experience to the party. The Daily Mirror claims his move will \"do nothing to help Reform's reputation as an old Tories' home\".The Daily Mail says the chief constable of West Midlands Police, Craig Guildford, is expected to resign today after Downing Street called for him to stand down.  The Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said on Wednesday that she'd lost confidence in him after his force used a misleading report, partly created by AI, to justify banning fans of the Israeli football team, Maccabi Tel Aviv, from a match in Birmingham.  The paper says his position has become increasingly \"untenable\".And The Daily Telegraph has picked up on reports that the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has joked that given the state of the world, now might be a \"good moment\" to start drinking. She's said to have told leaders of the European parliament that she's not much of a drinker but given the \"turbulent state of world affairs, that could change\".",

    "body": "India's aviation watchdog has launched an investigation after an Air India plane's engine sucked in a cargo container while taxiing at the Delhi airport.No-one was hurt, but the aircraft's engine was damaged and it has been grounded for repairs.The New York-bound Airbus A350 had returned to Delhi shortly after take-off on Thursday after Iran temporarily closed its airspace, forcing airlines to reroute flights.After landing safely, the aircraft had left the runway and was taxiing to the parking bay with passengers on board when the cargo container was sucked into its right engine. Visibility was \"marginal\" due to dense fog at the time, the aviation regulator said. There were around 240 passengers in the aircraft when the container was sucked in, a source from Air India told the BBC. The exact number of crew members could not be ascertained but the source added it could be between six and eight people. According to India's ministry of civil aviation, the incident occurred on Thursday around 05:25 local time (23:55 GMT on Wednesday) as the aircraft was taxiing towards the apron area, where aircraft are parked, loaded, unloaded and refuelled.The cargo container had accidentally fallen from a ground vehicle \"onto the taxiway intersection\", it added.An Air India spokesperson added that the container fell after a wheel came off a cart that was being towed by a vehicle used to move luggage and cargo around the airport. The vehicle operator noticed the aircraft taxiing in and left the area with the remaining cargo.\"However, the container which fell was left behind and it got ingested into the No. 2 engine of the aircraft,\" Air India added.Staff shortages threaten flight safety in India - reportAir India watchdog audit reveals 51 safety violationsThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said metal debris was later cleared from the taxiway, and the aircraft was towed and parked at a designated stand. It added that it has launched a detailed investigation into the incident.Photos shared by DGCA on X show damage to the aircraft's engine casing and fan blades, as well as debris lying on the taxiway.The incident adds to scrutiny around ground safety at India's busy airports.In June last year, the DGCA flagged significant safety lapses at major Indian airports and airlines, finding issues such as faded runway markings, faulty simulator training, crew fatigue, inadequate maintenance and unauthorised cockpit access.Air India has also warned of \"potential disruptions on select A350 routes\" as the aircraft is grounded.Air India operates six Airbus A350 aircraft on long-haul routes, including services to London and New York, Reuters reported. The airline hasn't specified which routes might be affected.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "8 hours agoColletta SmithYour Voice CorrespondentA new funding scheme will give access to emergency cash for people on low incomes across England. The Crisis and Resilience Fund beginning at the start of April will provide £1bn annually for the next three years. People will be able to apply for emergency funds through their local council, whether or not they currently receive benefits. The new rules say councils can give money to people in financial shock where there is \"a sudden, unexpected expense or drop in income\", like a broken boiler, the loss of a job or to prevent people from entering crisis. It is a replacement for the temporary Household Support Fund which had been extended on a rolling basis since it was set up in 2021, but was due to finish at the end of March.The level of funding is broadly the same as the previous scheme, leaving some councils disappointed that there has not been more money allocated. A recent survey for the Local Government Association showed most councils in England did not believe the current funding will be sufficient to meet local welfare needs.The cash element is a significant change to the past scheme, which the government hopes will help fulfil a manifesto pledge to end \"mass reliance on emergency food parcels\".It means councils can give those experiencing difficulties direct access to cash in the hopes of removing the need for hand-out provisions.The guarantee of at least three years of funding mean councils can plan their support schemes and provision over a longer period.Emma Revie, co-chief executive at the Trussell Trust, a charity that supports food banks, said: \"The new Crisis and Resilience Fund is a vital step towards ensuring no-one is forced to turn to a food bank to get by.\"In guidance to councils, the Department for Work and Pensions said the money can be used for three different purposes: crisis payments, housing payments – for those facing an unexpected shortfall, and resilience services for funding the charities and local organisations currently providing front-line support.The payments could help in scenarios such as redundancy, help leaving an abusing relationship or an unexpected bill.  There is no stipulation about how each local authority should divide their funding between those different purposes.Barnardo's, the charity, said shifting the way support is given from vouchers, food bank referrals and emergency food parcels to cash payments will aid millions who are currently dependent on government and council-funded help. Some councils have already been using a cash-first approach and deliver them through Post Office cash vouchers or Pay-By-Text platforms that allow people to withdraw money at cash machines.The charity said those struggling should have more agency to choose how and where they want to spend that cash.\"This guidance sets out how crisis support can be delivered in a way that protects dignity, offers real choice and reaches those who need it most, said Barnardo's chief executive Lynn Perry.\"It has the potential to make a meaningful difference to children growing up in poverty.\"A proportionate level of funding will be given to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but it is up to those authorities to decide how the extra money is used. In England, local authorities will have to publish how they are going to use the money, and open up applications to the public by the 1 April. Minister for Employment Dame Diana Johnson, said: \"Thanks to this £1bn fund local authorities will have the certainty to provide emergency support and stop families falling into crisis in the first place.\"",

She said: \"It's about time we held them to account and said 'what are you showing our children?'\"The lawsuit claims her son Julian \"Jools\" Sweeney, Isaac Kenevan, Archie Battersbee, Noah Gibson, and Maia Walsh all died while attempting a \"blackout challenge\".A TikTok spokesperson said: \"We strictly prohibit content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour.\"Roome has been campaigning for legislation, called Jools' Law, that would allow parents to access the social media accounts of their children if they die. She has been trying to obtain data from TikTok and its parent company ByteDance that she thinks could provide clarity around his death.The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, claims the children's deaths were \"the foreseeable result of ByteDance's engineered addiction-by-design and programming decisions\", which were \"aimed at pushing children into maximising their engagement with TikTok by any means necessary\".Roome said: \"We have our first hearing with TikTok and it's called a Motion to Dismiss hearing.\"So TikTok are trying to kick us out and our lawyers are saying 'no, we've got a case here'.\"If we get past that stage, we get to discovery, where TikTok have to release our children's data if they haven't deleted it.\"From left to right: Parents Hollie Dance, Lisa Kenevan, Liam Walsh and Ellen RoomeRoome said the case \"is not about money\".\"I want to see what my child was looking at, and if it is social media, I want accountability.\"Social media companies are feeding our children harmful material.\"They make their products addictive by design so they automatically have hooked in children and adults.\"Hopefully we're successful, because it's about time these big companies actually became accountable and took some responsibility. \"I just don't feel they've got any morals about looking after our children properly.\"In a statement, TikTok said: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with these families.\"We strictly prohibit content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour. \"Using robust detection systems and dedicated enforcement teams to proactively identify and remove this content, we remove 99% that's found to break these rules before it is reported to us.\"The spokesperson added that TikTok is bidding to dismiss the filing because the court has no jurisdiction over defendants mainly based in the UK and that established US law, like the First Amendment of the US Constitution, bars liability for third-party content hosted on TikTok.Related internet links",

    "body": "8 hours agoNardine Saad and Christal HayesLos AngelesActor Timothy Busfield has made his first court appearance after turning himself in on criminal charges that he allegedly sexually abused two boys on the set of a TV series filmed in New Mexico, prosecutors say.The Emmy-winning actor, who starred in Thirtysomething and The West Wing, was taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse that police allege happened on the set of Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady.Busfield, 68, strenuously denied the allegations through his lawyer.\"The claims being made against Tim are completely false, and we will fight this to the end until the truth prevails,\" the lawyer, Stanton \"Larry\" Stein, said.Stein said the actor, who is also known for his roles in the baseball film Field of Dreams and the comedy thriller Revenge of the Nerds, was being accused as an act of revenge after the children had been terminated from the series, which angered their mother. During a media conference on Thursday, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman said that Busfield made an initial court appearance on Wednesday and a judge ordered that he remain in custody. The case is now being transferred to district court and a hearing has been set for 20 January to determine whether Busfield should be released on bail pending trial.\"Our priority is to protect the rights of everyone involved,\" Bregman said at the news conference, urging anyone with information to contact law enforcement.In a warrant for Busfield's arrest, prosecutors say the parents of boys allege that Busfield groomed and sexually abused the youngsters while working on set for The Cleaning Lady, which Busfield both directs and executive produces. It airs on Fox in the US. In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as \"Uncle Tim\" and alleged that he \"would tickle them on the stomach and legs\". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he \"feared\" that Busfield would \"get mad at him\". The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities.\"They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies,\" he said in the video.His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. \"As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing,\" Stein said.Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find \"corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone\" with the boys. Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl.Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a \"documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior\". In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California \"several years ago\" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento.The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement\" and agreed to go to therapy. Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and \"maintains that they are completely false\". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew.A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. \"She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds,\" her publicist Ame Van Iden said. \"During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"",

    "body": "I didn't give up, I let go. How I came to terms with not having children7 hours agoLucy HookerCaroline StaffordTry hard enough, we are often told, and eventually you'll get what you want.But sometimes the hardest - and bravest - thing to do, is to stop trying.After years of hoping to start a family, including the painful rollercoaster of fertility treatment and a devastating miscarriage on Christmas day, Caroline Stafford, found the only way to find some kind of peace again was to accept it was not going to happen and to build a different future. But that meant overcoming what she calls the \"don't give up\" narrative. Like many people, Caroline and her husband Gareth, who she met at school, took it almost for granted they would have children in due course. \"We spend all our lives trying not to get pregnant. I just assumed as soon as I wasn't trying not to, I would,\" she says.Caroline StaffordCaroline and Gareth met at school in NottinghamshireNearly one in five women in the UK do not have children.That can be for a variety of reasons, including personal choice. But some simply find that the family life they had imagined, does not happen.After a year of failing to conceive Caroline and Gareth went to see the GP. A round of IVF in the UK was followed by more rounds abroad - a process of anxious appointments, medications and injections.At the same time she watched as her friends fell pregnant and had babies of their own.\"We were absolutely delighted for them, but the truth was, it was the worst thing to hear,\" she tells Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett.For anyone in Caroline's situation, simply seeing a parent with a pram can be painful, the source of a gnawing envy.That feeling ate away at her, changing who she was.\"Your world view becomes smaller and often more negative.\"I started to not really like how I was feeling towards other people,\" she says.Friends would tell her not to worry, it would happen in the end, or that she should stop trying, because then she would fall pregnant.Then in November six years ago, out of the blue, her friends were proved right.  Not trying seemed to have worked.She and Gareth had been living in a big farmhouse, in Rutland. They had just moved to a small cottage in a village, a kind of acceptance on some level that the large family they had been dreaming of was not going to be.As the festive season approached they began to share the good news with friends and family.Then on Christmas morning Gareth went out to deal with the dairy herd. By the time he was back she had lost the baby.\"It was the timing, the way it happened. It just felt so cruel.\"Her memories of that day are hazy.But both of them feel that it was the turning point.Caroline StaffordTaking up long-distance running allowed Caroline to change her relationship with her body\"It felt like we both knew it was time to begin to try to let go,\" she says, but that in itself required a huge effort.\"I didn't know at the point whether I was right. But we just began to tread forward,\" she says.She threw herself into work. She had started her business, selling biscuits stamped with personalised messages, during their second round of IVF.At first if people said her business was her baby, she would bristle. These days she finds it comforting. After all, it is something she has nurtured for a decade.She now has a team of 14 in the bakery, sends her biscuits all over the country, and has partnered with a mail order flower firm.For Gareth letting go has meant rethinking his work altogether. He is about to start a new job as a greenkeeper at his golf club.People do ask her if she considered adopting, but she says it \"wasn't the path that we chose.\"\"Adoption isn't just another way to become a parent. It's a major decision.A decade of IVF had changed Caroline's relationship with her own body.\"I was focusing on this one thing it couldn't do,\" she says.She started long distance running and instead of berating her body over its failure, she started celebrating what it could do instead. She has now done four half and full marathons, while Gareth is on his sixth.\"I love the life I've got. \"I don't feel that direct sense of loss any more. It's a different, a softer kind of sadness now.\"She has found a greater sense of peace as time passes. Even that comes though with pangs of guilt, wondering whether coming to terms with her childlessness, means she did not want it enough, or try hard enough.She knows that's still the \"don't give up\" message, nagging at her conscience. \"We're taught growing up that effort equals results, but it's often not how it works.\"Life can still have meaning and it can still have purpose, even when it looks so drastically different from what you expected.\"If you, or someone you know, have been affected by pregnancy issues, please visit BBC Action Line to find information on organisations that can help.All episodes of Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett are available on BBC Sounds.

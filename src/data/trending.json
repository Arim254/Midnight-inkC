    "body": "Woman who drove round bend at 85mph admits killing three men4 hours agoAlan SimpsonJorja Colville will be sentenced in JanuaryA 21-year-old woman who crashed a car after driving round a bend at more than 85mph has admitted killing her three passengers.Reece Williams, 23, Lewis Soden, 24, and Connor Page, 21, all died after the Ford Focus being driven by Jorja Colville crashed near Falkirk in July last year.  The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Colville was also speeding at more than 90mph shortly before the accident outside the village of Dunmore. Colville admitted causing death by dangerous driving and will be sentenced on 8 January at the High Court in Stirling.Her bail was continued.Police ScotlandConnor Page, Lewis Soden and Reece Williams were all killed in the crashJudge Lady Ross told Colville a prison sentence was \"inevitable\" and that there was nothing that could be said to take away \"the desperate pain\" in the lives of the three victims' families.Colville, of Stirling, admitted causing the deaths of the men on 26 July last year by driving dangerously at excessive speed, failing to maintain control of her car, causing it to leave the road and travel onto a verge where it struck a tree.Advocate depute Scott McKenzie told the court that Colville, an early years assistant, had no previous convictions.'Screaming for help'The prosecutor said that on the day of the crash, witness Kirstin Scobbie was driving on Moss Road on the approach to the collision site when she saw Colville's car behind her.She was travelling at about 60 mph, the appropriate speed limit, when the Focus overtook her before pulling back in close to the front of her vehicle.Mr McKenzie said: \"The white Ford Focus pulled away from her at speed.\" Following a series of bends in the road she noticed debris on the roadway and then saw the Focus in bushes.The prosecutor said: \"She noted the vehicle was on its side and had sustained serious damage. \"She stopped her vehicle as she approached the white Ford and saw Jorja Colville covered in blood and screaming for help.\"The court heard that Colville said that there were three people in the car who could not get out.Mr McKenzie said: \"She described that none of them were awake and that she did not know if they were breathing.\"Another driver, Dean Norris, saw the Focus approaching him in the opposing lane and said it momentarily left the road surface due to the dip on the road and formed the impression it was travelling at excessive speed. \"He saw the vehicle land back on the road surface before it lost control as it passed him,\" said the prosecutor.Mr Norris turned back to offer help and went to the Focus, but could not find any signs of life from the three men inside the vehicle. When police arrived Colville confirmed she was the driver and said her boyfriend Reece Williams was in the car along with her friends.Mr Williams had sustained blunt-force injuries to his head, chest, abdomen and limbs in the crash.Mr Soden suffered multiple injuries to his head, neck, chest abdomen and pelvis and Mr Page died from multiple blunt-force head and neck injuries.The court heard that data recovered from the car showed its speed increased greatly on the approach to the crash scene, hitting a maximum speed of 92.6mph prior to a bend and continuing through the bend at speeds in excess of 85mph.Collision investigators said the crash occurred because the driver was \"driving at significantly excessive speed for the road layout and approaching hazards of which she was warned of\".The court heard that a section of the road before the crash site has a series of peaks and troughs with a warning sign in place to alert drivers.Defence solicitor advocate Gordon Martin KC told the court that Colville, who suffered a broken shoulder and ribs, has not driven since the incident.'Kind, generous and hardworking man'Following Colville's guilty plea, Mr Williams' mother Tracy said the tragedy had not only affected her family, \"but Jorja and her family too\".\"We know she didn't set out to cause hurt that day, and this will be something she will carry for the rest of her life,\" she said.In a statement issued through Digby Brown Solicitors, Mrs Williams added:  \"If I close my eyes I can see Reece as a little boy laughing and helping his granddad build a summer house.\"He was adored by his little sister and shared a special bond with his cousins and aunts. I am so proud of the kind, generous and hardworking man he became.\"We have been blessed with these memories but are devastated there will be no more.\"My family and I will never fully comprehend life without Reece.\"",

    "body": "Volodymyr Zelensky will speak to Donald Trump after the US presented Ukraine with a draft peace plan to end the war with Russia.The plan was reportedly drafted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff and his Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev, without Ukraine's involvement. In a statement, Zelensky's office said the US believed the draft plan could \"help reinvigorate diplomacy\" and added that Ukraine had \"agreed to work on the plan's provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war\".Kyiv supported \"all substantive proposals capable of bringing genuine peace closer,\" the statement said. The Ukrainians did not share any details of what the proposal entails, although according to sources quoted by Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters, it includes plans for Kyiv to give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, to cut significantly the size of its army, and to forego many of its weapons. If confirmed, these demands would be heavily slanted towards Moscow's interest - explaining Kyiv's lukewarm reaction to the draft.But in a press briefing for reporters at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected suggestions the plan demands major concessions from Ukraine.She said Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been \"engaging both sides equally to understand what these countries would commit to\".\"It's a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine,\" she said, without providing further details. \"We believe that it should be acceptable to both sides. And we're working very hard to get it done.\"Moscow downplayed the significance of the plan, which is rumoured to include 28 points. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that while there had been \"contacts\" with the US there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".The statement from Zelensky's office came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between the Ukrainian president and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.Despite Kyiv's tepid reaction to the draft, Zelensky said he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.Neither Ukraine nor its European partners were involved in drafting the new plan, and on Thursday European foreign ministers warned against coming up with proposals without consulting Kyiv or Brussels.\"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\" said EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender. Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko told the BBC that Ukraine had \"not been consulted\".\"It looks like someone wants to decide things for us,\" she said. \"And that's very painful for most of us Ukrainians.\"Since starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, including a bilateral summit with Putin in Alaska, several visits by his envoy Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders. But as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict. While Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated. Earlier this week, at least 26 people were in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. More than people were still missing at the site on Thursday.",

    "body": "14 minutes agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterEurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, has halted its UK projects, claiming  \"unsustainable\" levels of taxation has made any future investments \"non-viable\".The company said it had been informed its business rates would increase by some 200% from next year.It hit out at the government, arguing that the higher costs were \"clearly contrary\" to ambitions of growing the economy and increasing investment.The Treasury said it would support firms \"hit hardest\" by tax hikes and would continue talks with affected industries over such concerns.The outburst from Eurotunnel comes days ahead of next week's Autumn Budget, where Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out the government's tax and spending plans.Speaking to the BBC, Eurotunnel's chief executive Yann Leriche said: \"All our investments, all our plans are becoming unsustainable.\"As you know, business rates, it's a property tax. And our property - the Channel Tunnel - has not changed. It's still the same tunnel, the same terminal, the same trains. Everything is equal.\"And so to face such an increase… is a real issue for us. Because we know in rail, we invest for the long term.\"The potential 200% increase in business rates for Eurotunnel is a result of new calculations by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), which provides the government with valuations and property advice used in setting taxation and benefits.Mr Leriche said while discussions were ongoing, this could see its business rates rising from £22m to £65m. A spokesperson for Eurotunnel said such a hike in business rates, along with other taxes, could put its total tax level at about 75% on UK earnings.The VOA told the BBC the body \"does not determine business rates\" and that \"next year's liability has not yet been confirmed\".\"This unparalleled and unsustainable level of taxation makes any future investment in the UK non-viable,\" the Channel Tunnel said. \"It is therefore impossible to develop new services, create jobs, and pursue what is needed for the long-term development of our activities.\"The company claimed it had \"no other choice but to freeze our future investments in railway assets in the UK, starting in 2026\".The BBC has asked Eurotunnel what investments it has frozen. The Financial Times reported that its chief executive, Yann Leriche, told the newspaper it had scrapped plans to reopen a freight terminal in Barking and to run a new direct freight service from Lille. The Channel Tunnel is an undersea tunnel linking southern England and northern France. Nicknamed \"Chunnel\", it comprises three tunnels, two rail tunnels used for freight and passenger trains, and a service tunnel.The link between Folkestone and Calais is operated by Eurotunnel. Separate company Eurostar, Eurotunnel's biggest customer, operates passenger services through the tunnel between London and a number of other European cities on the continent, including Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.A VOA spokesperson told the BBC it had engaged with Eurotunnel and their advisers \"on multiple occasions over the past eighteen months to discuss their valuation and fully explain our approach\". \"These discussions remain ongoing, and we are committed to continuing constructive engagement.\"The spokesperson added Eurotunnel could formally challenge the valuation.Ahead of the Budget, the Eurotunnel called on the government to \"provide certainty on business rates\".The firm has not been alone in issuing warnings to the chancellor, with supermarket bosses claiming part of the government's business rates reforms posed a problem for its industry.Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.It is expected that Reeves will confirm the rates businesses will have to pay at in the Budget, along with further details, which will come into force in April 2026.The Treasury said in response to Eurotunnel's comments that it did not comment on \"speculation around future changes to tax policy\".It said once it understood the \"complete\" revaluation picture, it would be in a position to \"make final decisions\" on support.

Oasis singer Liam Gallagher led the tributes, posting: \"In total shock and absolutely devastated on hearing the news about Mani. My hero, RIP R Kid.\"Getty ImagesMani pictured on stage with Ian Brown in 2004The Stone Roses posted on social media: \"RIP our wonderful brother Mani. The greatest bass player and friend we could ever have wished for. X\"Singer Ian Brown also paid his own tribute on X, writing: \"REST IN PEACE MANi X.\"Mounfield's wife Imelda died in November 2023, three years after she was diagnosed with bowel cancer. The couple have twin boys, who were born in 2013.Happy Mondays frontman Shaun Ryder posted: \"RIP Mani – my heartfelt condolences to his twin boys and all of his family.\"Ryder's Happy Mondays bandmate, vocalist Rowetta, posted a photo of herself with Mani and Imelda on X with the message: \"Going to miss you so much. All my love to the boys, the family & all those who knew & loved him.\"Getty ImagesMani, bottom left, with John Squire, Ian Brown and Reni in the Stone Roses' heyday in 1990With Mani on bass, Brown on vocals, John Squire on guitar and Alan \"Reni\" Wren on drums, the Stone Roses were at the forefront of the \"Madchester\" indie scene of the late 1980s and early 90s.Combining a melting pot of influences from across indie, punk, psychedelic rock, dance, funk and reggae, they released their beloved debut album in 1989, and its harder-rocking follow-up Second Coming came out in 1994. Both albums reached the top five in the UK.Their debut album featured such classic songs as I Wanna Be Adored, She Bangs The Drums and I Am The Resurrection, all underpinned by the grooves of Mani's basslines.After the group disbanded in 1996, Mani joined Scottish rock band Primal Scream, first playing on their album Vanishing Point, released a year later, where his bass playing was a key part of krautrock-influenced lead single Kowalski.Roses reunionGetty ImagesThe Stone Roses pictured in 2012, left to right: John Squire, Mani, Ian Brown and ReniMounfield would go on to record four more albums with Primal Scream before leaving in 2011 to reform The Stone Roses.The band released two further singles in 2016, but no full-length album followed and the group disbanded once more in 2017 after old tensions resurfaced.The Stone Roses played a number of UK gigs over 2016 and 2017 before their split, including a concert at Glasgow's Hampden Park, which would end up being the classic line-up's last concert.Brown told the crowd: \"Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened.\"'One of the absolute best'Last month, Mani told the Rockonteurs podcast he was \"in a great space\" and was \"itching to get back\" on stage.The lead singer of The Charlatans, Tim Burgess, re-posted a picture of the pair together that he had originally shared last week, on Mani’s 63rd birthday.\"One of the absolute best in every way,\" Burgess wrote. \"Such a beautiful friend.\"Echo And The Bunnymen singer Ian McCulloch also posted a tribute on X, saying his \"thoughts and feelings\" went out to his family.\"I'm absolutely gutted to hear the news about Mani, who I have always loved and always will love, deeply and forever. Like a brother,\" McCulloch said. \"I am in shock to be honest.\"Getty ImagesMani also had a guest role in the 2022 movie 24 Hour Party People and was in supergroup Freebass, with fellow bass players Andy Rourke of The Smiths and Peter Hook of Joy Division and New Order.Hook wrote on X: \"Oh God. Mani... words just fail me this time, they really do. I cannot believe it. Sending all my love to his family. This is so sad. RIP mate. Love Hooky. X\"The supergroup disbanded before releasing their debut album, It's A Beautiful Life, in 2010.'A rare person'Liam Walsh, a Manchester-based music publicist and friend, said: \"I've known Mani for 40 years. He was such a rare person: he always greeted me - and everyone - with such warmth.\"He was always pleased to see you, and I was always delighted to see him. He had the most infectious laugh that gave him all those laughter lines.\"Walsh said he was \"in shock\" after hearing the news on his way to a music industry event. \"As I walked in, the Stone Roses' Fools Gold, with that famous bassline of his, was playing in the bar. His legacy will live on forever.\"Away from music, the Manchester-born star was a keen fan of Manchester United, and often spoke about the team on TV and radio.Mounfield's death comes after he announced an in-conversation tour of UK venues, which would have seen him recount his experiences and memories in the Stone Roses and Primal Scream from September next year.",

    "body": "2 hours agoShiona McCallumSenior Tech Reporter Online marketplace Vinted says it has removed sexually explicit adverts, after a mum reported seeing a video depicting what she believed to be a pornographic scene while browsing for clothes. Kirsty Hopley, 44, from Carlisle, said she was searching the app for a dressing gown when the ad popped up.She was sitting next to her teenage daughter at the time.Ms Hopley reported the content to Vinted and later contacted Ofcom.She told BBC News the video, which started playing automatically, showed a \"sickening\" graphic and violent sexual encounter. The law and criminology teacher said she had installed content filters on her home internet and was shocked to see such material on the e-commerce platform.\"I probably won't buy anything from there again, which is disappointing as I love Vinted,\" she said. \"But I don't want to see content like that.\" The platform, which has no age restrictions, has recently faced scrutiny in France after reports that some sellers were using the site to direct users to adult content.The advert Ms Hopley saw was promoting DramaWave, a mobile app that produces short-form scripted stories for social platforms.Many of their series appear to follow romance storylines over multiple episodes of just a few minutes each. Vinted said the adverts have now been blocked. A spokesperson said the platform has a \"zero-tolerance policy for unsolicited sexual communications and the promotion of sexual content\". \"This includes prohibiting sexually explicit advertisements on our platform,\" they said. \"Where listings or ads are found to violate these rules, we will take action, including blocking or removing them.\"The BBC has approached DramaWave for comment. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told BBC News their rules were clear \"that ads must not cause harm or offence\". \"Harmful or degrading portrayals of women in ads are completely unacceptable, and we take a zero-tolerance approach to this kind of content,\" they said in a statement.They added: \"We encourage anyone with concerns about an ad they've seen to get in touch.\"Ms Hopley told BBC News she expected the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), which includes laws to protect children from explicit content online, to have prevented such material appearing on her phone.However the only paid-for advertising that is in scope of the OSA is fraudulent content.

    "body": "3 hours agoNardine Saad, James FitzGerald and Emma Saunders,Culture reporterThe US broadcast regulator has written to the BBC over a Panorama episode that edited together parts of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump.Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chief Brendan Carr wrote to the BBC's outgoing director general Tim Davie - and to top executives at public service broadcasters NPR and PBS, whose member stations air some BBC content.Carr said he wanted to determine if the BBC provided either the video or audio of the spliced speech to any broadcaster \"regulated by the FCC for airing in the US\".The BBC has previously stated it did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.Trump has threatened to sue over the programme, saying it defamed him. The BBC has apologised, while refusing the president's demand for financial compensation. The broadcaster has acknowledged the edit gave \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" on the day of the riot at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021.In Trump's speech in the Panorama episode, Trump: A Second Chance?, he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Of the edit, Carr wrote: \"In doing so, the BBC programme depicts President Trump voicing a sentence that, in fact, he never uttered. That would appear to meet the very definition of publishing a materially false and damaging statement.\"The letter goes on to say: \"As you may know, broadcasters regulated by the FCC have a legal obligation to operate in the public interest. Those public interest requirements include prohibitions on news distortion and broadcast hoax.\"Carr's letter also stated that he was \"writing to determine whether any FCC regulations have been implicated by the BBC's misleading and deceptive conduct\".The BBC has said it has nothing to add to its previous public statements. Last week the corporation set out why it does not think it has a case to answer in a letter to Trump's legal team.As well as stating it did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels, the BBC also said that when the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.The BBC letter also argued that the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.\"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters last weekend of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"Following his threat to sue for \"anywhere between $1bn and $5bn\", Trump was expected to speak to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer about the issue at the weekend. Details have not yet emerged.The Panorama episode was aired in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, which Trump went on to win. The BBC has said it will not show it again.The issue with the episode was highlighted by an earlier Daily Telegraph report that cited a leaked BBC memo written by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee. Mr Prescott also raised concerns about several other elements of the BBC's news output.BBC director general Tim Davie resigned during the furore, as did BBC News chief Deborah Turness. In the US, broadcasting licenses are issued by the FCC and are regulated by the federal agency.The BBC is regulated by the UK watchdog Ofcom.UK-based media lawyer Mark Stephens told BBC News that Trump's team appeared to hope the FCC could establish jurisdiction by proving the edited clip aired in the US.\"In reality, the FCC will likely come up empty. If the programme wasn't broadcast in America, that's fatal to Trump's claim and to the FCC investigation,\" he said.BBC News has contacted the FCC, which shared the letter from its chairman, as well as NPR and PBS, for comment.",

    "body": "54 minutes agoDaniel De Simone and Jo AdnittBBC News InvestigationsSocial mediaWiltshire Police were told in 2016 that serial rapist David Carrick had abused his youngest victim but failed to take action, the BBC can reveal.Carrick, who was a Metropolitan Police officer, went on to rape five women before his arrest in 2021 and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years in 2023. He was handed a further life sentence on Thursday for abusing his youngest victim for 18 months, beginning in 1989, when she was 12 and he was a teenager.Speaking to the BBC, his victim Jo - not her real name - said the way her allegations were handled \"was disgraceful\".Wiltshire Police said the incident was \"a clear case\" of officers failing to properly investigate allegations made to them.A Hertfordshire Police investigation into Carrick, who was originally from Wiltshire, began in 2021 after a woman came forward to say she had been raped by him. He was eventually convicted of raping and abusing 12 women, who came forward to police once the inquiry began.But the BBC can reveal that Wiltshire Police were told in 2016 about Carrick's abuse of his youngest victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.Another person - not Jo herself - contacted the force one night to report what happened decades before. When subsequently contacted by officers, the person said they had been drinking when they contacted police and had a poor memory about what happened years earlier.But Wiltshire Police failed to contact Jo herself and closed the investigation before it even began. They knew that Carrick was a Met Police officer, but did not tell their London counterparts about the reported abuse.Wiltshire officers also failed to search for Carrick in their own systems. Had officers done so, the search would have revealed he was already under investigation for a serious offence reported three days earlier.Jo urges other women to not suffer in silenceJo told the BBC the \"whole way it was handled was disgraceful\".She said that, had she been approached by officers in 2016, she would have told them everything.\"He'd have had five years of less offending if they'd spoken to me.\"She said Wiltshire Police should apologise to the women who were raped after 2016.\"If it was a member of the public, they would have probably done it a lot differently than a police officer.\"Jo wants Wiltshire Police to \"take accountability\" and make sure it never happens to anyone else, she said.In a statement, Wiltshire Police \"apologised unreservedly to the person whose report we did not initially investigate as we should\".Two Wiltshire officers have since been found to have committed misconduct and given final written warnings.Elsewhere, authorities had known about Carrick's abuse of Jo since 1990, when an NHS psychologist interviewed her.A letter from Carrick admitting the abuse was in his medical records, but police vetting didn't uncover it. He went on to join the Met in 2001.In his recent trial, the letter from Carrick was used as evidence. The BBC has separately seen a letter from an NHS psychologist, sent to a local GP practice in1990 who had spoken to Jo about the abuse.But there was no investigation into Carrick at the time.CPSCarrick penned this letter in August 1990 after sexually assaulting JoIn a recent letter to Jo, the NHS has apologised for how the abuse was handled in 1990.The letter says that \"unfortunately, when you were seen in 1990 the organisations would not have had a strong safeguarding governance structure\" and this is \"sadly evidenced in your available medical notes.\"The abuse against you was not fully understood and your voice was not heard in the process.\"Referrals that could have been made – meaning to police and other bodies – \"appear not to have been enacted\", the letter notes.The letter then apologises for this \"historical practice\".Jo told the BBC the abuse in the NHS records should have been identified when Carrick joined the police, and he could have been prevented joining at all.\"He shouldn't have been a police officer,\" she said.Jo said the recent BBC Panorama undercover investigation into Met Police showed a culture in which Carrick would have \"fitted in like a glove\", and that she is alarmed by that.Jo wants change and for women's voices to be heard.\"Just don't suffer in silence\", she said.\"Just keep talking. Keep telling people. If somebody won't listen, go somewhere else.\"\"Everyone should be a valued person. Everyone should be listened to.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoGetty ImagesTeachers could work a \"flexible\" four-day teaching week under new proposals announced by the Scottish government.Plans also include reduced classroom contact time with pupils and agreed national minimum standards for pupil learning hours. It would leave a fifth day for \"professional learning\" activities outside of the classroom, including lesson preparation, marking and training.Scotland's education secretary Jenny Gilruth said it demonstrated a \"clear commitment\" to teachers. But the EIS union said was \"not aware\" of how a four-day week would work.The EIS and NASUWT unions are currently balloting members on strike action over a failure to reduce class contact time - periods when teachers are directly teaching pupils.At the last Holyrood election, the SNP promised to cut contact time by 90 minutes a week to allow more time for other activities.  The new proposals could enable later start times, extended breaks, or restructured school days.The teaching unions emphasised that any allocated time outside of the classroom should be used as teachers see fit.PA MediaJenny Gilruth said the proposals showed a \"clear commitment to teachers\"The education secretary said the plans, along with a new pay deal, would form a new \"National Deal\" for teachers.Jenny Gilruth acknowledged that unions had \"strong\" opinions on these plans and said she would meet with the EIS later.She told BBC Scotland: \"The move to a four-day teaching week would really help to lighten the load in terms of workload, but also to create headspace for the teaching profession.\"We've come forward with some pragmatic solutions and we very much look forward to engaging with local government and also with the teaching trade unions on securing an agreement to ensure we can improve conditions for teachers.\"'Red line for teachers'A survey by the EIS in June found that the workload in schools was \"unfair, unhealthy and unsustainable\". Teachers said they were rarely or never able to do the work, preparation and correcting they had been asked to do within their working week.EIS general secretary Andrea Bradley said the promised 90-minute reduction in class contact time was a \"red line for teachers\".\"There can be no government or employer diktat over how this time should be utilised by teachers,\" she added.Ms Bradley told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the union was not yet aware of how a flexible four-day week would be implemented.She said the Scottish government's proposals did \"not amount to a plan that can be properly scrutinised\" and said it would not affect the EIS strike ballot.NASUWT said it was pleased with the proposals but it needed \"assurance that teachers will have the responsibility for deciding how such time should be used\". A spokesperson added: \"Our members are frustrated at the ongoing delays in the delivery of a clear Scottish government promise to them, which is why we have opened a ballot on industrial action on this matter.\"This is not a proposal to put teachers onto a four-day working week. The discussion is about exactly how a teacher's five day week might be structured.Any changes would come after negotiations involving the unions and councils. But there are clearly important practical issues which need to be looked at, not least in primary schools. Having a different teacher one day a week is different to having a different teacher for an hour, perhaps for PE or another specific subject. But there is real frustration among some teachers over their workloads. The unions want reduced contact time to help cut the amount of work teachers say they have to do in their own time in the evenings and at weekends.Strike ballots over this issue continue.Even if the proposals do not become the definitive long-term solution, will they be enough to avert the risk of a strike in the months before the Scottish election?",

Terence Duddy's BMW knocked a woman off her bike as he turned right on High Street, Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, on 21 June.  The 69-year-old admitted causing serious injury by careless and inconsiderate driving at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court on 13 November and was given an eight-month custodial sentence, suspended for 18 months. BBC Children in Need confirmed Duddy, who was appointed as chair on 21 October, had resigned, saying \"he could not continue in this role\".The collision was in Buckinghamshire in June As well as the suspended prison sentence, the court disqualified Duddy from driving or obtaining a licence for 18 months, fined him £85 costs plus £175 victim surcharge. He will also have to carry out 200 hours of community service in the next 12 months.  Thames Valley Police posted details and footage of the crash with the woman, who was in her 50s, to its Facebook page. It added: \"The cyclist had right of way and a moment of carelessness from the driver, by not properly checking the road was clear to cross, has had a life changing impact on the cyclist.\"Children in Need issued a statement following the sentencing. It stated: \"On Tuesday 18 November, our new chair Terry Duddy informed us that he had been convicted last week of causing serious injury through careless driving. \"In light of this he offered his resignation, which the board accepted, agreeing he could not continue in this role.\"The charity also confirmed \"robust\" checks were carried out prior to Duddy's appointment. A spokeswoman said: \"In accordance with established processes for all senior hires at the BBC robust due diligence was undertaken, including a DBS [criminal record] check. \"No concerns were identified or disclosed during this process.\"The charity confirmed James Fairclough, a trustee since 2021, would be replacing Duddy having formally been appointed chair \"with immediate effect\". \"We remain focused on helping children and young people thrive,\" it said. When Duddy was appointed to the role, the charity said he brought \"a wealth of governance and leadership experience across both the charity and commercial sectors, along with a strong commitment to supporting children and young people\".He was a trustee of the London Marathon Foundation, chair of London Marathon Events and chair of the charity Catch 22.  He has previously held senior commercial roles, including chief executive of Home Retail Group Plc.Children in Need is one of the BBC's corporate charities and last week it raised more than £45m to help children and young people across the UK.It operates independently with its own board of trustees, relying on public donations and other partners to fund its work.Related internet links",

    "body": "19 hours agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHarry Farley,Political correspondent and Sam Francis,Political reporter ReutersMigrants who are in the UK legally could have to wait up to 20 years before they can settle permanently, under government proposals.The Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain will be extended from five to 10 years, and will apply to the estimated 2.6 million who arrived since 2021.The changes will not apply to people who had already obtained settlement.Mahmood said becoming part of the UK is \"not a right but a privilege - and one that must be earned\".The package is the latest in a string of changes to the immigration system announced by Mahmood over the past week.Settlement, also known as Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), allows someone to live in the UK permanently, work without restrictions and access public services. It is also a key step towards British citizenship.Currently, most work and family visa holders can apply for settlement after five years. Under the proposed changes the standard wait will be 10 years - with a range of criteria that would lengthen or shorten that period.Legal migrants who claim benefits for less than 12 months will have to wait 15 yearsPeople who arrived on post-Brexit health and social care visas would have to wait 15 years, up from five year currentlyMigrants reliant on benefits for more than 12 months face a 20-year wait for settlement, four times more than the current period and the longest in EuropeAnnouncing the changes in the Commons, Mahmood said: \"Migration will always be a vital part of Britain's story. \"But the scale of arrivals in recent years has been unprecedented.\"Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused Labour of \"copying and pasting\" policies from his party that it had previsouly \"voted against\".Philp said his part would support the changes, but warned the new system could create loopholes and urged ministers to adopt a migration cap.Reform UK did not respond to the statement in the Commons. But the party has previously announced it would abolish ILR - replacing it with visas that migrants must reapply for every five years. That includes hundreds of thousands of migrants currently in the UK.Home Office figures show net migration added 2.6 million people to UK population between 2021 and 2024.Because of this, settlement grants are also expected to spike over the next five years, with around 1.6 million people forecast to settle between 2026 and 2030.Ministers plan to introduce an \"earned settlement\" system, requiring migrants to demonstrate social integration, economic contribution and good \"character\" before being granted settled status.Applicants will need to meet stricter minimum requirements including the equivalent to A-level standard English language, a clean criminal record and earning above £12,570 a year for at least three years.There will be accelerated routes for those who make an \"outsized contribution\" to the UK.Doctors and nurses working in the NHS will be able to settle after five years. The \"brightest and best\" international talent could have settlement fast-tracked, with high earners and entrepreneurs able to stay after just three years.Family members will not gain automatic status when the main applicant qualifies. Children who came to the UK under the age of 18 may settle with parents, but older dependants could face separate requirements.Existing fast-track routes for victims of domestic abuse, bereaved partners and resettled refugees will remain.Public service union Unison said the changes would be \"devastating to thousands of essential workers\" and put services at risk. Christina McAnea, Unison's general secretary, said: \"Forcing staff, many of whom stepped up during Covid, to wait 15 years for certainty about their futures betrays the promises they were made.\"Ms McAnea warned the government not to \"overlook the care workers, nursing assistants and school support staff from overseas\" as without them \"care services would collapse\".The changes build on measures first set out in the government's May white paper.The government plan to roll out changes from spring 2026, after a consultation ends on 12 February.On Monday, Mahmood announced a sweeping overhaul of the UK's asylum system – including plans to end permanent refugee status and replace it with temporary status subject to review every 30 months.",

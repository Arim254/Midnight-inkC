He then used that stripped, bent twig to spoon the termites into his mouth.</p><p>That observation - in 1960 - challenged the belief that only humans made and used tools.</p><p>Even as she changed our understanding of the natural world, Dr Goodall faced cynicism and sexism. She was not formally trained as a scientist. And, in the 1960s, that was unusual.</p><p>Her work in Gombe went on to show that chimps also form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.</p><p>But her approach – associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \"my friends\" - made her unpopular with the male-dominated scientific establishment.</p><p>Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, saw the value in that informality. </p><p>\"He wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\" she said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1e89/live/a0061a20-9f06-11f0-bf4d-3be239c29483.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1e89/live/a0061a20-9f06-11f0-bf4d-3be239c29483.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e89/live/a0061a20-9f06-11f0-bf4d-3be239c29483.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1e89/live/a0061a20-9f06-11f0-bf4d-3be239c29483.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1e89/live/a0061a20-9f06-11f0-bf4d-3be239c29483.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1e89/live/a0061a20-9f06-11f0-bf4d-3be239c29483.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1e89/live/a0061a20-9f06-11f0-bf4d-3be239c29483.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e89/live/a0061a20-9f06-11f0-bf4d-3be239c29483.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Jane Goodall appears in front of the Forbes logo holding a toy monkey and banana in her hands.\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Dr Goodall was still travelling the world into her 90s with her toy monkey, Mr H, at her side </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Now, the scientific establishment is reeling from the loss of a great scientist.</p><p>Adrian Smith, president of the Royal Society, described her as \"an amazing scientist who inspired people to see the natural world in a new way\".</p><p>Roger Highfield, from the Science Museum in London, which awarded Dr Goodall a fellowship earlier this year, called her an \"inspiration\".</p><p>\"She was formidable and it's incredibly shocking news, because she completely changed how we think about other species and how we think about ourselves - she challenged human exceptionalism,\" he said.</p><p>Jane Goodall eventually turned her focus from her chimpanzees to spreading the word about protecting nature. </p><p>When she spoke to me for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0024x18\">BBC Inside Science in 2024</a>, she was promoting a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation was carrying out in Uganda.</p><p>\"We still have a window of time to slow down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\" she said at the time. \"But it's a window that's closing.\"</p><p>Prof Hobaiter, one of the many scientists Dr Goodall inspired, told me: \"Jane would be the first person to tell us that what the world needs right now is not sadness over her loss, but to get to work.</p><p>\"We all have a lot to be getting on with to make sure that we are not the last generation to live alongside wild chimpanzees.\"</p></div></article>"

Israel has been policing this area but does not have jurisdiction there.</p><p>Israel said its navy told the boats to change course as they were \"approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade\", while the GSF described the interceptions as \"illegal\".</p></div><div><p>The group said Israel's response was \"not an act of defence\", but \"a brazen act of desperation\".</p><p>It estimated 443 people were detained from the boats and alleged that many were assaulted with water cannon. Israel said all those detained were \"safe and in good health\".</p><p>A growing number of countries have expressed concern over the incident, criticising Israel for staging the interception in international waters.</p><p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has expelled all remaining Israeli diplomats from the country in response, and denounced the interception as an \"international crime by [Israel's Prime Minister] Netanyahu\". </p><p>Petro also terminated Colombia's free trade agreement with Israel, in place since 2020, and called for the release of two Colombians who were aboard the flotilla.</p><p>Amnesty International's Secretary General, Agnès Callamard, said Israel's blockade on Gaza was \"unlawful\" and that the \"decades-long impunity for Israel's blatant violations of international law must end\".</p><p>However, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticised the attempt to reach Gaza, saying: \"I continue to believe that all this brings no benefit to the Palestinian people.\"</p><p>Israel's Foreign Ministry posted footage from the interception showing Thunberg sitting on the deck of a boat, being handed water and a jacket by a member of the Israeli military. Detained activists are being taken to the port of Ashdod, Israel said.</p><p>\"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" the Israeli government said.</p><p>Israel has described the flotilla as \"provocation yachts\" and contends that it was justified in stopping the vessels before they entered the naval blockade of the waters that border Gaza.</p><p>It said one boat remained \"at a distance\" and would be intercepted if it approached the blockade.</p><p>That boat appeared to be the Marinette, which the GSF said was still in communication and carrying six people on board. The flotilla's tracking system showed it sailing in international waters a long distance from Gaza's coastline on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Israel said none of the boats entered the blockade area, though the GSF tracking suggests one of its boats, the Mikeno, may have entered Gaza's territorial waters, but remains out of contact.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp\" alt=\"Israeli foreign ministry Greta Thunberg is detained by the Israeli navy after it intercepted a flotilla heading to Gaza\" /><span>Israeli foreign ministry</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The Israeli foreign ministry released footage of its forces detaining Swedish activist Greta Thunberg from one of the boats</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>A member of the legal team working with the flotilla has said there will be a further attempt to breach Israel's blockade \"in the coming days\".  </p><p>Caoimhe Butterly, who is aboard a vessel providing legal support and acting as an observer to the GSF, said: \"There is the expectation that it will be up to 13 vessels, ships and boats and that it will follow a similar route to Gaza.\"</p><p>People have gathered in Greece, Italy, Germany, Tunisia and Turkey to protest against Israel's interception of the flotilla.

    "body": "<div><p>A year after federal prosecutors unveiled a sweeping criminal case against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and months after a trial that revealed shocking details of violence and his private life, the convicted music mogul will learn his sentence. </p><p>He could face up to two decades behind bars, but his attorneys are battling for a more lenient sentence that could see Combs freed in a matter of weeks – or acquitted. </p><p>In July, a jury acquitted him of the most severe charges: racketeering and sex trafficking. But he was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.</p><p>Prosecutors have asked for a minimum of 11 years, but Combs' lawyers have argued that such a sentence would be a dramatic overreach. </p><p>\"In plain terms, prosecutors want to see Diddy defined by the worst-case math, while the defence wants the judge to cut through it and impose something far lighter,\" said Todd Spodek, a New York attorney who once represented fake heiress Anna Sorokin.</p></div><div><p>Federal judges ultimately decide on a final punishment and they have flexibility within guidelines - so the defence and prosecution will spend much of Friday arguing in court over Combs' sentence.</p><p>\"It's like bargaining for anything,\" Mr Spodek said. \"There's the benchmark, there's the number in the middle, and it goes up and goes down.\"</p><p>A probation office, which oversees offenders during and after incarceration,  separately recommended five to seven years in prison, according to Combs' court filings. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9yv4vzy7lo\">Cassie Ventura says she fears for her safety ahead of Diddy sentencing</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c9wykxlk2zpo\">Could Sean 'Diddy' Combs stage a comeback?</a></li></ul><p>But \"ultimately, the judge decides,\" Mr Spodek said. </p><p>A major question looming over the sentencing is how much Combs' conduct towards the victims will factor into New York federal judge Arun Subramanian's thinking.</p><p>While Combs will be sentenced on two prostitution charges, prosecutors have reminded the judge of his past behavior, which came out during testimony and included violence, domestic abuse, and illegal drug use.</p><p>Combs, they argue, is \"unrepentant.\"</p><p>\"The defendant tries to recast decades of abuse as simply the function of mutually toxic relationships,\" prosecutors wrote in a 29 September filing. \"But there is nothing mutual about a relationship where one person holds all the power and the other ends up bloodied and bruised.\"</p><p>His most high-profile victim, Cassandra Ventura, submitted a letter to the judge ahead of sentencing asking for justice and accountability. She said she moved her family away from New York City fearing retaliation.</p><p>\"As much progress as I have made in recovering from his abuse, I remain very much afraid of what he is capable of and the malice he undoubtedly harbours towards me for having the bravery to tell the truth,\" Ms Ventura wrote.</p><p>Combs' team, however, has portrayed him as a reformed man who should receive a sentence of no more than 14 months in prison. His time in jail while the case played out would count towards that total, meaning if the judge agrees, Combs would soon walk free.</p><p>A longer sentence, Combs' lawyers argue, would unfairly keep him from his seven children and elderly mother, and prevent him from receiving mental health care. In court filings, lawyers described Combs' incarceration as \"life changing, productive, and a testament to his desire to return to his family and community and lead the best life possible.\"</p><p>Judges can consider history, character, contributions to society, and previous criminal record during sentencing. </p><p>Combs' lawyers cited examples of his business and the music success as evidence of his contributions. His team also submitted testimonials from family members, and other detainees at the jail where Combs is held. </p><p>In the event that Combs receives an unfavourable sentence, his legal team could appeal the judge's decision to a higher court.</p></div><div><p>Combs' lawyers are making an additional bid to free him at the sentencing hearing: challenging the use of the anti-prostitution law that forms the basis for the charges and conviction.</p><p>Last week, Combs' lawyers asked the judge to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the Mann Act.</p><p>The 1910 law has a controversial history. It originally was an anti-interstate sex law that included a sweeping immorality clause; in practice, it could be applied broadly, covering interracial marriage and affairs. In the 1980s, Congress modernised it, and the law now forms a foundation for federal prostitution and sex trafficking cases. Most recently, prosecutors used it in cases against singer R Kelly, and Jeffrey Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yllvjgpk6o\">After Diddy: Why hip-hop is still struggling to have its own 'MeToo' moment</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qz32wzeego\">What has Sean 'Diddy' Combs been convicted of?</a></li></ul><p>Combs' lawyers argue Mann Act-related charges \"should never have been brought\" because the sexual encounters Combs engaged in were consensual, and they believe his conduct did not amount to \"prostitution.\"</p><p>A Mann Act charge is \"an easier case to make in a court of law than perhaps a trafficking conviction, which requires more elements,\" said Jessica Pliley, a historian at the University of Texas and Mann Act expert. </p><p>Prosecutors, like the ones handling the Combs case, often pair them. \"It's not an uncommon law,\" Professor Pliley said.</p><p>But prosecutors have reminded the judge of accounts from Ms Ventura and a woman referred to as Jane Doe. In filings, they recalled the women's testimony about participating in lengthy \"freak-off\" sessions with Combs and male escorts he requested, even when they felt coerced and suffered physically from the lengthy encounters.</p><p>\"Defendants who perpetrate violations of the Mann Act involving such violence and fear regularly face significant penalties,\" prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo. </p><p>\"The defendant should be no exception—particularly when his history and characteristics demonstrate years of abuse and violence.\"</p></div>"

However, he said his force has done an \"extraordinary amount\" to root out such officers since the Casey Review, ordered after the murder of Sarah Everard in 2021 by serving police officer Wayne Couzens.</p><p>Pressed on whether he should have accepted the review's finding that the Met was institutionally racist and misogynistic, Sir Mark insisted the Met was \"part way through the biggest counter-corruption initiative policing has ever seen in this country\". </p><p>Nearly 1,500 men and women had been removed from the Met, he said, adding: \"Londoners have my word, we won't stop until it's finished.\" </p><p>When asked if he would apologise and take personal responsibility for what was uncovered in the investigation, he said he had apologised \"several times\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9j283j9pko\">in his statement</a>, adding that \"everything the Met does\" is his \"personal responsibility\".</p><p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he had yet to see the BBC's footage for himself, but called it \"shocking\" based on what had been described to him.</p><p>He said he was glad Sir Mark was responding, and called on him to be \"very robust in his response.\"</p><p>Parm Sandhu, a former chief superintendent in the Met, questioned how the force would \"find the solutions\" to the issues raised in the BBC's investigation if it did not accept it had an \"institutional problem\".</p><p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday ahead of Sir Mark's interview, she said she was \"not surprised at all\" by what Panorama had found, adding that the \"behaviours are not new\".</p><p>\"They've been exposed before, they've been buried before and they've been tolerated before, and every single time there's a promise that the toxic culture will be rooted out, but it comes back every single time,\" Sandhu said.</p></div><div><p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the documentary exposed racism, islamophobia, misogyny and criminal behaviour by officers, but that Rowley had his \"full confidence\" and insisted he was the \"right person to undertake the change that we need\".</p><p>However, he also said he questioned Rowley on why it took journalists to expose this behaviour, which \"let down\" London irrespective of the commissioner's efforts.</p><p>Khan described the Metropolitan Police as an \"institutionally racist\", \"institutionally sexist\" and \"institutionally homophobic\" organisation. The commissioner has not himself used these terms to describe the force.</p><p>Zoe Billingham, who served as Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary from 2009 to 2021, told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday that Sir Mark was a \"reforming\" figure, but that the revelations were \"tricky\" for him.</p><p>\"I do think the pace of change really now needs to be demonstrated to Londoners if that precious bond of trust is to be restored,\" she said.</p></div><div><p>Sir Mark told BBC Radio London that the majority of his officers were \"good people\" who cared deeply about policing London, despite the \"far too big of a minority who don't\".</p><p>He added BBC Panorama's documentary showed that progress had been made as officers who held such views were \"going underground\", and the Met would continue to \"go after them and remove them\".</p><p>Londoners \"should trust us because the vast majority of men and women are on the streets day in-day out, working desperately hard to protect them\", he said of the force.</p><p>\"They've got courage, they've got compassion, they've got determination\", he said. </p></div>"

Legal sources suggest the costs could run into hundreds of millions of pounds.</p><p>It originally involved more than 100 defendants, including some 40 individuals and a number of corporate entities.</p></div><p></p><h2>Whistleblower </h2><p></p><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/de0f/live/2aef0270-9f8c-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/de0f/live/2aef0270-9f8c-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/de0f/live/2aef0270-9f8c-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/de0f/live/2aef0270-9f8c-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/de0f/live/2aef0270-9f8c-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/de0f/live/2aef0270-9f8c-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/de0f/live/2aef0270-9f8c-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/de0f/live/2aef0270-9f8c-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Jas Bains A man who appears to be in his 30s - he is sitting on a sofa at home, wearing a light off-white t-shirt, and smiling, clearly relaxed in the setting - he is leaning on the arm of the sofa with his left arm, and his watch is visible \" /><span>Jas Bains</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jas Bains thanked the court for its ruling </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The judge also rejected a claim against Jas Bains, a lawyer who worked at Solo Capital Partners as a senior manager between 2010 and 2013, before joining another firm that was also later implicated in the cum-ex scandal.</p><p>Giving evidence in the trial in April 2024, Mr Bains said he later became concerned about the sheer volume of cum-ex trades being carried out, after hearing reports that Solo Capital was engaged in transactions of huge value. </p><p>Through an intermediary, he contacted the Danish authorities in 2015 to warn them of what was going on and over the next two years, assisted the Danish police in a subsequent investigation.</p><p>Despite his role as a whistleblower, Mr Bains was included in the wide-ranging damages claim from Skat and has spent years fighting legal battles.</p><p>Speaking to the BBC after the ruling, the lawyer said: \"This unnecessary trial cost me eight years of my life and I'm grateful to the justice system for exonerating me.\"</p></div></article>"

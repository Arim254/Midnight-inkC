    "body": "4 hours agoEmily Holt & Yasmin RufoBBC NewsBBCWe all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands. In an industry worth £5.8bn in the UK, there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.The truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.Trichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair. 1. Cold water doesn't make your hair shinier Getty ImagesEver shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair? Well luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair. \"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.She does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.2. No product can repair damaged hair Getty ImagesIf you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.Proudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.Walker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"She says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.Proudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"Other stories you may enjoy3. Your hair won't self-clean  Getty ImagesYou may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all. But Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\" Walker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too. Not washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".Proudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.  Laura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.4. Dry shampoo isn't a substitute for washingGetty ImagesFinding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower. Proudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes. The problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out. \"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says. \"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"Ultimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.

It also carries an image of ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy hand-in-hand with wife Carla Bruni as he heads to jail for the start of a five-year sentence.Brexit hit the economy \"even harder than feared, says Reeves\" is The Independent's top story. \"Leaving the EU 'needlessly' added costs for British businesses\" it quotes the chancellor as saying. Now, with \"one month to go until crunch Budget\", the UK is \"rebuilding ties with Brussels\". Bruni and Sarkozy are also featured having a farewell kiss.The governor of the Bank of England is hearing \"alarm bells\" writes the Financial Times as it reports Andrew Bailey drawing comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. The paper also carries the image of Sanae Takaichi after the \"historic vote\" that saw Japan elect its first female PM.\"Putin defies Trump as peace talks collapse\" is the lead story for the Daily Telegraph.

It also carries a big image of Carla Bruni with her hands together on the day her husband went to prison.Former PM Boris Johnson's admission to the Covid inquiry that \"our lockdowns failed kids\" headlines the Metro. The paper quotes him as saying children paid a \"huge, huge price\", while standing by his handling of the pandemic.The Daily Mail reports the grooming gang inquiry is \"in chaos\" after three abuse survivors resignations from the process. The paper calls one of the withdrawal of one of the candidates in the running to the lead the review as a \"farcical development\".\"Family law shift hailed as victory for children facing domestic abuse\" headlines The Guardian. I says family courts will no longer have to operate under the presumption that contact with both parents is in the best interests of a child after the \"landmark change\".The Daily Star dubs Johnson \"Bozo the killer clown\" after he gave evidence at the Covid inquiry. The former PM described himself as \"homicidal\" after schools minister Gavin Williamson's \"U-turn\" on A-levels.\"Off you trot, Mr Windsor\" says the Sun after \"fury over free rent\". Following its story of Katie Price's ex-husband Kieran Hayler being charged with three counts of rape and one of sexual assault, the paper claims Ms Price may speak at his trial.The Daily Express headlines with a plea from the sister of 16-year-old Sasha Marsden, who the Express says was stabbed \"100 times\".

    "body": "7 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondent, Jerusalem andJake LaphamA small number of British planning officers has been sent to Israel to join a US-led multinational taskforce to help monitor the ceasefire in Gaza, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.The taskforce, called the civil military coordination centre, is also likely to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE, US officials have previously said.British troops are not going into Gaza, as it currently stands, and they are not being sent into a combat zone.The Israeli government has approved the first phase of a Gaza deal with Hamas, which has led to a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners.Earlier this month, American officials said up to 200 US troops already based in the Middle East would be moved to Israel to support the taskforce.They said it would be led by US Central Command (Centcom) based in the region, and was intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and also help coordinate humanitarian assistance.In a statement, a spokesperson for the MoD said the UK \"continues to work with international partners to support the Gaza ceasefire to see where the UK can best contribute to the peace process\".In a speech at Mansion House on Monday, Defence Secretary John Healey said the UK had sent a senior commander to deputise for a US commander tasked with running the centre in Israel, following an American request.He said Britain \"can contribute to the monitoring of the ceasefire\", but others would take the lead.\"Britain will play an anchor role, who will contribute to the specialist experience and skills where we can but we don't expect to be leading in the way,\" Healey added.An MoD source said the efforts were part of \"showing the UK is playing its part in setting the framework on what comes next\".Further work on what more the UK can contribute is understood to be under discussion.In the first two decades of this century, the UK military has built up extensive experience in capacity-building for security forces, first in Iraq, then in Afghanistan, which is partly why Centcom requested its participation. British officials have also been working in the West Bank since 2006 to help train the Palestinian police.Set against that is Britain's historic role in the Middle East. For 25 years, Britain was the colonial power in the area known as Palestine in World War One, departing in haste in 1948 as the State of Israel was created. There is still much bitterness amongst many Palestinians who blame Britain and the 1917 Balfour Declaration for what has happened to them since.The UK deployment comes after a visit by US Vice-President JD Vance to Israel on Tuesday, where he said the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire was \"going better than expected\".Vance also warned that \"if Hamas does not co-operate, it will be obliterated\", while refusing to give a deadline for when the Palestinian group must disarm - a part of US proposals yet to be agreed.The two special US envoys who helped negotiate the ceasefire deal, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, appeared alongside Vance at a news briefing in southern Israel.One of the points in US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza plan included the US working with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary international stabilisation force to immediately deploy in Gaza.This point is yet to be agreed between the sides and would only happen if a hostage and prisoner exchange was completed.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.At least 68,229 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

Separately, the BBC has also reached out to Hamilton's team and Chelsea Football Club for comments. In its ruling on Kwiff, which is run by Eaton Gate Gaming, ASA said that a researcher from the University of Bristol had lodged a complaint over concerns that the firm's post on X would likely appeal to under-18s.Kwiff's post featured an image of Hamilton with text highlighting a \"huge weekend\" for him at the British Grand Prix in the Silverstone race, accompanied by an \"18+\" symbol and the BeGambleAware.org logo, ASA said.The post also included a link to an article on Kwiff's website about the race, it added.Eaton Gate Gaming had said that its data indicated that Hamilton appealed to an older audience rather than those aged under 18, ASA wrote.The post was meant to drive traffic to their their company blog, which was an \"editorial commentary\" on a website separate from their gambling platform, Kwiff told ASA.Kwiff has since reviewed its social media accounts and removed any content that displayed mainstream sportspeople, ASA said.\"We considered Sir Lewis Hamilton was a notable star within the sport, with a significant public profile and social media following,\" the ASA ruling said.The authority also cited Hamilton's 150,000 Instagram followers who were under 18 and based in the UK as a sign of his appeal among youths. It also said Hamilton had appeared in the F1 24 video game - which had an age rating of three years old and above - and was a storyteller on a programme aired by the BBC's CBeebies last year.\"As such, we considered that Kwiff would have been aware of the possibility that Sir Lewis Hamilton would have strong appeal to under-18s,\" it added.Separately, ASA also ruled that Betway's advertisement breached its code.YouTube, according to ASA, was an unsuitable platform for the advert, as advertisers could not guarantee that their content would exclude under-18 viewers.\"It was likely that there was at least a significant number of children who had not used their real date of birth when signing up to YouTube,\" ASA said.Betway told ASA it had the contractual right to use Chelsea's logo in its role as the club's official European betting partner.Betway said that YouTube's own ad policies offered further safeguards against under-18s being exposed to age-restricted content, according to ASA's statement.Banning the advert could set a \"damaging precedent for gambling sponsorships in sport\", Betway told the report.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAdam Mandeville andCatherine MooreBBC News NIWatch: Police van set alight during protest outside Dublin migrant hotelSix people have been arrested after Irish police were attacked with bricks, fireworks and glass bottles at a protest outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Dublin.A police vehicle was also set on fire at the Citywest Hotel, in Saggart, on Tuesday evening. A line of riot police prevented the protesters getting to the hotel.Gardaí (Irish police) said protesters attempted to breach the police cordon by charging the line with horse-drawn sulkies (carts). Some carried garden forks and tools, while others damaged walls to get missiles.The police helicopter was targeted with lasers, and one officer received medical attention for a foot injury.Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly said: \"The actions can only be described as thuggery. This was a mob intent on violence against gardaí.\"I utterly condemn the attacks on gardaí who did their jobs professionally and with great courage to keep people safe.\"He said about 300 officers were on duty, with about half from the public order unit. A water cannon was deployed, as well as officers on horseback and a dog unit.Broadcaster RTÉ reported that several thousand people had gathered near the hotel.Riot police kept protesters away from the migrant hotelTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin said there could be no justification for attacks on police.\"There can be no justification for the vile abuse against them, or the attempted assaults and attacks on members of the force that will shock all right-thinking people,\" he said.\"I pay tribute to the frontline gardaí (Irish police) who acted courageously and quickly to restore order.\"Ireland's Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan said there was \"no excuse\" for the violent scenes.He added: \"This is unacceptable and will result in a forceful response from the gardaí. Those involved will be brought to justice. \"It is clear to me from talking to colleagues that this violence does not reflect the people of Saggart. They are not the people participating in this criminality, but rather the people sitting at home in fear of it.\"Speaking during the final Irish presidential debate on Tuesday, Heather Humphreys described the violence as \"absolutely awful\".\"This is not what we are as a country,\" she said.The other presidential candidate, Catherine Connolly, said the scenes in Saggart were \"very upsetting\".She added that \"we need to be careful in this country\" about the divisions emerging.",

    "body": "13 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East Correspondent, JerusalemUnder Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, the \"yellow line\" - which Israel withdrew to earlier this month - is the first of three stages of Israeli military withdrawal. It leaves it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.One Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, referred to it as \"effectively the new border\" in Gaza.It's a remark that will please the far-right coalition partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The fortifications and demarcations Israel is now building along this boundary are meant to clearly divide the territory, but they may also help to blur the differing hopes and expectations of Mr Netanyahu's allies in Washington and at home.How long he can keep both sets of expectations in play depends largely on this next stage of negotiations.The boundary marked by the yellow line is temporary, but further withdrawal of Israeli forces rests on resolving the difficult issues pinned to the second stage of Donald Trump's deal – including the transfer of power in Gaza and the process for disarming Hamas.Washington is keen that nothing upset this next delicate stage of negotiations. US Vice-President JD Vance flew in on Tuesday to push Netanyahu to press on with peace talks. Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with the Israeli PM on Monday.Israeli newspapers have been reporting that Netanyahu is receiving a stern message from his American allies to \"show restraint\" and not to endanger the ceasefire.When Israel complained that Hamas had violated the terms of the ceasefire on Sunday, killing two soldiers, the response advocated by Mr Netanyahu's far-right National Security Minister was a one-word demand: \"War\".Instead, Israel carried out an intense, but brief, wave of air strikes, before reinstating the truce, and was careful to emphasise that its troops had been attacked inside the yellow line – keen to show Washington that Israel had not broken the rules.Netanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas is dismantled – its disarmament, and the full demilitarisation of Gaza, are among the conditions he has set.But Israeli commentators are lining up to say that the real decisions over Israel's military action in Gaza are now being made in Washington.The yellow line – and the daunting task facing negotiators in this second stage of the deal – are clues as to why Netanyahu's coalition partners have chosen to wait, rather than carry out a threat to bring down his government.The dream for many extremist settlers – and ministers – is that the next stage of this process will prove impossible to resolve and the yellow line will indeed become the de facto border, opening the way to new settlements on Gazan land. Some hardliners would like Israel to annex the whole of the Gaza Strip.The vast majority of Israelis want an end to the war and for the remaining bodies of the hostages, and Israel's serving soldiers, to come home.But Israel's prime minister is known as a politician who likes to keep his options as open as possible, for as long as possible, and this is a deal in stages, with caveats built in.Agreeing to this first stage meant withdrawing to positions that left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, and agreeing to a ceasefire in order to get hostages home.From here, it will become harder to align the goals of his US and domestic allies.Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that violations of the deal by Hamas – including its failure to disarm – would allow Israel to return to war.\"If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better,\" he told the Israeli public earlier this month. \"If not, it will be achieved the hard way.\"Donald Trump has said the same.  But Washington has so far shown a tolerance for delays and violations in implementing the deal on the ground, leaving Netanyahu with far less political room than perhaps he'd like.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSean FarringtonBusiness presenter andMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe head of global theme park giant Merlin Entertainments says its \"biggest competition\" is people choosing to stay at home on their phones and other devices. Fiona Eastwood says a day out at one of its UK attractions - which include Legoland, Thorpe Park and Alton Towers - was the \"perfect antidote\" for spiralling screen time. In a wide-ranging BBC Big Boss Interview, the chief executive reflected on challenges in the forthcoming Budget, big brand partnerships, and how its customers were responding to cost-of-living pressures.Eastwood also highlighted the importance of seasonal attractions to its customers - with Halloween now rivalling its summer season in driving profits at some attractions. Having been in the job since February, Eastwood has taken over at a time when her industry is facing challenges from a dip in consumer confidence. Her company's latest half-year update flagged concerns over a \"softening of demand\" in the UK theme park sector and fewer international visitors. Last year the company's overall revenue was down slightly to just over £2bn, with an operating loss of £132m. Despite the challenging environment, Merlin drew just shy of 63 million people to its attractions in 2024. Escapism was something people were willing to spend on, Eastood says.\"The moments to be together are increasingly precious, and what we provide is quite distinct,\" she says. \"It's all about families coming together to play.\"Getty ImagesFiona Eastwood said she was not a big fan of riding on Alton Towers' Nemesis roller coaster - and that the Wicker Man attraction was more here speed Talking about its UK attractions, which include Madame Tussauds, Sea Life and the London Eye, Eastwood says seasonal windows are key.Its major theme parks have hosted Halloween events, like Scarefest at Alton Towers and Fright Nights at Thorpe Park, since 2002. \"We're a very seasonally led business,\" says Eastwood. \"So you have spring break, Easter, summer and Halloween. \"Halloween, that we're in now, we're seeing some really strong performance. That's in view of the amazing product we have. You take Thorpe Park, increasingly Halloween is almost half of its annual profits.\"Along with seasonal offerings, big brand partnerships are also a key part of Merlin Entertainments' strategy - creating rides themed around children's tv hits to tempt families away from their screens and into the parks.Next year it will open its first Bluey ride at Alton Towers as part of CBeebies land, as well as PAW Patrol land opening at Chessington World of Adventures. One of next year's biggest launches is a collaboration with video game Minecraft - an enduring mega hit since it was launched in 2009, spawning one of the highest grossing films of 2025.With Eastwood citing screen time as Merlin's toughest competition, it hopes an £85m investment in immersive experiences will attract Minecraft fans with themed rides, restaurants and accommodation in the UK and US during 2026 and 2027.\"What I'm really excited about in terms of Minecraft is bringing [the game] to life in a physical way that will mean the massive fans of that game can then be in the game with their friends, their parents,\" says Eastwood. Call for a VAT cut Eastwood is on the board of Hospitality UK, an industry trade body which has been calling for VAT on hospitality to be cut from 20% to 12.5%.\"What we really want is a growth-led Budget,\" says Eastwood. She adds that cutting VAT would put the UK on a \"level-playing field\" with its European neighbours - where hospitality businesses often face a rate of about 10%. Making the case for this, Eastwood pointed to a period during Covid when VAT was cut to 12.5%. \"We saw a bump, and we saw demand, and we saw people wanting to spend,\" she says.In a statement, the Treasury said the government was supporting all UK businesses and the upcoming Budget would aim to encourage growth and investment.\"We are a pro-business government that has capped corporation tax at 25%, the lowest rate in the G7, we're reforming business rates, have secured trade deals with the US, EU and India, and have seen interest rates cut five times since the election, benefiting businesses in every part of Britain.\"While Eastwood has been CEO for less than a year, her time with Merlin stretches back a decade, with her joining shortly after Alton Towers Smiler rollercoaster crash in 2015.Coming into the chief executive role, she says her focus was trying to take an \"outside view\" of the company - aware that she could have bias and blind spots. She adds one of the best parts of her role is getting out to visit the sites. \"Nothing beats going to the theme park, that is my job,\" she says. \"Spending time with the team, seeing kids having an amazing experience at our attractions.\" However, asked about getting to the front of the queue for Nemesis - the Alton Towers ride that is one of the best known in the country - Eastwood did not have any concrete advice, despite joining front-line workers on the ride last year. \"I'm not a big fan of Nemesis,\" she says. \"My favourite's actually Wicker Man, I love Wicker Man.\" ",

    "body": "Israel's military says the bodies of two hostages returned by Hamas on Tuesday have been identified as Aryeh Zalmanovich and Master Sergeant Tamir Adar.Mr Zalmanovich, 85 at the time of his death, was abducted from his home in kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in captivity on 17 November 2023, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.Mr Adar, 38 when he died, was a member of Nir Oz's community security squad and was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen during the 7 October attack.The return of their remains means that Hamas has transferred 15 out of 28 deceased Israeli hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal earlier this month. Their coffins were handed over to troops in the Palestinian territory by the Red Cross, which had earlier received them from Hamas. The IDF said the coffins - which were escorted by the military - had crossed into Israel and will be taken to be formally identified in Tel Aviv. Hamas has handed over a Palestinian body in a previous hostage transfers, which it said was accidental due to difficulties locating the bodies.All 20 living hostages were released shortly after the agreement was reached.Before the latest remains were identified, the IDF stressed that \"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages\".There has been outrage in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the deceased hostages. The Palestinian group says it is trying to do this but that it faces difficulty finding bodies under rubble of buildings bombed out by the IDF in Gaza.Under the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for every Israeli hostage's remains.The first phase of the agreement has also seen an increase of aid into Gaza, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in fighting - though deadly violence flared up over the weekend as both sides accused one another of breaching the terms of the deal.The IDF launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.More than 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "4 hours agoStuart LauNurPhoto via Getty ImagesUkraine has hit a Russian chemical plant with UK-made Storm Shadow missiles, the Ukrainian military said on Tuesday.Calling the strike \"a successful hit\" that penetrated the Russian air defence system, Ukraine's general staff of the armed forces said they were still assessing the outcome of the \"massive combined missile and air strike\".The Kremlin has been warning the West not to give Ukraine weapons capable of long-range attacks, but Kyiv says it's imperative to target Russian facilities that play a key role in Moscow's war against Ukraine.\"The Bryansk Chemical Plant is a key facility of the aggressor state's military-industrial complex\", the Ukrainian military said in an X post on Tuesday.The attack came on the same day that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders vowed to \"ramp up the pressure on Russia's economy and its defence industry\" until Russian leader Vladimir Putin \"is ready to make peace\".A joint statement - co-signed by the Ukrainian, German, French, Italian, Polish, Danish, Finnish, EU and Norwegian leaders - added that \"Ukraine must be in the strongest position - before, during, and after any ceasefire\".Russia launched an overnight air attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Wednesday morning, according to the city's mayor, Vitali Klitschko.Witnesses heard explosions that sounded like air defence units in operation, the Reuters news agency reported.The latest attacks came after a meeting at the White House last week between Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the US leader indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv.Trump initially agreed with Putin to hold talks in Budapest regarding the war in Ukraine, possibly in the coming weeks. But that plan was put on hold on Tuesday, with Trump saying he did not want a \"wasted meeting\".Watch: \"I don't want to have a wasted meeting\", says Trump on talks with PutinIn remarks at the White House, the US president indicated that a key sticking point remained Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line.Just last month, Trump appeared to take a major shift in his position towards ending the war, saying Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\" - referring to Ukraine's internationally recognised borders.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsular Moscow annexed in 2014.",

    "body": "Effects of antidepressants on physical health ranked for first time4 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentGetty ImagesSide effects of different antidepressants have been ranked for the first time, revealing huge differences between drugs.Academics looked at the impact medications had on patients in the first eight weeks after starting treatment, with some causing patients to gain up to 2kg in weight or vary heart rate by as much as 21 beats every minute.Around eight million people in the UK take antidepressants.Researchers warned the gulf in side effects could affect people's health and whether they could stick to their prescription.They said nobody reading this should stop their treatment, but have called for antidepressants to be closely matched to the needs of each person.\"There are big differences between [antidepressants] and this is important not just for individual patients, but large numbers of people are taking them, so even modest changes could have a big effect across the whole population,\" said researcher Prof Oliver Howes.We've always known antidepressants affect physical health. The study by King's College London and the University of Oxford is the first to produce a ranking so the effects of medicines can be easily compared.The team analysed 151 studies of 30 drugs commonly used in depression, involving more than 58,500 patients.Not everybody develops side effects but, on average, the results published in the Lancet medical journal showed:An eight-week prescription of agomelatine was linked to a 2.4kg drop in weight compared with maprotiline, which led to nearly 2kg of weight gainA difference of 21 beats per minute between fluvoxamine, which slowed the heart, and nortriptyline, which sped it upAn 11 mmHg difference in blood pressure between nortriptyline and doxepin\"Clearly no two antidepressants are built the same,\" said Dr Atheeshaan Arumuham, from King's College London.Those differences can stack up in ways that become clinically important, including an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.It means even people with the same diagnosis could be better suited to different antidepressants depending on their own preferences and other health conditions.Which antidepressant is best for me?In a hypothetical scenario, Sarah, 32, John, 44, and Jane, 56, have all received the same depression diagnosis and have been recommended antidepressants.But they each want to avoid different side effects. For Sarah, the priority is avoiding weight gain, while John already has high blood pressure and Jane has raised cholesterol.Dr Toby Pillinger, who worked through the examples for the BBC, says each would be recommended a different medicine.Dr Toby Pillinger says: Sarah should have an antidepressant that avoids weight gain, such as agomelatine, sertraline or venlafaxine rather than amitriptyline or mirtazapine which are more likely to increase weight.Dr Toby Pillinger says: John should avoid drugs such as venlafaxine, amitriptyline or nortriptyline which raise blood pressure, and would be better suited to citalopram, escitalopram and paroxetine.Dr Toby Pillinger says: For Jane, some antidepressants are linked to higher cholesterol, including venlafaxine, duloxetine and paroxetine, so she might steer clear of those. Citalopram or escitalopram are more neutral on cholesterol and could suit her better.Push for 'generic, cheap medications' It is too simplistic to say there are good and bad antidepressants, the researchers say. Even though amitriptyline increases weight, heart rate and blood pressure it also helps with pain and struggling to sleep. Overall, the most prescribed class of antidepressants - SSRIs such as paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline - tended to have fewer physical side effects. Fluoxetine - an SSRI that is also called Prozac - was linked to a drop in weight and higher blood pressure, in the study. Prof Andrea Cipriani from the University of Oxford said it was \"impossible\" to say how many of the millions of people being prescribed antidepressants should be on a different drug.However, he said there had been a push for \"generic, cheap medications\" that meant 85% of antidepressant prescriptions in the UK were for just three drugs: the SSRIs citalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine.He said implementing the findings of this report would see \"the 85% reduce dramatically\" with \"more people accessing better treatments\".The researchers are developing a free online tool to help doctors and patients choose the right drug. However, that would still require a significant change in culture within the NHS. The study also only analysed what happened eight weeks after starting treatment. Dr Pillinger said \"complimentary data\" meant they expected the short-term changes \"will persist\" but this still needs to be properly tested.Dr Prasad Nishtala, from the University of Bath which was not involved in the study, said the findings were \"novel and valuable\".He said: \"In a real-world setting, where patients often receive antidepressants for months or years, the cumulative risks are likely to be higher, particularly among those with chronic depression.\"",

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

    "body": "6 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentReggae legend Sly Dunbar, who played with everyone from Bob Marley to The Rolling Stones, has died at the age of 73.One of the genre's most revered drummers, he played on tracks such as Bob Marley's Punky Reggae Party and Dave and Ansell Collins' classic, Double Barrel.However, he was better known as half of the production team Sly & Robbie - who produced groundbreaking hits for everyone from Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru, to non-reggae acts like Bob Dylan, Grace Jones and Ian Dury.Dunbar's death was first reported by his wife, Thelma, who told the Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner she had found him unresponsive on Monday morning. The musician's agent and publicist confirmed the news to the BBC. Born Lowell Fillmore Dunbar in Kingston, Jamaica, he started out playing on tin cans, after watching Lloyd Knibbs and the Skatalites on television.\"I saw [Knibbs] playing and I thought, 'I want to be a drummer' because he's the hardest worker in the band,\" he said in a 1997 interview.\"He's my idol! In some ways, I'm self-taught but I got a lot of help from other drummers by watching them play.\"In his teens, Dunbar met bassist Robbie Shakespeare and formed the rhythm section of the Revolutionaries, who became regular session musicians at the famed Channel One recording studio.Their sound differed from the melody-rich music of Bob Marley, with a heavier emphasis on the beat - including the pioneering \"rockers\" rhythm, which introduced more syncopation and energy to the music.They spent the 1970s working with major reggae acts like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown and Barrington Levy, while touring the US with Peter Tosh.According to legend, the duo lived on bread and water in that period, hoping to save enough money to start their own production company.Taxi Records was duly founded in 1980, and nurtured a new generation of Jamaican artists such as Shaggy, Shabba Ranks, Skip Marley, Beenie Man and Red Dragon.Around the same time, they provided the thunderous beats on Grace Jones's hit 1981 album Nightclubbing, which opened the doors for them to work with some of rock and pop's greatest - from Dylan and Joe Cocker, to singers like Marianne Faithfull, Madonna and Sinead O'Connor.At home, they earned a reputation for updating the sound of reggae by incorporating more electronic instruments and textures.Later on, they developed a bright and melodic take on dancehall with the duo Chaka Demus & Pliers, scoring hits with songs such as Tease Me and Murder She Wrote in the early 1990s.At one point, Shakespeare (who died in 2021) estimated that he and Dunbar had taken part in more than 200,000 recordings, either their own or as backup musicians or producers for other artists.\"When you buy a reggae record, there's a 90% chance the drummer is Sly Dunbar,\" producer Brian Eno told the New Music New York festival in 1979. \"You get the impression that Sly Dunbar is chained to a studio seat somewhere in Jamaica, but in fact what happens is that his drum tracks are so interesting, they get used again and again.\"Dunbar's wife said she had found him unresponsive in bed at around 07:00 on Monday, 26 January.\"I went to wake him up and he wasn't responding, I called the doctor and that was the news,\" she said. An exact cause of death was not given, though Dunbar had reportedly been ill for some time.\"Yesterday was such a good day for him,\" Thelma told Jamaica's Gleaner newspaper. \"He had friends come over to visit him and we all had such a good time. He ate well yesterday... sometimes he's not into food. I knew he was sick... but I didn't know that he was this sick.\"Among those paying tribute was British DJ David Rodigan, who called Dunbar a \"true icon\" and \"one of the greatest drummers of all time\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoFallout following the decision to block Andy Burnham from standing in a forthcoming by-election has continued, with the Mail reporting a growing rebellion among government officials. It reports that 50 MPs have signed a letter protesting against the decision, noting that pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has \"intensified\".The Times says that senior Labour figures have \"privately conceded\" that they expect to lose the Gorton & Denton by-election as a result of the Burnham block. The paper says the fight for the seat is \"likely to be deeply divisive\", with the Greens and Reform UK \"set to pile pressure\" on Sir Keir. The prime minister has defended his decision regarding Burnham, insisting that allowing him to run for the seat would \"divert our resources\" from \"very important\" campaigns in May's elections.Several papers picture former Man United footballer Sir David Beckham and his family at an award ceremony in Paris, after Lady Beckham became a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters. Under the headline \"Clan united\", the Sun calls it a \"show of solidarity\", noting it is the first time that the family have been seen together following the row with Brooklyn, the eldest son, on Instagram last week. The couple were joined by their other three children - Romeo, Cruz and Harper.\"You are my everything\" declares the Star, pairing the photo of the family in Paris with a quote from Lady Beckham's Instagram post to mark her acceptance of the knighthood.Though the Beckhams are also front and centre of the Guardian, the paper's headline reads: \"Tories face backlash after 'mental health' jibe over Braverman's exit\". It reports that the Conservative Party had to correct the record after they initially said Suella Braverman had defected to Reform UK because of \"mental health\" issues. In a fresh statement, the party said the original had been a draft version sent out in error.A beaming Braverman and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage are splashed across the Mirror, paired with the headline \"Reform's latest con\". The i Paper says the statement regarding Braverman comes amid a growing Conservative party exodus. The front page also features Farage saying the Tories face a \"cataclysm\" in May's elections. \"More January transfer deals!\" declares the Metro, marking both the defection of Braverman and an updated cast for The Great British Bake Off. It confirms that Nigella Lawson with replace Prue Leith in the forthcoming series of the beloved television show.The price of gold is leading the Tuesday edition of the Financial Times, after it hit $5,000 per troy ounce for the first time. The paper says Monday also saw the US dollar sink to a four-month low, amid fears of another government shutdown.The Telegraph says China has been hacking the mobile phones of senior officials in Downing Street for \"several years\", as part of an operation that the paper understands \"compromised senior members of the government\". Previous claims of phone hacking were dismissed by China as \"baseless\".Holocaust survivor Eva Clarke, 80, has given an interview to the Express to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, telling the paper that she is still hopeful for a better future if people can stand up to prejudice and tackle rising antisemitism.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "The government will announce a cap on ground rents paid by leaseholders in England and Wales on Tuesday morning, the BBC understands. Labour's 2024 election manifesto promised to \"tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent charges\".However, there had been suggestions the government could retreat from its pledge due to concern about the potential impact on pension funds. The government has not yet confirmed where it will set the cap, but campaigners have said they believe £250 a year is likely. Earlier this month, former Housing Secretary Angela Rayner had urged the government to stick to its manifesto pledge on ground rents. There are around five million leasehold homes in England and Wales, where people own the right to occupy a property via a lease for a limited number of years from a freeholder.Leaseholds is the default tenure for privately-owned flats, and the Land Registry estimates that 99% of flat sales in 2024 in England were leasehold. Ground rents were abolished for most new residential leasehold properties in England and Wales in 2022, but remain for existing leasehold homes. The English Housing Survey has estimated that in 2023/24, leasehold owner-occupiers reported paying a median annual ground rent of £120 a year. In 2024, when Labour were in opposition, the current Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said his preference was for ground rents to be capped at effectively zero.Recent reports have suggested that the Treasury and the housing department have been at loggerheads over the issue, with concerns over how a cap would impact pension funds which own freeholds. Last week, former Labour minister Justin Madders told the BBC that the prime minister could face a \"mass rebellion\" if the government abandoned its pledge on a ground rent cap.He said setting the limit at a peppercorn rate would be his preferred choice but that he could accept a £250 cap due to the \"risk of elongated legal challenge\".A spokesperson for the Residential Freehold Association has previously said that capping ground rents \"would be an unprecedented and unjustified interference with existing property rights, which would seriously damage investor confidence in the UK housing market\".Harry Scoffin, founder of the Free Leaseholders campaign group, has said: \"At the election, Labour promised to end the feudal leasehold system and if they backtrack on reducing ground rates to a peppercorn or zero financial value they're not ending the leasehold scam.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoRichard Wheelerpolitical reporterAround 50 Labour MPs have signed a letter objecting to the decision to block Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham from standing in a forthcoming parliamentary by-election, BBC News understands.They have written to Sir Keir Starmer to warn the decision is a \"real gift\" to Reform UK, as polling suggests Burnham may be Labour's \"very best chance at winning\" the vacant Gorton and Denton seat.The signatories added there was \"no legitimate reason\" to block Burnham and asked for Labour's ruling National Executive Committee to \"re-evaluate\" the decision.Defending the move, Sir Keir said allowing Burnham to contest the seat would have diverted Labour's resources away from other important elections.\"Resources, whether that's money or people, need to be focused on the elections that we must have, not elections that we don't have to have,\" he said earlier. \"And that was the basis of the NEC decision.\"Burnham has been seen as a potential leadership rival to Sir Keir but would have to return to Parliament in order to mount a challenge. The letter was addressed to Sir Keir, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in her role as chair of the NEC, and Labour Party General Secretary Hollie Ridley.It said the decision to block Burnham had caused a \"huge amount of anxiety and anger\" amongst colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party and party members across the country.Around half a dozen Labour peers also signed the letter, the BBC has been told. Members of the NEC voted on Sunday morning to deny Burnham permission to stand in the contest.Labour won the seat in 2024 with a 13,000 majority but Reform UK and the Greens are both expected to pose a greater challenge this time round.Speaking to BBC Newsnight, former Labour cabinet minister Harriet Harman said her parliamentary colleagues should move on and focus on winning the by-election, instead of discussing the decision to block Burnham.",

    "body": "A Tokyo court has asked Pyongyang to pay 88 million Japanese yen ($570,000; £416,000) to four people who were lured to North Korea decades ago by a propaganda scheme.The plaintiffs said the North was marketed to them as \"paradise on Earth\", but they instead found themselves subject to harsh conditions, including forced labour. They later escaped. Monday's ruling is largely symbolic with no real way to enforce it: North Korea has for years ignored the lawsuit, and its leader Kim Jong Un has not responded to Japanese court summons.But the ruling, which comes after a years-long legal battle in Japanese courts, has been hailed by the plaintiffs' lawyer as \"historic\".This was the first time \"a Japanese court exercised its sovereignty against North Korea to recognise its malpractice\", said Atsushi Shiraki, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, AFP reported.More than 90,000 Zainichi Koreans - ethnic Koreans who live in Japan - moved to North Korea between 1959 and 1984, under a resettlement scheme which promised an idyllic life of free healthcare, education and jobs. But instead survivors say they found themselves forced to work on farms and factories, subject to restrictions and could not leave.One of the plaintiffs, Eiko Kawasaki, went to North Korea in 1960, when she was 17. She escaped in 2003 and is now 83 years old.She was among a group of five plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit in 2018 demanding compensation. Two of the original plaintiffs have since died, but one of them continued to be represented in the lawsuit by their family.In 2022, a Tokyo district court rejected their compensation claims, saying that it fell outside Japanese jurisdiction and the statute of limitations had expired.But in 2023, the Tokyo High Court ruled that the case was in fact under Japanese jurisdiction and found that North Korea had violated the plaintiffs' rights.\"It's not an overstatement to say most of their lives were ruined by North Korea,\" judge Taiichi Kamino said at a ruling at the Tokyo District Court on Monday,  according to an Associated Press report. Kenji Fukuda, another lawyer for the plaintiffs acknowledged the significance of the ruling but said it would be a \"challenge\" actually getting any money from North Korea. ",

    "body": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he will not be forced to \"choose between\" relations with the US or China, ahead of the first visit of a British leader to Beijing in eight years.Sir Keir said the UK would maintain \"close ties\" with the US on business, security and defence, but added that \"sticking your head in the sand and ignoring China... wouldn't be sensible\". In the interview with Bloomberg News, he said the visit to the world's second-largest economy could bring \"significant opportunities\" for British companies. Dozens of UK business leaders are expected to travel with him.The trip comes days after the UK approved controversial plans for a vast new Chinese embassy in London.The long-delayed decision was made despite opponents warning it could be used as a base for Chinese spying. \"I'm often invited to simply choose between countries. I don't do that,\" Sir Keir said in the interview.\"I remember when I was doing the US trade deal, and everybody put to me that I'd have to make a choice between the US and Europe, and I said, 'I'm not making that choice.'\"\"We've got very close relations with the US – of course, we want to – and we will maintain that business, alongside security and defence,\" he said.\"Equally, just sticking your head in the sand and ignoring China, when it's the second-biggest economy in the world and there are business opportunities wouldn't be sensible.\"Of the delegation travelling with him to China, Sir Keir added: \"They understand the opportunities that there are... That does not mean compromising on national security – quite the opposite.\"The trip, which includes stops in Beijing and Shanghai, comes after a turbulent  few weeks in relations between the US and its allies. In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on allies for opposing his demand to take control of Greenland, and later provoked a backlash in the UK by saying Nato troops had stayed \"a little back\" from the front line in Afghanistan. Trump also threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country struck a trade deal with China. Sir Keir has previously said that failing to navigate a relationship with China would be a \"dereliction of duty\", rejecting the \"isolationism\" put forward by opponents of the Chinese government in the UK.\"For years we have blown hot and cold,\" he said. \"We had the golden age, which then flipped to an Ice Age. We reject that binary choice.\"In the interview with Bloomberg, Sir Keir suggested he would bring up disagreements with Beijing on human rights, including the fate of Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon who was found guilty of colluding with foreign forces in December.Lord Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, told the Press Association that Sir Keir would be \"pathetic\" if he did not raise the case of Lai who is a British citizen.British policy toward China, Lord Patten continued, had rested on a \"falsehood\" that \"in order to do business with them, we must avoid saying anything they don't like or doing anything that they don't like\".He added: \"What will not persuade them is if it becomes the 'oh, by the way' issue in meetings where you don't actually raise something until the end as you're going out, just so you can tell the press you did it.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoHenry Zeffman,Chief political correspondentandJennifer McKiernan,political reporter The by-election to replace former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne is likely to take place at the end of February, after the process to hold the poll was begun.On Monday, government chief whip Jonathan Reynolds asked for the writ for the Gorton and Denton constituency to be issued in Parliament.The by-election has to take place between 21 and 27 working days from the issuing of the writ, so the poll is likely to fall on Thursday 26 February.Sir Keir Starmer has opted for the fastest possible by-election timetable in the seat, amid anxiety in the Labour Party about the bitter fallout from a potential defeat.The Greater Manchester constituency has been represented continuously by Labour for more than 90 years but sources from different wings of the party fear that the by-election could be won by either Reform UK or the Greens.The rapid timetable is designed to constrict the amount of time the two parties have to build a campaigning infrastructure in the constituency.While the decision by the prime minister and other officers from Labour's ruling national executive to block Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, from becoming the candidate for the seat has been criticised by some MPs, the backlash has not been as great as some allies of Sir Keir feared.However, several MPs - including MPs who supported the decision to exclude Burnham - said they now believed that if Labour lost the by-election it would trigger a destabilising burst of leadership speculation surrounding the prime minister because he is so closely associated with the decision to bar Burnham.While a by-election defeat in a formerly safe seat would not be unheard of for a governing party, it would raise the political stakes even further for Sir Keir ahead of the May elections, where the Scottish and Welsh parliaments as well as some councils in England are being contested.There is a widespread expectation among Labour MPs that at least some of their number would respond to a bad set of results by trying to force a leadership contest.In the 2024 general election, Gwynne won the seat with just over 50% of the vote share, with Reform UK's Lee Moffitt second and the Green Party third.George Galloway's Workers Party of Britain came fourth, with the party's candidate Amir Burney getting 10% of the vote.No party has announced the names of their candidates yet, but selection processes have been confirmed as \"in motion\" by the Greens, who said local members should have finished choosing a candidate by early next week.A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: \"When that information is ready to share, we will certainly update you.\"Reform and the Conservatives have been contacted for comment, but Nigel Farage told reporters on Monday that the party's candidate would be announced on Tuesday.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDearbail JordanandPeter HoskinsUS President Donald Trump has announced he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports to 25% after accusing Seoul of \"not living up\" to a trade deal reached last year.In a post on social media, Trump said he would increase levies on South Korea from 15% across a range of products including automobiles, lumber, pharmaceuticals and \"all other Reciprocal TARIFFS\".Trump said South Korean lawmakers have been slow to approve the deal while \"we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to\".South Korea says it had not been given official notice of the decision to raise tariffs on some of its goods, and wanted urgent talks with Washington over the issue.It added that South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, who is currently in Canada, will visit Washington as soon as possible to meet US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.South Korea's benchmark Kospi stock index fell on Tuesday morning but was trading about 1.8% higher later in the day as shares in major exporters recovered.Seoul and Washington reached a deal last October, which included a pledge from South Korea to invest $350bn (£256bn) in the US, some of which would go to shipbuilding.The following month, the two countries agreed that the US would reduce tariffs on some products once South Korea started the process to approve the deal.The agreement was submitted to South Korea's National Assembly on 26 November and is currently being reviewed. It is likely to be passed in February, according to local media.Tariffs are paid by companies who import products. In this case, US firms will pay a 25% tax on goods they buy from South Korea.Trump has frequently used tariffs as leverage to enact foreign policy during his second term in the White House.On Saturday, he threatened Canada with a 100% tariff if it struck a trade deal with China.On Monday, Chinese officials said its \"strategic partnership\" agreement with Canada is not meant to undercut other countries.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country was not pursuing a free trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it.He added that Canadian officials have made their position clear to their American counterparts.Before that, Trump said he would impose import taxes on eight countries - including the UK - who opposed US plans to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark which is a member of Nato.He later backed down from the tariff threat over Greenland citing progress towards a \"future deal\" over the island, but the episode strained US relations with Denmark and other Nato allies.

    "body": "5 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesThe menopause is linked to changes in the brain similar to those seen in Alzheimer's, according to a large UK study.The loss of grey matter in areas involved with memory and emotion might partly explain why women are generally at greater risk of dementia than men, researchers speculate.The findings come from nearly 125,000 women, of whom 11,000 had MRI brain scans. In the study, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use did not appear to prevent the grey matter loss. Prof Barbara Sahakian, senior author and from Cambridge University, said: \"The brain regions where we saw these differences are ones that tend to be affected by Alzheimer's disease.\"Menopause could make these women vulnerable further down the line. While not the whole story, it may help explain why we see almost twice as many cases of dementia in women than in men.\"The brain changes occurred in:a area which has a major role in learning and memory - the hippocampusa region essential for forming memories and spatial navigation - the entorhinal cortexa part which helps with attention and regulating emotions - the anterior cingulate cortexWhite matter and grey matter are both essential parts of the brain and spinal cord. Grey matter consists of neuronal cell bodies and their dendrites - short protrusions that communicate with neurons nearby. White matter consists of long axons of neurons that transmit impulses to more distant regions of the brain and spinal cord.Asking for help According to guidelines for the NHS, HRT can be considered for menopausal symptoms such as sleep problems and hot flushes. There is limited understanding of the effects of menopause and HRT use on the brain, memory and mood, say the researchers.The study found women on HRT were more likely to suffer poor mental health. But may of those already had poorer mental health before being prescribed the medication.Co-researcher Dr Christelle Langley said it was important to recognise the variety of struggles that can come with menopause. \"We all need to be more sensitive to not only the physical, but also the mental health of women during menopause. \"There should be no embarrassment in letting others know what you're going through and asking for help.\"Michelle Dyson from the Alzheimer's Society said women account for around two-thirds of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the UK.\"And while we still don't fully understand why they are more susceptible than men, it is thought that hormones may play a role,\" she said.\"This large study adds to evidence showing how menopause impacts the brain, including physical changes such as loss of brain volume.\"But without long-term participant tracking, to check if they later develop dementia, we cannot be sure that these brain changes associated with menopause also increase dementia risk.\"She said getting regular exercise, not smoking and limiting alcohol intake can help cut the risk of dementia.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterThe Beckham family has made its first joint public appearance since an Instagram post from Brooklyn Beckham confirmed a rift in the family.Last week, Brooklyn said in a statement he had no wish to reconcile with his family and accused his parents of attacking him and his wife in the press.On Monday, Sir David and Lady Beckham were joined by three of their four children - Romeo, Cruz and Harper - during an appearance at Haute Couture Fashion Week in Paris.The appearance came as Lady Beckham received a new accolade by becoming a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters.Posting on her Instagram after receiving her award, Lady Beckham said: \"I'm so honoured to be named a Chevalière de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. \"I have always deeply admired the French aesthetic and the seriousness with which it treats fashion: as a form of art. \"So to be recognised here and embraced in this way, is a profound privilege - one that reflects decades of commitment and dedication. My sincere thanks to the French Minister of Culture, Rachida Dati, for this honour. \"Thank you also to business partners who believed in me, my family, and especially David - my husband, and original investor. \"I couldn't be more grateful, you are my everything.\"The honour is awarded by the French Ministry of Culture, and recognises individual contributions of artists, writers, and cultural figures to the arts and literature.It has previously been given to actresses Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, director Denis Villeneuve and actor Jude Law, among others.Although this is the Beckhams' first appearance as a family since Brooklyn's Instagram statement, several of them have been pictured individually in recent days.Lady Beckham attended her bandmate Emma Bunton's 50th birthday over the weekend, while Sir David appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.Meanwhile, Romeo appeared at US designer Willy Chavarria's show in Paris, while Cruz announced a mini-tour with his band in the UK and Europe.In his Instagram post, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham said he does not want to \"reconcile\" with his family and accused his parents of \"attacking\" him and his wife Nicola Peltz Beckham in the press.Brooklyn, the Beckhams' eldest child, alleged his parents tried \"endlessly to ruin\" his relationship, and accused his mother Victoria of hijacking their first wedding dance.The Beckhams have not commented on the row, but Sir David, speaking generally about social media in Davos on Tuesday, said that children are \"allowed to make mistakes\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is lent against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "5 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/Getty ImagesMeta boss Mark Zuckerberg is one of the big tech executives who will give evidence during the trialA landmark social media addiction trial in which top tech executives are expected to testify begins on Tuesday in California.The plaintiff, a 19-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of the platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health.The defendants include Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - TikTok's owner ByteDance and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled with the plaintiff last week. The closely-watched case at Los Angeles Superior Court is the first in a wave of such lawsuits, which could challenge a legal theory used by tech firms to shield themselves from culpability in the US.'Dangerous and addictive algorithms'The named social media companies have said the plaintiff's evidence falls short of proving they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders.The case going to trial marks a distinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms, which face mounting claims that their products lead to addictive behaviours.The companies have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, exempts platforms from liability for what third parties post.But at issue in this case are design choices about algorithms, notifications and other features that affect how people use their apps.KGM's attorney, Matthew Bergman, told the BBC the case will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial.\"Unfortunately, there are all too many kids in the United States, the UK, and around the world who are suffering as KGM does because of the dangerous and addictive algorithms that the social media platforms foist on unsuspecting kids,\" he said.\"These companies are going to have to explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the lives of our young people.\"Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, told the BBC that losing these cases in court could pose an existential threat to the social media companies.But he said it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove physical harms can be blamed on content publishers.\"The fact that the plaintiffs have been able to sell that idea has opened the door to a whole bunch of new legal questions that the law wasn't really designed to answer,\" he said.'The tech industry has been given deferential treatment'At trial, jurors are expected to see an array of evidence, including excerpts from internal company documents.\"A lot of what these companies have been trying to shield from the public is likely going to be aired in court,\" said Mary Graw Leary, a law professor at Catholic University of America.Meta previously said it introduced dozens of tools to support a safe environment for teens online, but some researchers have disputed the effectiveness of the recent measures.The companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users.One highly-anticipated witness the jury will hear from is Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who is due to testify early in the trial.In 2024, he told US senators \"the existing body of scientific work has not shown any causal link between social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes\".During that same hearing, at the prodding of one senator, Zuckerberg apologised to victims and their loved ones who had crowded into the chamber.Tech executives \"are often not good under pressure\" said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at George Washington University. She said the firms were \"very much much hoping\" they could avoid having top bosses testify.The trial comes as the companies face growing scrutiny from families, school districts, and prosecutors worldwide.Last year, dozens of US states sued Meta, alleging the company misled the public over risks of social media use and had contributed to a youth mental health crisis.Australia has enacted a social media ban on under-16s, and the UK signalled in January it may follow.\"There is a tipping point when it comes to the harms of social media,\" Franks said. \"The tech industry has been given deferential treatment - I think we're seeing that start to change.\"",

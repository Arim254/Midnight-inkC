    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max Verstappen is aiming to equal Michael Schumacher's record of winning five consecutive F1 drivers' championshipsByF1 Correspondent in AustinFor the first time all year, Max Verstappen said after the United States Grand Prix that winning the world championship was a real possibility.It felt like a significant moment, because until now Verstappen has been dismissing the idea.That made sense during McLaren's imperious form from the beginning of the year to the end of the summer.Even when Verstappen started winning races in September, the points gap to the McLaren drivers was so big that the four-time champion refused to entertain the idea in public, even if he might have been thinking about it in private. He was taking it race by race, he said, and not thinking about the championship.Verstappen said the same thing at the start of the weekend in Austin, even though he had won two of the past three grands prix and finished second in the other. A McLaren had not finished ahead of him since the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August.After a race weekend in which Verstappen took pole and victory in both the sprint and grand prix itself, he could have said it again. He might even have been expected to. But the belief in him now was almost palpable.\"For sure, the chance is there,\" Verstappen said. \"We just need to try and deliver these kind of weekends to the end. We will try. It is exciting.\"Of course we know we need to be perfect to the end of the season to have a chance, but we will try, and if we succeed, of course amazing.\"If we don't, we tried everything we could to the end and we kept it exciting. That's the spirit for us. It's positive pressure. It's not putting anything on us. We're not stressed about it. We're just going flat out.\"Verstappen's remarkable runThe statistics of the last four races over the past month and a half are quite remarkable.After the Dutch Grand Prix, Verstappen was 104 points behind McLaren's Oscar Piastri in the championship, and 70 adrift of Lando Norris. Now, he is 40 points behind the Australian, whose lead over his team-mate has been cut to just 14 points.Verstappen expressed his own incredulity at what he had achieved. If someone had told him after Zandvoort this would happen, he said, \"I would have told him he was an idiot.\"But we found a good way with the car. It's simple as that. Of course, we put some upgrades on the car, but we just understood our car a bit better, where we wanted it to perform better.\"A 64-point gain in four races tells its own story, but how it has come about is just as remarkable.McLaren trounced Red Bull through the summer races in Europe - until the Italian Grand Prix in early September, when an upgraded floor and front wing finally gave Verstappen the balance he had been craving all year.Since then, the Red Bull has been the fastest car. Until this weekend in Austin, that could have been explained away through circuit characteristics - Monza, Baku and Singapore are all short, slow corners, and require good braking and traction.The McLaren's strengths are not in this area - they are in long-duration, medium-speed corners, where they crush everyone else.But Austin is a \"normal\" circuit, a road course not a street circuit, not a high-speed outlier like Monza, with a good range of corners. And Verstappen won again.There are five races left, two of them sprint events. If he keeps closing on the McLaren drivers at the rate he has been, he will win a fifth consecutive title, it's as stark and simple as that.Norris 'had the pace to win'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc battled all race over second positionThere are circuits to come that play to McLaren's strengths - Brazil, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, the team have singled out.But Verstappen's recent form brings everything into question.On Saturday in Austin, McLaren team principal Andrea Stella was saying that the Verstappen-Red Bull combination could be the fastest at every remaining track this year.By Sunday, though, Stella's tone in public had become more positive. He was encouraged, he said, by the fact that Norris \"had the pace to win the race today\".This, Stella said, had been proved on the few laps Norris was able to run his pace. Verstappen agreed.\"As soon as Lando was in clean air,\" the Dutchman said, \"it was very evenly matched or he was slightly faster. We managed to gap to the end but it was not super-easy.\"Norris' problem was that he spent the vast majority of the race stuck behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.Ferrari were the only team to pick the right strategy. Leclerc started on soft tyres, which gave him the grip off the line to pass Norris into the first corner.Most teams started on the mediums, expecting the race to be a one-stop on the medium and hard tyres. But it soon became apparent in the first stint that the cars who had started on hards were struggling.Leclerc held Norris back for the entire first stint. He pitted first, fitting the medium tyres, while the McLaren driver stayed out on his mediums. When Norris finally pitted, fitting the softs instead of the hards that had been the plan at the start of the race, he emerged behind Leclerc again, inevitably.He expected to be able to pass relatively easily, but although he caught the Ferrari quickly, Leclerc fended him off again. Norris backed off to cool his tyres and had another go, and it was not until five laps from the end that he was finally able to claim second place.Had he held on to it at the start, the race could have been very different. \"Performance-wise,\" Stella said, \"we are reassured that the pace was sufficient to fight for the victory.\"This was especially encouraging because the crash between the McLaren drivers that had taken them both out of the sprint on the first lap had cost them valuable learning.That meant McLaren had had to be conservative with their set-up, especially in terms of ride height, because they lacked the necessary data on a track where other teams have in the past been caught out by the bumps and been disqualified for excessive floor wear.McLaren had to err on the side of caution, and it inevitably cost them performance. Hence the encouragement from the fact that, despite that compromise, they were nevertheless competitive in the race.Piastri denies pressure getting to himImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Oscar Piastri won seven of the first 13 races this seasonAs Verstappen closes on both McLaren drivers, so Norris has been closing on Piastri - he was 34 points behind his team-mate after Zandvoort; he has now reduced that by more than half.Piastri finished behind Norris in Monza, had a very poor weekend in Baku, and lost out in Singapore when Norris barged past him at the first corner.This weekend was different. He lacked pace from the off, never comfortable with the car, always lagging about 0.2secs behind his team-mate.\"I don't think there's an overwhelming trend that things are in a bad way,\" Piastri said. \"It's just that this weekend has been has been tough. So we'll try and understand why that was the case. And try and bounce back next week.\"He denied that the pressure was getting to him.\"No, I don't think so,\" Piastri said. \"The pressure has been there the whole year.  This weekend, I didn't really feel like I made any mistakes. It just wasn't very fast.\"There's some weekends where it just doesn't click for you. And this was one of those. When you feel like you've done a reasonable job and just the pace hasn't been there, I don't think that's really what pressure looks like.\"I've been in fights that were as close or at this point even closer than what they are now. So I've got the evidence for myself that things can still turn out well and I still fully believe that I can win the championship.\"There's still a long way to go in the championship. Max has obviously chased it down pretty quick, but it's not exactly a small gap with five rounds to go.\"Ultimately, if we can find our way again, find our pace, certainly for me find our pace again, then I don't have any major concerns.\"'Results will take care of themselves'Norris, Piastri and McLaren as a whole are heading into new territory.The drivers and the team have not fought for a drivers' title before, although Norris threatened Verstappen last year. The only exception is Stella, who is the veteran of many close battles, when he was race engineer for Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso at Ferrari.His job now is to keep the team and drivers on an even keel, to try to brush off the pressure and focus on the job in hand.\"We keep talking about the fact that what we are facing in this moment - which is a tight competition to win races, a tight competition in the quest for the drivers' championship - is what Formula 1 is about,\" Stella said.\"If anything, it was anomalous when we were doing easily P1, P2, like in Barcelona, in Bahrain, and some other places. That's not what Formula 1 is about.\"It's a process of getting used to this kind of pressure, which we want to live with maximum intensity and minimum stress.\"We don't want to lose the joy of doing what we do. We just want to make sure that we put ourselves in the state in which we perform at our best, which also includes having fun and keeping recognising that ultimately it's quite a big privilege to be in this situation.\"And it's a privilege that came thanks to the good work that McLaren, the team, the two drivers, have been able to do.\"So what we do in the future is very easy. We keep doing the good work and the results will take care of themselves.\"",

    "body": "46 minutes agoCharlotte EdwardsBusiness reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesPizza Hut is to close 68 restaurants and 11 delivery sites in the UK with the loss of 1,210 jobs, after the firm running them fell into administration.DC London Pie Limited, which operates Pizza Hut's UK restaurants, appointed FTI Consulting as administrators on Monday.However, Pizza Hut's global owner Yum! Brands has agreed to save 64 restaurants, preserving 1,276 jobs.Pizza Hut is well known for its family-friendly dining and salad bar, but its UK business has been struggling and had previously gone into administration less than a year ago.DC London Pie had bought Pizza Hut UK's restaurants from insolvency in January this year. The company also owns Pizza Hut franchises in Sweden and Denmark.A spokesperson for Pizza Hut UK said: \"We are pleased to secure the continuation of 64 sites to safeguard our guest experience and protect the associated jobs.\"Nicolas Burquier, managing director for Pizza Hut Europe and Canada, said: \"This targeted acquisition aims to safeguard our guest experience and protect jobs where possible.\"He added that the immediate priority for Pizza Hut was \"operational continuity at the acquired locations and supporting colleagues through the transition\".Zoe Adjay, a senior lecturer in hospitality at the University of East London, said Pizza Hut had been \"at the forefront of bringing fast food into the UK\" in the 1970s, but had struggled to remain relevant amid increased competition.\"The pizza market has become a lot more upmarket,\" she said. \"There's a lot more high-end pizza and they've taken a huge market share.\"Ms Adjay added that Pizza Hut had also failed to establish itself on social media in the same way as some of its competitors.More on this story",

Japan's conservative views on abortion are rooted in patriarchy and deeply traditional views on the role of women.ASKA Pharmaceutical said in a statement on Monday that it \"has obtained the marketing authorisation as a switch to OTC [over-the-counter] use of the emergency contraceptive pill commercialised under the trademark Norlevo\".There will be no age restrictions on buyers and no requirement for parental consent, the saily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported.The company said it had filed for regulatory approval in 2024, following prescription-free trial sales of the pill the year before.During the trial, Norlevo was made available at 145 pharmacies in Japan. Until then, the pill had only been supplied at clinics or pharmacies with a doctor's examination and prescription.At the time, rights groups criticised the trial, saying it was too small, and called for restrictions to be lifted. Campaigners have long argued that requiring a prescription deterred younger women and rape victims from accessing emergency contraception.Selling the drug without prescription was first discussed by a health ministry panel in 2017 - the public consultation found overwhelming support across the country.But officials stopped short of giving it the green light then, saying that making it more easily available would encourage irresponsible use of the \"morning-after\" pill.Norlevo - and the generic version levonorgestrel - works best within 72 hours after unprotected sex and has an efficacy rate of 80%.",

    "body": "34 minutes agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterMcVitie's Penguin and Club bars are no longer classed as chocolate after rising cocoa prices led the makers to switch to using other ingredients.Club bars had previously been marketed under the slogan: \"If you like a lot of chocolate on your biscuit, join our club\". But both treats are now described as \"chocolate flavour\" because the amount of cocoa they contain has been reduced after owner Pladis had to find cheaper alternatives to the main ingredient in chocolate.The UK sources cocoa beans from West Africa and poor harvests as a result of severe drought conditions in cocoa-producing countries, such as Ivory Coast and Ghana, have led to restricted supplies and higher prices.The change to the bars' ingredients was first reported by trade journal The Grocer.A spokesperson for Pladis said: \"We made some changes to McVitie's Penguin and Club earlier this year, where we are using a chocolate flavour coating with cocoa mass, rather than a chocolate coating.\"\"Sensory testing with consumers shows the new coatings deliver the same great taste as the originals,\" the spokesperson added.The company said it was committed to delivering \"great-tasting snacks\" while managing rising costs, and it only adjusted its recipes when \"necessary\".Confectionery historian Alex Hutchinson said many confectioners were lowering the amount of cocoa ingredients in their chocolate in favour of cheaper alternatives. When processed, a cocoa bean becomes cocoa liquor, which contains 50% each of cocoa solids and cocoa butter.But manufacturers looking to save costs can reduce the amount of ingredients they use which are directly from the bean, and instead use alternatives such as palm oil or shea butter.For milk chocolate to be classified as such, UK regulations say it should be made up of about 20% cocoa solids, slightly lower than EU regulations which stipulate a minimum of 25%.The move from Pladis, which owns well-known household favourites such as McVities, Godiva, Go Ahead and Jacobs, means the firm is now using less than 20% cocoa-bean derived ingredients in its \"chocolate\" coating for Club and Penguin.Although cocoa commodity prices have eased slightly recently, a surge in costs over the past three years led to pricier Easter eggs and squeezed profit margins at some chocolate-sellers.\"During my lifetime the cost of cocoa has stayed around $3,500 (£2,607) dollars a tonne and last year it soared to $11,500 (£8,567) a tonne,\" said Ms Hutchinson.\"Chocolate costs more than ever before,\" she added.",

    "body": "43 minutes agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorAmazon Web Services (AWS) has had a bad day.That's how the boss of another big US tech firm Cloudflare put it – probably feeling very relieved that today's outage, hitting over 1,000 companies and affecting millions of internet users, had nothing to do with him.The places hit by the outage vary significantly. It took out major social media platforms like Snapchat and Reddit, banks like Lloyds and Halifax, and games like Roblox and Fortnite. AWS is a US giant with a large global footprint, having positioned itself as the backbone of the internet.It provides tools and computers which enable around a third of the internet to work, it offers storage space and database management, it saves firms from having to maintain their own costly set-ups, and it also connects traffic to those platforms.That's how it sells its services: let us look after your business's computing needs for you.But today something very mundane went very wrong: a common kind of outage known as a Domain Name System (DNS) error. People who work in the tech industry will be rolling their eyes right now.This common error can cause a lot of havoc.\"It's always DNS!\" is something I hear a lot. When someone taps an app or clicks a link, their device is essentially sending a request to be connected to that service.DNS is supposed to act like a map, and today AWS lost its bearings – platforms like Snapchat, Canva and HMRC were all still there but it couldn't see where they were to direct traffic to them.These errors happen for a number of reasons.Usually it's a maintenance issue or a server failure. Sometimes that's human error, someone misconfiguring something somewhere, or in extreme cases a cyber attack - although there's no evidence of this so far.AWS said it occurred at its vast data centre plant in North Virginia, its oldest and biggest site.A chorus of experts have said today is a textbook illustration of the risks of putting all of your eggs in one basket in terms of a service provider - AWS is a giant and millions of businesses rely on it.And they are right, but the issue is there aren't many alternatives at the sheer scale provided by AWS. There are only two main contenders in fact, and they're both other US giants: Microsoft's Azure and Google's Cloud Platform.Smaller rivals include IBM and the Chinese firm Alibaba. The parent company of the supermarket Lidl launched a European rival called Stackit last year, in direct competition with Amazon.But AWS remains the dominant player by some margin.Some argue the UK and Europe urgently needs to build up its own infrastructure and be less reliant on the US for cloud services – while others say it's too late. Someone working in government once told me an MP informally proposed creating a UK version of AWS.\"But what's the point?\" came the reply. \"We already have AWS, over there.\"Perhaps incidents like today's highlight why it's not quite that simple.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJohn Sudworthin Kyiv, andMaia DaviesUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would be ready to join Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin at a proposed summit in Hungary if he were invited.The US and Russian presidents announced on Thursday that they planned to hold talks on the war in Ukraine in Budapest, possibly in the coming weeks.In comments released on Monday, Zelensky told reporters: \"If it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it's called, shuttle diplomacy... then in one format or another, we will agree.\"Meanwhile, media reports suggest his White House meeting with Trump on Friday descended into a \"shouting match\" - with the US side urging Ukraine to accept Russia's terms to end the war.Zelensky was guarded during his first press briefing since the talks, but still his comments made clear that there were large areas of disagreement between the two sides.He described the meeting as frank, and said he had told Trump that his main aim was a just peace, not a quick peace.He criticised Hungary as the location of the prospective Trump-Putin talks, saying the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban could not do \"anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution\".When asked by reporters on Friday if Zelensky would be involved in the meeting in Budapest, Trump said he wanted to \"make it comfortable for everybody\".\"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated,\" he said, adding the three leaders \"have to get together\".Zelensky had hoped to secure US Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia at the talks, but appeared to walk away empty-handed as Trump struck a non-committal tone on the matter.Media reports on Monday suggested the atmosphere at the US and Ukrainian leaders' meeting had been far more acrimonious than previously understood.The Financial Times reported that Trump had warned Zelensky that Putin would \"destroy\" Ukraine if he did not agree to its terms, citing sources familiar with the conversation.The US side was said to have echoed Russian talking points at the \"volatile\" meeting. It also reported that Trump tossed aside maps of the front line in Ukraine and insisted Zelensky surrender the entire eastern Donbas region to Putin.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including most - but not all - of the Donbas.Just last month, Trump appeared to take a major shift in his position on ending the war by saying Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\".He said at the time that his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".Trump had previously warned the process would likely involve Ukraine giving up some territory - an outcome Zelensky has consistently rejected.The US president has been pressuring Nato nations, as well as China and India, to stop purchasing Russian oil in a bid to create further economic pressure on Moscow to end the conflict.He also previously threatened Russia with tougher sanctions if Putin did not meet deadlines to make progress in ending the war, though he did not follow through with those threats.Trump's public relations with Zelensky had also vastly improved in recent months, after an Oval Office meeting in February during which he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president on live television.During his re-election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to office.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoTom Bennettin Jerusalem, andAlaa Daraghmein Ramallah, occupied West BankA 55-year-old Palestinian woman has been taken to hospital after being clubbed over the head by a masked Jewish settler as she was picking olives.The unprovoked attack, which took place on Sunday morning in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya in the occupied West Bank, was captured on video by US journalist Jasper Nathaniel.Mr Nathaniel said the settler knocked the woman unconscious with the first strike of his stick, before hitting her again as she lay on the ground. She has been named locally as Umm Saleh Abu Alia.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC the confrontation was dispersed after its forces arrived, and that it \"strongly condemns any form of violence\" by settlers. However, Mr Nathaniel said Israeli soldiers were on-site prior to the attack and had \"lured\" him and others into an \"ambush\". He said soldiers \"sped off\" just before the settlers launched the assault. The BBC has put this specific allegation to the IDF.At least 80% of residents of Turmus Ayya hold US citizenship or residency, according to Israeli media. The BBC has reached out to the US State Department and US embassy for comment.The young male attacker is seen in the footage wielding a large wooden stick with a knot at one end, reminiscent of a club, before he swings it overhead and strikes Mrs Abu Alia.\"It's the most vivid image that's ever been seared in my mind,\" Mr Nathaniel told the BBC.\"He swings it one time and I saw her body go completely limp. And then he stood over her and hit her twice more.\"The mother of five is then seen bleeding as she is carried into a vehicle to be taken to hospital. She was initially admitted to an intensive care unit but is now in a stable condition, doctors say.Her cousin, Hamdi Abu Alia, told the BBC that medical staff found she had been struck twice in the head. Amin Abu Alia, the mayor of the adjacent village al-Mughayyir, confirmed details of the attack to the BBC.The attack was part of a wider incident in which at least 15 masked settlers were seen hurling stones and attacking other Palestinians who were harvesting olives - as well as activists who had arrived to support them, including Mr Nathaniel.At least one car was torched. Others had their windows smashed.The assault comes amid a spate of attacks in recent weeks linked to the olive harvest, which officially began on 9 October.The harvest is an age-old ritual that forms a major part of Palestinian culture. It is also an economic necessity for many, but is increasingly precarious.Farmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks during harvest season, including organised assaults and the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands.Of the 71 settler attacks documented by the UN's humanitarian office, Ocha, across the West Bank between 7 and 13 October, half were related to the ongoing harvest season. The attacks affected Palestinians in 27 villages.In 2025, more than 3,200 Palestinians have been injured in settler attacks across the West Bank, according to Ocha.Attacks are intended, monitors say, to intimidate Palestinians and eventually drive them from their land so settlers can seize it. The vast majority go unpunished, with just 3% of official investigations into settler violence between 2005 and 2023 ending in a conviction, according to Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din. Many incidents are not investigated.Shortly after entering office, US President Donald Trump cancelled a range of sanctions imposed on Israeli settlers by his predecessor Joe Biden.",

    "body": "25 minutes agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesMuch of Virginia Giuffre's story has been heard before but in her memoir, published posthumously, the abuse is described in appalling detail.Two days ahead of the book's official publication, the BBC got hold of a copy.There are revelations about Ms Giuffre's encounters with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell - as well as more details of her allegations about Prince Andrew, which he has always denied.Here's what we learned from the 367-page-long book.Prince Andrew allegations - and an 'orgy'In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions.The third time, she says, was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says.\"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English. Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"She later recalls seeing the photo of Epstein walking in New York's central park with Prince Andrew, published in newspapers around the world in 2011.\"I was of course revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll,\" she writes.\"But mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein\".Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In 2019, he told BBC Newsnight he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\", and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"News Syndication'Epstein told me I'd had a miscarriage'Shortly after the alleged \"orgy\" Ms Giuffre says she \"wasn't in great shape\", and had irregular bleeding and a tenderness in her abdomen.She says Epstein took her to a hospital, where she remembers being taken to an examination room. However, she says she is unclear what happened next due to pain medication affecting her memory.Soon after, she writes, one of the other girls in Epstein's house suggested to her that an incision mark near her belly button could mean she had surgery for an ectopic pregnancy.\"But Epstein told me I'd suffered a miscarriage, which is altogether something different,\" Ms Giuffre says.\"Epstein never wore a condom. Neither did the men he and Maxwell trafficked me to.\"Memories of Epstein 'torture' GiuffreAt the centre of the abuse was the late Epstein and his former girlfriend Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even after many years, the memories of what Epstein put her through \"torture\" her - and says she she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Epstein and his circle.The memoir includes shocking descriptions of sadomasochistic sex.She says Epstein developed an interest in it over time, and began to \"experiment with whips and restraints and other instruments of torture\".\"In session after session, he would play out various fantasies, with me as the victim,\" she writes.She says the chains and contraptions he used on her \"caused so much pain that I prayed I would black out\". But she adds: \"When I did, I'd awaken to more abuse\".Ms Giuffre also details the physical effects such abuse had on her body, with dark circles under her eyes and her ribs visible beneath her skin.Rather than offering any care, Epstein was \"disgusted\" at her appearance, she says.\"'You're not the same girl you were,' Epstein said coldly. 'You need to clean yourself up',\" she writes in the book.Maxwell's part in the abuseMs Giuffre goes into detail about how she first met Maxwell, and how she introduced her to Epstein.She says Maxwell turned up at the Mar-a-Lago spa, where a teenage Ms Giuffre was working.\"She looks to be in her late thirties, and her British accent reminds me of Mary Poppins,\" Ms Giuffre recalls.She says Maxwell asked her to come for a job interview as a masseuse.When she arrived at the house, Ms Giuffre says she was taken to a room where Epstein was completely naked on a massage table. \"Just do what I do,\" she says Maxwell told her.Ms Giuffre says she started giving Epstein a massage. She says Maxwell then took her clothes off, and undressed Ms Giuffre, and they sexually abused her.\"The disappointment was excruciating. I blamed myself. 'Is sex all anyone will ever want from me',\" she writes.She later describes how Maxwell facilitated the introduction to Prince Andrew in March 2001.She writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" - that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".Ms Giuffre later writes that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared both Epstein and Maxwell.Disappointment at Epstein's deathOne of the other themes running through the book is Ms Giuffre's desire for accountability.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre describes feeling disappointed at his death. \"This wasn't how justice was supposed to work out,\" she says.On Prince Andrew, she recalls standing outside a courtroom and telling journalists: \"He knows exactly what he's done… and I hope he comes clean about it.\"She later writes that she hopes the royal - who has always denied wrongdoing - will be \"held to account\".The most powerful words are perhaps saved for the ending of the book.\"In my mind, I hold a picture of a girl reaching out for help and easily finding it,\" Ms Giuffre writes.\"I picture a woman, too, who - having come to terms with her childhood pain - feels that it's within her power to take action against those who hurt her.\"If this book moves us even an inch closer to a reality like that - if it helps just one person - I will have achieved my goal.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentThe claims about Prince Andrew and his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are being treated by Buckingham Palace with \"very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent\", say royal sources.While the prince will no longer use his titles, including the Duke of York, there are still calls for them to be formally removed.Rachael Maskell, who is the MP for York and says many of her constituents no longer want the city to be associated with the royal, wants the government to change the law to allow this process.The Metropolitan Police are looking into claims the prince asked a protection officer for personal information about Virginia Giuffre, who said she had been forced to have sex with the prince, a claim he has consistently denied.Her memoir, published posthumously this week, adds to pressure on him.Earlier, a royal source had said they were expecting \"more days of pain ahead\" in the scandal.The source said the focus of the Royal Family's thoughts were on Epstein's victims and the \"whole network of girls and young women who were abused and treated appallingly\".It should not be seen as a reputational or PR battle, they suggested, saying they were treating the ongoing claims with \" very great concern\".The posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre repeats claims she was trafficked for sex by Epstein to his powerful circle of friends, including Prince Andrew - an allegation that the prince has strongly denied.On Friday the prince announced he would no longer use his titles and honours, which include the Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. He also  gave up his membership of the prestigious Order of the Garter.He remains a prince, a title assigned from birth as the son of a monarch. But constitutional expert Craig Prescott says Andrew's title of \"prince\" could also be theoretically removed by a legal document issued by monarchs, called Letters Patent. If he ceased to be a prince and as he is no longer Duke of York, he would become Andrew Windsor.Andrew could also be expelled from his place in the line of succession to the throne, where he is currently eighth in line. Parliament could remove him, according to the House of Commons Library, but it would require the consent of all the Commonwealth countries which has the King as head of state.Removing his other titles could also be carried out by legislation in Parliament.Although Palace pressure might have been exerted, the handing back of his titles was a voluntary move. They were not taken away, but Andrew's offer to stop using them can be enacted immediately and avoids using parliamentary time that would be necessary to remove those titles.But Maskell wants the government to amend current laws to make it possible for the King to directly take away his other titles and honours - and she says a poll in her York Central constituency showed overwhelming support for forcing Andrew to lose his titles.\"There are opportunities here to address the wrongs of history and ensure the voices of victims and survivors are heard and acted upon,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Maskell, who lost the Labour whip in a rebellion over welfare reforms, said she \"didn't come into Parliament to discuss princes and princesses\" but that such a change could be quickly passed allowing the monarch to remove titles and honours.\"It's a simple single clause, it could be added to constitutional bill or a private member's bill,\" she said.Flynn, the SNP's Westminster leader, has also called for a better mechanism to remove titles.He said the public was \"angry and aghast and they deserve to know that some MPs share their outrage\".Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson,  speaking on BBC Breakfast, said that with regards the debate about taking away the prince's titles: \"Any further decisions are not something we as a government would be involved in.\"Prince Andrew also faces pressure from inquiries in the US into Epstein's contacts with influential people, with more documents being trawled.At the weekend, there were reports of emails showing Epstein's connections with Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has also lost her title and is no longer the Duchess of York.The emails suggested that Prince Andrew in 2011 had sought personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre from his police protection officers and that he had already had her social security number.This was in contrast to his claims in his BBC Newsnight interview - when he said: \"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\"The Metropolitan Police has said it is actively looking into the claims about Andrew seeking information about her.The documents emerging from the US, published by the Mail on Sunday, also showed Epstein claiming to have financially supported Sarah Ferguson for 15 years.Sources close to Sarah Ferguson denied that this was correct.The announcement that Prince Andrew would lose his remaining titles had been intended to draw a line under what a royal source had called the \"constant parade of headlines\" about him, which had taken attention away from other royals.Royal sources highlighted that also included the work by Queen Camilla and the Duchess of Edinburgh to challenge violence against women.The Palace will not want the scandal surrounding Andrew to overshadow a historic state visit to the Vatican this week, during which King Charles will meet Pope Leo.",

    "body": "11 hours agoGill DummiganNorth WestBBCFreya Mandapalli, 19, is among many medical students who are choosing to study abroad A growing number of young people are choosing to study in Eastern Europe due to a strict cap on medical school places in the UK.Freya Mandapalli from Preston is one of them.The 19-year-old has healthcare in her blood.  Her parents both work at the local hospital and her older sister studied medicine at Edinburgh and now works as a doctor.\"I just got inspired by her really,\" Freya said.But getting into a medical school in the UK generally requires a minimum of three As at A-level and high grades in other subjects and Freya struggled to get them.Although she got interviews, she didn't receive any offers.  She considered a gap year but then a family friend mentioned the possibility of studying in Plovdiv, in Southern Bulgaria.\"I was really nervous to start with, but the city's beautiful and I've found some great friends,\" added Freya, who has just started her second year of a medical degree.In England around 8,126 medical students started this academic year, just over a thousand of them in the North West.  This is sharply up from two years ago when it was just 7,010 but still far short of the 15,000 the government says it needs for England by 2031 to meet demand.But with the cap on medical school places, it means competition to get one is intense, and many students are voting with their feet.'Word of mouth'Mohammed Adnaan Patel from Bolton has just started his fifth year at the same university in Plovdiv.  He too found the course through word of mouth.\"One of my friends told me that his brother already studies within Bulgaria and he was planning on going himself,\" he said.\"My mother was very worried, my father wanted me to stay strong and be independent, but the rest of my family didn't know what to expect.  But those worries gradually subsided.\"The Medical University of Plovdiv is one of Bulgaria's most prestigious medical schools and attracts many more applicants than it admits.  Although it does ask for academic qualifications, a large part of the admissions process hangs on an entrance exam.Mohammed Adnaan Patel from Bolton is now in his fifth year at the university in PlovdivProfessor Veselina Goranova, vice rector for Education, says their students' home countries include Greece, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Canada, the US – but added the biggest group by far, \"about 40% come from the UK\".That may be in part because classes for international students are held in English but also because a well-established network of agencies now exist to help those hoping to make the leap.Dr Muhammad Hamza from Blackburn graduated from Plovdiv last year and is currently back there helping to settle new students. He works with MedConnect Europe Ltd, an agency headquartered in London but with offices around Eastern Europe.He says the agency helps new students navigate the complications of a new life abroad like finding a flat, dealing with paperwork, and sorting out life's essentials.\"We get them in touch with the estate agents, we book the flights for them. Our representatives will be there at the airport to collect them, take them to the hotels,\" he said.Medical students, including Freya, are studying in Bulgaria instead of the UKStrict timetable\"We help them with shopping – buying bedding, cutlery..wifi, mobile sims, setting them up.  Because they don't know the language and we have representatives in each country which do know the language it becomes so much easier,\" he added.Dr Hamza spends most of his time working as a private dentist in Chorley, where he spends a year with a mentor. The firm, he says, came out to Plovdiv to recruit dentists there.\"It's probably because of the vast practical experience we get in Bulgaria,\" he said, adding that the Bulgarian system requires students to complete large numbers of relatively complex procedures.\"So going and starting as a dentist in the UK, I already had somewhat of a solid foundation.\"New students need to get used to a strict timetable which often begins at 7.30am and may not finish until 6pm.  They also need to study Bulgarian so they can talk to the patients they will be treating in the last three years of their course.Dr Hamza now works as a Dentist in Chorley after studying in BulgariaBulgarian, like Russian, uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and a complex grammar structure.  Milena Muleshkova is one of those tasked with getting the students up to scratch. She says that first year is about everyday communication, while the second-year concentrates on medical terms.Medical courses in Bulgaria last six years,  one year longer than in the UK but common in mainland Europe.  At the end of it, successful students have a degree which is recognised by the General Medical Council in England, and which allows them to practice in the NHS without any further tests.Watch BBC World Service documentary : Why are medical students going to Bulgaria?This may change though in 2028 when Britain next looks at its agreements with the EU.  And another potential change is particularly worrying some students.The NHS has become increasingly reliant on attracting healthcare staff from overseas to meet increasing patient demand. In 2023 68% of doctors joining the NHS were international medical graduates (IMGs) and the number has been rising year on year.There is uncertainty around the future of qualifications medical students gain from studying in BulgariaCurrently the NHS treats applicants from overseas and the UK in the same way for jobs and training opportunities.  This has become an increasingly contentious issue for resident (formerly known as junior) doctors in England who say many at the beginning of their career are being denied the opportunity to progress.Earlier this month they voted to strike over the shortage of speciality training places.But the doctors' union the British Medical Association wants UK graduates to be prioritised for those training posts.  Health Secretary Wes Streeting says he agrees.  But this could mean British students studying abroad would also be looked at less favourably because they would also be classed as IMGs.'It's quite scary'Mohammed Adnaan Patel said he did have sympathy with much of the argument but not all.He said: \"It's quite a topic of frequent discussion as the years go on as we get closer to that stage,\"\"It is quite scary.  It does raise a lot of anxiety within the students and myself.\"But the NHS also has difficulty keeping hold of medical staff.  Last year in the North West of England one in ten left  - although that was actually better than the year before.  Some will have left the profession altogether but some will have been tempted away by similar jobs in Canada, Australia, and the gulf states, who also run international recruitment campaigns.As the global population ages and healthcare needs increase, the international fight to attract trained medical staff, wherever they come from, is likely to intensify.Dr Muhammad Hamza from MedConnect Europe says he doesn't see the demand for European students slowing any time soon.He said: \"I see it growing because the demand for doctors and dentists, not only in the UK is a lot but all over the world\"\"I don't see it slowing down.  It's going to expand further and further.\"",

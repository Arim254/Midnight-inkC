What’s really going on with Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine?AmericastAvailable for over a yearDonald Trump has posted on social media that ‘something good just may be happening’ when it comes to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, after overnight talks in Geneva.\nEuropean leaders criticised a 28-point US peace plan when it emerged last week, saying it was too favourable to Russia. A new plan has been promised, but President Zelensky has played down Trump’s hopes of progress.\nSarah, Anthony and Marianna join Matt Chorley on 5 Live to answer your questions. We look at who’s actually involved in putting the plan together? And what does Donald Trump stand to gain from the proposed deal?\nPlus, the MAGA icon and Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will resign from Congress following her bitter feud with the president last week. Could we start to see power shifts within the MAGA movement following her departure? And why did Trump say the behaviour of some Democrats was “punishable by death”?\nPlus, what happened when the mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, met Donald Trump in the White House on Friday? Clips of the meeting quickly went viral, with users commenting on the warmth between the two leaders. Is this the start of a fruitful friendship between Trump and Mamdani - or is it all just for show?\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "2 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentLawyers for Palestine Action have said the group can be compared to the suffragettes, in a challenge against the government's ban.On the first day of a three day judicial review at the High Court, lawyers for the group's co-founder Huda Ammori said the votes-for-women movement would have faced the same ban if today's laws had been in place more than 100 years ago.Palestine Action was listed as a proscribed terrorist organisation after causing millions of pounds worth of damage to defence firms.The then Home Secretary Yvette Cooper proscribed the group after internal Home Office security assessments of its activity.Raza Husain KC, for Ms Ammori, told the court the ban was unprecedented.Around 200 people protested peacefully outside during the opening of the challenge - with scores of them silently holding up signs saying \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.\"Several sign-holders were then arrested by police. Since the ban, more than 2,100 people have been arrested nationwide for taking part in similar protests.In court, Mr Husain KC told a panel of three senior judges that, in the entire history of home secretaries using exceptional powers to ban a group under terrorism legislation, no minister had ever proscribed a group for being a \"direct action\" organisation.He said that Palestine Action was followed by hundreds of thousands of people on social media before it was banned. Most of its \"actionists\" - meaning people who had taken part in protests and alleged vandalism at defence firms and associated companies - had been arrested or charged with standard offences such as criminal damage.Ministers say that a series of incidents organised by the group went further than minor vandalism, by causing millions of pounds in damage, justifying the decision to ban the group.\"Palestine Action is the first direct action civil disobedience organisation that does not advocate for violence ever to be proscribed as terrorist,\" Mr Husain KC said.\"Ms Huda Ammori has explained that she was inspired by the long tradition in this country from suffragettes to anti-apartheid activists, to Iraq war activists.\"The suffragettes had resorted to direct action, property damage and even attempted arson at Westminster Abbey.\"His written submissions to the court added: \"The suffragettes would have been liable to proscription if the Terrorism Act 2000 regime had been in force at the turn of the 20th century.\"Ms Ammori's lawyers argue that the ban is unlawful because it disproportionately interferes with the right to freedom of expression and assembly - and the then home secretary failed to consider that impact.They also argue that Cooper should have consulted the group before banning it and that she failed to take into account her own policy that such a decision had to be proportionate.Owen Greenhall, another of Ms Ammori's lawyers, argued that the impact of the ban was so wide it had deterred legitimate protest outside a key defence firm that has been targeted by the group since its founding.Anyone who wanted to take part in such a disruptive protest, as had regularly happened before the ban, would risk being labelled a member of Palestine Action.The case continues on Thursday, when government lawyers will respond. In their written submissions to the court, made public on Wednesday, they argue that ministers acted lawfully in identifying incidents which they believed justified a ban under terrorism legislation - and that they did not have to take into account that the vast majority of Palestine Action's activity had fallen short of that test.The case then returns to court next Tuesday for final submissions, including a secret \"closed\" hearing for national security reasons.",

    "body": "Police in New York City are holding a woman in custody who has been accused of dining at multiple upscale restaurants and then refusing to pay for her lavish meals. Pei Chung, 35, has been arrested and banned from restaurants at least seven times since late October, according to police records. The self-styled food influencer has attracted attention among the city's vibrant dining scene in just a few weeks. She reportedly dresses in expensive outfits, and arrives at restaurants with a high-resolution camera and lighting equipment, earning her the nickname, the \"dine-and-dash diva\".As of Tuesday, she was being held on bail at Rikers Island jail, with a court appearance planned for this week. She is being held on a cash bail of $4,500 (£3,400). Restaurant staff have chronicled her bizarre behaviours on social media, and in local news stories, over the past several weeks. One employee of the famed Peter Luger Steak House told NBC News that after she allegedly declined to pay her bill she offered staff items from her handbag -including a pair of scissors - instead. She also remained inside the restaurant for several hours, and later posted a glowing review of the expensive meal online.Other restaurateurs have alleged she offered to review their food or post photos on her social media account as her payment, while still others have accused her of simply walking out, without paying.Ms Chung did not respond to a message that the BBC sent to her Instagram account, where she boasts 26,000 followers.She is facing multiple charges of misdemeanour theft of services.Her story has attracted attention to the role played by influencers in fine dining, and restaurant policies about how much to welcome or avoid them. Hole In The Wall, one of the restaurants that she is accused of stealing from, says that they took back their food after Ms Chung said she wanted to pay with photos.\"She's giving us more exposure than any one of these influencers we've actually coordinated with,\" founder Tom Rowse told the New York Times.\"Even after we took her food away, she posted about it, saying it was nice.\"",

He has formally denied two of the claims and is yet to file a defence with the court in the third. He was separately cleared of nine sexual offence charges at a criminal trial in 2023.Two of the men who accused the Oscar-winning star during the criminal trial have also filed civil legal cases at the High Court.One man, known only as LNP, alleges that Mr Spacey \"deliberately assaulted\" him on about 12 occasions between 2000 and 2005.Another, referred to as GHI, says he met Mr Spacey through a workshop at London's Old Vic theatre and claims he \"suffered psychiatric damage and financial loss\" as a result of an assault in 2008.Mr Spacey was artistic director of the Old Vic between 2004 and 2013.The man originally sued Mr Spacey in 2022 but his case was paused when the criminal charges were brought.The third man, Ruari Cannon, has waived his right to anonymity.He was in Tennessee Williams' play Sweet Bird of Youth at the Old Vic in 2013, and alleges that Mr Spacey groped him at a party after the show's press night.Mr Cannon took part in a Channel 4 documentary, Spacey Unmasked, in 2024.Mr Spacey said the allegation was \"ridiculous and it never happened\".Elizabeth-Anne Gumbel KC, representing the trio, said in written submissions that the cases should be heard in a single trial to avoid the men and Mr Spacey giving evidence more than once.The US actor has previously admitted \"bad behaviour\" and \"being too handsy\" at times, but said he would not use the word \"grope\" to describe his actions.At his criminal trial in London in 2023, he was acquitted of seven counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.",

It was inspired by the strict dress code and atmosphere of London's Blitz Club during the early 1980s.Hogg told the BBC's Kirsty Wark: \"I started making clothes when I was about five years old from all the hand-me-downs from neighbours – more wealthy neighbours but they probably weren't that wealthy, just better off than us. And I was really formulating my look way back then.\"The designer's clothes, as well as her personal visual identity, embraced futuristic beauty looks, bold hair, punk sensibilities, and a strong sense of androgyny.One of her most memorable contributions to fashion is her interpretation of the catsuit.It became a signature statement of her aesthetic and she continued to create catsuits throughout her career for stars such as Minogue, Rihanna and Lady Gaga.Supermodels Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer and singers Jessie J, Björk, Siouxsie Sioux, Grace Jones and Kelly Rowland are among the other stars who wore Hogg's designs over the years.In 1989, Hogg opened her first standalone boutique on Newburgh Street, just off Carnaby Street in London.Princess Diana once wore one of Hogg's dresses, while Princess Eugenie wore one of her custom designs to Ascot in 2013.In 2016, Hogg designed the statuette for the Brit Awards, producing 13 trophies characterised by her distinctive use of glitter and metallic tones.Hogg was a music artist in her own right and supported Debbie Harry of Blondie and The Pogues, before founding the band Doll.

    "body": "Image source, Ben Whitley / PA WireByStav DanaosLead Weather PresenterUpdated 25 November 2025With a cold spell gripping the UK over the last week and bringing snow for many, you may be wondering whether winter has arrived.The answer is almost, but not quite. According to the meteorological calendar, the last week of November is the last week of autumn, notable this year for its vibrant autumn colours and changeable, whiplash-like weather patterns. The UK has recorded both the warmest November overnight minimums and the coldest November nights for 15 years.So when will we see the official start of winter and what kind of temperatures could that bring?Defining the start of winterImage source, Danny Lawson / PA WireImage caption, The recent cold snap created this snowy scene in the North York MoorsThere are two common ways to define the start of our seasons in the UK -  meteorological and astronomical.BBC Weather follows the meteorological calendar, where winter always begins on 1 December and ends on the last day of February. Meteorologists use fixed three month periods for each season, which makes year-on-year comparisons between them easier. Astronomical winter starts on the 21 December, known as the winter solstice and is the shortest day of the year. The season then runs until the vernal or spring equinox which in 2026 is Friday 20 March. What makes winter winter?We define winter as the three coldest months - December, January and February - and when we look at a list of record low temperatures from across the UK we can see why. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK is –27.2C (–17.0F), reached on three separate occasions in Scotland:Braemar, Aberdeenshire, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982Altnaharra, Sutherland, on 30 December 1995Other national record lows include:England: –26.1C (–15.0F) in Newport, Shropshire, on 10 January 1982Wales: –23.3C (–9.9F) in Rhayader, Powys, on 21 January 1940Northern Ireland: –18.7C (–1.7F) in Castlederg, County Tyrone, on 24 December 2010But the UK does not often experience prolonged very cold weather, and some winters are so mild that it feels as if we skipped the season all together.In February 2019 England and Wales saw an exceptional spell of warmth, with temperatures rising above 20C on more than one occasion. What impact is climate change having on winter?Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / NikonmanImage caption, Flooding in Martock, Somerset, December 2023UK winters are becoming warmer and wetter due to human-driven climate change. Long term data shows rising average temperatures and fewer cold weather extremes.With global temperatures continuing to rise UK winters are now about 1C warmer than a century ago. The decade 2015–2024 has been 1.24C warmer than the 1961–1990 average. Indeed, six of the ten warmest UK winters on record have occurred since 2000.Globally 2023 was the warmest year on record where most days in December broke temperature records.Air and ground frosts have fallen by around 25% since the 1980s, and snow days are becoming increasingly rare across the UK.A warming world means we are more likely to see winter precipitation fall as rain rather than snow, external.However, even in a warming climate the UK can still experience spells of extreme cold. In 2018 the infamous Beast from the East brought severe wintry conditions to many parts of Europe leading to significant disruption, and its impact lingered well into meteorological spring.",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterForeign tourists visiting popular US national parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite will need to pay an extra fee, the Trump administration says.The Department of the Interior, which runs the country's national parks, said each international visitor will need to pay $100 (£76) per person on top of existing fees to access 11 of the most popular sites.From 2026, non-residents will also need to pay more than $250 for an annual pass to the parks, while US citizens and permanent residents will continue to pay $80.The fee hike aims to \"put American families first\" and reflects President Donald Trump's goal to make the parks more accessible and affordable for US citizens, said the department.\"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.The increase will take effect at the start of 2026, alongside the launch of an upgraded online booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, \"patriotic fee-free\" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.The fee hike follows an executive order, signed by Trump in July, to raise entrance fees at national parks for overseas visitors. The extra revenue would raise funds for conservation and maintenance at the sites, the White House said at the time - even as the Trump administration planned deep cuts to the Park Service budget.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before.The country's most visited parks include the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California and Colorado's Rocky Mountains.",

    "body": "The biggest initial surprise in this Budget may have been that the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) managed to publish it all by mistake long before Chancellor Rachel Reeves got to read it out. There is no precedent for that.But actually the real surprise was that the government's financial position is nowhere near as bad as had been suggested in the run-up.I had warned in a few live appearances not to take at full face value the protestations about how dire the OBR forecast had been. There are always a lot of moving parts when you project long term.Yes the economy is forecast to grow more slowly than expected because long-term productivity has been downgraded, but it also starts from a better base thanks to outperformance and upgrades this year. On top of that, higher wages due to high inflation have boosted the Treasury's tax take. Very interestingly, the OBR has also made a judgement that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could boost productivity by a notable and growing amount by the end of the year.The net result of all that is the OBR forecasts show she could have met her self-imposed rules of only borrowing to invest and cover day-to-day spending with tax  receipts, without freezing income tax thresholds.So why did she do way more than expected? By freezing thresholds for a further three years until 2031, she is dragging most people into paying more tax including pulling almost one in four people into the higher rate tax bracket.If it wasn't for her U-turn on welfare reforms, she would have been on track to actually meet her target by a whisker before she made any changes to tax and spending.So this gets us to the big story of this Budget of two halves. A Budget that borrows to spend on political priorities in the next year or so, and then taxes hard to get borrowing down in the final years of the decade.This is about buying breathing space, politically and economically. The two factors are inseparable.By borrowing to spend, the chancellor and prime minister have shored up their immediate position in parliament and it appears to put to bed the shocking doubts  about passing their budgets. The Labour left is getting behind this Budget as it spends to help alleviate child poverty, to lower energy bills, and to freeze rail fares and prescriptions. This is important for the financial markets which need to know, whether they love the policies or not, that the government has the votes to pass its Budget.By subsequently taxing hard to double the amount of breathing space or headroom to £22bn a year around her borrowing targets, Reeves gets space from the uncomfortable glare of the markets. Add in the fact that there will now only be an annual check of the fiscal rules rather than a bi-annual one, and with a fair wind, this should put to bed the hamster wheel of speculation about missing borrowing targets. This has been a force for instability, and lack of credibility over the last year, and ultimately led to the calamitous U-turn on welfare cuts over the summer.The net result of all this and a slightly lower than expected issuance of UK government bonds, was that markets were more than calm. Despite the rollercoaster of a day, the effective interest rate on government bonds was down across the board, and on occasion was a notable 10 basis points or 0.1% down on the key bonds.The message has been heard in the markets, and at first glance in her own party.Now this has come at a price. Taxes will go up to new records in 2028. How will that be squared with the need for growth?I detect an unspoken strategy. The government hopes that growth will exceed the solid pedestrian predictions of 1.5%. If that is the case, we might not ever get to this extended threshold freeze. There is also hope the choices made will enable the Bank of England to cut interest rates further.For this to work, growth will have to come. There is some space for green shoots to sprout now, or at least for the animal spirits of the economy to emerge from non-stop chaos. This applies to business investment plans, and those older consumers who have been hoarding savings and not spending.It's no guarantee of success, but there is some space now for a more stable backdrop.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJonny Humphries,at Liverpool Crown Court andLauren Hirst,North WestCPSPaul Doyle broke down in tears as he quietly answered guilty to all 31 chargesPaul Doyle has pleaded guilty to all 31 charges after ploughing his car into a dense crowd of supporters at the Liverpool FC victory parade. The 54-year-old admitted dangerous driving, affray, 17 charges of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, nine counts of causing GBH with intent and three counts of wounding with intent.The Crown Prosecution Service said it was an \"act of calculated violence\" when Doyle drove into the crowd on the evening of the 26 May, injuring more than 130 people. The father-of-three, of Croxteth, Liverpool, sat with his head down and sobbed as he changed his pleas on the second day of his trial at Liverpool Crown Court.  Thousands of Liverpool fans were in the city on the day of Doyle's attack to watch the parade, which started at 14:30 BST on 26 May. The team bus had travelled down The Strand, which passes the end of Water Street, before the incident and the parade was coming to a close, with supporters heading home.EPAThe incident unfolded on Water Street just after 18:00More than 130 people reported injuries after Doyle drove his Ford Galaxy Titanium into crowds on Water Street just after 18:00.He was arrested at the scene and charged later that week.Recap: Paul Doyle changes his pleas on the second day of his trialA jury was sworn in for his trial on Tuesday but he changed his pleas earlier as the prosecution case was due to be opened.The charges relate to 29 people aged between six months and 77 years.Footage of the incident was shared after the incident Doyle, a former Royal Marine, was in tears at a number of pre-trial hearings when he appeared over videolink from prison.He was supported in court by family members when he appeared earlier. The Recorder of Liverpool Andrew Menary KC told Doyle it was \"inevitable\" he would be facing a custodial sentence \"of some length\".A two-day sentencing hearing was set for 15 and 16 December at the same court.Julia QuenzlerA jury had been sworn in for Doyle's trial on TuesdaySarah Hammond, chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said Doyle had finally accepted that he intentionally drove into crowds of innocent people.\"Dashcam footage from Doyle's vehicle shows that as he approached Dale Street and Water Street, he became increasingly agitated by the crowds,\" she said. \"Rather than wait for them to pass, he deliberately drove at them, forcing his way through.\"She added driving a vehicle into a crowd was \"an act of calculated violence\". \"This was not a momentary lapse by Paul Doyle — it was a choice he made that day and it turned celebration into mayhem.\"In May, Merseyside Police said they believed Doyle had followed an ambulance on to Water Street after a road block was temporarily lifted for crews to attend to a person having a heart attack.Det Ch Insp John Fitzgerald said it was only \"by sheer luck that nobody was killed because of Doyle's reckless actions\".\"In just seven minutes his dangerous driving meant that his car collided with more than 100 people, including children, in some cases trapping people underneath and causing serious injuries.\"What should have been a day of celebration for the city turned into a distressing and frightening experience which we know continues to have a physical and psychological impact on many people.\"Following the hearing, councillor Liam Robinson confirmed Liverpool City Council's independent review into what happened would be published soon.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterBBCThe Chancellor has announced £820m of funding to guarantee paid work placements for 18 to 21-year-olds \"not earning or learning\" for over 18 months.The funding will pay for three years of the Youth Guarantee scheme offering young people in England an apprenticeship, training, education, or help to find a job.Latest figures show almost a million young people not in education, employment or training - known as Neets.Making her Budget speech on Wednesday, Rachel Reeves said the money would \"give the young people who were let down by the Conservatives the support and opportunity they deserve\".Under the scheme, 18 to 21-year-olds on Universal Credit for 18 months without working or studying will be offered six-month paid work placements - and those not taking up the offer face being stripped of their benefits.Reeves also announced the government would be funding a scheme to make apprenticeship training for under-25s at small and medium businesses \"completely free\".Nick Harrison, CEO of education think tank the Sutton Trust, welcomed the planned changes to apprenticeship schemes but called on the government to go further. \"Apprenticeships have the potential to be a powerful tool for social mobility, offering an alternative route to highly skilled industries,\" he said.Association of Colleges head David Hughes said the money would enable colleges to support more young people so they do not end up not in education, employment or training.But he said more money was needed, adding: \"To fully support the nearly one million young people who are Neets, there will need to be more adult education funding, and to ensure millions of adults are not left behind by the tech and green revolutions we are seeing before our eyes, that budget will need to grow even more.\"Lancaster University warned the scheme may be \"too blunt an instrument to successfully support young people into secure and sustained employment\".Rebecca Florisson, lead analyst at the university's Work Foundation, said the \"evidence is clear that forcing individuals into 'any job' can do more harm than good to their future employment prospects.\"The announcement comes amid rising concern about youth inactivity. Nearly 946,000 people aged 16 to 24 are currently Neets  - around one in eight of the age group - close to an 11-year high.The DWP recently launched an investigation into why the figure is so stubbornly high. The jobs market is particularly challenging for young people, with 2025 figures showing a falling number of vacancies and fewer people on payrolls.Official stats on Neets include stay-at-home parents as well as jobseekers.The majority of young people (580,000) who are Neets fall into the economically inactive category, compared to 366,000 who are unemployed.A rise in long-term sickness among young people has been one of the main causes of economic inactivity over the past three years, according to research by the Youth Futures Foundation.Youth Guarantee funding formed part of a wider welfare reform package in the Budget, where Reeves said the system should \"protect people who cannot work and empower those who can\".Forecasts released alongside the Budget by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predict relatively few inactive people returning to work before the next election, despite the changes. The legal minimum wage for over-21s is to rise 4.1% in April, from £12.21 to £12.71 per hour, with the wage for 18 to 20-year-olds rising from £10 to £10.85.Some businesses - especially in the hospitality sector - have warned this could put companies off hiring young people, undoing the government's efforts to increase youth employment.

    "body": "Health officials in Glasgow are planning to make the case for a smoking space to be added to the city's drug consumption room.The Thistle, which opened on Hunter Street in January, is a facility in which people can inject heroin or cocaine while under medical supervision without being prosecuted.Officials involved in the three-year pilot project say a smoking space for taking cocaine is \"critical in order to realise the full benefit\" of the facility.Members of the city's integration joint board (IJB) — which oversees health and social care services — will be asked to approve the development of a business case for an inhalation space later.Since the Thistle opened, cocaine has been reported as 67% of substances injected, but officials said there is anecdotal evidence of a shift to smoking or inhalation of drugs, particularly cocaine.The IJB report states recent overdose clusters in Glasgow have been \"linked to increased smoking/inhalation of crack cocaine which has been contaminated with other substances.\"In September Glasgow's health board warned drug users against inhaling crack cocaine following a series of suspected drug incidents.It is currently not legal for Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership to operate a smoking room, but it is planning talks with the Scottish government over amending regulations to define the Thistle as an \"exempt service\".The Thistle is able to operate after the Lord Advocate announced users would not be prosecuted for possessing illegal drugs while on the site.A report to the IJB states if a smoking/inhalation room is added then the statement of prosecution policy may need to be amended, requiring further discussions with the Crown Office and the Lord Advocate.Legal issues, as well as costs and staffing and the best location for the space, would be explored during the development of the full business case.A room for smoking drugs was included in the original plans, but was dropped due to potential delays while legal issues were explored, as well as extra costs and ventilation requirements.Cocaine was implicated in 52% of drug-related deaths in Glasgow in 2024.Officials added feedback highlighted the lack of inhalation spaces as \"the main barrier to using the service\".The report said creating a smoking/inhalation space would let staff encourage clients to transition from injection to smoking, as well as reach out to users who do not use the Thistle.Inhalation rooms consist of individual enclosed booths that have a ventilation system designed to remove smoke and vapour. Community engagement on the proposed service is planned.By 31 October, 494 individuals had registered to use the Thistle, with 8,236 visits and 5,552 recorded injecting episodes. Staff had managed 69 medical emergencies and over 360 referrals to other services had been made.Most often these referrals were to housing services but also to alcohol and drug recovery services and other clinical services.Last week the UK government said it would not make changes to drug laws to allow the creation of more legal drug consumption rooms.Reporting by local democracy reporter Drew Sandelands.",

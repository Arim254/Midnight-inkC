What’s really going on with Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine?AmericastAvailable for over a yearDonald Trump has posted on social media that ‘something good just may be happening’ when it comes to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, after overnight talks in Geneva.\nEuropean leaders criticised a 28-point US peace plan when it emerged last week, saying it was too favourable to Russia. A new plan has been promised, but President Zelensky has played down Trump’s hopes of progress.\nSarah, Anthony and Marianna join Matt Chorley on 5 Live to answer your questions. We look at who’s actually involved in putting the plan together? And what does Donald Trump stand to gain from the proposed deal?\nPlus, the MAGA icon and Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will resign from Congress following her bitter feud with the president last week. Could we start to see power shifts within the MAGA movement following her departure? And why did Trump say the behaviour of some Democrats was “punishable by death”?\nPlus, what happened when the mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, met Donald Trump in the White House on Friday? Clips of the meeting quickly went viral, with users commenting on the warmth between the two leaders. Is this the start of a fruitful friendship between Trump and Mamdani - or is it all just for show?\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "6 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterTwo peers are set to be suspended from the House of Lords for breaching rules, including providing parliamentary services in return for \"payment or reward\".Former Army chief Lord Richard Dannatt and businessman Lord David Evans of Watford face suspensions of four and five months respectively.The House of Lords' standards watchdog launched separate investigations into the two men following an undercover operation by the Guardian newspaper. Neither peer appealed the standard commissioner's findings or the sanctions, which will come into force once approved by the House of Lords.In the course of his investigation, the standards commissioner found that crossbench peer Lord Dannatt had breached the code of conduct by corresponding with ministers and government officials about three companies - UK Nitrogen, Teledyne UK and Blue International Holdings - in which he had a financial interest.The commissioner also identified four ways in which Labour peer Lord Evans had broken the rules, including by sponsoring events in Parliament for a company that was owned by his son, and in which he held one-third of the shares. Both men referred themselves to the commissioner after the Guardian reported comments they had made to the newspaper's undercover reporters.Lord Dannatt was filmed telling the journalists, posing as potential commercial clients, he could make introductions to people in government and could \"make a point of getting to know\" the best-placed ministers.The commissioner concluded that no lobbying had taken place and no payment had been received.However, he said Lord Dannatt had demonstrated \"a clear willingness to undertake activity that would have amounted to paid parliamentary services\" and had \"demonstrated insufficient regard for the need to act solely in the public interest in the course of his parliamentary activities\".For that reason, he said the peer had breached the section of the code of conduct which requires members to \"always act on their personal honour\".During the course of the investigation, the commissioner identified three further breaches, relating to Lord Dannatt contacting people in government about companies in which he had a financial interest.In these instances, the commissioner said the peer had breached the section of the code which states that peers \"must not seek to profit from membership of the House by accepting or agreeing to accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services\". He said Lord Dannatt's \"lack of understanding\" about the code and his belief that he was \"acting in the national interest\" were not mitigating factors, but acknowledged the peer's \"proactive expressions of remorse\" and \"willingness to learn\".In a statement, Lord Dannatt accepted three breaches of the code of conduct had been found by the commissioner but added \"for the record\" that the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists had investigated the two UK-based matters and \"concluded that I had not conducted consultant lobbying\".He said he \"deeply\" regretted the findings and said that the \"honourable course of action was not to waste the Conduct Committee's time by appealing against the findings but to accept the appropriate sanction\".Lord Dannatt said he had declared all relevant interests, as well as registering them with the Registrar of Lords' Interests, but he accepted his actions had been \"insufficient\" and that \"ignorance\" was no defence for any breach of the code of conduct. He added: \"I also understand that acting in the national interest in good faith, which was my motivation in the three matters, is not an excuse or justification for breaching the Code of Conduct.\"At nearly 75 no-one is too old to learn lessons and I hope that these activities will be placed in the context of my 56-years public service.\"Lord Evans was found to have failed to \"act on his personal honour\" by telling the Guardian journalists he could introduce them to MPs.He also sponsored events in Parliament for the company, Affinity, and asked members of the House of Lords if they would speak at the events. Tickets to the events were advertised for sale at a price greater than the actual cost per head, contravening House of Lords rules on holding events, the commissioner's report said. He noted that Lord Evans had believed his shares in Affinity had been transferred to his son in 2013 and therefore \"did not think he would benefit from sponsoring events for Affinity as a shareholder\". However, the commissioner concluded that, taking into the account the \"number and seriousness of the breaches\", a lengthy suspension from the Lords would be appropriate. Speaking to the commissioner for the inquiry, Lord Evans said of the meeting with the undercover journalists: \"I was suspicious of the whole approach... in hindsight, I should not have agreed to attend the online meeting.\"Asked if he thought it was appropriate to invite peers to the events he hosted on behalf of Affinity, Lord Evans said: \"Given the circumstances at the time, when I didn't even know I was a shareholder - I had resigned from the company - I thought it was appropriate and I wasn't breaking any rules.\"\"I'm horrified by the whole thing. I've had a clean reputation all my life. I've never done anything wrong,\" he added. ",

    "body": "Just nowOn the eve of the Budget, speculation about Chancellor Rachel Reeves's fiscal statement dominates the papers. The Times reports that she is urging Labour MPs to \"unite for her Budget\", hitting out at what she calls \"misogynist critics\". Pre-Budget leaks had been \"incredibly destabilising\", she adds, with the paper quoting her address to MPs at the Commons. \"The Chancellor will significantly cut the annual £20,000 cash Isa (Individual Savings Account) allowance to £12,000,\" the Daily Mail reports. Lowering the tax-free interest limit could \"punish savers while potentially causing mortgage rates to rise\", according to the paper. It reports the chancellor could use her fiscal statement to argue the \"billions of pounds sitting in the savings accounts would generate better returns if it was invested in the riskier stock market\".A proposal to introduce a council tax surcharge on properties worth more than £2m could turn into a \"'sticking plaster' for the government\", the i newspaper writes. It describes the measure as a \"mansion tax\", quoting warnings from the former Institute for Fiscal Studies economist Paul Johnson, who tells the paper the system \"needs a complete overhaul\".The Silver Voices campaign group cautions the chancellor that \"many older people will struggle to heat their homes without help with the cost of living\", the Daily Express reports. \"Frozen income tax thresholds expected in tomorrow's Budget will lead to frozen homes\", the paper writes, adding that people already struggling with soaring energy costs \"are hammered with higher tax bills\". The Independent leads with \"reports that efforts to grow the economy have stalled\", citing unpublished analysis from the economic watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The paper says the OBR has \"reportedly downgraded its forecast for growth in each year until 2029\", adding that the news \"could not come at a worse time for the beleaguered chancellor\". US and Ukrainian negotiators drafted an incomplete peace proposal in Geneva, which \"leaves big calls to presidents\", the Financial Times says. \"Washington had been pressing Kyiv to agree a 28-point proposal developed by US and Russian officials\", the paper writes. Parts of the plan, such as territorial concessions, crossed \"Ukrainian red lines\". The paper says the outstanding \"politically sensitive elements\" of the Geneva plan will be decided by Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.\"1,000 abuse victims safer,\" writes the Metro, reporting on the number of domestic abuse protection orders (DAPOs) imposed in the year since they were introduced. The paper says the DAPOs \"limit perpetrators' movements, with breaches punishable by up to five years\". Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable unpaid carers will have their cases reassessed after a damning official review, the Guardian writes. Some carers were \"plunged into hardship; others were jailed\" after \"draconian penalties of as much as £20,000\" were foisted on some carers. A review blames \"government failure and maladministration\", according to the paper. The Daily Telegraph reports that BBC chair Samir Shah \"has insisted he will not resign despite deep divisions at the broadcaster\". It writes board members are split over how to respond to the Telegraph's \"disclosure of bias at the corporation\", based on a leaked memo. \"Reform's Russia crisis\" is the Daily Mirror front page headline, as the paper says party leader Nigel Farage is facing \"mounting pressure to investigate pro-Putin links\" in the party. This follows the jailing of former Welsh Reform UK leader Nathan Gill for taking pro-Russian bribes. The Daily Star leads with darts champion Luke Littler supporting the paper's campaign to give a knighthood to motor neurone disease charity campaigner and ex-rugby league star Kevin Sinfield. TV star Jeff Brazier has separated from his wife Kate Dwyer, the Sun reports. It says the split comes 16 years after the death of Brazier's ex-partner Jade Goody, who appeared on Big Brother years earlier.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said he agreed to visit Beijing in April and invited Chinese President Xi Jinping for a state visit later next year, following a phone call between the two leaders.Trump and Xi - who met nearly a month ago in South Korea - discussed a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to the president and China's foreign ministry.\"Our relationship with China is extremely strong!\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.China's state new agency released a statement that said both countries should \"keep up the momentum, keep moving forward in the right direction on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit\". The leaders met in Busan, South Korea in October, after which they agreed to a truce on tariffs. The US decided to cut a 20% tariff in half aimed at decreasing the flow of fentanyl. Tariffs remain on Chinese goods and average just below 50%. \"Since then, the China-US relationship has generally maintained a steady and positive trajectory, and this is welcomed by the two countries and the broader international community,\" the Chinese statement said.Xi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer gameTrade, tariffs and TikTok: Why it matters that Trump and Xi are talking againThe US then pulled back a threat of 100% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, while China delayed its plan to introduce its latest round of rare earth export controls. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Monday call with Xi - which lasted about an hour - was focused on trade.\"We are pleased with what we've seen from from the Chinese, and they feel the same way,\" she said.In addition to discussing trade, Xi and Trump broached the topics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan.Xi told Trump that Taiwan's \"return to China\" is essential for China's vision for the \"post-war international order\".China has been marred in a diplomatic battle with Japan, a US ally, over the longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a Japanese military response.Trump, however, did not mention Taiwan in his Truth Social post about the call. US Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, previously said the US backs Tokyo in the wake of China's \"coercion\".",

    "body": "Judge dismisses cases against ex-FBI director Comey and NY attorney general James4 hours agoAna FaguyComey: \"Donald Trump will probably come after me again\"A US judge has dismissed criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the charges was unlawfully appointed.Judge Cameron Currie said that Lindsey Halligan, who was handpicked by Trump to bring the charges against two of his political adversaries, was never eligible to assume the post.Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and described the prosecutions as political in nature. In response to the ruling, the White House told the BBC:  \"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter.\"President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Comey and James, declaring in one social media post, \"They're all guilty as hell\", and later adding \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" In her decision on Monday, Judge Currie wrote that Halligan, a former White House aide who had never prosecuted a case before, was not authorised to present the charges to the grand jury.\"All actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie ruled.Getty ImagesLindsey HalliganHalligan was named as a replacement for Erik Siebert, an interim US attorney who resigned in September amid the Trump administration's pressure to file charges against both Comey and James.Judge Currie determined that Halligan's appointment violated the statute governing interim US attorneys. Under that law, the attorney general has 120 days to make an interim appointment - a period that began on 21 January with Siebert's designation, the judge noted.When that 120-day window closed on 21 May, the attorney general's authority to appoint an interim replacement expired as well, Judge Currie wrote. As a result, Halligan \"has been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her 22 September appointment.The cases were dismissed \"without prejudice\", meaning the justice department could potentially refile the case at a later date.The department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the justice department would appeal against the dismissal of Comey and James's cases \"very soon\".She said the administration's position was that Halligan had been legally appointed. Leavitt also accused the judge of \"trying to shield\"  Comey and James.Getty ImagesLetitia JamesAfter the ruling, Comey said he was grateful a prosecution \"based on malevolence and incompetence\" had ended, but noted \"Trump will probably come after me again\".Comey was fired by Trump during his first term, after leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The former FBI director was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice in September, after Trump called for his prosecution and appointed a new federal prosecutor to pursue the case. James issued a statement saying she was \"heartened by today's victory\".\"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,\" the statement continued.James was facing federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. She previously brought charges against Trump before he won re-election, and later became a target of the Trump administration.

    "body": "8 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorDrug maker Novo Nordisk says semaglutide, the active ingredient for the weight loss jab Wegovy, does not slow Alzheimer's - despite initial hopes that it might help against dementia.Researchers began two large trials involving more than 3,800 people after reports the medicine was having an impact in the real world.But the studies showed the GLP-1 drug, which is already used to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity, made no difference compared to a dummy drug. The disappointing results are due to be presented at an Alzheimer's disease conference next month and are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Dr Susan Kohlhaas from Alzheimer's Research UK said the results would come as a blow for people affected by Alzheimer's.Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research and development at Novo Nordisk, said: \"Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success.\"While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities,\" he said. The patients who took part in the Evoke trials were aged between 55 and 85 and had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.Dementia progression was monitored and measured through tests and interviews. Treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers, but this did not translate into delaying progression of the disease.Dr Kohlhaas said: \"These trial results are another reminder that Alzheimer's is driven by several different biological processes. No single approach is likely to be enough. \"The field now needs to focus on understanding those processes in much greater detail and developing treatments that can be used together to tackle the disease from multiple angles.\"She added that the growing use of GLP-1 medicines through private prescriptions, largely for weight loss, offers an opportunity to gather better real-world data on their longer-term effects.Fiona Carragher, chief policy and research officer at Alzheimer's Society, said while it was \"very disappointing\" that these eagerly awaited results were not what everyone had hoped for, \"no trial is wasted\".\"Every investigation helps us develop better drugs and design better trials in the future.\"She said there were currently more than 130 Alzheimer's drugs in clinical trials of which around 30 are in late-stage trials - the final step before they are considered by regulators.",

    "body": "Zelensky welcomes amendments to proposed peace plan3 hours agoLaura GozziandPatrick JacksonRubio hails 'most productive day' of negotiations with UkraineUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed proposed changes to the controversial 28-point peace plan for ending the war with Russia.  It appears Ukraine's European allies produced an amended version of the plan after rejecting parts which favoured Russia's war aims.\"Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable...\" Zelensky said on Telegram. \"Many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework.\" US and Ukrainian officials met in Geneva on Sunday to discuss the plan, drafted by American and Russian officials in October, which had caused consternation in Kyiv and among its European allies. Russian representatives did not take part in the meeting in Switzerland. A Kremlin official rejected the amendments on Monday as \"completely unconstructive\". In another development, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the Trump administration was not favouring Russia in its efforts to end the war.\"The idea that the United States of America is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,\" she told reporters.President Donald Trump was \"hopeful and optimistic\" that a plan could be worked out for ending the war, Leavitt added.Following the end of the talks in Geneva, Trump suggested on social media that \"something good just may be happening\" but added: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"In Geneva, the talks began with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny the 28-point plan advocated by Trump had been written by the Kremlin, as several of its elements seemed heavily geared towards Moscow's longstanding demands.Zelensky said on Monday evening that the revised plan was \"truly the right approach\". \"The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump,\" he added, without saying when.According to an official in Zelensky's office, the 28-point plan leaked on Friday no longer existed. Speaking to the Financial Times, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsa, who attended the weekend talks in Geneva, said the latest plan consisted of just 19 points, with some of the most politically sensitive elements, including territorial concessions, now due to be decided by the leaders themselves.A virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting of Ukraine's European allies will take place on Tuesday to discuss developments, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced.There was, he said, still work to do for a \"just and lasting peace\" in Ukraine.In Moscow, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters: \"The European plan, at first glance... is completely unconstructive and does not work for us.\"Zelensky said earlier on Monday that the \"main problem\" remained Putin's demand for legal recognition of territory Russia had taken.Comments by Trump which suggested Ukraine had until 27 November to accept the deal or risk losing US support created a sense of urgency across Europe on Friday, and talks between Ukraine and US officials were hastily convened.The counter-proposals - reportedly drafted by the UK, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's permitted army size, and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It also controls Crimea and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes, since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly four years ago.",

    "body": "12 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesJimmy Cliff's hits included Many Rivers To Cross, Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really WantJimmy Cliff, one of the most prominent and beloved proponents of reggae music, has died at the age of 81.A star since the 1960s, he helped to bring the sound of Jamaica to a global audience through hits such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.His lead role as a gun-toting rebel in the 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come is a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema, and was attributed as the movie that brought reggae to America.Cliff's wife, Latifa Chambers, announced his death via a statement on Instagram.\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" she wrote.\"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. \"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.\"Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\" Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.Getty ImagesBorn James Chambers in 1944, Cliff grew up as the eighth of nine children in abject poverty in the parish of St. James, Jamaica.Blessed with a sweet, mellifluous voice, he began singing at his local church at the age of six.He was inspired to write his own material when he heard ska pioneer Derrick Morgan on the radio - and asked his woodwork teacher how one might go about composing their own song. “He told me, ‘You just write it!’“ he told Mojo magazine. ”So I went ahead and… wrote a song called I Need A Fiancée, another called Sob Sob and I made a guitar out of bamboo to accompany myself.”By the time he was 14, he'd moved to Kingston and adopted the surname Cliff to express the heights he intended on reaching.He recorded a handful of singles before topping the Jamaican charts with his own composition, Hurricane Hattie. In 1965, he relocated to London to work with Island Records - later the home of Bob Marley - but the label's attempts to make his sound palatable to rock audiences were initially unsuccessful.He eventually struck gold with the 1969 single Wonderful World, Beautiful People - an upbeat, feelgood anthem; and the more politically-charged Vietnam, which Bob Dylan called \"the best protest song ever written\".Its lyric tells the story of a young soldier who writes from the war, promising his mother he'll be home soon; only for her to receive a telegram the next day, informing her of his death.Cliff reflected on the song in 1986, telling reggae archivist Roger Steffens: \"The essence of my music is struggle. What gives it the icing is the hope of love.\"Getty ImagesThe Harder They Come had to be subtitled in the US because of the character's thick Jamaican patoisThe musician became an international star with The Harder They Come, expressly written for the movie of the same name, in which he played Ivan Martin, a young man trying to break into Jamaica's corrupt music industry.\"The film opened the door for Jamaica,\" Cliff recalled. \"It said, 'This is where this music comes from.'\"BBC Sounds: Witness - Jimmy Cliff on The Harder They ComeBBC 6 Music: The First Time with Jimmy CliffCliff contributed four songs to the soundtrack, including the gospel hymn Many Rivers To Cross, which reflected his early days as a struggling artist in the UK.\"I was still in my teens,\" he later recalled. \"I came full of vigour: I'm going to make it, I'm going to be up there with the Beatles and the Stones.\"\"And it wasn't really going like that, I was touring clubs, not breaking through. I was struggling, with work, life, my identity. I couldn't find my place. Frustration fuelled the song.\"Instead, the film and its soundtrack won him international acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine even named it one of their top 500 albums of all time.During the 1980s, he collaborated with the Rolling Stones on their Dirty Work album, and he returned to the US charts in 1993 with his cover of I Can See Clearly Now, from the soundtrack for Cool Runnings, which followed the escapades of Jamaica's bobsled team.His other recordings included the Grammy Award-winning albums Cliff Hanger (1985) and Rebirth (2012), a nostalgic return to form.Cliff entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, calling it \"a great thrill and an honour\".Inducting him, Fugees star Wyclef Jean said he'd been inspired by Cliff's success as a young boy growing up in Haiti.\"When we saw Jimmy Cliff, we saw ourselves,\" he said.Cliff continued to tour late into his life, playing Glastonbury's legends slot in 2003; and winning over a new generation of fans at the 2010 Coachella Festival.His contributions to Jamaican music and culture were recognised in October 2003 when he was awarded the country's prestigious Order of Merit.But the singer said his connection to fans was more important than any of the other honours bestowed upon him.Speaking to US radio station NPR in 2012, he reflected: \"When someone comes up to me and says, 'I was a dropout in school and I heard your song You Can Get It If You Really Want, and that song made me go back to school, and now I am a teacher and I use your song with my students' - that, for me, is a big success.\"",

But for 20 minutes there, it was lodged and I couldn't breathe, so it was terrifying.\"She joked that Strictly would \"have been a judge down tonight if it wasn't for her\".Ballas contined: \"Gratitude to Jane because I panicked. I really thought that was it, the end, amen.\"In a separate post, the Liverpudlian dancer and TV personality, 65, wrote: \"Almost didn't make it to the desk last night, I had a fishbone stuck.\"She updated her followers in a later post by saying she was \"a bit hoarse, but all is good\".She also vowed to learn how to peform the Heimlich manoeuvre - which involves abdominal thrusts from behind - \"in case I ever come across anybody who needs my help\".Only four in ten people know the first aid skills needed for choking, according to research from England's first aid charity St John Ambulance in August 2024.Ballas took over as head judge on the celebrity dance contest from Len Goodman in 2017.How to help someone who's chokingThe NHS advises that for severe choking - when the person is unable to breathe, speak and/or cough to clear the blockage themself - a helper should administer five sharp back blows between the shoulders from behind (for anyone over the age of one year old).If the blockage has not cleared, the NHS says the helper should try abdominal thrusts. It suggests:Stand behind the person who is chokingPlace your arms around their waist and bend them well forwardClench one fist and place it just above the person's belly buttonPlace your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwardsRepeat this up to five timesBBC News health reporter Michelle Roberts said people who find themselves choking, in a similar manner to Ballas, should seek urgent medical help. \"A fish bone in the airways causing breathing problems is an emergency,\" she said.\"Sometimes a bone may get stuck in the throat or gullet instead. A doctor will be able to assess whether the bone is likely to pass through on its own or if treatment is needed to remove it.\"They may do a scan and recommend removal under anaesthetic.\"",

The Queensland senator, of the anti-immigration One Nation party, was seeking to introduce a bill that would ban full face coverings in public – a policy she has long campaigned for.It is the second time she has worn the garment – which covers the face and body – in parliament, and said her actions were in protest at the senate rejecting her bill.Shortly after other lawmakers blocked her from introducing the bill on Monday, she returned wearing a black burka.\"This is a racist senator, displaying blatant racism,\" said Mehreen Faruqi, a Muslim  Greens senator from New South Wales.Fatima Payman, an independent senator from the state of Western Australia, called the stunt \"disgraceful\".Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who serves as leader of the government in the senate, condemned it as \"disrespectful\". \"We represent in our states, people of every faith, of every faith of all backgrounds. And we should do so decently,\" she said.She added Hanson was \"not worthy of a member of the Australian Senate\" and moved a motion to suspend Hanson for failing to remove the garment. In a post on Facebook, Hanson wrote \"If they don't want me wearing it - ban the burka.\"She previously wore a burka to parliament in 2017, also calling for a national ban at the time.In 2016, Hanson was criticised for her maiden speech to the Australian senate, in which she said the country was in danger of being \"swamped by Muslims\".It echoed her controversial 1996 speech in which she warned that the country was in danger of being \"swamped by Asians\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent , Geneva Donald Trump wants a peace deal in Ukraine very badly.Kyiv wants peace even more, just not at any cost.That's why when the US began pushing it to agree to a deal by Thanksgiving on what looked close to surrender terms, Ukraine pushed back.It scrambled senior officials to talks in Geneva and all of Sunday we saw delegates from the US and Ukraine shuttling back and forth between the two main venues in black limousines with darkened windows.They were joined by national security advisers from Germany, France and the UK.The only time I glimpsed Andriy Yermak, heading the negotiating team from Kyiv, he looked stony-faced.No wonder: the starting proposal on the table was so skewed towards Russia's demands, the talks began with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny it had been written by the Kremlin.But Donald Trump had been clear that Ukraine needed to sign up fast or face unspecified consequences. So Kyiv had to engage.On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though - Ukraine's deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"",

    "body": "Three-time Olympic gold medallist Max Whitlock is coming out of retirement to target a place at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.The 32-year-old, who is the most successful British gymnast in history, had initially announced that the 2024 Paris Games would be his last.However, Whitlock says his career felt \"unfinished\" after missing out on a place on the podium in the French capital. \"I'm back,\" he said on The One Show. \"It feels unbelievable. I'm officially back, I'm a gymnast again, and that feels crazy.\"Something was itching away at me constantly, it has been for the last year, it doesn't sit right, it feels unfinished, incomplete.\"I feel like I've got an opportunity in front of me, and I'll never get this again. So I'm going back in, a three-year stint, I want to make it to my fifth Olympic Games.\"I know it's a dangerous game to play, but I want to finish it on a high, I want to rewrite the end of my career.\"I would rather take the risk of taking that opportunity, rather than not taking the risk, because I think that's something that fast forward 10, 15 years, I'll look back and think that's something I regret.\"I really want to push it further than I ever have before.\"Whitlock, who will be 35 by the start of the LA Games, took pommel horse gold at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, and has three bronze medals - as well as a triumph on the floor.Yet he now faces a challenge to get back into peak shape and compete against gymnasts who are considerably younger, with the English Championships, the British Championships and the Commonwealth Games all on the horizon next year.\"I had a year out completely, I've come back in slowly,\" he said. \"The other week I picked up an injury. I wasn't even doing anything on the pommel horse, I was sitting next to it, I looked at my phone, I looked up, and my neck had gone.\"Who knows what's to come.\"",

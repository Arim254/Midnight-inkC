    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems14 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them. How will we live?\"We want safety. We go to sleep and wake up afraid.\"Top picture credits: AFP via Getty Images and Anadolu via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Norris keen to 'live a normal few days' and 'forget I drive in F1'Media caption, 'Winning made everything worth it' - Norris on F1 title and what's to come in the futureByF1 Correspondent in Abu DhabiLando Norris says he is looking forward to switching off and forgetting all about the year in which he achieved his lifetime's ambition of winning the Formula 1 World Championship.The McLaren driver spent Sunday night into Monday morning celebrating in Abu Dhabi, before digesting his triumph with BBC Sport in a hotel on Yas Island, a stone's throw from the F1 track.Norris is relaxed, good humoured and chatty as he reviews his journey.Next, he is heading to the McLaren factory, to analyse this year, and for work in the simulator, already thinking about next season.There are more celebrations to come this week, including picking up the official championship trophy at a prizegiving ceremony in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on Friday, before the McLaren Christmas party in London on Saturday.And then, breathe.\"Honestly,\" Norris says, \"try to forget this season, try to forget a little bit what we've been able to achieve together. Forget that I drive in Formula 1.\"I don't want to forget what we've achieved this season, but just try to live a normal few days of the year, and go play some golf and do some normal things and that's it.\"The realisation of what he has achieved is beginning to dawn on the 26-year-old Briton but he says he \"still finds it very surreal\".\"I was just by the pool earlier,\" he says. \"And when someone says, 'Congrats, world champ' or something, it's definitely got a very different ring to it (than) when it's just 'Congrats, Lando,' or whatever it may be.\"I don't know. It's such a sizeable achievement.\"Making parents proud 'the best thing you can ask for'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris is embraced by his mum Cisca and dad Adam just after the conclusion of the Abu Dhabi Grand PrixAt the celebrations, and waiting for him in the lobby of the hotel, were his father Adam and mother Cisca. The family are wealthy, thanks to Adam Norris' success as a pension trader, which made him a multi-millionaire.But becoming an elite sportsman still means starting learning your trade at a very young age, and a lot of personal sacrifices.\"Everything is different for everyone,\" he says, \"so the sacrifices you've made are just very different sacrifices to all the people in the world have made. So I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.\"But still as a family you want to spend time together. And that's something we've not really done a lot of since I started when I was like seven, eight years old.\"My dad was taking me everywhere. I spent a lot more time with my dad than I did with my mum. My mum was at home looking after my sisters.\"I see my mum 20 days a year maybe, something like that. Which is not a lot.\"But certainly winning and having the achievement we did yesterday made everything feel more worth it, all those times away.\"One thing that everyone wants to do, is make their parents proud. So the fact I got to do that yesterday, I hope make them even more proud, is the best thing you can ask for.\"Proving himself wrong and 'a brutal honesty'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris, then 15, celebrates winning the 2015 MSA Formula Championship (now known as the F4 British Championship) - 10 years before he reached the pinnacle of motorsportNorris says he's \"seen a lot of photos over the last 12 hours; a lot of little me\".One of them is of him doing donuts in a kart when he was still a small boy. What would he tell little Lando if he could talk to him now?\"Probably just to have a bit more belief in myself,\" he says, \"because it's something I never really had when I was younger. It's something I always lacked.\"In that video, I was so small. I was never the big kid or never the aggressive one, that kind of thing. I'm still the same, I think, now. I would just get my elbows out a little bit more. That's probably my only thing.\"This sort of vulnerability is Norris' trademark. It was evident after the race, too, when he said he was \"proud that I've proved myself wrong\".I ask what he meant, and he says it was a reference to his difficult first part of the season, when his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took the initiative, and the championship lead, and had won four races before Norris had taken his second.By the time of the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August, Piastri had a 34-point lead over Norris and seemed a certain bet for the title, only for Norris to rally and overhaul it all.\"When Oscar was doing a better job than me and I wasn't doing a great job, I was like, 'Well, you know, maybe they're just a bit better. Maybe they can just be more consistent, get more out of the car,'\" Norris says.\"I just never thought at times that it was possible. So for me to then do that for myself, to kind of go, 'You're wrong, you can do it,' is a pretty incredible feeling to have for yourself.\"I wouldn't say I'm a very selfish person, but I've also learned at times I almost have to be more selfish with some of these feelings and thoughts. I need that to almost make me a better and stronger driver.\"It's just nice to almost make myself have more confidence. But I often only do that when I prove it to myself. I've always had that thought of, 'Oh, the next step is such a big leap. Am I ever going to be able to perform at the level I need to perform at?' I have more doubts than positive thoughts at those times.\"But I've also changed a lot this season. I also feel through the year I've been able to be in a much better place, be a lot more confident in myself, change my whole approach and mentality.\"It's a trademark of all great F1 drivers that they look hard at themselves, analyse their weaknesses, and work out ways to improve, and keep doing it throughout their career.Norris is unusual, though, in that he speaks about that process so openly. Why?\"Great question,\" he says. \"I don't know, truthfully. I don't know why sometimes I tell you guys as much stuff as I do.\"Sometimes I get told I shouldn't and sometimes I probably do tell too much, or reveal too much, and people can see vulnerabilities in that and so forth.\"Maybe at times that's a mistake. But at the same time at least I'm being truthful to my own self. If I'm doing a bad job, I tell myself I'm doing a bad job and I certainly have people around me telling me the truth about things.\"What I hate the most is the opposite, is doing a bad job and someone going, 'That's all right, you'll be fine, things will just get better.' Because it's just not the case.\"I hate that kind of mentality and approach, and I've certainly not been brought up in that way. People around me have certainly not been like that.\"It's very much a brutal honesty which has made me the person I am today. But I'm also just I think quite an open, honest person, I will just say what I believe.\"How Monaco lap made him cry and 'flipped everything'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris set a new track record of 1:09.954 in taking pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix in MayNorris has achieved so much this year. Along with the world title, he has won the two races every driver dreams of winning - Monaco and his home grand prix at Silverstone.What else is there left to do? He smiles.\"I would have loved to make my life a bit easier and win it just earlier next time,\" he says. \"But I won ones that people have dreams of winning. They're some of the most incredible ones.\"The lap I did in Monaco in qualifying was the only other time probably in the last 10 years that I cried a little bit over something.\"It was the one other moment this season that I proved myself wrong, because I had that bad run of results.\"I just couldn't perform in qualifying. Qualifying has always been my strong suit, my best. It's been my strength since I was in karting. All my qualifying results are my thing and they weren't at the beginning of the season.\"I went to the hardest track to do a qualifying lap. It's not been my best track in the past.\"I turned off my (lap time cockpit display) delta for the first time that weekend so I couldn't see if I was on a better lap, worse lap, whatever it was.\"For me to then to go there and put in that lap at the end of qualifying was one of the best moments of my career, because it was the time I almost doubted myself the most ever, in the most important season that it turned out to be.\"But that one lap - one minute nine seconds - was all it needed for me to flip everything and turn that thought of 'I just don't know if I've got this' to 'I can definitely do this'. That was a pivotal moment for me up here (he points to his head).\"We end by discussing what he will take from this year into next. And he gives another revealing answer.\"I take a lot,\" he says, \"plenty of things that I know I could have done better, I should have done better.\"But I did what I had to in the end. It was crazy close. Two points is all it was to Max (Verstappen). That's pretty insane, especially when he was so far back.\"What do I take? I take that I can do it. I do have what it takes.\"I had my flaws. I had my mistakes. But I'm confident, and I have the confidence now that I can look at them, review them, analyse them, not make them again and do even better next season.\"",

Run!\" and \"Tsunami warning issued for central Hokkaido's Pacific Coast\"No irregularities were reported at the Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said.None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency.Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011.That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.",

They both remain in custody, the force said.The arrests follow an investigation into an assault at the multi-storey car park at Terminal 3 on Sunday. Prior to the attack, two women were robbed of their suitcases after getting out of a car park lift.A three-year-old girl was among the injured during the incident. Five people went to hospital for treatment and have since been discharged.Officers arrested a 31-year-old man on suspicion of robbery and assault close to the scene. He has since been released under investigation while inquiries continue.Police were called at about 08:10 GMT following reports of a number of people injured by a noxious substance believed to be pepper spray.The assault - which the Met said was isolated and not being treated as terrorism - resulted in train delays and the partial closure of the Central Terminal Area tunnel and the Terminal 3 car park for a short time.More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoDaniela Relph,Senior royal correspondentandNoor Nanji,Culture reporterThe Duke of Sussex's access to security when he visits the UK is under review, sources have told the BBC.In May, Prince Harry lost a legal case to have his police protection reinstated when visiting the UK.In a BBC interview after the ruling, he said it was not safe to bring his family back to the country of his birth because he could not guarantee their safety.It is understood a Home Office review will now look at whether he should automatically receive full police protection on visits to the UK even though he is no longer a working member of the royal family.Sources close to the prince say this level of security review is long overdue. According to The Sun newspaper, the process for reassessing the duke's threat level is already under way and a decision is expected next month.King Charles has only met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children once before. He last saw his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.Prince Harry's security was downgraded after he stepped back from frontline royal duties in 2020 and moved to the US with the Duchess of Sussex.In his legal challenge earlier this year, he contested the decision-making process used by a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office.Ravec had concluded that because Prince Harry was going to be an infrequent visitor to the UK, his security needs would be assessed on a case by case basis.But in doing so, the duke's legal team argued that Ravec did not properly re-assess the threats he faced when considering his situation in 2020.His lawyers had argued that he had been \"singled out\" for \"inferior treatment\", but the court ruling upheld that there had been nothing unlawful about how the decision had been reached.A senior judge ruled that Prince Harry's \"sense of grievance\" over how the decision to alter his security was reached did not amount to a basis for a successful appeal.That decision meant the duke's security remained outside the automatic, high level of protection which is provided for senior royals.Speaking to BBC News in California shortly afterwards, Prince Harry said he was \"devastated\" at losing his appeal.He also said any prospect of a return to the UK for him and his family was \"impossible\" in light of the Court of Appeal ruling, adding: \"I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\"At the time, Buckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\"A government spokesperson said: \"The UK Government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate.\"It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterWarner Brothers DiscoveryWarner Brothers Discovery is owner of HBO, known for shows like Sex and the City Paramount Skydance has made another offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery as it seeks to trump a rival plan from Netflix to buy the company's studio and streaming networks. Paramount, which is backed by the billionaire Ellison family, said it was making a direct offer to shareholders of $30 per share to scoop up the whole of Warner Bros, including its traditional television networks.It said its proposal was a \"superior alternative\" to Netflix's, delivering more cash upfront to shareholders and greater prospect of approval by regulators. President Donald Trump has said \"there could be a problem\" with Netflix's purchase, pointing to competition concerns given the size of the companies. The hostile bid from Paramount, a smaller player than Netflix which is known for brands such as CBS News, Nickelodeon and Mission Impossible, is the latest twist in a saga that started a few months ago, when Paramount started submitting offers to buy Warner Bros.That eventually prompted Warner Bros, owner of HBO and classics from Looney Tunes to Harry Potter, to formally open a bidding process. Paramount had been seen by many on Wall Street as a strong suitor for Warner Bros, in part because the relationship between David and Larry Ellison, who is a Republican megadonor, and Trump was expected to help ease the approval process. But Warner Bros declared Netflix the winner of that auction on Friday, announcing a deal that valued its studio and streaming networks, including HBO, at about $83bn, including its debt.It said the sale would proceed after a planned spin-off of other parts of Warner Brothers' business, including CNN, into an independent company.Paramount's offer values the entire company at $108.4bn, which it said was a better deal. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is among the financial partners Paramount is working with as part of the deal, according to paperwork submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Either takeover is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.Analysts said Netflix's plan would likely raise concerns about dominance in streaming, while Paramount's proposal would prompt a review of the impact on advertisers and local television distributors, given the power of a combined company over sports and children's networks.Paramount's plans, which would put CBS and CNN under the same parent company, have also been closely watched because of the potential impact on the news business and the Ellisons' ties to Trump.The president said over the weekend he expected to be involved in the approval process. But he has offered little certainty about his views.While noting potential concerns about Netflix's tie-up on Sunday, he also praised the streamer's bosses. Meanwhile on social media on Monday, he took aim at Paramount for a 60 Minutes interview that it aired with former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative.In an interview with CNBC, Paramount chief executive David Ellison said he had had \"great conversations\" with Trump about the deal, while noting that he did not want to speak for the president. Netflix is the biggest streaming company in the world, with more than 300 million subscribers. It said on Friday it believed the takeover would help supercharge its business and expressed confidence in winning approval from regulators. But Wall Street analysts have long said they believe a Paramount-Warner Bros combination makes sense, giving the company the scale to compete against rivals such as Netflix and Disney. It would build on Mr Ellison's purchase earlier this year of Paramount, which he folded into his Skydance film studio. \"Paramount ultimately needs this deal more than Netflix,\" said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, calling the Warner Bros assets simply \"nice to have\" for the streamer.Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr Ellison talked up the benefits of his plan for the entire media industry, arguing that Netflix's takeover of Warner Brothers Discovery would give one firm too much power over actors and other players in the industry.\"It's a horrible deal for Hollywood,\" he said. He also said he thought Warner Bros' plan to spin-off its traditional networks into an independent company would set them up to fail and ultimately prove a mistake for shareholders.\"I think [its shares are] going to be worth a lot less than people are claiming,\" he said. Shares in Warner Bros were up more than 3% in midday trade on Monday, while Paramount shares were also up.Shares in Netflix, however, dropped.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKatya AdlerBBC Europe editorUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has met key European allies as he faces US pressure to reach a swift peace deal with Russia.In London, Zelensky held talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.The meeting came amid US efforts to get Moscow and Kyiv to sign up - quickly - to a plan to end the war in Ukraine.For Kyiv, the crucial, thorny issues are the question of ceding territory to Russia as part of any peace deal and obtaining strong security guarantees to ensure that Moscow respects an eventual agreement.Ahead of the meeting in London, Starmer insisted - as he often has in the past - that Ukraine needed \"hard-edged security guarantees\". He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv must determine its own future, not have conditions imposed on it.The big names Starmer hosted in London discussed hugely significant issues - not only for Ukraine's future, but for the security of the continent as a whole.There's concern that if Russia is \"rewarded\" by being given Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, it could feel emboldened to attack other European countries in the future.But will Monday's talks in London make any meaningful difference to peace negotiations?The visuals of Europe's arguably most influential nations standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street tell one story. But when it comes to Washington, European leaders are walking a tightrope.In its National Security Strategy published on Friday, the US pointed the finger of blame at Europeans over Ukraine, accusing them of having \"unrealistic expectations\" as to how the war might end.Although they have not publicly commented on the document, behind closed doors Europe's leaders fear Donald Trump is keen for a quick fix in Ukraine, so he can turn his attentions elsewhere. But a quick fix, they worry, will not mean a long-lasting peace - only a temporary pause in Russian aggression in Ukraine and possibly further afield in Europe.Recent incidents including unmanned drones causing chaos in civilian airports in Germany, Denmark, Belgium and elsewhere, an act of railway sabotage in Poland that could have cost lives and significant cyber-attacks across the continent have all been laid at Russia's door. They have brought the war in Ukraine closer to Europeans, however far they are from the front line. With that has come a sense that Russia would like to weaken their continent as a whole.But we do not hear those European concerns broadcast loudly in public.For the most part, leaders continue to praise Trump. On Monday, Starmer said the US president had progressed peace negotiations \"the furthest we've got in the four years\" in just a few weeks. He added that talks were complicated, but progress was being made.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that he was \"sceptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the US side\",  but added \"we have to talk about it\".The fact is, European leaders don't want to provoke the US president over differences on how to achieve peace.Donald Trump has flip-flopped dramatically in his attitudes towards Kyiv since he returned to the White House. He has a pretty tempestuous relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, whereas he has often praised Vladimir Putin.Washington has already stopped direct aid to Ukraine - although it still provides much-needed intelligence to its military and allows European countries to purchase US weapons which are then sent on to Kyiv.European nations are not in a position to support Ukraine militarily without the US.After decades of under-investment in their militaries, they are not in a position to take on the security and defence of their own continent alone, either.The US is the biggest and most powerful member of Nato. Europe looks to Washington for intelligence, command and control capabilities, for air force capabilities - such as air-to-air refuelling - and much more.Despite a pledge to Donald Trump at a Nato summit a few months ago to vastly increase defence spending (and Trump is far from the first US president to ask for that), Europe cannot practically become militarily independent overnight.European governments are currently facing considerable budgetary constraints.In the UK, talk of struggling and failing public services are common. In France - which has long been in the throes of a huge budgetary crisis - next year's draft budget only sets €120m (£105m) in civilian and military aid for Ukraine.It is because of these limitations that - in public - the concerns about Washington and a peace plan for Ukraine are so carefully expressed by Europe's leaders. They don't want to risk being left completely alone by the power they still describe as their greatest ally.But the differences in the European and US approaches to Moscow are glaring.While Europeans – particularly in countries bordering Russia - view Moscow as a destabilising threat, in its National Security Strategy the Trump administration talked up the importance of building \"strategic stability\" with Russia, and questioned Europe's longer-term reliability as an ally.Europe's leaders are trying to avoid further alienating the US president, while fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and future continental stability. It's a tortuous dance.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGetty ImagesGhetts pictured at the Ivor Novello Awards earlier this yearAward-winning rapper Ghetts has admitted killing a young man in a hit-and-run collision in north-east London.The grime artist, whose real name is Justin Clarke-Samuel, failed to stop after his BMW hit Nepali student Yubin Tamang, 20, in Ilford, north-east London, on 18 October.Police said the rapper was driving over 60mph in a 30mph zone, and hit Mr Tamang who was crossing the road. Clarke-Samuel, 41, from Woodford, east London, pleaded guilty to causing Mr Tamang's death by dangerous driving, and a second charge of dangerous driving on the same day. He also faces two further charges which are driving while over the legal alcohol limit and dangerous driving.Met PoliceMr Tamang was an only child and his parents had sent him to the UK to receive an education, the court heardThe fatal collision happened at about 23:30 BST, where Mr Tamang was hit as he was crossing the road on Redbridge Lane, Ilford, north-east London.The second charge of dangerous driving that he admitted to, related to being behind the wheel of his BMW M5 in Tavistock Place and other London roads in Camden, Islington and Hackney on the same day.Police attended the defendant's address in Woodford early the next day.The black BMW, registered and insured in the defendant's name, was significantly damaged, police said.'Split-second decisions'Clarke-Samuel is due to be sentenced on 12 February, when the two other charges will also be dealt with, the court said.The first is a charge of causing death by careless driving when over the limit for alcohol. It is alleged he was over the prescribed limit as he drove with 119 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath on 18 October.The second, a dangerous driving charge, relates to an allegation that he dangerously drove a BMW M5 on Worcester Crescent and other roads in Redbridge, east London, on the same day.Met PoliceJustin Clarke-Samuel, better known as Ghetts, has been told to expect a custodial sentenceMr Tamang was an only child and his parents had sent him to the UK to receive an education.He died in hospital two days after being knocked down.Clarke-Samuel, who appeared via videolink from Pentonville prison, is currently in custody and the judge told him to expect a jail term, the length of which has yet to be determined.He was also disqualified from driving, but the length of the ban is also still to be decided.Ghetts is a Mercury Prize-nominated grime MC, rapper and songwriter who has had high profile musical collaborations with major acts including Stormzy, Ed Sheeran and Skepta.He won the Best Male Act at the Mobo Awards in 2021 and received the Mobo Pioneer award in 2024 for his \"significant contribution to British black culture\".He has also performed at Glastonbury multiple times including in 2024, and featured in the Netflix superhero series Supacell.After the hearing, Det Insp Mark Braithwaite from the Met said \"split-second decisions behind the wheel can have devastating, life-changing consequences\".He added: \"Our thoughts and sympathies remain with Yubin's family.\"While nothing can undo their loss, today's two guilty pleas mark a step toward justice.\"We hope this brings them some measure of comfort.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSteven BrocklehurstBBC ScotlandPA MediaNurse Sandie Peggie, pictured after the tribunal judgement, has worked for the NHS for 30 yearsA nurse who objected to sharing a female changing room with a transgender doctor has won a claim for harassment against NHS Fife but other allegations of discrimination and victimisation were dismissed.Sandie Peggie was suspended from her job in a hospital's A&E department after she complained about Dr Beth Upton - a biological male who identifies as a woman - using a female changing room.An employment tribunal judgement outlined four ways in which NHS Fife harassed Ms Peggie but dismissed the other allegations against the health board and all claims against Dr Upton.Ms Peggie welcomed the decision and said the past two years had been \"agonising\", while NHS Fife said it would take time to work through the details.Dr Beth Upton accused Sandie Peggie of bullying and harrassmentSandie Peggie employment tribunal outcome - reaction and analysisThe employment tribunal, which took place earlier this year, was high profile and controversial. It was brought by Ms Peggie, a nurse who has worked for the NHS for 30 years.She refused to share a women's changing room with a transgender colleague at Victoria Hospital, in Kirkcaldy, and was suspended from work at the beginning of 2024. Ms Peggie claimed her experiences amounted to harassment and took legal action against the health board and Dr Upton, citing the Equality Act 2010.Timeline of the Sandie Peggie tribunalIn a written judgement on Monday, the tribunal found that NHS Fife had harassed Ms Peggie in a number of ways.It said that when she complained to her employers about Dr Upton using the women's changing rooms, permission should have been revoked on an interim basis.It said the NHS should have stopped allowing Dr Upton to use the changing area until different work rotas took effect - at which point they wouldn't be working together. The tribunal also ruled that the health board had taken an unreasonable time to investigate the claims against her and that officials were wrong to tell her not to discuss the case. The health board's reference to unproven claims that Ms Peggie had put patients at risk was also deemed to amount to harassment.However, Ms Peggie's claims of discrimination and victimisation by NHS Fife did not succeed and were dismissed, as was her claim against Dr Upton.A separate hearing will take place at a later date to decide on the \"remedy\" for Ms Peggie, which could result in her being awarded compensation.PA MediaDr Upton and Sandie Peggie both worked at the Victoria hospital in KirkcaldyFollowing the judgement, Ms Peggie said: \"I am beyond relieved and delighted that the tribunal has found that my employer Fife Health Board harassed me after I complained about having to share a female-only changing room with a male colleague.\"The last two years have been agonising for me and my family. I will have much more to say in the coming days once I've been able to properly consider the lengthy judgement and discuss it with my legal team.\"For now, I am looking forward to spending a quiet few days with my family.\"In a media statement on Monday evening, Ms Peggie's legal representatives said that \"due to the length of the judgement and the fact it was only received at 10am\" they were not going to make a \"substantive comment\".However, they added that their \"preliminary thoughts\" were that aspects of the judgement were \"hugely problematic\". A spokesperson for NHS Fife said: \"NHS Fife recognises that this has been a complex and lengthy process and acknowledges the careful consideration of Judge Kemp and the tribunal panel.\"The employment tribunal unanimously dismissed all of the claimant's allegations against Dr Upton and all of the allegations against the board, apart from four specific aspects of the harassment complaint.\"We will now take time to work through the detail of the judgement alongside our legal team to understand fully what it means for the organisation.\"Scotland's first minister John Swinney said the tribunal ruling in \"this complex case\" was important and that his government would look at the \"general issues to be learned\".Mr Swinney told BBC News: \"It is important to take time to consider the judgment, that is the role of NHS Fife to do so, and of course the Scottish government will consider any issues that arise out of the judgement for the taking forward of public policy in this area.\"Asked whether he thought Ms Peggie was right to raise the case, Swinney said that \"individuals with concerns about their employment practice are free within the law to raise any concerns that they have\".How have campaigners reacted to the judgement?The campaign group Sex Matters, which backed Sandie Peggie in the case, said it was very disappointed in the approach taken by the tribunal.Maya Forstater, the organisation's CEO, said it should have provided employers with clarity regarding single-sex spaces and that should have meant giving them the confidence to refuse to let trans women use those spaces.She added: \"It is a travesty that a woman can be judged as having expressed herself in the wrong way when she objects to finding a man in the women's changing room.\"Ms Forstater said there was an \"urgent\" need for the Health and Safety Executive to provide clear guidance to employers regarding workplace toilets and changing rooms.However, discrimination lawyer Robin Moira White - who works with Translucent, a trans-led advocacy and human rights organisation - said the ruling was a \"very sensible, balanced judgement\".She said the tribunal had found that Sandie Peggie had harassed Dr Upton, not the other way around.Ms White added: \"It recognised that both trans people and gender critical people have rights in the workplace and employers have to balance those.\"This is showing trans people need to be accommodated appropriately in workplaces, be it toilets or be it changing rooms, and that can only be to the good.\"",

The UK edition of the new football league kicked off in March, bringing together ex-pros, creators and rising players all on one pitch.The six-a-side tournament, fronted by YouTuber KSI, shakes up the game with its 15-minute halves and a 3 vs 3 format in the closing minutes.Now on its second season, the league has opened the door for young footballers, like Bryan Ly, who have spent years trying to get wider recognition. He tells BBC Newsbeat getting the chance to showcase his talent in front of football legends like John Terry and Ian Wright, who are among the team managers,  has been \"absolutely crazy\".\"I've had Ian Wright come up to me and be like: 'Bry you're a very good player' -  these type of people, where they can recognise what I'm doing - it's crazy.\" HandoutBryan Ly's parents moved him and his brother to Manchester to give them the best shot of becoming professional footballers 'I honestly thought my life was over'Like many young kids growing up, becoming a professional footballer was Bryan's dream.Born in Ireland, his parents moved to Manchester when he was 10 as they wanted to give him and his seven-year-old brother the \"best opportunity\" to make it. The 22-year-old's talent was noticed as a teenager and he joined Morecambe FC's under-16s academy.He hoped to get offered a professional contract at the end of his two-year scholarship, but he was dropped at age 18.\"If I'm being 100% real, when I got released, I honestly thought my life was over,\" Bryan says. Afterwards, he emailed more than 90 clubs \"begging for a trial\", but he kept getting rejected.He said it was a \"reality check\" which forced him to reconsider his career path, and credits his family with being \"very supportive\" of him at the time.HandoutBryan later joined non-league football club Wythenshawe at age 19Bryan later joined non-league club Wythenshawe at age 19, and following a season at Bury FC, he returned to Wythenshawe as an attacking midfielder for this season.His attention was drawn to the world of Baller League when he saw a video on social media which highlighted some of the ex-pros and content creators attached. The league features 12 teams with some pretty well-known managers on the bill, including England footballer Chloe Kelly, actor Idris Elba and presenter Maya.Following a trial, Bryan was drafted in and joined the N5 team, which was managed at the time by former pro footballers Jens Lehmann, Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg.\"Obviously, I wasn't old enough to watch them in their prime,\" he says.\"But watching clips back, they're amazing footballers and a lot of fans look up to (them), so to be managed by them and to be coached by them - it was surreal.\" He went on to be the top goal scorer in the competition last year with 21 goals.\"Its amazing for people, like young lads, especially non-league, who maybe aren't given that opportunity or aren't really seen,\" he says.\"It really highlights and showcases your talent.\"It has also helped him secure brand opportunities and grow his presence on social media, as well as leveling up his skills.\"If you told me a year ago I would have played against an ex-Premier League defender and (tried) different things against him, I would have laughed in your face,\" he says.PA MediaAngry Ginge manages the Yanited team at Baller League However, Bryan, who also works with a specialised programme which helps young people facing challenges in mainstream schools, says it can be tiring balancing his job and playing for two teams. It is also very physically demanding, he admits, as Baller League referees don't hand out many fouls. \"You could be pulled, you could be kicked, they might not give you the foul.\" Like many footballers, he's also had to contend with online abuse, but he has \"got to a point where it fuels\" him. For this season he's moved teams to Yanited, managed by one of the UK's most popular streamers, Angry Ginge.But his manager has been out-of-action for the past three weeks as he has been down under competing on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! After enduring a host of bushtucker trials, the 24-year-old Mancunian content creator was crowned the king of the jungle during Sunday's final.Bryan says the team watched Angry Ginge, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, every night and he's glad the creator showed he is \"actually a real human being who's got feelings\", rather than just a streamer known for \"shouting at a video game\". Once Angry Ginge is back on English soil, they hope he leads the team to victory in the league, which will take place every Monday until 5 January. \"He'll come back, he'll take over, we finally get to the top four,\" says Bryan.\"And, hopefully, we lift the Baller League trophy.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "4 hours agoDouglas FraserScotland business and economy editorGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his \"prince\" title in October The St Andrews golf course named after the former Prince Andrew is to be rebranded. The Duke's Course, which is three miles from the centre of the Fife university town, will become the Craigtoun Course, after a nearby country park. A heathland course unlike the links which dominate the home of golf, the Duke's was opened by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in 1995.He later became captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which is based in St Andrews.Getty ImagesAndrew is a keen golfer and attended the 2018 Open at Carnoustie as a spectatorAndrew has given up his honorary membership, as part of his retreat from public life in the wake of the scandal about his close friendship with the paedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The course and club are also to come under the management of the St Andrews Links Trust on a long-term lease. The club's logo is also being changed, to remove the royal association.An illustration featuring trees will replace a lion rampant holding a saltire flag.The trust already runs seven public courses around the Fife town, including the world famous Old Course, which hosts the Open Championship every five years. Until 5 January, the Duke's will continue to be run by golf resort operator Kohler, alongside its ownership of the Old Course Hotel.From then on it will be know as the Craigtoun Course.Private estateFollowing a growing public outcry about his links to Epstein, Andrew was stripped of titles such as the Duke of York and his status as prince, becoming Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.As part of that announcement in October, Andrew was also to leave Royal Lodge and to move into some other accommodation in Sandringham, the King's private estate in Norfolk.Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.A press release confirmed the course would take on a \"revitalised identity\" but it did not mention the former prince.Neil Coulson, chief executive of St Andrews Links Trust, said: \"The agreement for The Craigtoun Course will see the first new course added to the Home of Golf's portfolio in 18 years and presents an ideal opportunity to expand the golf experiences we offer.\"We are delighted to have reached agreement with the Old Course Hotel and look forward to taking over what it is already a significant asset for St Andrews and Scotland and building on its reputation.\"",

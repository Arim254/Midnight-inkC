    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Thomas Tuchel has won nine of his first 10 games in charge of England - the only other England manager to pick up as many wins in his first 10 matches is Glenn Hoddle in 1996-97 (also W9 L1)ByChief football writerEngland completed a flawless World Cup qualifying campaign with victory in Albania, giving head coach Thomas Tuchel an outstanding record of eight wins from eight with 22 goals scored and none conceded.It concludes phase one of the job Tuchel was brought in to do by the Football Association after succeeding Sir Gareth Southgate. Namely win the World Cup.Tuchel's planning now moves to the next stage - so what are the major issues he must ponder before he names his World Cup squad as he looks to end a 60-year wait for a major men's trophy?Bellingham or Rogers?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England's win over Albania saw Jude Bellingham start his first international since JuneThe rivalry between childhood friends Jude Bellingham and Morgan Rogers for England's number 10 jersey provides an intriguing sub-plot to Tuchel's World Cup build-up.Tuchel stresses the battle can remain friendly, although it has almost been stoked and encouraged by the German, so keen is he to create edge and competition in his squad.Along with Declan Rice, Rogers is the only other England player to feature in all 10 games under Tuchel.Rogers took his chance impressively when Bellingham was absent after shoulder surgery, then Tuchel kept faith with Aston Villa's 23-year old after he decided against giving one of the global superstars in England's squad an instant recall.After a 25-minute cameo as a substitute against Serbia at Wembley, Bellingham started in Tirana, delivering a bit of everything that makes him such a passionate point of discussion.Bellingham showed his range of passing, made trademark driving runs, almost scored in the second half – but also demonstrated petulance when he was shown a yellow card for a foul committed after he lost possession, then looked unhappy at being substituted, which Tuchel said he will review.The accomplished manner in which Rogers has taken to the England stage has given Tuchel a wonderful conundrum, while the searing heat at next summer's World Cup means he is likely to deploy \"starters\" and \"finishers\", Bellingham and Rogers can do both.Rogers has an avid admirer in Tuchel. He has made 10 appearances under him, starting six games and playing for a total of 531 minutes. Bellingham has started four, playing 374 minutes in total.Tuchel will not duck big decisions. He will not indulge in star systems or simply pack his team with the biggest names.So who will start?For all Rogers' impressive work, Bellingham has proved he can deliver game-changing moments at the highest level, his status also confirmed when Albania's Kristjan Asllani asked him to swap shirts at half-time rather than risk leaving it until the end.Phil Foden will be in Tuchel's thinking, with the German saying he does not see the Manchester City forward as a winger, and instead \"as a mix between a nine and a 10\".Chelsea's Cole Palmer also has the ability and class to force his way into the squad if he can recover from his groin injury.In reality, however, it looks like a choice between Bellingham and Rogers.Bellingham's greater experience of the rarefied air of major competitions will surely just give him the edge when Tuchel names his team for England's first World Cup game.Kane indispensable – but who are the alternatives?Harry Kane maintained his magnificent England record with the double in Albania that ensured they finished World Cup qualifying with a win.Kane may be 32 but looks at his peak, a master marksman as well as the complete player, willing to drop deep to do dirty work but still always arriving at the sharp end with perfect timing when goals are required.Former England defender Conor Coady told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I don't want to think of an England without Harry Kane. What he brings to this team is unbelievable.\"The way he keeps on producing these numbers is unbelievable and it is credit to him. He is the first on and last off the training pitch. He is our biggest hope going into next year.\"Kane is indispensable, England's record scorer with 78 goals in 112 internationals.If he is not playing the drop off is deep. Kane's potential deputies are all perfectly capable, but they are not Harry Kane.An injury to his captain will be Tuchel's biggest fear, particularly as ready-made replacements are hardly forming an orderly queue.Image source, EPAImage caption, Harry Kane has now scored 78 goals in 112 games for EnglandBrighton's 34-year-old veteran Danny Welbeck has been touted. It is testimony to the enduring skill of the striker, who last played for England seven years ago, but also suggests the cupboard is worryingly bare.Tuchel said Welbeck was \"very close\" to a call-up for England's latest camp, but added: \"I felt even without knowing him I know what he can give us. Do I really need to see this in November?\"Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins has been used, although Ivan Toney has disappeared from view after bizarrely being summoned from Saudi Arabia to play two minutes in the friendly against Senegal last June.Marcus Rashford can play as a striker, while Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon has played there for his club, but is not a natural fit.Foden has been mentioned as part of a tactical tweak if England are in need of a main striker, but the bottom line is they still have no-one who comes close to Kane's class.As Coady stated, England without Harry Kane at the World Cup is unthinkable.Tuchel ponders defensive questionsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, John Stones brings class, experience and versatility to England's defence - so will he start at the World Cup?John Stones showed his class and versatility in a hybrid role in Tirana, ostensibly in his usual central defensive position but stepping into midfield when England were in possession. It is a ploy he can carry out with comfort, potentially giving Tuchel's strategy an extra dimension.Former England defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This game against Albania is cementing why John Stones is so vital to this England squad. He is conducting the play from a centre-back position and a centre midfield position. Really impressive.\"It is likely to be a more orthodox back four at the World Cup, so it looks down to two from Stones, Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa and Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi in central defence.Stones may have the edge with his vast experience, while Konsa and Guehi, who both missed the win in Albania through injury, have grown as internationals.Coady said: \"I think it's really close. Konsa has been outstanding. For me, it's Stones and Guehi's to lose. To keep Stones fit for the World Cup is absolutely huge.\"Bayer Leverkusen's Jarell Quansah made his long-awaited senior debut against Albania and impressed as he started centrally before moving out wide.Tuchel must also decide on his left-back with an exciting trio of youngsters leading the race.Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tottenham's Djed Spence and Manchester City's Nico O'Reilly have all been handed senior debuts by Tuchel, but it is O'Reilly who started and impressed in the final two qualifiers.Newcastle United's Tino Livramento, currently out injured, may be in the lead for that place, with Lewis-Skelly left out by Tuchel because of lack of game time this season. O'Reilly may have edged ahead of Spence after this camp.It is still a position up for grabs.Will Rashford start on the left?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Marcus Rashford assisted Harry Kane seven minutes after coming on against AlbaniaBukayo Saka has nailed down the right wing slot, so who will play on the opposite side?Marcus Rashford left Tuchel with something to remember him by from England's World Cup qualifier with a superb cross for Kane's second goal in Tirana.Rashford has made his case, but Gordon has also impressed, while Tuchel is a big fan of Arsenal's Noni Madueke, currently out injured.Jack Grealish has done well on loan at Everton, but he simply has too much competition to fight his way past and has not featured for the Three Lions since October 2024.Eberechi Eze started against Albania and can play on the left or as a number 10, though he is not at the forefront of the conversations to compete with Bellingham and Rogers in that role.If Rashford wanted to give Tuchel food for thought, his superb cross for Kane to complete his double gave the head coach plenty to digest.",

    "body": "Australian Paralympic gold medallist Paige Greco has died at the age of 28.The para-cyclist, who clinched her country's first gold medal at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, died on Sunday at her home in Adelaide after a \"sudden medical episode\", said AusCycling, the sport's national governing body.Greco's family is \"devastated by her loss, [but] incredibly proud of the person she was and the way she represented Australia\", her mother Natalie said in a statement published by AusCycling.\"Paige meant everything to us. Her kindness, her determination and her warmth touched our family every single day,\" Mrs Greco said.Greco, who had cerebral palsy, started out as a track-and-field athlete before turning to cycling in 2018.Throughout her career, she won several World Championship titles and World Cup medals. At the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games she broke the record for the women's C1–3 3,000m individual pursuit, a track event where cyclists race head-to-head on opposite sides of the track.She went on to win bronze medals in the women's C1-3 road race and time trial at the Games.Greco sat out of selection rounds for last year's Games held in Paris because of health issues, but returned to elite competition this year, The Guardian reported.In August, she won another bronze medal at the para-cycling World Championships in Belgium, this time for the C3 road race event.Tributes poured in from various corners of Australia's sporting community following news of Greco's death.AusCycling's chief executive officer Marne Fechner called her an \"extraordinary athlete who achieved outstanding accomplishments at the highest levels of [the] sport\". \"Much more than that, she touched the lives of everyone around her with her positive spirit and courageous outlook,\" Fechner said.Paralympics Australia's chief executive officer Cameron Murray said \"Paige's achievements on the international stage were exceptional, but it was her kindness, her quiet determination and the way she uplifted people around her that will stay with us all\".\"She had a rare ability to make people feel included and supported, and her influence will no doubt leave a lasting impression on so many,\" he said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIone Wells,South America correspondent and Laura BlaseyCartel de los Soles, a group the US alleges is led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, will be designated a terrorist organisation, the US State Department has said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement on Sunday announcing that the US intends to consider the group a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) from 24 November. It means that Maduro will effectively be designated a terrorist as well, because the US alleges he heads the Cartel de los Soles, an accusation Maduro strongly denies.  It is the Trump administration's latest effort to reduce drug trafficking and put pressure on Maduro, as the US considers whether to take military action inside the country. An FTO designation allows the US government to crackdown more aggressively on the group and its alleged associates, by making it illegal to knowingly offer them support.The US Treasury Department has previously placed sanctions on Cartel de los Soles, but the new FTO designation is an escalated approach which unlocks stronger powers. The Cartel de los Soles is a term used by the US to describe an alleged criminal group involved in activities such as drug-trafficking and illegal mining. Washington claims it is led by the Venezuelan president and includes members of his inner circle, including from the military. The US hasn't published evidence publicly of Maduro's direct involvement in drug trafficking. But its characterisation of Maduro as a drug-trafficker is seen as a way for the US to possibly justify targeting him or those close to him personally as part of its military campaign against alleged drug-trafficking.Speculation is mounting about whether the US may strike land targets inside Venezuela as part of efforts to put pressure on Maduro.In October, Maduro accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the USS Gerald Ford to be sent to the Caribbean.US President Donald Trump has said he has \"sort of\" made up his mind about what to do but has not announced his decision yet.He told reporters on Sunday night that he asked Rubio to discuss the situation with Congress. He added that \"we may be having some discussions\" with Maduro and that \"Venezuela wants to talk\", but did not provide further details on when talks might happen.The Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach toward Maduro, who returned to office in January following allegations of vote-rigging. \"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio said in his statement. In August, the US government increased a reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m (£37.2m), alleging he was a leading \"narco-trafficker\".The US has also criticised Venezuela as inadequately addressing cartel activity, which Trump says is responsible for an influx of fentanyl into the US. There is not evidence to suggest fentanyl comes from Venezuela, as it is primarily produced in Mexico with chemicals largely sourced from Asia. The Venezuelan government acknowledges some cocaine trafficking takes place in the country, but there are much bigger trafficking hubs in the region. Cocaine is predominantly produced in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.Since September, the US has carried out a series of airstrikes on boats off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. The US has sent the largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades and has carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels, killing at least 83 people. The administration has previously designated cartels in other countries as terrorist groups.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterJapanese stocks related to tourism and retail fell on Monday after China warned its citizens not to travel to the country as Tokyo and Beijing remain locked in a row over Taiwan.Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its military activities in the region, suggested this month Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Shares in Japanese department stores were hit hard, with the parent company of the Mitsukoshi and Isetan chains plunging more than 10%. Other well-known brands like cosmetics company Shiseido also fell sharply.China has consistently ranked among the top sources of tourists visiting Japan.In morning trade in Tokyo, shares in department store chain Takashimaya, and  the owner of global fashion chain Uniqlo fell more than 5%.Carriers Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings were also down.Shares in Oriental Land, the theme park company that runs the Tokyo Disney resort, was around 5% lower. The share price falls came after the dispute between Beijing and Tokyo has deepened in recent days.On Sunday, the Chinese government urged its citizens to reconsider studying in Japan, citing risks to their safety and a rise in crimes targeting Chinese people.China's Education Ministry also told students already based in Japan to closely monitor the security situation.Last year, more than 100,000 Chinese students were enrolled in educational institutions in Japan, according to a Japanese government survey.Also over the weekend, Chinese airlines - including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, and Air China - offered refunds for flights to Japan.Takaichi said in the Japanese parliament on 7 November: \"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation.\"A \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies presents an existential threat to Tokyo.In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be called upon to respond to the threat.Taiwan lies just over 100km (62 miles) south of the closest Japanese island.A Kyodo news agency poll published on Sunday suggested that the Japanese public is split on whether the country should exercise its right to self-defence if Beijing attacks Taiwan.Chinese and Japanese official are expected to hold talks on Tuesday.Chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara said that Beijing's moves are not in line with the \"broader direction confirmed between our leaders\" in promoting a mutually beneficial and stable relationship.Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this.But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it.",

    "body": "7 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentJohnReimberg/XEcuador's interior minister shared this picture following news of Chavarria's captureThe leader of one of Ecuador's biggest drug-trafficking gangs has been captured in an operation involving Spanish police, Ecuador's president Daniel Noboa has said. Wilmer \"Pipo\" Chavarria, the head of Los Lobos, was detained in the city of Malaga, according to Spain's National Police. President Noboa said Chavarria had faked his own death, changed his identity and hidden in Europe while continuing to control criminal operations in Ecuador, including illegal mining and ordering murders.His family had claimed in 2021 that he had died from a heart attack due to Covid.Both Ecuador and the US have designated Los Lobos (The Wolves) as a terrorist organisation.In a post on X, Ecuador's interior minister John Reimberg, who said he was in Spain with police, said the capture of Chavarria was a \"historic day\" for his country.Los Lobos is estimated to have 8,000 members and is one of the most powerful criminal organisations in Ecuador.In June 2024, the US Treasury sanctioned the gang and described it as a group with \"thousands of members\" that had significantly contributed to the increase in violence in Ecuador.Violence and murders have soared in Ecuador in recent years as it has become a major cocaine trafficking hub and rival gangs compete for control. It does not produce the drug, but sits next to major drug-producing countries such as Peru and Colombia.President Noboa has defined his presidency through a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs.The high-profile arrest coincides with a referendum in Ecuador on whether to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in the country again. The US held one on Ecuador's Pacific coast until 2009, when the left-wing president at the time Rafael Correa did not renew it and banned them constitutionally.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has recently toured military facilities in Ecuador.President Noboa told the BBC earlier this year that he wanted US and European armies to join his \"war\" against what he called \"narco-terrorists.\"The US is expanding military operations in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. It has deployed troops and a naval strike force centred around the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to the region.Additionally, it has carried out at least 20 strikes on alleged narco-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean, killing at least 80 people.It has not yet provided evidence about those on board and some lawyers have argued the strikes could breach international law.Many Los Lobos members are in jail and the gang is thought to have instigated some of Ecuador's bloodiest prison riots. The gang is thought to have links to the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel in Mexico.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has called on House Republicans to vote to release the Epstein files, in a reversal from his previous position. \"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday night. The shift from days of Trump fighting the proposal comes as the House is expected to hold a vote this week on legislation that would force the Justice Department to release the files to the public. Supporters of the proposal appear to have enough votes to pass the House, though it is unclear whether it would pass the Senate. Democrats and some Republicans have been pushing a measure that would force the US justice department to make public more documents from the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein case. The major shift in Trump's position comes as potentially dozens of Republicans were willing to break ranks in the vote.Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in an interview with ABC News on Sunday that as many as 100 Republicans could vote in favour.Known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.Trump posted the statement shortly after landing at Joint Base Andrews following a weekend in Florida. \"The Department of Justice has already turned over tens of thousands of pages to the Public on \"Epstein,\" are looking at various Democrat operatives (Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, Larry Summers, etc.) and their relationship to Epstein, and the House Oversight Committee can have whatever they are legally entitled to, I DON'T CARE!,\" Trump wrote, adding that he wanted Republicans to get \"BACK ON POINT\". Trump's reference to Clinton comes after the US justice department confirmed it will investigate paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein's alleged links to major banks and several prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton.Trump said he would ask Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI to look into Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with Clinton and others.Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regrets \"any association\" they had with Epstein, and added that the firm \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".Last week, thousands of Epstein's emails were released by the US Congress - with the files including mentions of the US president. Democrats have accused Trump of trying to deflect from questions about his relationship with Epstein.A review by the Wall Street Journal found that Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.",

Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "10 hours agoEmma Rossiter,BBC News and Eleanor Doyle,NewsbeatSky Sports has scrapped its new female-focused TikTok channel, Halo, after it faced a backlash online with its posts described as \"patronising\" and \"sexist\".In a statement posted on social media on Saturday night, the broadcaster said it \"didn't get it right\" and that it would be \"stopping all activity\" on the account.The channel, which was only announced on Thursday, was described by the broadcaster as an \"inclusive, dedicated platform for women to enjoy and explore content from all sports, while amplifying female voices and perspectives.\"However, many on social media criticised the \"little sister\" account, which talked about \"hot girl walks\" and matcha in its content.At its inception, Sky said Halo's aim was \"to build a welcoming community for female fans, whether casual or committed, through fun, trend-led, and relatable content\". One post saw a clip of Manchester City players Rayan Cherki and Erling Haaland combining for the latter to score against Bournemouth, given the caption \"How the matcha + hot girl walk combo hits\".Viewers argued the posts were \"infantilising\" and undermined the work done over the past few years to put women's sport in the spotlight. Among those criticising the channel was Emily Trees, 23, who told BBC Newsbeat that she thought Halo calling themselves the \"little sister\" of Sky Sports was a \"really damaging\" thing to say. \"We've spent the last 50 years trying to come away from the stereotypes around women's sport, and trying to make women's sport seen as an entity in itself rather than just as an extension of what men can do. We deserve our own space, something that's ours. We don't need to be the 'little sister' to anyone,\" she said.GirlsontheBall, a prominent platform covering women's football, voiced its frustrations saying on X they could not \"imagine this is what women sports fans want\".\"Have many thoughts which I will get to when not under a mountain of writing but all I can ask is why? The branding (one day can we please be past the pink/peach stage?!), the premise, the copy…\"Sports fan Millie Jones, 27, told BBC Newsbeat that she did not think women needed a separate space for content, rather, she says, they need to be equally represented in the content Sky Sports already put out.\"As a sports fan, I've consumed generic Sky Sports media for the entirety of the time that I've been into sport. I don't need a pink, glittery sidepiece to the normal content,\" she said.One user said that Sky Sports Halo was one of the worst concepts he had ever seen.\"So condescending. Creating a dumbed down sports channel for women is unbelievably sexist. Incredible that it was approved and that it's still live,\" they said.Some social media users have also created spoof posts of the channel's content which have been widely shared.While the channel was aimed at women many of the sports stars featured in its posts were men.Andy Gill, head of social media and audience development at Sky Sports, wrote on LinkedIn that he \"couldn't be prouder and more excited about [Halo's] launch\", but by Saturday night the broadcaster was forced to rethink.All but two posts have been deleted from the Halo account, one of which is a brief statement from Sky which reads: \"Our intention for Halo was to create a space alongside our existing channel for new, young, female fans.\"We've listened. We didn't get it right. As a result we're stopping all activity on this account. We're learning and remain as committed as ever to creating spaces where fans feel included and inspired.\"The BBC contacted Sky for comment but it had nothing further to add.Correction 16 November: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to one post as having been published by Halo but it was a mock-up not produced by the channel.",

    "body": "1 hour agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent Ecuadoreans have voted against allowing the return of foreign military bases in the country, frustrating US hopes of expanding its presence in the Eastern Pacific region.The referendum result is a blow to Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa, who had campaigned to change the constitution in order to reverse a ban that the country's legislature passed in 2008.He said it would help fight organised crime and reduce the soaring violence the country has seen in recent years, during which it has become one of the world's biggest drug-trafficking hotspots.The US had hoped the referendum would pave the way for it to open a military base, 16 years after it was made to close a site on the Pacific coast.While Ecuador does not produce cocaine, its huge ports and proximity to Colombia and Peru - where large quantities of the drug are made - make it a desirable and lucrative location for drug-trafficking gangs.According to Noboa, about 70% of the world's cocaine passes through Ecuador.His presidency has been defined by a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs, including by putting armed soldiers on the streets. Supporters say his approach has helped to fight crime, but critics say his government has resorted to authoritarian tactics. The US's former military base on Ecuador's Pacific coast was closed after left-wing president Rafael Correa decided not to renew its lease and pushed for a constitutional ban which was passed by lawmakers.US Homeland Secretary Secretary Kristi Noem recently toured military facilities in Ecuador with Noboa.In a BBC interview earlier this year, Noboa said he wanted foreign \"armies\" to join what he has described as a \"war\" against narco-trafficking groups. He has recently held talks over increased regional security and migration co-operation with US officials.The referendum also saw voters reject ending public funding for political parties, shrinking the size of Congress, and establishing a constitutional assembly to re-write the Ecuador's constitution.Noboa had argued a fresh constitution could allow for tougher punishments for criminals and stronger measures to secure the borders, but critics argued it would not solve wider social problems like insecurity and poor access to education or healthcare in some areas.Critics also feared the plans to reduce funding for political parties and the size of Congress could lead to a reduction in checks and balances on the government and representation in poorer areas, though the government hoped it would save public funds.Noboa reacted by saying he would \"respect\" the outcome of the vote.On the day of the referendum, the leader of one of Ecuador's biggest drug-trafficking gangs, Los Lobos, was captured in an operation involving Spanish police.According to Noboa, Wilmer \"Pipo\" Chavarria had faked his own death and had been hiding in Europe while controlling criminal operations like drug-trafficking, ordering murders and illegal mining in Ecuador.Both Ecuador and the US have designated Los Lobos as a terrorist organisation under domestic law.This referendum played came as the US sent its largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades, including the world's largest warship and bomber planes.It has carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean, killing at least 83 people. It has not provided evidence about who is on board and some lawyers have said the strikes could breach international law.Speculation is mounting over whether the US will strike land targets in Venezuela.The US alleges that its President Nicolás Maduro is the head of a narco-trafficking organisation, an accusation he strongly denies. Many observers believe the US military build-up in the region is also an attempt to put pressure on Maduro to force him from power.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJake Lapham and Sarah Keith-Lucas,Lead Weather Presenter Eddie T/BBC Weather WatchersCold Arctic air is set to sweep across the UK next week as communities in Wales recover from severe flooding that inundated properties and disrupted transport at the weekend.Temperatures are now set to drop, with yellow cold health alerts in place from Monday to Friday in northern and central parts of England. Snow is possible on higher ground in Scotland and northern England by Tuesday.The cold snap comes as Storm Claudia moved away on Sunday after delivering more than a month's worth of rain in parts of England and Wales. People have rallied together to help residents and business owners recover from unprecedented flooding in Monmouth, Wales.A major incident which had been declared in the area was rescinded on Sunday afternoon. Four severe flood warnings - which warned of a \"danger to life\" - also ended.The River Monnow reached record levels after the storm, exceeding those recorded during Storm Dennis in 2020 and Storm Bert in 2024. While that low pressure system has been replaced by mostly calm and dry weather, Monday could bring a few wintry showers on exposed eastern coasts. Highs of 5–10°C are expected across much of the UK in the coming days.By Tuesday, low pressure brings rain and sleet, with snow possible in the northern half of the UK, particularly in the mountains.England's yellow cold health alerts, issued by the UK Health Security Agency, warn of the potential for \"significant impacts\" across health and social care services. They are in place from 08:00 on Monday to 08:00 on Friday.Cold Arctic air is sweeping across the UK this week, bringing lower temperatures and the risk of snow in some areasMidweek stays cold with brisk northerly winds, and sleet and snow showers are likely, mainly along northern and eastern coasts, as well as Northern Ireland, west Wales, and possibly the moors of south-west England.The significant drop in temperature is due to a change in wind direction.Since the start of this month, there has generally been a southerly wind bringing a very mild, but cloudy, tropical maritime airmass all the way from the Canary Islands.This pattern will change. After being on the warmer side of the jet stream, the UK will be on the colder side of it.Monmouth town centre in Wales flooded after Storm ClaudiaMajor flooding in Monmouth saw people rescued from their homes, with some evacuated to a library and a leisure centre. Hundreds of homes were left without power. As the waters receded, many buildings were left covered in a thick layer of sludge.\"It's dreadful,\" county councillor Martin Newell told the BBC. He said he had spoken to a resident who had \"lost everything, all of his possessions\", and that businesses would not recover before Christmas.Monmouthshire MP Catherine Fookes said it was a \"really worrying time\" and that flood defences would need to be reviewed while the clear-up was under way. She praised the \"incredibly resilient and kind\" community, which has been donating clothes and hot meals for evacuees at a church.Flooding has been less severe in England, but an ongoing risk remains, with 27 flood warnings still in place.The weather also triggered major disruption on rail networks over the weekend. Most lines have since returned to normal, but disruption is expected to continue into Monday on some Great Western Railway and Transport for Wales services.National Rail has warned passengers to check before they travel and the AA told drivers to avoid travelling in \"hazardous weather\".Additional reporting by Nicholas Bourne",

    "body": "51 minutes agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterPA MediaThe government has said it wants to reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK on small boatsPlans to fast-track the deportation of illegal migrants as part of sweeping reforms of the UK's asylum policy are to be announced by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.In a statement to MPs later she will outline plans to end multiple appeals against removal and for an overhaul of legislation on human rights law. For those granted asylum they will only be given it on a temporary basis and will be returned home if their country is at any time deemed safe. They will have to wait 20 years to apply to settle permanently.Mahmood will also say the UK will stop granting visas to people from three African countries if their governments do not improve co-operation on removals of illegal migrants.Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday: \"This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.\"Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said he would go further and deport failed asylum seekers \"within a week\".The plans have prompted criticism from some Labour MPs, including Rachael Maskell, who said the government was going in \"completely the wrong direction\" on immigration.The government wants to reduce the number of people arriving to the UK on small boats and the reforms aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.Under the plans people will be restricted to arguing their grounds for appeal within a single appeal and if a case fails, they will be deported.The government will follow the Danish model of creating an independent body to fast-track the deportation of foreign criminals and cases with little prospect of success through the appeals system.As part of the reforms, Mahmood wants to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied in migration court cases. Only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.The UK will join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.The government believes this has been used to support unreasonable claims, including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their  healthcare needs cannot be met. Similarly, the Home Office said the Modern Slavery Act will be tightened up to prevent last-minute claims to block removal.Illegal migration is 'dividing our country' says MahmoodPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the reforms would stop \"endless appeals\" to increase the removals of \"those with no right to be here\".Mahmood said the reforms recognised the \"pace and scale\" of immigration had destabilised and divided communities and would allow the government to ramp up the removal of those with no right to be in Britain.She said \"To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.\"Earlier the home secretary told the BBC she would create new safe and legal routes for refugees through work and study routes.Under the new measures there will be tighter restrictions placed on successful asylum seekers, who will have their case reviewed every two and a half years and if their home country is considered safe they will be returned.A refugee will have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.They will not be able to bring family members to join them unless they are immediate relatives, including parents and children, while housing and weekly allowances will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.'Years of limbo'Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year.There has also been criticism of the proposed reforms from within Labour, with Maskell saying lots of her fellow MPs were \"really concerned\".She said it was important to have a robust human rights framework and described \"reordering our relationship with the ECHR\" as a \"step too far\".Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the home secretary \"sounds like a Reform supporter\". \"It's a shame that the Human Rights Act, ECHR and her own backbenchers mean that this will never happen,\" he added.Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson said the government should \"focus on processing claims quickly, getting them right first time, and swiftly deporting people with no right to be here\".Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said rather than deter migrants, the 20-year time frame would \"leave people in limbo and in tense anxiety for many, many years\".As first reported in the Times, the threat of the visa ban for Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.A Home Office source said the countries were being targeted \"for their unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive returns processes\".Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "4 hours agoCherylann Mollan,BBC News and Gopal Kateshiya and Roxy Gagdekar Chhara,BBC GujaratiGetty ImagesPolice say that they uncovered a massive cybercrime racket Hacked CCTV videos from a maternity hospital in India have been sold on Telegram, police say, raising serious questions about privacy and security in a country where such cameras have become commonplace.Earlier this year, police in Gujarat state were alerted by the media to videos on YouTube - some showed pregnant women undergoing medical exams and receiving injections in their buttocks - in a maternity hospital in a city. The videos had a link directing viewers to Telegram channels to buy longer videos. The director of the hospital told the BBC that the cameras had been installed for the safety of doctors. The BBC is not naming the city or hospital to protect the identity of the women in the videos. None of them have filed a police complaint.Police say their investigation uncovered a massive cybercrime racket where sensitive footage from at least 50,000 CCTVs from across the country was stolen by hackers and sold on the internet.CCTVs have become ubiquitous in India, especially in urban areas. They are installed in malls, offices, hospitals, schools, private apartment complexes and even inside people's homes.Experts warn that while CCTV boosts security, poorly installed or managed systems can threaten privacy. In India, cameras are often handled by staff without cybersecurity training, and some domestically manufactured models are reportedly easily exploitable.In 2018, a tech worker in Bengaluru city said that his webcam was hacked, and that the hacker demanded payment in exchange for not sharing his private videos. In 2023, a YouTuber reportedly found out that his home CCTV had been hacked after private videos went viral.Last year, the federal government asked states to not procure CCTVs from suppliers with a history of security and data breaches and also introduced new rules to improve cyber security of CCTV cameras. But hacking incidents like these are still reported.Getty ImagesCCTV cameras are ubiquitous in IndiaIn Gujarat, police say they ended up discovering a \"network of individuals spread across the country\".\"[They] were hacking into the video surveillance systems - or CCTV systems - of hospitals, schools, colleges, corporate offices and even the bedrooms of private individuals in multiple states,\" Lavina Sinha, who heads the Ahmedabad cyber crime department investigating the case, told reporters.Hardik Makadiya, Gujarat's top cybercrime official, says videos were sold for 800–2,000 rupees  ($9-22; £7-17, with Telegram channels offering live CCTV feeds via subscription.Police have registered a case under various sections of the law, including violating a female patient's privacy, publishing obscene material, voyeurism and cyber terrorism - which is a non-bailable offence. They say that they reached out to Telegram and YouTube, and the videos have been taken down.Since February, police have arrested eight people in the case - four from Maharashtra and others from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, and Uttarakhand. They remain in judicial custody as the case proceeds in court.CCTV: Why do so many Indians love surveillance?Yash Koshti, lawyer for three of the accused, denied the allegations, saying they were not hackers or cyber criminals and that someone else carried out the breach.Cybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia warns that weakly protected CCTV and home networks are easy targets and must be properly secured.\"Wireless CCTV systems help you access the footage remotely, like on your smartphone or laptop. But once a system is connected to the web, it's easy for hackers to decode its IP address and default password. And once they get into the system, they can see or record live footage, download it or even shut down the system,\" Mr Bhatia says.He says that one way to secure surveillance systems is to change IP addresses and the default password.Mr Bhatia advises using a robust password that mixes letters, numbers, and symbols and cannot be found in a dictionary, and recommends periodic audits by a cybersecurity professional.He adds that CCTV manufacturers also bear responsibility, and their packaging should clearly warn users to replace default passwords with strong ones - similar to cigarette packet health warnings.Getty ImagesA CCTV surveillance sign in Tamil Nadu; such signs are common across IndiaMr Makadiya told the BBC that many of the hacked CCTVs used default passwords - like Admin123 - or weak ones.\"The hackers used brute force (the use of certain programmes to generate thousands of letter-number password combinations) to break into these systems and access videos,\" he said.Audrey Dmello of Majlis, a legal centre for women's and children's rights, highlights the ubiquity of CCTVs in India, often installed without consent. She urges organisations, especially in sensitive spaces, to ensure their systems are properly secured.\"Organisations and institutions that set up surveillance systems, especially in sensitive spaces, must see to it that their systems are adequately secured. It's an absolute must,\" she says.The director of one of the affected hospitals told the BBC the CCTVs in exam and injection rooms were meant to protect doctors from false allegations. He added that the cameras have since been removed from sensitive areas.Police in Gujarat told the BBC that neither the hospital nor any patient had come forward to file a formal complaint. The complaint was finally lodged by a police officer.\"Female patients fear that their identity will be revealed. Therefore, they are not willing to lodge a complaint,\" said an officer.Ms Dmello says that the shame women face around such incidents only adds to its horrific nature.\"When there is a sexual angle involved, the victim is re-victimised because of the patriarchal nature of Indian society. If we want women to assert their rights and we want criminals to be brought to justice, we, as a society, should first stop shaming and blaming women for the crime,\" she says.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

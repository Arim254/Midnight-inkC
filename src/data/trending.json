This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "5 days agoEmily HoltBBC NewsGetty ImagesNow the clocks have gone back and the evenings are darker, many of us are trudging to work and back in the dark and sometimes our mood is lower as well.We can feel more tired than normal, lack energy or find it difficult to concentrate. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), or \"winter depression\" can affect anyone. For those struggling to stick to their normal daily activites, the NHS advises contacting their local GP. For those with milder symptoms, here are three ways to help you manage the darker days and even embrace them.1. Focus on what you can do Getty ImagesPsychologist Kari Leibowitz says growing up in the US in a summer-centric town meant she used to view winter as limiting and uncomfortable, but travelling to Norway where some places get almost no daylight in the depths of winter changed her mindset.She found that instead of people succumbing to a darker mood, they embraced their circumstances, finding different hobbies from snow sports to knitting and cooking. \"They're looking at winter as a time of year that's full of opportunities,\" she says. Kari said it taught her that changing your approach to focus on what you can do during this time, rather than what you can't, was surprisingly effective.This could include winter walks, movie nights, cooking a new meal or ice skating.\"So often we only focus on the things that are harder to do in the winter when really there's a whole world of seasonal activities that feel better when it's cold out.\" 2. Accept you need more restGetty ImagesWith our work and social calendars ticking along as normal, we may wonder why we feel so tired but Kari says we need to accept our bodies need more rest in winter.\"It's actually good not to be as productive or active as you would be during the summer months because our bodies are biologically hardwired for rest during winter,\" she says. Just like animals and plants, she says we should be slowing down and changing our behaviour.Dr Em May Armstrong, a plant researcher, says the key is finding the balance between resting more and becoming too lethargic. She suggests so called \"active dormancy\" - mixing a slower restful lifestyle with activities that still keep us mentally engaged. This could include activities such as knitting, repairing clothes or practices that help get you ready for the year ahead. \"And while that's not as active as, say, travelling or camping, it's just as active in a more restorative way.\"3. Make plansGetty ImagesWhile resting more is natural, it is still important to make time for the things that make us happy and to mix with other people, according to GP Gavin Francis.\"We're very social animals, even the most solitary human being doesn't live completely alone. We all depend on others.\"He suggests planning activities in advance, focusing on spending time with those who make you feel good, and activities which can boost your mood.Doing this means you're committed, and a low mood nearer the time won't be able to stop you.\"You can then start planning in your diary to do more things with these people over winter,\" he says. Simple practical things to improve your mood, such as making sure you get a good night's sleep, avoiding too much alcohol or late night parties and maintaining a healthy diet are also important, he says.\"These things are not rocket science, but they're really fundamental to having a good, healthy circadian rhythm and a good healthy physiology through the winter.\"  Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "At least four people have died after two boats carrying nearly 100 migrants capsized off the coast of Libya on Saturday, rescue workers have said.Those confirmed to have died by the Libyan Red Crescent so far were all passengers in a boat carrying 26 Bangladeshi nationals.The humanitarian group did not say whether there were further fatalities among passengers in a second boat which sank while carrying around 70 mostly Sudanese people.The boats were using the central Mediterranean route between North Africa and Italy, which is the \"deadliest known migration route in the world\" according to the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM).The boats had set off from Al Khums, a port city in northwestern Libya, the organisation said.The Libyan Red Crescent shared images of its crew administering aid to survivors, as well as black body bags lying on the ground.Hundreds of people die each year trying to make the crossing to southern Europe each year in overcrowded and unsafe boats. More than 1,500 people have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean in 2025 so far, according to data from the IOM. Around a third of those cases happened off Libya's coast.The North African nation was the departure point for the majority of the almost 59,000 people who arrived in Europe this year via the central Mediterranean route, according to Frontex, the European Union's border security agency. Earlier this week, dozens of migrants who boarded a small boat in Libya were missing and presumed dead after it capsized in the Mediterranean. Seven survivors - from Sudan, Somalia, Cameroon and Nigeria - were rescued after being lost at sea for nearly a week.",

    "body": "South Korean actor and K-pop singer Nana managed to fight off a home intruder alongside her mother, local media reported. A man in his 30s reportedly broke into the star's property in Guri with a weapon and threatened the two women.But the 34-year-old singer's agency told South Korean media that Nana - whose real name is Im Jin-ah - and her mother managed to subdue the intruder until police arrived.The actor's mother lost consciousness during the disturbance, and both she and Nana required medical attention, the Yonhap news agency reported.A local detective told AFP news agency that the intruder was attempting to steal valuables and had been detained on charges of aggravated robbery.The suspect reportedly threatened both women and demanded money after breaking into the house.Nana and her mother called the police after restraining the man, who was also taken to hospital for treatment, local media said.Nana rose to fame in 2009 as part of the girl group After School, a popular K-pop outfit. The group is no longer active but she has since gained popularity over the past decade as an actor. She has starred in several TV series, including Kill It and Justice, both crime dramas which first aired in 2019.Nana released her first solo album in September.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood tells the Sunday Times she will end the UK's \"golden ticket\" asylum rules by increasing the period of time after which a refugee can claim settled status from five to 10 years. A shorter waiting period for people who arrive legally will also be confirmed by the government when it sets out its asylum plans later this week, the paper says. Illegal migration, Mahmoods adds, is \"tearing us apart\". Former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has spoken to the Daily Mirror, calling this week's leadership challenge talk in the Labour Party \"arrogant tittle tattle\". The paper says it is her first interview since resigning after admitting not paying the right tax on her home.But elsewhere, the Sunday Telegraph claims Rayner is preparing for a leadership election herself by shoring up support among Labour MPs. A source close to the Greater Manchester MP told the paper its report was \"total rubbish\". The Observer's front page asks if there is \"political interference\" at the BBC, after a turbulent week which saw its its director-general and head of news resign. The newspaper has previously published an editorial describing the events leading up to their departure as a \"political attack\".The Daily Mail's front page focuses on upcoming BBC lectures given by Rutger Bregman, who the paper says has been critical of Donald Trump in the past. The author, who is best known for his books Utopia For Realists and Humankind: A Hopeful History, is due to give four BBC lectures, one of which will be titled A Time Of Monsters.The Daily Express leads on calls from the Conservatives, Reform and some industry figures for the government to reduce taxes on high street businesses, particularly pubs. Claims of an impending \"bloodbath\" in the main headline on Sunday's front page come from shadow chancellor Mel Stride.The Sunday People leads on an update about Edward Putman, who made national headlines when he claimed a lottery win using a fake ticket. Edward Putman, who was jailed in 2019 for the con, has previously also been convicted of rape and benefit fraud.Model Kelly Brook speaks to the Daily Star as she enters the jungle for the latest series of I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here. The paper says she is \"defying cruel taunts about her figure\", and quotes her as saying: \"I embrace my curves, I embrace my body.\"Finally, the Sun pictures British actor Sacha Baron Cohen outside a nightclub with a female companion on its front page. The Ali G and Borat actor was spotted in Hollywood. Several of Sunday's newspapers feature stories about reported divisions at the top of government which have emerged this week.  According to the Sunday Times, Health Secretary Wes Streeting had what sources have described as a \"very shouty\" phone call with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney on Tuesday afternoon.Earlier this week, No 10 denied that Starmer's closest aide was behind briefings to newspaper journalists that Streeting was preparing an imminent leadership challenge.The Sunday Telegraph says former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner is laying the ground for a leadership challenge, claiming she has been offering prospective Cabinet roles to MPs in exchange for support. Her office has rubbished the report.In the Sunday Mirror, Rayner uses her first interview since leaving her position to condemn \"tittle-tattle in Westminster\", describing recent leadership challenge speculation as \"arrogant\". The Sun on Sunday claims Starmer vetoed the returns of former cabinet ministers David Miliband and Ed Balls to Parliament. Downing Street has denied the report.Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has told the Sunday Express that he believes the forthcoming Budget will be the last given by Rachel Reeves as chancellor.The Daily Star Sunday's editorial focuses on the government's new proposals to tighten the asylum system, with Shabana Mahmood's plans inspired by policies implemented in Denmark. \"If the Danish scheme works it may well end up saving this government's bacon\", the editorial says.There is more about those plans in the Sunday Times too, which says the home secretary is planning to extend the period after which an asylum seeker can claim settled status by 15 years in some case.The Mail on Sunday reports that the White House is angry that Dutch author Rutger Bregman - who it describes as a fierce critic of Donald Trump - has been asked to deliver the annual Reith lectures. The paper says he used the events to draw parallels between Trump's America and the rise of fascism in the 1930s.  The BBC said the views expressed were always those of the speaker, not the corporation.And the Observer reports that local councils have spent more than £70,000 removing unauthorised flags, based on hundreds of freedom of information requests.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Disagreements between Donald Trump and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have ballooned into a public feud, signalling a breakdown in relations between the US president and one of his fiercest defenders.On Friday, Trump called Greene \"wacky\" in social media posts and said she should be unseated in next year's elections. On Saturday, he called her a \"traitor\". Greene has in recent days questioned whether Trump was still putting \"America First\" and criticised his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.The feud comes as the House is set to consider whether to release the files to the public, with speaker Mike Johnson saying he would put the bill to a vote this coming week.Known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.US outlet Politico reported a vote could come as soon as Tuesday. \"All I see \"Wacky\" Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" Trump posted on Friday night, claiming that she turned on him after he suggested that she shouldn't run for governor or senator in her home state of Georgia. \"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore,\" Trump said, adding: \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"He pledged to back any Republican opponent that takes her on in next year's midterm elections, when she is up for reelection, before intensifying his attacks in social media posts on Saturday from his home in Florida.\"Marjorie 'Traitor' Green [sic] is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\" he wrote.The comments follow days of criticism from Greene, who has said that Trump is not doing enough to bring down costs for voters. She also denounced his recent decisions in foreign conflicts and on tariff policies.But she has been most critical of his approach to handling the Epstein files. The turnaround is remarkable for a lawmaker who stood by Trump during multiple scandals, most notably the Capitol riot in 2021 when Trump supporters stormed the US legislature in an attempt to block Trump's election defeat. The US president also vigorously defended Greene when she was accused of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories.Greene is one of only four House Republicans who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the Epstein files last week.On Friday, Greene posted on X that Trump was trying to stop other Republicans from voting in favour of the Epstein petition.\"He's coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,\" she posted, adding: \"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.\"She returned to X on Saturday to say Trump had made her a target for threats \"fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world\".\"As a Republican, who overwhelmingly votes for President Trump's bills and agenda, his aggression against me... is completely shocking to everyone,\" she wrote.\"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump,\" she wrote in one post. \"I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.\"Former Republican pollster and strategist Robert Moran said it was clear the US president did not want the Epstein files to be released and \"is trying to pressure\" Greene. Mr Moran doubted the row would affect Trump's popularity as the electorate was so divided, but said it was inevitable the files would eventually come out. \"Many of his voters are sceptical of power and so they want power to be held to account, and they support the release of these files,\" he added.Trump has long faced criticism from both parties over his handling of the US Department of Justice files related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the US president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.",

    "body": "7 November 2025Jess Warren,London and Alice Bhandhukravi,LondonBBCOliver Archer's chatty nature led to him striking up a conversation with the man who turned out to be his fatherOliver Archer was posting two parcels in a corner shop in west London when another customer walked in. Within minutes, he would discover this man was his biological father.\"My whole life I've wanted to know him,\" the 21-year-old told BBC London. \"I got to a state where I accepted I wasn't going to meet him.\"Mr Archer said he had struck up a conversation with the man in the shop in Ladbroke Grove on 27 October after hearing him speaking Turkish on the phone. All he knew about his father was his first name, his height, and that he was a \"nice man from Istanbul\".\"How chatty I am in general, I just started a conversation,\" he said. After hearing that the man's family was from Istanbul, Mr Archer said he replied: \"Oh, my dad is from Istanbul.\"Oliver ArcherMr Archer said he had wanted to meet his father his whole lifeMr Archer said he had introduced himself properly to the man, and they shook hands and exchanged names.\"I'm thinking, 'that's my father's name',\" he said. \"It was the only description that my mum ever gave me. She always said he was a nice guy - I analysed the conversation; he was lovely.\"I wasn't analysing his face and thinking: 'Do we look alike?' I just knew his name, short, nice guy. All three boxes were ticked. I thought, one in a million - why not?\"As the man went to leave, Mr Archer called out to him, and asked him for a quick chat, then asked him if he knew a woman by his mother's name.The reply: \"Yes, but 20-odd years ago.\"\"He kind of just froze, and we were both standing there awkwardly,\" said Mr Archer, whose follow-up sentence was: \"I think I might be your son.\"He added: \"This all happened in the space of three or four minutes of talking. It just so happened our lives crossed paths.\"Oliver ArcherMr Archer said as a boy, he used to search his father's first name on Facebook in the hopes of finding himMr Archer said he knew his father was aware he had a son called Oliver, and had a picture of his paternal grandmother holding him as a baby. The 21-year-old, who has five sisters and two brothers, said he had spent his youth hoping to find his father, and often searched for his first name on Facebook when his mother left the room.Having started his life in Ladbroke Grove, Mr Archer spent his childhood in Kent and then Kingston. He moved back to Ladbroke Grove aged 18. \"He met my mum in Ladbroke Grove,\" Mr Archer said. \"So that's why I always had a little bit of hope, having moved back to this area.\"He explained that two weeks before their chance meeting, he had taken an ancestry DNA test in the hope of finding a link to his father. The result was what he already knew - he was half Turkish.Oliver ArcherMr Archer said he had discovered his father has six other children, giving him a total of 13 siblingsMr Archer said the man explained that he remembered his mother's street address and her sister - who was involved in their introduction - and that she had two children at the time.\"We had a little conversation, and had a bit of a laugh,\" he said. \"He told me he has six other children.\"I guess that's another conversation as to whether I get to meet them.\"Mr Archer said he and his father had been texting since their chance encounter and planned to meet for a coffee on Sunday.Asked if he intended to take a DNA test with his father to prove the familial link, he laughed.\"He's the spitting image of me,\" he said. \"Based on his looks, I'd like to think he was.\"The timeline - and how we connected all the dots - there was no way I was walking out of that situation thinking he was a stranger on the street just blagging it.\"He added that he hoped they would do a DNA test at some point, for 100% certainty.BBC London has spoken to the man Mr Archer believes is his father. He believes he is too.'Proud of his response'Mr Archer added that his mother was happy for him, and agreed that the description sounded like the man she knew years ago.\"I'm still processing it all,\" he said. \"I'm very happy, I'm very excited. \"I have to credit him, he handled it very well. Despite him not being in my life, I'm very proud of his response.\"We've probably walked past each other so many times and never known.\"He said he wanted to understand what had happened in the past, but held no resentment.\"I don't want there to be any expectation, any sense of owing, resentment or anything,\" he said. \"I just want us both to look at what we have now, and say, 'Let's build something from it'.\"Mr Archer added: \"A conversation with an individual is an opportunity. That conversation - being kind, being thoughtful - led me to meet my dad. \"To anyone that is ever hesitant about talking to people, being kind, try to keep it rooted at the forefront of your heart.\"There's definitely something you can get from it. In my case, I met my dad.\"More on this story",

    "body": "The Vatican has returned 62 indigenous artefacts to Canada, 100 years after they were taken from tribes to appear in a missionary museum in Rome. The items were given by Pope Leo XIV on Saturday to the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB), which says it plans to return them to their original native communities. The move comes three years after Pope Francis issued a historic apology to Canada's First Nations for the church's role in the \"genocide\" and suppression of indigenous identity through the residential schools programme. A joint statement from the Vatican and the CCCB says the Pope \"desires that this gift represent a concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity\".The statement adds that the artefacts \"bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the indigenous peoples\".The items, which came from several different communities around Canada, had been sent by missionaries to Rome to appear in a 1925 exhibition that displayed over 100,000 items.Among the artefacts being returned is an Inuit kayak that had historically been used to hunt whales in Canada's far north, and a set of embroidered gloves that came from the Cree Nation.Canada's ambassador to the Holy See told CBC News that the items are currently in storage in Rome, and will be flown back to Canada on 6 December.In 2022, Pope Francis made a \"penitential pilgrimage\" across Canada, where he offered an apology to local tribal leaders. During the trip, the communities requested the return of their artefacts.The CCCB says the items will be transferred to Canada's National Indigenous Organizations which \"will then ensure that the artefacts are reunited with their communities of origin\".The cost of repatriating the items has been prepaid by the tribes, which plan to hold ceremonies before they can be officially returned, according to CBC.Canadian Foreign Minister praised the move, calling it, \"an important step that honours the diverse cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples and supports ongoing efforts toward truth, justice, and reconciliation\".The items had been held in the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The church has described the items as \"gifts\" that were given by tribal leaders. Critics have disputed this characterisation, given the power imbalance at the time they were transferred. The items were taken to Europe during a time when Canadian law, as well as Catholic decrees, prohibited native spiritual practices, leading to a ban on certain items used during ceremonies.",

    "body": "TikTok award winner Max: 'It takes me hours to make the content you scroll on the toilet'2 days agoYasmin RufoMagazine LondonGetty ImagesMax Klymenko took home the coveted prize of creator of the yearA transport enthusiast, a beauty advocate and a mum teaching people how to raise an autistic child were among the winners of the second annual TikTok awards. Hosted by TV presenter AJ Odudu at Magazine London, awards were handed out in  12 categories including fashion, travel, food and education. And taking home the coveted prize of creator of the year was Max Klymenko, who is best known for his career ladder series, which he says is the most popular non-animated show in the world.In case you've not seen it, Max sets up his stepladder in various public spaces and invites passers-by to join him standing on the ladder while he tries to guess their career with a series of yes/no questions. Max came to the UK from Ukraine 14 years ago and said the reason he started creating content was because he found it impossible to get a job to get his own career going. \"I had a lot of anxiety and stress around finding a job so I created videos helping people know what jobs were available to them.\" Gold ladder in hand, Max, who has 8.5 million followers on TikTok, dedicated his award to his grandma in Ukraine who \"has no electricity to follow along\". \"I'm calling her right after this,\" he said, explaining that she used to log-in from different TikTok accounts when he first started creating content so it looked like he had more views. The 29-year-old, who accepted his award from last year's winner Kyra-Mae Turner added that he was grateful his content was being recognised because \"everything you see when you scroll on the toilet or in bed takes hours to make\".The nominees have a combined follower count of more than 83 million and the winners were voted for by five million people on the app. Winning the award for video of the year was Bemi Orojuogun, better known as bus aunty. Often seen smiling silently on TikToks as she stands at the side of a road or a depot – while a passing double-decker appears to narrowly miss hitting her – Bemi has turned her lifelong love of the London's transport network into a viral celebration of city life.Getty ImagesBemi thanked Transport for London, Stormzy and God for her award tonight Her winning video has been viewed almost 50 million times and she now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea.The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admitted: \"It's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me,\" but said she is proud of what she's achieved.She thanked Transport for London and Stormzy, saying that he propelled her to fame after re-posting one of her videos. The 56-year-old grandma had a wonderful night making friends - including Nikki Lilly, the winner of the fashion and beauty creator of the year.Nikki, who has 10 million TikTok followers, told the BBC that fashion, beauty and lifestyle content can be seen as \"skin deep\" but her content challenges those perceptions. \"I don't want to only make my social media a highlights reel,\" the 21-year-old said. \"It's also me having surgeries, a chronic illness and me having a facial difference.\"Third wheeling a new friendship... Bemi and Nikki have found a best friend in each other After being diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation, a rare life-threatening medical condition, at age six, she has used her platform to raise awareness and inspire others.\"As someone with a facial condition, I've never felt fully embraced in this space,\" she said while accepting her award. But she added, she has now found \"so much safety\" in the TikTok beauty world. Another advocate creator is Tola and Kevin who won the \"voice for change\" award. Getty ImagesTola's content about raising an autistic child has seen her build up a global following Tola and Kevin are a mother-son duo behind an account that posts candid videos of what it's like to raise a young adult with autism, striving to create content that raises awareness and promotes acceptance.In tears, Tola said she was so grateful for the award and explained she started the account because she felt isolated when her son was first diagnosed with autism 16 years ago.She's since built an \"amazing community who love and support Kevin\" which has helped the both of them immensely. One of the most recognisable winners of the night was Charley Marlowe, a Radio 1 presenter, who won entertainment creator of the year. Getty ImagesCharley's celebrity interviews and presenting work earned her the award for entertainment creator of the year If you don't know her, you're likely to know her famous cackle which has become her trademark. On the red carpet earlier in the night she told me \"Win or lose, we're on the booze, so I'm having a good night anyway.\" She was in shock to have won the award and dedicated it to \"every northern, working-class diva.\" In the bar at the awards, she would have found Phil Carr, who promised to hit the bar immediately after picking up the award for travel creator of the year. His videos show him visiting attractions and towns and cities around the UK (and occasionally further afield) where he uncovers their worst and best qualities and routinely updates viewers on how many branches of Aldi, Iceland and Wetherspoons can be found in the vicinity.He had promised his 1.1m followers he will carry out a series of forfeits suggested by them so has now lined up nights out in Luton, Clacton and a full 16 hours (from breakfast right through to last orders) in the Sweyn Forkbeard pub in Gainsborough. Lincolnshire – which he has said may be his toughest TikTok assignment to date.Full list of winnersCreator of the year - Max KlymenkoEntertainment creator of the year - Charley MarloweFood creator of the year - Kieran MonlouisSport creator of the year - Lissie MackintoshFashion and beauty creator of the year - Nikki LillyTravel creator of the year -  Phil CarrBooks & learning creator of the year - Gabriel AstorgaVoice for change creator of the year - Tola and KevinStoryteller of the year - Morgan M James Rising star creator of the year - Joy AnokwuruVideo of the year award - Bemi OrojuogunArtist of the year - Olivia Dean",

    "body": "5 hours agoRuth Comerford and Ethirajan Anbarasan,global affairs reporterWatch: Protesters against violent crime and the Sheinbaum government clash with police in Mexico CityAt least 120 people - 100 of them police officers - have been injured in clashes during anti-government protests in Mexico City, police said.Thousands of demonstrators marched in the Mexican capital on Saturday to protest against violent crime and President Claudia Sheinbaum's government.Sheinbaum said the marches, which also took place in other cities, had been funded by right-wing politicians who oppose her government.The rally was organised by Gen Z youth groups, drawing support from citizens protesting against high-profile killings, including the assassination just weeks ago of Uruapan Mayor Carlos Manzo - who had called for tough action against cartels.Demonstrators dismantled parts of a barrier protecting the National Palace, where Sheinbaum lives. Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.Manzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"Sheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

Get Me Out of Here! kicks off on Sunday night, with former Lioness Alex Scott, TV personality Jack Osbourne and comedian Ruby Wax among those being dumped in the middle of the Australian outback.The full line-up was confirmed just a few days before the 25th series gets under way.Here’s everything you need to know before the action begins at 21:00 GMT.Who’s on the line-up?Aitch, rapper whose real name is Harrison ArmstrongAlex Scott, former pro footballer turned pundit and presenterAngryginge, content creator whose real name is Morgan BurtwistleEddie Kadi, comedian and BBC Radio 1Xtra presenterJack Osbourne, media personalityKelly Brook, model and Heart radio presenterLisa Riley, Emmerdale starMartin Kemp, Spandau Ballet starRuby Wax, US comedianShona McGarty, EastEnders actress... And who isn't on the line-up?There’s a conspicuous absence of politicians on this year’s line-up.Who could forget those scenes of the former health secretary Matt Hancock and the now-leader of Reform, Nigel Farage, wading through sludge and eating disgusting items?But a few years ago, Ant and Dec suggested the ITV show should take a break from putting politicians in the jungle.And that seems to have worked, as far as the 2025 line-up is concerned.Who is hosting?Getty ImagesPresenting duo Ant and Dec - real names Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly - are back as hosts once again this year.The pair have already popped up in a trailer for the show, wearing matching Christmas jumpers.Ant says: \"It's the most wonderful time of the year, and it's about to get even better.\"How have the rules changed this year?ITV has introduced a new rule for this year's series, meaning individual contestants cannot be voted to do every bushtucker trial for numerous days in a row.Show bosses said the new rule, which will mean celebrities can do \"two in a row and you miss a go\", has been created to \"give all campmates the opportunity to shine\".Viewers voted for DJ Dean McCullough to do trials six times in a row in last year's series, while Hancock also did six trials in a row in 2022.The gruesome trials often require celebrities to eat delicacies like kangaroo anus, crocodile penis and sheep semen, or be trapped with creatures such as snakes, cockroaches and rats.Being repeatedly nominated for trials has taken its toll on some celebrities in the past. Gillian McKeith appeared to faint after she was voted to do her seventh trial in 2010.When does the show start?I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! is set to return on ITV1 and ITVX on Sunday 16 November at 21:00 GMT, and will air every night while the series is on.The end date has not been confirmed yet.However, the series usually runs for around three weeks, which would put the finale in early December.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAna Faguy,Washington DCandEloise Alanna,MontrealWatch: 'Integrity in sport is important' - Canadians react to Olympic curling cheating rowA scandal at the Winter Olympics has left the Canadian curling teams on the defensive and Canadians reeling over the crack in their country's polite persona.Over the weekend, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy had an expletive-filled outburst after Sweden accused him of cheating during a match, and later said his team might be the target of a \"premeditated\" attack by their rivals.Kennedy was accused of \"double-touching\" - touching the stone a second time after initially releasing it down the ice. The next day, Canadian women's captain Rachel Holman was accused of using the same move. Both have denied the accusations, but Canada's curling teams, who historically have dominated the sport, now face questions over their tactics. While the curlers have shown their anger over the situation during matches, fans of the sport and Canadians have questioned whether the team acted in the spirit of curling.In a country well known for its \"niceness\", the cheating row has stung for some. The BBC asked tourists and locals in Montreal what they made of it. \"It's a sad day for Canadian sport,\" said Tim Gray, from Alberta. \"Integrity in the sport is important, even if you have to call it on yourself.\"\"As Canadians, we aren't supposed to do these things,\" said Samar, from Ontario.Without sportsmanship, said Dwayne from British Columbia, it's not sport any more.There was a more nuanced take at the Royal Montreal Curling Club.One of the curling instructors, Ankara Leonard, said the publicity could be good for the sport by generating interest.She added: \"Do I think [Kennedy's] finger affects the rock? No I do not. Do I think we have to play within the rules? Yes.\"The controversy began on Friday when Swedish player Oskar Eriksson accused Kennedy of double-touching. As the game continued, Kennedy and Eriksson got into a verbal back-and-forth that included expletives. Their exchange quickly went viral as a video emerged that appeared to show Kennedy pushing the stone with his finger after releasing it.Kennedy got a verbal warning from World Curling for using foul language, but he was not formally charged with cheating by the governing body. ReutersCanada's Marc Kennedy was accused of double-touching stones when he released themThe next day, Kennedy said: \"I probably could have handled it better. But we're human out there and there's a lot of emotions. I'm not going to apologise for defending my teammates and standing up for myself.\" \"I've curled my whole life, never once with the intention of getting an advantage through cheating,\" he added. An opinion piece in the Canadian news outlet, the Globe and Mail, pointed to some of the frustration felt back home\"These Canadian curling teams are not fun bad guys. They come off like the sort of competitors who need so desperately to win that they will do anything - even things that are pointless - in order to get there.\"Cathal Kelly, the writer of the opinion piece, continued: \"There's an easy way out of this - stop struggling. Stop acting like our curling reputation matters more than our national one. Be the bigger man and woman, even if you don't think you did anything wrong.\"AFP via Getty ImagesCanada's Rachel Homan slammed the officials' decision to remove her stoneThere was a second cheating row on Saturday when match officials accused the Canadian women's team of the same double-touch violation.  Rachel Homan said there was a \"zero percent chance\" there had truly been a violation, as she and her teammates looked on in frustration. The Canadians lost to the Swiss, 8-7.On Sunday, Great Britain's men's team was accused of the same violation. Both Homan and British men's curler Bobby Lammie had stones removed from play due to alleged violations.Homan later slammed the officials' decision to remove her stone during a defeat to Switzerland, saying it was \"insane\".All of the incidents led World Curling to clarify that double-tapping is not allowed.\"During forward motion, touching the granite of the stone is not allowed. This will result in the stone being removed from play,\" they said.World Curling does not use video to review play, but they did send two officials to monitor how players released their stones in subsequent games. Curling columnist and Olympian Tomi Rantamaki, in an article for The Curling News, warned that Canada's dominance in the world of curling means its players should be mindful of the influence they have.\"Young players in Finland, Korea, Italy, Sweden - everywhere - often copy what Canadian teams do. They copy the athlete's delivery, the sweeping, the tactics, the communication,\" Rantamaki wrote. \"And they copy the behaviour.\"",

    "body": "Legal challenge to Met's Freemasons policy thrown out50 minutes agoPA MediaFreemasons are a fraternal society that emerged from medieval European stonemason guild traditions, and dates back over 600 yearsA legal challenge against the Met Police over its decision to force staff to declare whether they are or have been Freemasons has been thrown out by a High Court judge.Mr Justice Chamberlain said on Tuesday that the Met's decision \"serves a legitimate aim, maintaining and enhancing public trust in policing, and is proportionate\".Three bodies representing Freemasons in England, Wales, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, as well as two serving police officers who are Freemasons, had sought to take legal action against the force at the High Court.It came after the Met announced in December that membership of the Freemasons or similar organisations would be added to its declarable associations policy.This means officers and staff were required to declare membership \"past or present\" of any organisation that is \"hierarchical, has confidential membership and requires members to support and protect each other\".Around 400 Met officers and staff have already made declarations under the policy.'Unduly stigmatising'In a 17-page ruling on Tuesday, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the grounds of the proposed legal challenge were not \"reasonably arguable\" and that the policy was not discriminatory or \"unduly stigmatising\" against Freemasons.He added that leaving the decision of whether to declare membership of the Freemasons to individual officers and staff on an \"ad hoc basis\" would not \"achieve the object of maintaining or enhancing public trust\".At a hearing on 11 February, lawyers for the two officers, the United Grand Lodge of England, the Order of Women Freemasons and the Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons asked Mr Justice Chamberlain to allow the challenge to proceed.Claire Darwin KC, for the claimants, said that the Met's decision allowed it to create a \"blacklist\".In written submissions, the barrister said that the move was an \"institutional signal of suspicion\" which breached Freemasons' human rights and was based on \"limited, opaque and heavily perception-driven\" evidence.She continued that the police appeared to rely on \"long-standing conspiracy theories and/or prejudicial tropes about Freemasons\" as a reason to introduce the measure.Barristers for the Met said the claim should be thrown out, telling the court that the suggestion officers would be blacklisted was \"plainly wrong\" and that employees were \"free to become or remain Freemasons\".James Berry KC, for the force, said in written submissions that claims that the decision breached officers' and staff's human rights were \"without merit\", and that fears of stigmatisation are \"not supported by the evidence\".Discussing the \"stigma associated with Freemasonry\", he added: \"The defendant is not responsible for the stigma, but the defendant is responsible for addressing it in connection with the exercise of police duties and functions by the defendant's officers and staff and for positively maintaining public confidence in the impartiality and transparency of the Metropolitan Police.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentandKate Whannel,Political reporterGetty ImagesLocal election administrators have warned that councils face \"an uphill struggle\" to be ready in time for local elections in May after the government reversed its plan to delay some votes. Local Government Secretary Steve Reed had initially approved delays in 30 council elections in England until 2027.But in a surprise announcement on Monday, the government announced it would be abandoning plans to postpone ballots following a legal challenge brought by Reform UK.Explaining the U-turn, the government said its legal advice had changed - but it has not provided further details, and is now facing pressure from opposition parties to publish the advice. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Heath Minister Stephen Kinnock said: \"We had a process that we went through, and then that changed. \"Sometimes circumstances change, and that's the nature of the beast.\"Ministers had previously justified the delays by arguing that some councils were worried about the cost of running elections in authorities that are due to be abolished as part of Labour's overhaul of local government in England.Writing in The Times last month, Reed had said running elections for \"short-lived zombie councils\" would divert \"scarce resources away from front-line services like fixing pot holes and social care.\"However, the postponements had been met with a huge political backlash, whilst the Electoral Commission, the UK's elections watchdog, said it did not believe \"capacity constraints\" were a \"legitimate reason\" for delays. A group that represents electoral officials in the UK said the teams who help to run elections had lost months of preparation time and would struggle to be ready.Local elections in Norfolk, Suffolk, Blackburn, Lincoln, Thurrock and two dozen more parts of England, will now take place on 7 May.Some organisers said they were still preparing anyway, aware there was a legal challenge to the government's decision to postpone votes in their areas, which was due to be heard in the High Court on Thursday.The Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA), which provides training for electoral officials in the UK, said it was \"extremely disappointed\" that months of \"essential planning time\" had been lost. The AEA's deputy chief executive Laura Lock said returning officers, electoral registration officers, and electoral administration teams would be affected. \"These teams now face an uphill struggle to catch up to where they should be,\" she said. \"They have paused planning to avoid unnecessary cost, but this means they are now playing catch-up.\" The U-turn means Labour will now be defending 2,558 seats, up from 2,317, whilst the Conservatives will be defending 1,362 instead of 1,074. Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit, told BBC Breakfast the elections would put pressure on \"hard-working council officers\".\"It will be done, as always, by hard-working council officers just going the extra mile, working harder, doing the extra hours, giving up their weekends. They can do it, but I don't think it's fair to ask them to\", he said.He said the situation \"damages our democratic process\", and warned the last-minute change sends the message that \"these elections are optional\".Matthew Hicks, leader of Tory-run Suffolk County Council said: \"Local councils across the country are experiencing whiplash as major government decisions shift repeatedly and without warning.\"Hicks said the uncertainty impacted on the ability \"to plan effectively\" and \"deliver stability for residents\".Meanwhile, the leader of Labour-run Thurrock Council Lynn Worrall said it was \"disappointing that this decision has been reversed so late in the day\".The U-turn, the latest in a string of climbdowns by the government, was announced during Parliament's mid-February recess, meaning MPs will have to wait until next week to question ministers on the move.In celebration of his win, Nigel Farage, writing on X, said: \"We took this Labour government to court and won.\"The government has agreed to pay Reform's legal costs relating to the proceedings, which a party source said would be at least £100,000.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said it was \"predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions\".Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party \"fought tooth and nail to stop this stitch-up and the government has been forced into a humiliating U-turn\".Zack Polanski, the Green Party leader of England and Wales, welcomed the decision adding that \"attempting to cancel elections\" was \"part of a disturbing authoritarian trend of this caretaker prime minister\".

    "body": "7 minutes agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterReutersReform UK has announced Robert Jenrick as the party's pick to become chancellor if it wins power at the next general election.The former Conservative minister - who defected to Reform last month - said his party's plans would restore stability to the economy, cut waste, bring down the benefits bill and reduce taxes.Meanwhile, another recent Tory defector, Suella Braverman, has been handed the education and skills brief, with deputy leader Richard Tice given a new role combining business, trade and energy policy.Announcing his new top team, which he branded a \"shadow cabinet\", leader Nigel Farage said Reform was \"the voice of opposition\" to the Labour government. As the party with the largest number of MPs behind Labour, the Conservatives are the official opposition with a shadow cabinet mirroring government ministers.However, with Reform consistently leading in national opinion polls since last spring, Farage said it was time to \"broaden the party\" and put people in \"shadow positions\".Jenrick is a former housing secretary, and has held ministerial roles at the Home Office and health department when the Conservatives were in government. He also held a junior Treasury role as exchequer secretary, under Theresa May.Zia Yusuf, currently Reform's head of policy, was announced as the party's lead on home affairs, with a focus on cutting legal and illegal immigration.Before Jenrick's defection, both Tice and Yusuf had been considered potential chancellors in a future Reform government.However, Tice, whom Farage said would also become deputy prime minister if Reform won power, insisted \"we're all delighted\" with the jobs given.Tice said he would focus on using oil and gas to help boost economic growth, while abandoning net zero targets. Conservative chairman Kevin Hollinrake said Reform's front bench \"looks more like a tribute act to the old Conservative Party than a credible alternative\".Labour Party chairwoman Anna Turley said Farage's top team was made up of \"failed Tories\" who had \"failed Britain before\" and would \"do the same again under Reform\".Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Nigel Farage is welcome to give his colleagues new name badges but it won't change the opinion of the country - that Conservatives, current or former, are totally unfit to govern.\"",

    "body": "Can you really depuff your face? The truth about three common treatments10 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesFrom plunging your face into bowls of ice water to rolling frozen tools across your cheeks, social media is full of quick fixes promising to depuff your face in minutes.While these techniques look convincing on screen, dermatologists say many of them are misunderstood, overhyped and at best, temporary. Consultant dermatologist Dr Aiza Jamil says facial puffiness is usually caused by fluid retention and common triggers include high salt and alcohol intake, allergies and lack of sleep. Dr Tina Tian, also a consultant dermatologist explains most viral hacks fall into three categories - cold exposure, massage and temporary tightening effects.They can \"genuinely reduce visible swelling and provide relief but the key word is temporary - they won't permanently change facial structure\". So what actually helps with facial puffiness, and what's more myth than miracle? Here's the truth about three common treatments.1. Cold therapy Getty ImagesCold exposure causes blood vessels to constrictIf you've ever hovered over a sink debating whether to dunk your face into a bowl of ice water, you're not alone. The \"ice facial\" has become a social media rite of passage and is half beauty hack, half endurance challenge.Tina explains the appeal comes from the fact that the \"cold exposure causes blood vessels to constrict, which can reduce swelling\".This is the logic behind ice facials, cryo globes and refrigerated sheet masks but Tina says you don't need a dramatic ice plunge to get the benefit as a chilled compress or even a splash of cold water can do the job. Aiza adds that it can give you a \"slightly tighter, fresher appearance, particularly in the morning\" but results are temporary and the effect \"lasts hours rather than days\". Tina says there's also a fine line between refreshing and overdoing it as \"very aggressive ice exposure can irritate sensitive skin or trigger rosacea, so keep it gentle\". 2. Facial rollers Getty ImagesIt's important to use the tools gently, says TinaOnce niche spa tools, facial rollers and gua sha stones are now bathroom staples for many of us. Promoted as sculpting devices, they've built a reputation for lifting and contouring but Aiza says they \"do not permanently tighten skin, change skin structure, or remove fat\". She adds that it's best to see them as a \"soothing tool\".They can however help with reducing facial puffiness temporarily. \"A gentle massage encourages lymphatic drainage and reduces fluid pooling if used regularly,\" Tina says. When you roll or glide these products across the skin, you're helping stagnant fluid move away from the face and towards the lymph nodes, where it can drain naturally. Tina adds that cooling the tools can boost the results so some people choose to keep them in the fridge. If done properly, it's unlikely to cause you any harm, but Tina warns that \"too much pressure can cause bruising or broken capillaries, so be gentle\".3. Caffeine creamsGetty ImagesYou've probably seen caffeine eye cream everywhere - it's recommended by influencers, stacked in skincare aisles and tucked into \"morning routine\" videos promising instant bright eyes. The skin around the eyes is especially prone to swelling because fluid can collect there easily.Unlike many beauty trends, Tina says this one does have some evidence behind it. \"Caffeine is a mild vasoconstrictor [narrows blood vessels], so caffeine-containing eye creams can genuinely reduce puffiness,\" she says. Caffeine temporarily shrinks blood vessels and less dilation means less visible swelling. Aiza adds that it can help \"reduce fluid retention and some under-eye darkness\". If you're going to use an eye cream, Tina recommends looking for one with hydrating ingredients alongside the caffeine as that supports skin quality. She adds that you can also keep the cream in the fridge or even \"apply it with the back of a cold spoon\". Aiza says DIY alternatives like using a cold spoon or chilled tea bags \"works similarly by temporarily reducing swelling and soothing skin\".Tina agrees and says these methods follow the same principle \"but can provide a lesser effect\".While caffeine eye cream can help reduce puffiness, Tina says it's more important to focus on the cause. \"Reduce evening salt and alcohol, treat allergies properly, prioritise sleep and slightly elevate your head at night. Most puffiness isn't a medical issue and will settle on its own but Tina says that \"if it's persistent, worsening, painful or associated with other symptoms such as breathlessness or swelling elsewhere in the body, it should be assessed medically\".

    "body": "57 minutes agoAnna LamcheGettyMPs may investigate Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor for his conduct while working as a trade envoy for the UK, the chairman of the cross-party Business and Trade Committee has said.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Liam Byrne said his committee would meet next Tuesday to decide \"how we might or might not take this investigation forward\".The latest files released by the US Department of Justice appear to show the former prince forwarded sensitive government documents and commercial information to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.MPs are taking the allegations \"acutely seriously\", Byrne said. \"And I can guarantee you that MPs are not in the market for letting anything slip through the cracks,\" he added.\"My job as the chair is to make sure that the options are on the table in front of them when we consider it next week when Parliament resumes.\"The former Duke of York served as a UK trade envoy between 2001 and 2011. In this role he travelled globally and enjoyed privileged access to senior government and business contacts around the world.In 2010, Andrew appears to have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein, according to the recently published files. Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct. Andrew has previously strongly denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein and rejected any suggestion he used his time as trade envoy to further his own interests.Earlier in February, Thames Valley Police confirmed it was assessing whether there are grounds to investigate a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic, which reported Mountbatten-Windsor for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets.Byrne said parliamentary recess meant the Business and Trade Committee had not yet had a chance to consider the allegations about Andrew, but added he was working to ensure \"the committee's got options in front of them when they meet on Tuesday for how we might or might not take this investigation forward\". He said he couldn't \"pre-judge\" the committee's decision about whether an investigation was necessary, but added: \"At this stage, all I can say is nothing is off the table\".In theory select committees - cross-party groups of MPs covering specific policy areas - have the power to force witnesses to attend a session to answer questions.However, this does not apply to members of the Royal Family and such an appearance would be unprecedented.In practice, there are few repercussions if someone does refuse to attend.Bryne, the MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North, is the latest person to suggest the former Duke of York could face an investigation for his conduct while serving as a UK trade envoy.Byrne's comments come as the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) announced a new national group has been set up to support UK police forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files.It is understood the national coordination group will bring together affected forces to ensure consistency. The group is not an investigative team, and each force will remain responsible for any potential offences that occurred within their jurisdiction.",

The group performed at Glastonbury in 2015 for BBC Introducing. Since then, he has been performing and recording under his solo name.\"I find it completely bonkers to be jumping on this wonderful and wild journey,\" he said.\"I have always been a massive Eurovision fan, and I love the magical joy it brings to millions of people every year, so getting to join that legacy and fly the flag for the UK is an absolute honour that I am taking very seriously.\"'Creativity, ambition and wit'The Kent-based artist has attracted attention for the unusual electronic instruments he creates, including organs made from Furby toys and Game Boys, synthesiser bicycles and flame-throwing keyboards.\"I've been working a long-time creating, writing, and producing my own visions from scratch, and documenting my process,\" he explained.\"I will be bringing every ounce of my creativity to my performances, and I can't wait for everyone to hear and see what we've created.

I am sure he will make us all proud on the international stage in May.\"'Try something different'His song hasn't been revealed yet, but BBC Radio 2 DJ Scott Mills said he had heard it.He said: \"The UK often gets criticised at Eurovision, or it has in some years. 'We're always really safe, we always keep it really middle of the road.' So we are going to try something different this year. Why not? Let's try something different, and it is different.\"Speaking about the song, Mills said: \"From just one listen, I want you to imagine a bit of Basshunter's Now You're Gone and then put a bit of Parklife [by] Blur in there, and maybe you would add in a bit of West End Girls [by] Pet Shop Boys, maybe the synths of The Human League. Sprinkle a bit of Verka Serduchka in there. Maybe just a tiny bit of Sex Pistols.\"Stick all that in a blender and create a big anthem to take on Eurovision, one that I can imagine they will be singing in that arena.\"The song will get its first radio play on Mills's Radio 2 breakfast show \"in the coming weeks\", the BBC said.The 70th Eurovision Song Contest will be held in Vienna following Austrian singer JJ's victory in Switzerland last year. The grand final will take place on 16 May, although this year's contest has been dogged by controversy after five countries pulled out following the confirmation of Israel's participation in the competition.The UK is hoping to reverse its fortunes after struggling in the contest since in recent years.After the high of Sam Ryder's second place back in 2022, Mae Muller came second to last in Liverpool the following year, Olly Alexander finished 18th in 2024, and Remember Monday landed in 19th place last year.",

May he rest in peace.\"In his tribute, Pacino wrote: \"He was a born actor as they say, his connection with it, his understanding and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. I will miss him.\"During his impressive six-decade career, Duvall was nominated for seven Oscars and played roles including the mafia consigliere in Francis Ford Coppola‘s The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, and a forceful army officer in Coppola’s Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now.He only had a few minutes of screen time but his famous line in the 1979 classic, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\", became legendary.Coppola called his loss \"a blow\".\"Such a great actor and such an essential part of American Zoetrope from its beginning,\" the director said in a statement on Instagram, referring to his production company.His Apocalypse Now character was originally meant to be even more over the top but Duvall toned it down and the name was changed from Captain Carnage to Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore.\"I did my homework,\" Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. \"I did my research.”Getty ImagesOthers paying tribute included Fallout actor Walton Goggins, who appeared in 1997's The Apostle, which Duvall directed, wrote and starred in.\"The celestial light just lost its glow.

    "body": "19 minutes agoSimon King,Lead Weather PresenterandMalu CursinoGetty ImagesYellow weather warnings for ice and snow have been issued in parts of the UKThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a yellow cold health alert for most of England, as Arctic air sweeps the country.The alert comes ahead of the Met Office's yellow warnings for snow and rain in parts of England and Wales, which will come into effect on Wednesday.The cold snap has also led forecasters to issue fresh warnings for ice and snow, after temperatures dipped as low as -7.2C (19F) in the Highlands overnight on Monday.Although earlier warnings for snow and ice expired on Tuesday morning, the Met Office warned commuters to remain vigilant due to the risk of black ice and slippery conditions.Regions affected by the UKHSA's yellow cold health alert include the East Midlands, the East of England, the North East, North West, West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the South West.The alert will be in place from 18:00 on Tuesday until 18:00 on Friday, the UKHSA said.The agency warns that the weather is likely to have \"minor impacts on health and social care services, including increased use of healthcare services and a greater risk to life of vulnerable people\".A yellow weather warning for snow across most of Wales and parts of western England will come into effect at 16:00 on Wednesday and will be in place until 06:00 on Thursday.A separate yellow warning for rain will be in place for much of the south of England from 06:00 on Wednesday until Thursday at 08:00.How to drive safely in icy weatherMonday brought blustery showers and a few brighter spells for much of the UK, with wintry rain continuing across Scotland and snow settling over higher ground.By Monday night, colder Arctic air spread south, lowering snow levels across Scotland and increasing the risk of ice and snow showers in some areas.Overnight on Monday, temperatures in England reached a low of -3.9C in Spadeadam, Cumbria, while Northern Ireland saw temperatures of -4.3C in Katesbridge, County Down. Scotland, meanwhile, recorded lows of -7.2C at Loch Glascarnoch in the Highlands. The coldest overnight temperature in Wales was recorded in Sennybridge, Powys, where the mercury hit -2.8C.Tuesday is expected to be mostly dry and sunny for many. But with temperatures only reaching 3C to 6C and a brisk northerly wind, it will feel colder - particularly in eastern areas where wind chill could make it feel close to freezing.Temperatures are set to fall close to freezing for most of the UK on Wednesday morning. In parts of northern and north-east Scotland, temperatures could fall to -8C and -10C. Further ice warnings may come into force.Weather conditions will become more unsettled again on Wednesday with a band of rain pushing in from the south and west. This could bring a mix of rain, sleet and hill snow, according to the Met Office. The forecaster said the system is being monitored closely with the potential for further snow warnings.Later in the week, conditions are expected to turn drier and milder.Getty ImagesA flooded playground in the Chertsey area of Surrey, where a flood warning is in placeMeanwhile, 64 flood warnings and 175 flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency across England on Tuesday - concentrated in the south and the Midlands - following a long spell of wet weather.Two flood alerts were in place in Wales on Tuesday for the lower Severn catchment in Powys, and south Pembrokeshire.Jonathan Day, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said more than 24,000 homes and businesses have been protected but about 330 flooded.With further heavy rain forecast for southern England and South Wales on Wednesday, and the ground already saturated, more flood warnings or alerts could be issued.More on this story",

    "body": "5 hours agoTommy Lumby,Business data journalistandPhil Leake,Data journalistBBCWages have been rising faster than prices for the last two-and-a-half years - the longest stretch since the 2008 financial crisis.Use our calculator below to see how your pay could be affected.Tax thresholds are the points at which you start paying more income tax and National Insurance on each extra pound you earn, as your salary rises.You pay no income tax on the first £12,570, which is known as the personal allowance.You then pay 20% on earnings between £12,571 and £50,270 - the basic rate - and 40% on anything between £50,271 and £125,140, which is the higher rate. Anything above £125,140 is taxed at 45%.If you earn more than £100,000 after accounting for certain tax reliefs, you start to lose £1 from your personal allowance for every £2 you earn over that point.Governments have historically raised tax thresholds in line with inflation, to try to ensure your take-home pay keeps up with the cost of living.Weekly earnings across Britain grew at an annual rate of 0.8% between October and December after accounting for inflation, the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows.That means growth in average salaries has now consistently beaten the pace of price rises since July 2023.But thresholds have been frozen for the whole of that period and will remain stuck into the next decade.According to our calculations, the freeze in thresholds will add £465 to the 2030-31 income tax and National Insurance bill for someone currently earning £39,000, which is the salary of the average UK worker.Of that, £227 would be due to the extended freeze announced by the current Chancellor Rachel Reeves in November.Someone on £50,000 would pay an estimated £1,309 more, of which £704 would be because of the extension from 2028-29.You can read more about how the calculator works in the final section of this article.Freezing thresholds is often called a stealth tax by economists because it increases the tax take without a government having to put up rates.Both Labour and Conservative governments have used it to raise additional revenue. Extra money from tax receipts helps pay for public services such as the NHS, schools and welfare spending.Most earners will pay more because of the freeze. But people whose pay rises move them across the thresholds into the basic and higher rates are likely to see the biggest jumps in what they owe.But this only goes up to 2028-29, so does not include the period covered by the extended freeze.Thresholds were initially frozen in 2022 by former Conservative Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who paused them until 2026.The Conservatives later extended that for a further two years, before Reeves announced she would keep it in place until 2031.By 2030-31, official forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates an additional 5.2 million people will be paying the basic rate of income tax because of threshold freezes first introduced in 2022-23.An estimated 4.8 million more will be paying the higher rate, and 600,000 more the additional rate.It forecasts that the freezes to income tax thresholds will generate £56bn in revenue in 2030-31. Of that, £12bn will be down to Reeves's extension.Additional reporting by Lucy Dady and Jess CarrHow the calculator worksThis calculator estimates how much extra tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs) you will pay in 2030-31 due to frozen tax thresholds.Using official forecasts produced by the OBR for the November 2025 Budget, it estimates the extra amount you could pay compared with if thresholds had been allowed to rise from 2026-27, and how much of that is down to the current government's extension of the freeze from 2028-29.The calculator does not store your results.What does the calculator not take into account?This calculator is designed to give you an idea of how much frozen tax thresholds could affect how much tax you pay over time, but there are various other factors that can determine your tax bill.For example, if you are over the state pension age, you could be exempt from paying NICs. You can also get tax relief on pension contributions.There are various other taxes you could pay, and tax credits and allowances you could potentially claim, which this calculator does not take into account.It applies to employees working in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only. Scotland has different tax bands and thresholds.It does not apply to self-employed workers, who are taxed differently.How does it calculate how my earnings will rise?It assumes your salary will rise in line with the OBR's financial year forecasts for average weekly earnings growth each year. These forecasts are the OBR's best estimate of how wages across the labour market will rise in the future, and actual wage growth could be different.It also assumes your salary remains regular. If it fluctuates or you change jobs, this could affect how your earnings rise.How does it calculate how tax thresholds will rise?The calculator uses the same Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation figures the OBR uses to estimate how tax thresholds would rise in the future. Actual inflation could be higher or lower.The personal allowance (PA) is rounded up to the nearest £10, and the basic rate limit is rounded up to the nearest £100. The additional rate threshold rises in line with the PA, which means your PA goes down by £1 for every £2 you earn over £100,000.",

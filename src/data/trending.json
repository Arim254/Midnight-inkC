    "body": "Trump's grand plan to reshape the world order leaves Europe with a difficult choice to make9 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCFor 80 years, what bound the United States to Europe was a shared commitment to defence and a common set of values: a commitment to defend democracy, human rights and the rule of law.That era was inaugurated in March 1947 in an 18-minute speech by President Harry Truman, in which he pledged US support to defend Europe against further expansion by the Soviet Union.America led the creation of Nato, the World Bank, the IMF and the United Nations. And it bound itself into what became known as the \"rules-based international order\", in which nation states committed to a series of mutual obligations and shared burdens, designed to defend the democratic world against hostile authoritarian powers.Now, the new US National Security Strategy (NSS), published in December, signals that, for the White House, that shared endeavour has ended; that much of what the world has taken for granted about America's role is over.The review refers to the \"so-called 'rules-based international order'\", putting the latter phrase in inverted commas: a kind of delegitimisation by punctuation mark.AFP via Getty ImagesJD Vance said that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within Vice-President JD Vance warned America's European allies that this was coming in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025.He told them bluntly that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within - from those censoring free speech, suppressing political opposition and therefore undermining European democracy. And he was damning about the \"leftist liberal network\".The French newspaper Le Monde said the speech was a declaration of \"ideological war\" against Europe.Last month's NSS codifies Vance's remarks, and, in black and white, elevates them to the status of doctrine.\"Certainly America is no longer the country that promoted the global values that have been in place since the end of the Second World War,\" says Karin von Hippel, who previously held senior positions in the US State Department and is a former Director of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank.\"It is shifting to a very different place.\"So, if the world is indeed moving away from that order, what is it moving towards? And what does it mean for the rest of the world and in particular for Europe?'We have a different world today'\"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment, and have not served our or any other particular purpose,\" says Victoria Coates, a vice-president at The Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank in Washington.In the eyes of Coates - who was previously the Deputy National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump - change to the international order is inevitable in a changing world.\"The other issue we face here is that when that so-called rules-based international order was established after the Second World War, 80 short years ago, China wasn't a major concern.\"We just have a different world today.\"Getty ImagesPresident Truman watches on as a US representative signs the United Nations Charter in 1945This rules-based international order, built in the years after World War Two, was created by a generation that had come of age during an era of Great Power geopolitics, and had seen that system descend, twice, into catastrophic global conflict.That international order, flawed and incomplete though it undoubtedly was, was the legacy of that experience.But the NSS directly argues that American strategy went astray in the years since - and it blames what it calls \"American foreign policy elites\".\"They lashed American policy to a network of international institutions, some of which are driven by outright anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to dissolve individual state sovereignty,\" it says.It suggests that in future, the US will seek to roll back the influence of supranational bodies. Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe National Security Strategy says: 'We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations'\"The world's fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state… We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations…\"Elsewhere in the document, reflecting on the \"balance of power\", it states: \"The outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations.\"The Kremlin responded to the review with praise, saying much of it aligned with Moscow's own thinking.\"I think Trump, Xi, Putin and their more authoritarian acolytes are seeking to return us to an era of Great Power politics,\" says Field Marshal Lord Richards, who, as General Sir David Richards, was the head of the UK's armed forces from 2010 till 2013.Yet Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London, believes the new Security Strategy is not as radical a break with the past as it may appear.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin said much of the review aligned with Moscow's own thinking\"We need to be careful about the rules-based international order, which is a term that came into general use in the last decade or so,\" he argues.\"Look back and you find plenty of violations of the rules, Vietnam for example. So there's a sort of rosy glow about the past at times and everyone should be careful about nostalgia for what was a complex past.\"Muscular reassertion of the Monroe doctrineWashington's military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas that led to the capture of the country's leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is an early example of this more muscular assertion of sovereign unilateralism.Some international law experts have questioned the legality of the Trump administration's actions, and argued the US may have violated international statutes governing the use of force. The US maintains its actions were legally justified.\"Under American law it certainly was [legal]\" Robert Wilkie, who served as an Undersecretary of Defense in the first Trump administration, has previously told the BBC.\"Maduro - most of our European partners have not recognised his regime so he is an illegitimate figure. Because of that he is stripped of the normal protections that heads of state would have [...]particularly when were are looking at constitutional provisions that exist in the United States, that would supersede anything the UN says.\"AFP via Getty ImagesThe military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas led to the capture of Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia FloresThe NSS claims, for the United States, the right to be the pre-eminent power in the Western Hemisphere, and to bend its Latin American and Caribbean neighbours into alignment with Washington's interests.This is a muscular reassertion of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the Western hemisphere.Colombia, Panama and Cuba are all also in the President's sights.\"This starts primarily with the Panama Canal,\" says Victoria Coates. \"The degree to which control of the canal is necessary to the United States cannot be overstated.\"China is now Latin America's biggest trading partner and a major infrastructure investor there. The NSS aims to roll back Chinese influence in Washington's backyard.When the canal was handed over to Panama in 1999, says Coates, \"we were in the assumption that China was a reasonable actor… That turned out not to be true…\"So making sure that the United States retains a prime position over the canal is critical, and I think Panama is for the first time getting that message from the United States.\"But Sir Lawrence Freedman is among those who argue that the US's ability to control its neighbours is not unlimited.\"The Strategy Review might say this is our hemisphere and we can do what we want, but there are still constraints. They may have extricated Maduro and his wife, but they're still dealing with the old regime.\"They're not running the country, despite what Trump says.\"Under the new strategy, the United States will no longer pressure authoritarian regimes to improve their human rights records.In a phrase taken from the US Declaration of Independence of 1776, the review declares, \"All nations are entitled by 'the laws of nature and nature's God' to a 'separate and equal station' with respect to one another.\"Getty ImagesXi Jinping and Nicolas Maduro pictured in 2015 in Beijing, ChinaIn the Middle East, for example, the US says it will abandon the \"misguided experiment with hectoring these nations - especially the Gulf monarchies - into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government\".\"The key to successful relations with the Middle East,\" it adds, \"is accepting the region, its leaders, and its nations as they are while working together on areas of common interest.\"But it seems the same level of respect for traditions and historic forms of government is not extended to the democratic and allied nations of Europe.Whilst it refers to an American sentimental attachment to the European continent - and to Britain and Ireland - what's striking about this paper is that it seeks to redefine what is worth defending in the Western world.This review is civilisational in its reach, and argues for a civilisation that is no longer built on the shared values of the Truman Doctrine, but instead on the primacy of the sovereign nation-state.Where does this leave Europe?The review is damning about Europe's \"current trajectory\" and raises questions about whether some European nations can be regarded as dependable allies in the future.It talks about \"economic decline\" but adds that this is \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\".Elsewhere in the document, it states: \"It is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,\" which raises doubts about their viability as long-term security partners, the strategy suggests.\"It's a very nativist document,\" argues Karin von Hippel. \"It's very ideological. The underlying message is that the Christian white male is no longer running many of the countries [in the West] and we're seeing a threat to the dominance that the Christian white male has had in the United States and Europe.\"They're very careful not to say any of that explicitly but I think that's what's implied.\"Getty ImagesThe new US National Security Strategy, which was published in December, is damning about Europe's 'current trajectory'But Victoria Coates argues that, in her view, the \"larger struggle we find ourselves in\" is indeed civilisational.\"Sovereignty is also a critical issue,\" she says. \"Looking at the European Union project, especially after Brexit, I think a lot of countries are wondering if subverting the national interest to Brussels is a winning strategy.\"I do think that is one of the institutions that the NSS does call into question.\"This chimes with the interests of the American tech giants that oppose EU efforts to regulate their activities on the European continent.Last month Elon Musk posted on X that the European Union should be abolished and sovereignty returned to the individual nation states.'Cultivating resistance to Europe's trajectory'The review is clear about how Europe can regain its \"self-confidence\".It says: \"The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism. Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory. We will need a strong Europe to help us successfully compete.\"And one of its policies for doing this is by \"cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".What is meant precisely by \"cultivating resistance\" raises many questions.In Europe, some have already concluded that the USA may no longer be a reliable ally, at a time when Russia poses a growing threat. After Vice-President Vance's speech in Munich, Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" from America with a reshaped Nato.But this takes time.\"It's not achievable in the short term,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Europeans have become very dependent upon the United States, and this was a matter of choice: it was cheaper and simpler.\"Though in practice it would be desirable to be able to act without the Americans… in practice it's going to take years to disentangle ourselves. And it'll be extremely expensive.\"So Europe has a difficulty: it can't rely on the Americans, but it can't operate easily without them.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFriedrich Merz has said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" As to the pressing question of what it means for Europe - and the EU - in the near future, Lord Richards issues a stark warning: \"[It] risks falling between the cracks.\"\"The EU cannot be a Great Power, nor can any of its constituent nations,\" he argues. \"[So] the UK/EU must decide under whose sphere of influence they should shelter?\"The answer is they are likely to remain in the USA's - and within a reshaped Nato.\"'A popular revolt against the establishment'But Lord Richards also believes that increased spending commitment is long overdue.\"European nations are going to have to spend much more on their own defence. This has long been coming but in the UK it is not yet translating into any fresh money. Indeed this year the armed forces are being required to save money rather than spend more.\"The US has been pushing Europe to increase defence spending for years, notes Sir Lawrence.\"The message that Europe needs to do more for its own defence has been around a long time. It was pushed by both Obama and Biden.\"Last year Trump secured from the European allies a commitment to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP - and in doing so may have done Europe a security favour, by pushing it, in the long term, towards greater operational independence from Washington.\"Spending has gone up quite significantly,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Germans have been making quite impressive strides. So there is movement, not as fast as many would wish, but it's happening.\"The review is clear about how America thinks it can \"help\" Europe. \"We want to work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness,\" it says.Getty ImagesVictoria Coates says: \"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment...\"Ultimately, what the report reveals is not so much an ideological divide that separates the US and Europe, but one that slices through both continents.Both sides of the Atlantic have certain concerns in common, argues Victor Mallet, a Paris-based journalist and author of a forthcoming book, Far Right France: Le Pen, Bardella and the Future of Europe.\"Concerns about immigration, concerns about the economy… and there's an extraordinary cultural gulf between supporters of people like Donald Trump, the National Rally in France, the AfD in Germany, and the intellectual, metropolitan, educated liberal elite.\"It's definitely a popular revolt against the establishment.\"He believes that one of the problems is inequality. \"America has, on average, the richest group of consumers the world has ever seen and yet many ordinary Americans find it hard to make ends meet and the same applies in Western Europe.\"More from InDepthIn the NSS, the US commits to scrapping certain practices, such as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, that are derided by many in Trump's base.In this document, the culture wars that shape America's bitter public discourse now to a degree also shape its in foreign policy, and - by extension, affect the security of the Western world.Russia is not mentioned as a hostile power, despite its invasion of Ukraine, a Western ally. For in the culture wars, some in Trump's Maga base see in Vladimir Putin not a foe but a natural ally in the defence of white, Christian nationalist civilisation: a man who proudly defends his country, its traditions and identity - the very attributes, after all, that they value and admire in Donald Trump.Update: This article was updated to remove an incorrect reference to President George HW Bush having handed over the Panama Canal.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

As it attempts to drive off, one of the agents points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. \nWith the Trump administration characterising the incident as “domestic terrorism”, alleging Renee Good had “harassed” officers all day prior to the shooting, the mayor of Minneapolis has labelled this account “bullshit” and called on immigration officers to get out of the city. The governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, is calling for a full investigation but says a fair outcome will be difficult because \"people in positions of power\" - naming Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem - have \"already passed judgement\". Walz says they've shared information that he says is \"verifiably false\" and \"inaccurate\" and made assumptions about Renee Good's character and actions ahead of the shooting.\nIn today’s episode, Justin, Sarah and Marianna discuss the reasons why Americans can’t agree on what happened in the videos posted to social media, and reflect on whether the shooting has the capacity to lead to a larger protest movement across the nation. And, as recent polling suggests more Americans are growing dissatisfied with some of the tactics used by ICE, we ask what it would take to change Donald Trump’s mind on his flagship deportations policy.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "7 hours agoJaroslav LukivEPA/ShutterstockJacques and Jessica Moretti, French owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, were questioned by Swiss prosecutorsOne of the two co-owners of the Swiss bar where 40 people died in a fire on New Year's Eve has been detained.Swiss prosecutors said Jacques Moretti, a French national, was a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.The blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana left 116 people injured. Many of the victims were aged under 20. The fire is believed to have been started by sparklers in champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations.It emerged this week that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years.Watch: Co-owner of Swiss ski bar apologises to victimsThe decision to detain Jacques Moretti came after he and his wife, Jessica, who own the bar together, were on Friday questioned by prosecutors in Sion, a town in the canton of Valais.Under Swiss law, the subject of an investigation is kept in custody until a court decision is made within 48 hours. The couple had been earlier placed under criminal investigation.On Friday, Jessica Moretti told reporters: \"My constant thoughts go to the victims and those who are fighting today.\"This was an unthinkable tragedy and never could we have imagined this. It happened in our bar and I want to say I'm sorry,\" she added as she walked through the streets of Sion surrounded by police.The co-owners had earlier said they were \"devastated\", pledging \"full co-operation\" with the ongoing investigation.The prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar.EPA/ShutterstockPeople across Switzerland observed a minute's silence on FridayOn Friday, Switzerland staged a minute's silence on a national day of mourning for the victims of the fire. Church bells then rang across the country for five minutes.Trains and trams came to a halt and Zurich airport briefly paused operations.At a local commemoration staged in Crans-Montana, there was a standing ovation for firefighters.The news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims.Romain Jordan, who represents some of the families, said earlier this week the \"staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency\".Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said on Tuesday he could not explain why this had not been done for so long at that bar.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries.The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place.",

    "body": "Man jailed for making woman have sex with strangers12 hours agoClare Wordenat Norwich Crown CourtNorfolk PoliceProsecutors said more than 100 men were involved in the abuse which was photographed and filmed by Rodney JohnstonA man who coerced a woman into having sex with more than 100 strangers over three decades has been jailed for a minimum term of 16 years. Rodney Johnston threatened the woman if she did not comply with his demands to engage in a range of sex acts with men at secluded countryside locations as well as in cars and in hotels, the court has heard.The 67-year-old, from Starston in Norfolk, was found guilty after a trial in September, which also heard he photographed and filmed the abuse.Sentencing him to life in prison at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Alice Robinson said the victim's impact statement was \"harrowing\" and showed \"the severe and lifelong impact\" of the abuse. Police found some 30,000 images and videos documenting the abuse.The court heard the coercion involved physical and verbal threats.'Rape in all but name'The judge said the victim was forced to \"go out\" several times a week. \"Going out became a byword for her being raped by strangers. This is rape in all but name,\" said the judge.Robinson said she believed Johnston would remain a danger to the victim for the rest of his life.  In a police statement released after sentencing, the woman said she had been left feeling \"used\" and \"terrified\" by the abuse. She said: \"I had no voice, no choice.\"I feel anxious about the future, but for the first time in decades I am free.\"Johnston was found guilty of multiple offences dating between 1994 and 2024, including:three counts of procuring a woman to have sexual intercourse by threats or intimidationtwo counts of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consentone count of intimidation of a witnessThroughout the seven-week trial, Johnston denied all the charges and claimed the acts were consensual.However, police said evidence proved the woman's account that she was not a willing participant and had been coerced and exploited.He made connections through adult social networks and sent out bulk text messages to advertise times and places where men could have sex with the woman.Norfolk Police said he claimed many of these messages were him living out \"a fantasy\" and dismissed them as \"banter\".However, thousands of other messages and images, including messages the victim sent to a friend detailing the abuse, supported her account, detectives said.In a statement, the victim said Johnston \"took her out\" up to five nights a week to hotels or outdoor locations, despite insisting she did not want to go.She said she was disgusted afterwards and was threatened or punished if Johnston felt she was not being co-operative.'Disturbing abuse'Police said Johnston caused further distress to his victim when he broke the conditions of his bail, following his arrest in July 2024.Senior investigating officer Duncan Woodhams said the sentence was \"the result of painstaking work due to the sheer volume of evidence involved, and of course the courage of the victim telling us about what she endured\". \"We're grateful for her trust in us, allowing us to present the full scale of Johnston's prolonged, disturbing and truly awful abuse,\" he said.\"Our focus will now shift to establishing if any further offences have been committed and if so we'll conduct a thorough investigation to identify those responsible and do everything we can to bring them to justice.\" If you have been affected by this story or would like support then you can find organisations which offer help and information at the BBC Action Line.Related internet links",

    "body": "9 hours agoJiyar GolBBC News PersianTehran has witnessed its largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, as protests swept through dozens of districts across the capital and its wider metropolitan area of nearly 16 million people. For several hours there on Thursday night, security forces appeared unusually restrained. In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back.That restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story.According to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago. BBC Persian's verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic \"will not back down in the face of vandals\". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage. Referring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings \"just to please the president of the United States\".Following the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran's leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran's nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. It is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation.President Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime's calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed.In a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would \"get hit very hard\" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to \"stampedes\", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been \"told very strongly\" where the red lines lay.It is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime's response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city.Outside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal.During the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests.Historically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes. In more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force.Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as \"legitimate protests,\" but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency. The current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.",

    "body": "1 hour agoA number of the papers have splashed on the ongoing demonstrations across Iran, which began two weeks ago in response to the nation's economic woes. \"Regime teeters in Tehran\" reads the headline of the Times, leading on remarks from US President Donald Trump, after he told Fox News that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was \"looking to flee the country\".The Guardian says that Iran is preparing for \"violent clashes\" as tensions continue to escalate, pairing its leading story with a photo of a protester gesticulating in front of a burning building in Tehran. Khamenei has warned that authorities will \"not back down\", which the paper says could set the stage for an \"intensified violent crackdown\" on the second day of a national internet shutdown.\"Tehran hardens crackdown on protesters 'working for Trump'\" reads the weekend edition of the Financial Times. Iranian officials have said that protesters will receive the maximum punishment, with diplomats concerned that the \"cover of the internet blackout\" could be used to suppress the demonstrations. The paper says that the protests \"present the biggest domestic threat to the regime in several years\". The Duke of Sussex will ask King Charles III to open the Invictus Games in Birmingham next year, according to the Sun. Founded by Prince Harry in 2014, the games sees injured military personnel and veterans from around the world compete in a range of sports every two years. A source told the paper that the 2027 iteration of the event would be a brilliant chance for the pair to \"come together\".Catherine, Princess of Wales, is pictured in the English countryside on the front page of the Mirror, after she released a new video to mark her 44th birthday. In the footage, the princess said she was \"deeply grateful\" for the healing power of Mother Nature, as she reflected on \"what it means to be alive\".\"Kate's 'deeply grateful' for nature's healing power\" reads the Express, pointing towards Catherine's ongoing \"cancer recovery\".The shadow secretary of state for justice, Robert Jenrick, has penned a piece for the Saturday edition of the Telegraph, declaring that police are \"giving in to Islamists because it is too challenging to confront them\". His remarks come as the Labour government prepares a new official definition of Islamophobia, which free speech campaigners claim could prevent legitimate criticism of the religion.The i Weekend says that the Home Office is set to start evicting asylum seekers from hotels, ahead of new legislation planned for the spring.The Mail suggests that thousands of Britons have been prescribed \"super-strength cannabis\" as a treatment for anxiety and depression. The paper found that specialist pharmacies had referred patients to \"almost 10,000 different products\" via a \"shocking loophole\".\"Loot Littler\" announces the Star, after darts champion Luke Littler, 18, signed a historic sponsorship deal worth a reported £20m.

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterThe government is refusing to deny reports that plans to make Britain's armed forces \"war ready\" will require billions more than it has allocated so far.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes it will require an extra £28bn over the next four years to meet its forecast costs, according to The Times and The Sun. The department's investment plan has been delayed, with Sir Keir Starmer reportedly ordering a rewrite of the proposals.The plan was initially supposed to have been completed in autumn last year, but could now not emerge until the spring. The document is due to set out how new equipment and defence infrastructure will be funded over the coming decade, following a wide-ranging review of Britain's capabilities published in June last year.The review pledged billions in extra spending for extra ammunition, next-generation fast jets, drones, and new attack submarines, as ministers pledged to move the UK to \"war-fighting readiness\".According to the reports, the projected £28bn shortfall was made by MoD officials in an internal assessment conducted last year.Sir Richard Knighton, the chief of the defence staff, delivered the forecast to Sir Keir and Chancellor Rachel Reeves in the run-up to Christmas at a meeting in Downing Street, it is reported.The prime minister's spokesman said he would not discuss \"specific meetings,\" but acknowledged that the armed forces were facing additional demands, including a potential deployment to Ukraine to police any deal to end its war with Russia.Asked several times if he could deny there was a £28bn spending gap, he said he could only reiterate the spending pledges already made by the government.The MoD's budget is due to rise by 3.6% in real terms by 2029, under departmental spending plans fixed last year.The increase was weighted towards the long-term investment budget, which pays for new military kit, rather then the day-to-day budget that covers things like administration costs and salaries.Labour has pledged to raise overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, estimated to cost an extra £6bn a year.It has then promised it will rise to 3.5% by 2035, in line with a pledge made by Nato countries at a summit last year.This is not the first time that there have been warnings about the MoD's ability to fund its spending commitments.The investment plan is meant to replace decade-long \"equipment plans\" released on a rolling yearly basis until 2022, when the department halted publication whilst it assessed the effect of \"extraordinary inflation\" on its plans.An analysis published by the department in December 2023, under the previous government, found that the MoD's most recent equipment plan was forecast to exceed its budget by £16.9bn.A report by MPs published the following year said the biggest cause of that shortfall came from spiralling costs from maintaining the UK's nuclear weapons system, alongside inflation.The delay to the investment plan has also delayed the release of a separate document detailing yet to be specified \"productivity savings\" within the department worth £6bn between now and 2029. An MoD spokesperson said it was working \"flat out\" to finish the investment plan, adding that Labour had inherited an \"underfunded defence programme\" from the previous government. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoLucy HookerandRachel Clun,business reportersThe EU has reached a free trade agreement with South American countries, 25 years after talks began and despite opposition from farmers in several European countries.The deal with the Mercosur trading bloc - which includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay - will require the approval of the European parliament within the next few monthsBrazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hailed it as a \"historic day for multilateralism\" after the four South American countries put the final touches to the deal in Brussels.It comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries around the world and his recent military intervention in Venezuela.The EU heralded what will be its largest free trade accord to date as a \"win-win\", although critics have argued that cheap imports may undercut European farmers in products including beef, poultry and sugar. \"In an international scenario of growing protectionism and unilateralism, the agreement is a signal in favour of international trade as a driver of economic growth, with benefits for both blocs,\" President Lula posted on X.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal will \"bring meaningful benefits to consumers and businesses, on both sides\".Farmers in several countries in Europe held last-ditch protests against the deal, with marches and demonstrations using tractors in France and Belgium.\"There is a lot of pain,\" Judy Peeters, a representative for a Belgian young farmers' group, told AFP at a protest on a motorway south of Brussels. \"There is a lot of anger.\"Von der Leyen said the Commission had listened to the concerns of farmers, and had acted on them including through introducing \"robust safeguards\" to protect their livelihoods in the agreement.As well as boosting trade and political ties, the European Commission said the deal would help fight climate change, through commitments to halt deforestation and ensure a \"reliable\" flow of raw materials, critical for the global green transition.The Commission expects the deal to save local companies €4bn ($4.7bn, £3.5bn) a year in export duties.South American countries boast deposits of gold, copper and some of the critical minerals required for renewable and battery technology.Cecilia Malmström, a former European commissioner for trade who led EU trade negotiations for five years, told World Business Express on BBC World Service that parts of the trade agreement could be suspended if Mercosur countries failed to stick to their commitments around environmental protection.\"[This agreement] is also a very strong geopolitical signal today to other powers who do not appreciate rule-based trade in the same way as we do,\" she said.On Friday afternoon a broad majority of EU member states confirmed their support for the free trade agreement, but it will still require approval from the European Parliament before it can take effect.Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief Euro-zone economist for Capital Economics, said voting was expected to be close in the parliament.However, he said the larger issue was how much of an impact the deal would have, and pointed to the Commission's own estimate that it would raise EU economic output by just 0.05%.\"The bigger point though is that even if the agreement is eventually implemented, it will be macroeconomically insignificant,\" he said.\"And because it will be phased in over 15 years, these benefits won't arrive until 2040 at the earliest.\"",

    "body": "'Unprecedented' numbers seeking debt help post-Christmas, say charities57 minutes agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesDebt charities say they are receiving an influx of calls as people worry their financial situation has slipped towards becoming unmanageable.The first weeks of January are usually the busiest time of year for helplines following a particularly expensive period.Advice charity StepChange said Monday was busier than any single day last year, and credit counselling service Money Wellness said a fifth of those accessing its services at the turn of the year did so between 22:00 and 03:00.Dave Murphy is working his way out of debt and said demands from creditors could have become overwhelming, but he urged anyone struggling to ensure they asked for help - for their financial and mental wellbeing.Money Wellness, which runs free debt and money advice services, said thousands of people had accessed its services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Expanded assistance online allows people to increasingly find information outside of normal hours - including overnight.Sebrina McCullough, its head of advice, said: \"The numbers we're seeing over Christmas and New Year are unprecedented.\"People often feel pressure to celebrate the holidays, even when money is tight, and our data shows many are turning to us late at night when they feel most anxious.\"Pressure of priority billsStepChange's website had 3,958 visitors on Christmas Day, and 15,401 on New Year's Eve and 1 January combined.Many may have simply been exploring their options, but calls came in thick and fast at the start of the month. While not at the level of the energy crisis of a few years ago, call numbers were notably up on last year.The Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said the first working days of January had seen more calls than last year.Monday was the busiest single day in its history, when 1,365 calls came in.Concerns are particularly acute for those struggling to pay priority bills such as council tax and rent.The colder weather could also place extra strain on vulnerable households, with £4.4bn already owed to energy suppliers following a period of high prices, although the government's cold weather payments have been triggered in many areas.Charities are urging anyone whose debt has become unmanageable to seek help as soon as possible, rather than making matters worse by ignoring the situation.That is a view shared by Dave, who has managed to work his way out of difficulty. A few years ago, he found his previously manageable credit card debt becoming a problem when he was unexpectedly made redundant at the same time as going through a divorce.Dave has turned his finances around after receiving help from StepChange\"They were two quite dramatic things in six months,\" said Dave, who has previously spoken to the BBC about his debt issues.\"The debt was around £20,000 to £25,000 at its height. It became so overwhelming. You feel that you are letting creditors down because you want to do what they ask of you - but you are scared, you are renting, and at times you struggle to get through each day.\"Once you are in a spiral, it is really hard to get out of it.\"He is now working in insurance, his debts are manageable and being paid off, and he said he wanted to help others \"to show that you can get through these things\".Figures published earlier in the week by the Bank of England fuelled concerns that everyday costs were becoming harder for some households to manage without turning to borrowing.The data showed that credit card borrowing grew at the fastest annual rate in nearly two years in the run-up to Christmas.The annual growth rate for credit card borrowing increased to 12.1% in November, from 10.9% the previous month - the highest figure since January 2024 when it was 12.5%.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJames W KellyLondonHeinekenHeineken's campaign is TfL's latest commercial Tube rebranding dealThe commercial rebranding of a London Underground line may cause \"unnecessary confusion\" for some passengers, a disability rights charity has said.Signage along central London Bakerloo line stations are being rebranded as \"Bakerl0.0\" and \"Waterl0.0\" as part of an advertising campaign by Heineken to promote its zero alcohol products.Emma Vogelmann from Transport for All said getting around London with confidence and ease depended on having \"consistent, recognisable information across the Tube network\".Transport for London (TfL) said advertising campaigns provide additional funding and are \"fully assessed to ensure they do not impact services, staff or customers\".HeinekenThe Dutch beer brand said it was partnering with TfL to help \"keep Londoners' social lives on track\" during what will be a alcohol-free \"dry January\" for many. While Heineken's rebranding is more subtle than some previous campaigns - including Burberry's 2024 renaming of Old Street and Bond Street stations - Ms Voglemann said name and navigation signs should not be altered as part of advertising as it creates unnecessary confusion.She added: \"For many people – including those with visual impairments, learning disabilities, neurodivergent people, or people who experience fatigue or brain fog - these campaigns can turn a routine journey into a stressful or unsafe one.\"She said accessibility wasn't optional, and that there was plenty of advertising space on the Tube network \"without undermining essential information\".Transport for All branded the Bond Street renaming as a \"thoughtless PR stunt\" at the timeEmma Strain from TfL said the organisation was \"always keen to work with brands to create new experiences\" for the millions of people who travel on the network.She added that the funding raised through advertising deals was invested into London's transport network to provide further improvements.Burberry's temporary name change of the two stations netted TfL £500,000.

    "body": "7 hours agoJonny HumphriesNorth WestPA MediaCarter said she was targeted with racist abuse during the UEFA Women's EurosA 60-year-old man has admitted sending abusive social media messages to England footballer Jess Carter.Nigel Dewale sent the posts to Carter's TikTok account during the Uefa Women's Euro 2025 tournament last summer, which defending champions the Lionesses went on to win. The messages included a derogatory reference to Carter's race and suggested people with brown skin were \"murderers\" and \"groomers\". Dewale, of Great Harwood in Lancashire, appeared at Blackburn Magistrates' Court on Friday where he pleaded guilty to sending a malicious message via a public communications network between 19 and 23 June last year. He also pleaded guilty to possession of an offensive weapon, namely an extendable baton, in a private place in February.Magistrates adjourned the case until 25 March for pre-sentence reports and warned Dewale, of Prospect Street, that all sentencing options were open including prison.'Totally abhorrent'Dewale was granted unconditional bail. Central defender Carter plays her club football for American side Gotham FC in the National Women's Soccer League, having previously represented Chelsea and Birmingham City in the UK.The 28-year-old, from Warwick, previously said she was stepping away from social media after she was subjected to racist abuse online during the tournament.Lancashire Police said the UK Football Policing Unit launched an investigation in July and traced the messages to Dewale, who was arrested in August.Mark Roberts, Chief Constable for Cheshire Police and the national lead for football policing, said: \"Dewale's comments were totally abhorrent, they caused emotional distress for Miss Carter and her family and I welcome the guilty plea entered today.\"We have been clear that hate crime online or in person, is not acceptable and as we have shown in this case, you cannot hide behind a social media profile to post vile comments and spread hate.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram, and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.More on this story",

    "body": "19 minutes agoMallory MoenchOffice of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA (West Asia News Agency)Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (seen in a file photo) called protesters \"troublemakers\" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers\" and \"a bunch of vandals\" just trying \"to please the president of the US\".He accused crowds of destroying buildings because Donald Trump said he \"supports you\". Trump later told reporters at the White House that Iran was \"in big trouble\".The protests, in their 13th day, erupted over the economy and have grown into the largest in years - leading to calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and some urging the restoration of the monarchy.At least 48 protesters and 14 security personnel have been killed, according to human rights groups. An internet blackout is in place.\"We will be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was watching the situation in Iran carefully and that any US involvement does not mean \"boots on the ground\".\"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,\" he said. These remarks echo ones the US president made about the Iranian government on Thursday, where he pledged to \"hit them very hard\" if they \"start killing people\". Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday.\"Let everyone know that the Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this,\" the 86-year-old said.Since protests began on 28 December, in addition to the 48 protesters killed, more than 2,277 individuals have also been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) said.The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed.BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran.In a joint statement, the leaders of the UK, Germany and France said they were \"deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces, and strongly condemn the killing of protesters\".\"The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal,\" French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the United Nations was very disturbed by the loss of life. \"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said.Meanwhile the Iranian security and judicial authorities issued a series of coordinated warnings, hardening their rhetoric and echoing an earlier message of \"no leniency\" by Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).Iran's National Security Council - responsible for domestic security and not to be confused with the SNSC - said \"decisive and necessary legal action will be taken\" against protesters, which it described as \"armed vandals\" and \"disruptors of peace and security\".In a brief statement, it warned against \"any form of attack on military, law-enforcement, or governmental facilities\". The intelligence arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it would not tolerate what it described as \"terrorist acts\", asserting that it would continue its operations \"until the complete defeat of the enemy's plan\".Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah who was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution, called on Trump on Friday to \"be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran\". Pahlavi, who lives close to Washington DC, had urged protesters to take to the streets on Thursday and Friday.Watch: Protesters take to the streets of Tehran on Friday nightProtests have taken place across the country, with BBC Verify verifying videos from 67 locations.On Friday, protesters amassed after weekly prayers in the south-eastern city of Zahedan, videos verified by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show. In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting \"death to the dictator\", referencing Khamenei.In another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard.Another verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured.Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout.The country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, with minor amounts of traffic returning on Friday, internet monitoring groups Cloudfare and Netblocks said. That means less information is emerging from Iran.IHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that \"the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious\".Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible \"massacre\" during the internet shutdown.One person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran. He reported a run on supermarkets by residents trying to stock up on food and other essentials, expecting worse days to come.Watch: Why are there huge protests going on in Iran?The shutdown of the internet has meant that cash machines are not working, and there is no way to pay for purchases in shops where debit cards cannot be used due to the lack of internet.Mahsa Alimardani, who works for the human rights NGO Witness, told the BBC in London that she had not been able to make contact with her family since Thursday evening.\"It's very anxiety-inducing, not having access to information, not knowing if your loved ones participated [in the protests] or if they're okay,\" she said.The protests began nearly two weeks ago with shopkeepers in Tehran angry about the collapsing currency, before spreading to students and street demonstrations.The last major protests were in 2022, when demonstrations erupted after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.Additional reporting by Reha Kansara, Kasra Naji and Soroush Negahdari",

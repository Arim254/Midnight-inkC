Trump attacks the Supreme Court over tariff banAmericastAvailable for over a yearDonald Trump has called the Supreme Court’s ruling blocking many of his sweeping tariffs ‘deeply disappointing’ and has announced a new 10 per cent tariff on global imports.\nJustin, Sarah and Anthony jumped into action following the President’s press conference to unpack the day’s drama: starting with the US Supreme Court decision to block global tariffs and ending with the President’s withering attack on some of the justices for their decision. \nThe president spoke a few hours after the US Supreme court struck down the legal justification for a large portion of Trump's sweeping global tariffs in a major blow to the president's economic agenda.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Miranda Slade, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "1 hour agoOlivia IrelandPeter Mandelson led away by police following arrest from Camden homeLord Mandelson has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.The Metropolitan Police said a 72-year-old man was arrested at an address in Camden, north London, on Monday and taken to a police station for interview.The arrest follows search warrants at two addresses in the Wiltshire and Camden, a police statement added.The force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a government minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Lord Mandelson has not publicly commented in recent weeks on the Epstein files, but the BBC understands his position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The government has said it expects to release the first documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment in \"early March\".On Monday afternoon, he was seen being led away from his London home by plain clothes officers who put him in the back of an unmarked car.The BBC understands his arrest was carried out by officers from the Met's central specialist crime division. Consultations between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.An email from 2009 appears to show that Lord Mandelson passed on an assessment by an adviser to the then prime minister Gordon Brown about policy measures, including an \"asset sales plan\". He also appeared to discuss a tax on bankers' bonuses and confirm an imminent bailout package for the Euro on the day before it was announced in 2010.Responding to Lord Mandelson's arrest, the family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor of sexual abuse, said they \"commend the British authorities for taking meaningful action and treating the Epstein files with the urgency they demand\". Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.In a statement, Sky and Amanda Roberts said: \"The contrast with the continued inaction in the United States is undeniable. Survivors deserve transparency, swift investigation, and real justice, no matter who is implicated.\"BBC News understands the government will continue talking to police about which documents can be released, after it was previously suggested an arrest could have implications for that process.The government still wants to be able to publish documents, which it hopes will back up Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Lord Mandelson had \"lied\" during his vetting process.Darren Jones, chief secretary to the prime minister, told MPs on Monday that records detailing follow-up questions posed by No 10 during the initial due diligence process for the appointment would not feature in the first tranche of published material, due to the \"interest in this document\" from the Met Police. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Lord Mandelson's arrest was \"the defining moment of Sir Keir's premiership\".Badenoch, who said the prime minister was \"weak\", added: \"Watching the man who he appointed to the highest position in our diplomatic service getting arrested by police is an image which I think is going to stay with us for many, many years to come.\"Pool/BBC NewsLord Peter Mandelson being escorted by a police officer outside his homeLord Mandelson has been urged by US politicians to answer questions as part of a Congress investigation into Epstein.He began working for Labour in the 1980s, playing a key role in the New Labour movement and Sir Tony Blair's landslide election victory in 1997.",

The Metropolitan Police said it had been called by London Ambulance Service to reports of an unconscious man on Lincoln Plaza, Canary Wharf in east London, on Wednesday, at 12:38 GMT.He was pronounced dead at the scene and his death is currently being treated as \"unexplained\", the force said. On Friday, a 43-year-old man, and a woman, 52, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were released on bail pending further investigation, police added.A Met spokesperson said his death was currently being treated as unexplained, and an investigation to establish the full circumstances was ongoing.  The spokesperson added officers were \"reviewing information that suggests the victim may have been undergoing a cosmetic procedure prior to his death\" and were waiting for the results of a post-mortem examination, which would be held in due course. In October, a BBC investigation reported that Parke had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after a woman died following a non-surgical BBL procedure. He had not been charged. The investigation also found he had been illegally selling prescription-only weight-loss injections online.",

    "body": "Australian police find human remains in search for grandfather kidnapped by mistake13 minutes agoLana LamSydneyNSW PolicePolice say Chris Baghsarian, 85, was kidnapped by mistake Australian police have found human remains in their search for a Sydney grandfather who they believe was kidnapped by mistake almost two weeks ago.Widower Chris Baghsarian, 85, was forcibly taken from his home in North Ryde just before dawn on 13 February, with CCTV showing a group of masked men bundling him into an SUV.Police say the incident was most likely a case of mistaken identity, and local media have reported the intended target was a relative of a man with links to a well-known organised crime family.On Tuesday, police confirmed they had found human remains near a golf course on the outskirts of Sydney, after an earlier search located a burnt out car.Police had found a blood-stained carpet in the boot of the car, which was linked to the alleged kidnappers and an abandoned property where it is believed Baghsarian was held hostage.In the days after the kidnapping, video circulating in Sydney's underworld purported to show the elderly man had been seriously injured.Police repeatedly appealed to the kidnappers for the man's safe return, saying he suffered from health issues and needed daily medication.\"They were intending to take somebody, but have taken the wrong person,\" Det Acting Supt Andrew Marks told reporters a few days after the kidnapping.\"The family are in distress. All they want is their father to be returned, their grandfather to be returned.\"New South Wales Premier Chris Minns had suggested the kidnappers could \"drop Mr Baghsarian off at a shopping centre or an emergency department or even a nursing home\".Cases of mistaken identity have become more common in Sydney's underworld, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, as large organised crime networks increasingly subcontract crimes.Last year, a 23-year-old plumber was shot dead in his driveway in Condell Park in what police believe was also a case of mistaken identity.\"The fact that these offenders – these kidnappers – have got it so wrong is concerning,\" Marks said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoIan AikmanPA MediaThe two women met for tea at Clarence House on MondayQueen Camilla has told French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot that she was left speechless by her new memoir, which she says she finished reading in just two days.The Queen invited Pelicot to her official residence in London, where the 73-year-old had been promoting her new book, Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides.Pelicot became a global figurehead of strength and feminism after waiving her right to anonymity and confronting dozens of the men who had raped her.\"I've met so many survivors of rape and sexual abuse,\" the Queen told Pelicot on Monday. \"I never thought I could be shocked by anything anymore, but I was shocked at your case - it left me speechless.\"The two women sat down for tea together at Clarence House, where Pelicot was joined by her partner, Jean-Loup Agopian, and her literary and legal team.The Queen first spoke to her guests in French, joking she had \"forgotten\" the language after studying it \"60 years ago\". Afterwards, she spoke through an interpreter.Pelicot said she had received \"incredible strength\" from the public after coming forward with her story. \"You have so much support,\" the Queen said in response.The meeting came after Pelicot launched her book at a sold-out event at London's Royal Festival Hall on Friday. It featured readings from Hollywood actresses Kate Winslet, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliet Stevenson.Last year, Queen Camilla sent Pelicot a letter praising her \"extraordinary dignity and courage\". In the letter, the Queen said Pelicot had \"inspired women across the globe\" and \"created a powerful legacy that will change the narrative around shame, forever\".Pelicot said the letter, which left her \"overwhelmed\", was now framed in her office.PA MediaThe Queen joked about her French language skills with Pelicot and her partner, Jean-Loup Agopian.The harrowing details of Pelicot's ordeal shocked the world in 2024.A court heard how for many years she had been drugged unconscious by her then-husband Dominique and raped by dozens of men he had recruited online. After a 16-week public trial, 46 men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two of sexual assault. Dominique Pelicot was handed the maximum jail sentence of 20 years.Millions were moved by Gisèle Pelicot's presence at the trial, and she received an outpouring of support in France and beyond.She said it was time to make \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist - a message that resonated with many, including the groups of women that gathered in support outside court every day, carrying signs demanding justice.ReutersFor most of the meeting, the pair spoke through an interpreter.She also recalled the moment she decided to waive her legal right to anonymity - a decision she says she has never regretted.",

    "body": "Landmark royal commission into antisemitism prompted by Bondi shooting begins1 hour agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesThe federal royal commission will look at antisemitism and its drivers in AustraliaAustralia's royal commission into antisemitism, prompted after the Bondi Beach shootings that killed 15 people and injured 40, has begun public hearings.The federal commission - the country's most powerful form of public inquiry - will investigate the prevalence and key drivers of antisemitism and make recommendations to government.Headed by former High Court Justice Virginia Bell, the inquiry - which started on Tuesday - will also examine the events leading up to the attack, which was Australia's worst mass shooting in decades.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had resisted calls for a federal inquiry, saying it would hinder social cohesion but later bowed to public pressure.\"I acknowledge the importance of addressing antisemitism within the Australian community,\" Bell said in a statement last week. \"I plan to conduct the inquiry as expeditiously as possible.\"The commissioner is expected to hand down an interim report by the end of April, and a full report no later than the first anniversary of the attack, which took place on 14 December last year.She will outline the parameters of the inquiry on Tuesday before a brief opening statement from the counsel assisting the inquiry.The probe is expected to later hear from security agencies and intelligence services, as well as families of victims and survivors of the attack.One of the gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene of the shootings. His son Naveed Akram - the other alleged attacker - was critically injured and later transferred from hospital to prison.The 24-year-old appeared in court last week for the first time, facing 59 charges, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.In light of the ongoing criminal case, the royal commission has been instructed to avoid matters that might prejudice current and future court proceedings. This may mean some hearings are conducted behind closed doors. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Albanese announced a review by a former spy chief to look at what federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the lead-up to the attack and what improvements could be made.He said that review, alongside a royal commission called by the state of New South Wales, would be the best way to respond to the attacks and that a federal inquiry would give a platform to antisemitic hate speech.However Albanese was forced to reverse his decision amid continued calls by prominent Jewish leaders and a number of the families affected - which were echoed by the opposition leader at the time.As a result, the the review into federal law enforcement and agencies will be folded into the royal commission and the NSW inquiry was cancelled.The shootings also prompted a raft of new gun laws and crackdown on hate speech, as well as greater powers to limit protests.The commission comes amid an already fraught debate raging in Australia over Israel, Gaza and antisemitism.Earlier this month, a rally against a visit by Israeli president Isaac Herzog was marred by violent scuffles between police and protestors. Herzog had been invited by Albanese as a comfort to the families affected by the Bondi attack, but his visit was opposed by thousands of Australians over his government's actions in Gaza.",

Vonn said her leg was \"in pieces\" and that she had compartment syndrome, a pressure inside a muscle, which restricts blood flow - and that the surgeon performed a fasciotomy, an emergency operation, to relieve the pressure.\"Dr Tom Hackett saved my leg - he saved it from being amputated,\" she said.\"He cut open both sides of my leg, so it was open and let it breathe so to speak. He saved me.\"Vonn, who returned to the United States last week after four operations in Italy, said she has now left hospital and been moved to a hotel, describing it as a \"huge step\".She added that she will be in a wheelchair \"for a while\" because in addition to the broken leg, she has also broken her ankle.",

    "body": "19 minutes agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesGPs in England are to be paid £3,000 a year bonuses to prescribe patients weight loss drugs.The government is adding the incentive payments to the GP contract starting in April.GPs will also get extra money – worth about £1,000 a year - for referring patients on to weight loss programmes.Ministers said it was important that patients who could benefit from weight loss support were able to access it.But obesity experts warned the scheme would have limited impact because the drugs were still being tightly-restricted on the NHS – and this move would do nothing to widen eligibility.The incentive payments will only apply to Mounjaro.The other new generation weight loss drug available on the NHS – Wegovy – is not prescribed by GPs but instead is given by specialist NHS weight loss services.More than 1 million people are estimated to be using weight loss drugs, given as injections, with nine in 10 paying for them privately.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Weight loss drugs can be a real game changer for those who need them. I'm determined that access should be based on need, not ability to pay.\"Outside the NHS, we've seen those who can spare the cash buying privately, and the proliferation of rogue prescribers peddling dangerous unlicensed drugs that are putting patients at risk.\"Investing in general practice will help bring this modern medicine to the many, not just the few, and help shift the focus of the NHS from treatment to prevention.\"Incentive payments are a normal part of the GP contract and in the past have been paid for a variety of other things to improve everything from dementia care to boosting vaccination rates and to prescribe statins to lower the risk of heart disease.This will be the first time weight loss drugs have been made part of the contract with the £3,000 available for prescribing the maximum number of eligible patients Mounjaro.The drug only started being prescribed by GPs during this financial year – and access has been restricted to those severely obese with both a BMI of over 40 and certain health conditions.Next year that will be widened to those with a BMI of over 35 with the expectation that by 2028, 220,000 patients will be on Mounjaro provided by the NHS. The eligibility thresholds are lower for certain ethnic groups.However, rollout so far has been reported to be patchy with not all GPs currently prescribing them as much as expected.Katharine Jenner, director of Obesity Health Alliance, said the incentives were a welcome step.But she added: \"This doesn't mean weight loss drugs will suddenly be available to everyone who wants them.\"NHS access will remain very limited and focused on those with the greatest clinical need, and these treatments are most effective when combined with sustained support.\"And she added: \"If we're serious about moving from sickness to prevention, expanded treatment must go alongside stronger action to improve the food environment and prevent obesity in the first place.\"Dr Katie Bramall, of the British Medical Association, said: \"While the headlines promise much, in reality there will be no change to NHS England's eligibility criteria for patients to access injectable weight‑loss medication on the NHS. \"These proposals will do nothing over the next year to address the divide between those able to pay and those left waiting unable to afford private self-funded treatments\"And Prof Victoria Tzortziou Brown, of the Royal College of GPs, added: \"GPs do not withhold treatment or prescribe based on financial incentives. Decisions are guided by clinical judgement and what is safest and most appropriate for individual patients.\"Widening the roll-out of these medications in general practice could end up increasing workload in a way that may not be sustainable and risk raising unrealistic expectations among patients who may not be eligible or for whom these medicines are not suitable.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoDominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent PA MediaThe man was wrongly released from HMP Wormwood Scrubs earlier this monthA suspected rapist awaiting trial has been mistakenly set free from prison and has left the country, the BBC has learnt.The man from London was on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs, charged with  multiple allegations of rape, sexual assault and violence against a woman.After a pre-trial hearing in early February, a court official wrongly told the prison the defendant could be set free on bail and he was later released, leaving the country soon afterwards.Details of the case emerged as a top judge called on the government to intervene to try to ensure the man returns to stand trial next Monday. The man, who is in his forties, cannot be named for legal reasons.\"We take this error extremely seriously,\" said Judge Martin Edmunds KC, the Recorder of Kensington and Chelsea, in a ruling.\"We will fully investigate how it occurred and what steps can be put in place to prevent it occurring again.\"Isleworth Crown Court heard the defendant, who denies all the charges against him, was remanded in custody after being charged with multiple counts of rape, and was originally due to stand trial in June this year.He appeared in court on 26 January for a hearing to consider whether his trial date should be brought forward to March.Following that hearing, HMP Wormwood Scrubs received a notice from the court stating the defendant had been granted bail.Two passportsOne of the charges he faces did not, on its own, merit remand in custody. But the prison had not been told by the court to continue to detain the man in relation to the more serious charges, including rape.The man was released from prison on 6 February and soon after left the UK for a European country on one of his two passports - the other was being held by the police.The BBC understands that both the man's lawyers and the police have been in contact with the suspect - but he has told them that he cannot return because of complications relating to him having two passports.The judge urged government officials to work out a \"clear, practical\" plan to bring the man back to the UK for trial.A further court hearing is due to take place on Tuesday to determine if the trial in March can take place and whether the defendant will be able to return to the UK.Official figures showed that in the year to March 2025, 262 inmates had been mistakenly let out - a 128% increase on the 115 in the previous 12 months.The government responded to the crisis with promises to improve systems in prisons that deal with releases.More stories like thisRelated internet links",

Set in more than 160 acres near Eyemouth, it is one of only two baronial buildings designed by architect James Gillespie Graham.The castle's history stretches back to a medieval tower house, and its interiors were once decorated by Edinburgh firm Bonnar and Carfrae.Their work had an unlikely brush with literary fame: during a visit in 1873, Mark Twain was so taken with the dining‑room mantelpiece at Ayton Castle that he purchased it. It now sits in the Mark Twain House and Museum in Connecticut.Stories you may have missedThe site also includes a rare 16th Century beehive-shaped dovecot and a private chapel.The previous owners, who bought the property in 2014, carried out substantial refurbishment.As part of that, they built a 600m (1,969 ft) narrow‑gauge railway that runs through part of the grounds, which visitors to the castle can pay to ride.",

He could face life in prison without parole or the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors allege that Reiner fatally stabbed his father and mother, Michele, inside a bedroom of their home before fleeing. Reiner, who is being held in custody, will next appear in court on 29 April.Rob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, were found dead in their home by their daughter on 14 December.The couple died from \"multiple sharp force injuries\", according to the LA County medical examiner. Nick Reiner was arrested in Los Angeles the same day. US outlets reported that he and his father had attended a party the previous evening, and engaged in an argument of some kind. Reports vary as to the severity of the alleged row.He faces two counts of first-degree murder, with a special circumstance alleging multiple murders.Rob Reiner directed films including This Is Spinal Tap, the Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally and Stand By Me.Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.Getty ImagesRob Reiner (left) pictured with his son Nick in 2016The couple's children, Jake and Romy, said in a statement after their deaths that they were experiencing \"unimaginable pain\" following the \"horrific and devastating loss\".Nick Reiner's arraignment, which was originally set for January, had been postponed after lawyer Alan Jackson withdrew from the case for reasons he said were beyond his and his clients control.His new lawyer, Kimberly Greene, entered the not guilty plea on his behalf on Monday.Reiner is receiving publicly funded legal representation that is allotted to defendants who cannot pay their own fees.",

Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

    "body": "3 hours ago\"An army of online conspiracy theorists\" pushed Julia Wandelt to believe she was the missing girl Madeleine McCann, according to the Daily Mail. The paper writes that \"a jury yesterday convicted her [Wandelt] of tormenting Kate and Gerry McCann in a campaign that began on the internet\", pushing Wandelt to claim she was their missing daughter after being abducted during a family holiday in 2007. DNA tests show Wandelt is not Madeleine.\"The parents of Madeleine McCann say the fantasist who pretended to be their missing daughter needs help,\" leads the Daily Mirror. Madeleine's family has shown Wandelt \"compassion\" after her conviction, the paper writes.The Financial Times leads with a $1.2tn (£0.9tn) \"AI sell-off\" among some of the biggest \"AI-related stocks\", including Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle. It also reports slippage among tech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, which are \"borrowing hundreds of billions to fund expansion in AI\". According to the paper, the mass sell-off is \"putting Wall Street on course for its worst week since [US President] Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs in April\".\"Disgraced Andrew Windsor is spending his last weeks at Royal Lodge 'ranting to himself'\", according to the Sun's top story, after the former prince lost his title and was ordered to leave the Royal Lodge. Quoting insiders, the paper also writes his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson \"pours out her heart to staff at a secret bar called The Doghouse\".Under the headline \"Trump goes to war on the BBC\", the Daily Telegraph quotes White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt commenting on a Panorama report on the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, which she said shows the BBC is a \"leftist propaganda machine\". Leavitt described the editing of a Trump speech in the report as \"further evidence that they [BBC] are total, 100 per cent fake news\". The BBC has said it is investigating issues raised about the programme.Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"will announce a stealth tax raid on retirement savings\" in the forthcoming Budget, writes the Times. The paper says she is expected to \"limit a tax break on pension contributions for both employers and employees to raise up to  £2 billion a year\". It cites \"concerns that it would penalise people for 'trying to do the right thing' and save for their retirement\". \"Labour MPs now plotting to oust Starmer,\" is the headline of the i Paper, writing on the group in \"despair about Labour poll ratings and the plan to break the manifesto by raising income tax in this month's Budget\". The Labour MPs met at a private bar at the House of Commons, according to the paper, to discuss the \"mechanics of a future coup\", while \"Cabinet ministers urge caution\".\"Guinness socialite Lady Mary Charteris has sparked a war on her posh street after turning her fancy home into a real life 'Barbie House',\" reports the Daily Star, after the DJ and model \"decided to paint her pad bright pink\".The Daily Express leads its weekend front page with a \"Christmas appeal to help 1,000 children waiting for vital wheelchairs\", urging readers to \"give the gift of freedom for every child\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "9 hours agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Manjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump says he will consider allowing Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban to buy Russian oil, in an exemption from sanctions aimed at helping to end the Ukraine war.Speaking on Friday during Orban's visit to the White House, Trump said an allowance might be made because \"it's very difficult for him [Orban] to get the oil and gas from other areas\". The comments come after the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies last month, threatening sanctions on those that buy from them.Following the meeting, Hungary's foreign minister wrote on X that the US had given Budapest \"a full and unlimited exemption from sanctions on oil and gas\". Trump added that while Hungary faced unique logistical challenges, including access to a sea that could be used to drill oil, he was \"very disturbed\" by other European countries that he said continued to buy Russian commodities despite not being landlocked.Orban, who is one of Trump's closest allies in Europe and who has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine, has defended his energy ties with Russia, saying on Friday that pipelines are neither \"ideological\" nor \"political\", but a \"physical reality\" due to the lack of ports.He has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.Trump and Orban also discussed the war in Ukraine on Friday - their first formal talks since Trump returned to power - including the possibility of holding talks with Putin.\"He [Orban] understands Putin and knows him very well... I think that Viktor feels we're going to get that war ended in the not-too-distant future\", Trump said.The Hungarian leader, meanwhile, said only their two nations truly wanted peace in Ukraine. \"All the other governments prefer to continue the war because many of them think that Ukraine can win on the front line, which is a misunderstanding of the situation.\"Trump asked him: \"So you would say that Ukraine cannot win that war?\" To which Orban replied: \"You know, a miracle can happen.\"Aside from the issue of oil and gas sanctions, Hungary's export-driven car industry has been hit by Trump's tariffs on European goods, adding to an already weak economy. Despite frequent clashes with EU leaders over migration, democracy, and the rule of law, Trump urged Europe to \"respect this leader very, very strongly because he's been right on immigration.\"with additional reporting by Nick Thorpe",

    "body": "Israel has received a coffin that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said contains the body of a hostage, Israel's military says.Hamas's armed wing said the body had been found on Friday in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The body has been transported to Israel via the Red Cross for identification.Before this handover, Hamas had returned all 20 living hostages and 22 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal that started on 10 October. Five of the six dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis and one was Thai.Israel has criticised Hamas for not yet returning all the bodies. Hamas says it is hard to find them under rubble.During the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has also handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel launched air strikes after accusing Hamas fighters of killing two of its soldiers on 19 October and of killing another soldier on 28 October. Hamas said it was unaware of clashes in the area of the first incident and had no connection to the second attack.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were abducted in the attack.At least 68,875 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Christal HayesGetty ImagesNobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside a British scientist, Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.But his reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made claims about genes causing a difference in average IQ between blacks and whites.The death of Watson was confirmed to the BBC by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades. Watson shared the Nobel in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery.\"We have discovered the secret of life,\" they said at the time. His later comments on race led to him saying that he felt ostracised by the scientific community. In 2007, the scientist, who once worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, told the Times newspaper that he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\", because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\".The comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. His additional comments in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led the lab to strip his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee.\"Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,\" the laboratory said in a statement.DNA was discovered in 1869 but it took until 1943 for scientists to discover that DNA made up the genetic material in cells. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery. Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure.Watch: James Watson and Francis Crick awarded Nobel Prize in 1962Watson sold his Nobel gold medal at auction for $4.8m (£3.6m) in 2014, saying he was letting go of the medal because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his remarks on race.A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.  There, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures.To pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures for DNA.Later, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom suffered from schizophrenia.In 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes.",

Its writer Daniel Welsh said: \"The glossy sheen of the show and its stacked cast might make you think it's verging on 'so bad it's good' territory, but it's really just a boring dud.\"Other critics include Alison Herman, writing in Variety that it is a \"clumsy, condescending take on rah-rah girlboss feminism\", while the Hollywood Reporter's Angie Han called Kardashian an \"appropriately wooden lead for Ryan Murphy's empty, unforgivably dull drama\".But undeterred, the reality star and businesswoman shared fan reactions including one who said they \"immediately pressed play\" after seeing a post saying the show had debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a paltry 0%.She also included a BBC News Instagram post quoting the Daily Telegraph's Ed Power, who wrote: \"Ryan Murphy is the high priest of tacky tasteless television, and this year he has outdone himself.\"Another fan said: \"Some of the worst acting I've ever seen in my life alongside the most predictable storylines and the most ridulous styling. I'm obsessed. I need 14 seasons.\"Kardashian ended her post with what is arguably the last laugh.She shared a screenshot from Disney Hulu, stating that the show is curently the most watched title on Disney+ around the world, ranking first in 28 countries including the US.",

    "body": "6 hours agoReutersThe Conservatives are calling for Sir Keir Starmer to face a standards probe over the appointment of Labour donor David Kogan as England's new football watchdog.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy was found to have \"unknowingly\" breached public appointment rules by not declaring Mr Kogan's donations to her 2020 Labour leadership campaign before picking him for the job.The Tories are arguing that the prime minister had \"exactly the same conflict of interest\" since Mr Kogan had also donated to the prime minister's Labour leadership campaign.Downing Street dismissed the calls, saying an extensive review by the Independent Commissioner for Public Appointments found no further breaches.Nandy announced Mr Kogan, a sports rights executive, as the government's preferred candidate to chair the football regulator in April.But she stepped back from the appointment process the following month, after he revealed to MPs that he had given \"very small sums\" to her 2020 Labour leadership campaign, as well as that of the now prime minister.In a report published on Thursday, the commissioner for public appointments, Sir William Shawcross, revealed Mr Kogan had made two donations of £1,450 each to Nandy's campaign, one personally and one through his company.They were part of total donations worth £33,410 to Labour and the party's candidates in the five years prior to his appointment, the commissioner said.The two donations to Nandy's campaign were below declaration thresholds set by the Electoral Commission and by Parliament.But Nandy should have checked if the sports agent had contributed before endorsing him, Sir William said, and taken \"any necessary consequential action\".\"The fact of the donations was capable of giving rise to a perceived conflict of interest in the appointment process,\" he added.Nandy apologised on Thursday, telling the prime minister in a letter: \"I deeply regret this error. I appreciate the perception it could create\".Sir Keir has stood by his culture secretary, telling her in reply that she had \"acted in good faith\", and he \"noted the commissioner's findings that the error was unknowing\". 'Final approval'The commissioner did not specify how much money Mr Kogan donated to Sir Keir's 2020 campaign. Electoral transparency records show he separately donated £2,500 to Sir Keir's local Labour branch in May last year.Nandy was the \"formal appointing authority\" for the regulator role, but it is listed by the government as one in which the prime minister has a \"strong interest\" According to Sir William's report, Mr Kogan's appointment was \"cleared\" by 10 Downing Street, having been sent for \"final approval\".The Conservatives have now asked Sir Laurie Magnus, Sir Keir's ethics adviser, to investigate whether the prime minister's role in Mr Kogan's appointment, and his verdict on Nandy's role, broke ministerial rules on transparency.In a letter to Sir Laurie, shadow Cabinet Office minster Alex Burghart wrote: \"If Ms Nandy recused herself from involvement in this appointment, shouldn't the prime minister have done the same?\"Isn't the prime minister complicit in exactly the same conflict of interest?\"Mr Kogan was longlisted for the role under the previous Conservative government but the process was paused after last year's general election was called, according to Sir William's report. The commissioner added that Mr Kogan initially withdrew his application in November last year, before eventually being re-selected for the role as an external candidate.In a statement on Thursday, Mr Kogan said: \"I have cooperated fully throughout the investigation and can now draw a line under the process.\"As the commissioner states, my suitability for the role has never been in question, and at no point was I aware of any deviation from best practice.\"It is now time to move on and get on with the business of setting up the IFR [Independent Football Regulator] so we can tackle the critical and urgent issues facing football.\" A Government spokesperson said: \"The Chair of the Football regulator was appointed by Ministers in the Department for Culture, Media, and Sports, as set out in the legislation.\"This was the case under the previous Government.\"The Independent Commissioner for Public Appointments reviewed the appointment process extensively and found no breaches aside from those set out in the report.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick Eardley,Political Correspondent and Sima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentPA MediaAt least four prisoners released in error are still at large, the BBC has been told.These are among 262 prisoners in England and Wales mistakenly released in the year to March - up from 115 the previous year.The new information comes as the government is under increasing pressure after a number of high-profile cases of prisoners being wrongly released.An Algerian sex offender who was mistakenly released from prison was arrested by police on Friday.Brahim Kaddour-Cherif was one of two men separately released by mistake from the prison in the same week. Both are now back in custody, after William Smith handed himself in on Thursday.Watch: Moment wrongly released prisoner Kaddour-Cherif is arrestedTheir releases came after migrant sex offender Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford in Essex late last month.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"The vast majority of offenders released by mistake are quickly brought back to prison, and we will do everything we can to work with the police to capture the few still in the community.\"But there has been widespread criticism of the government's handling of the issue.The unaccounted prisoners reveal \"the incompetence of this government\", shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said.\"It shouldn't be left to reporters to uncover the facts. [Justice Secretary] David Lammy must finally come clean about how many prisoners have been accidentally released and how many are still at large.\"A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said \"every resource\" must go into finding the prisoners. \"This is a disgrace and an omnishambles. It shouldn't have to take the media to inform the public that prisoners are at large after accidental release,\" Jess Brown-Fuller said.In a statement, Lammy said: \"We inherited a prison system in crisis and I'm appalled at the rate of releases in error this is causing.\"I'm determined to grip this problem, but there is a mountain to climb which cannot be done overnight.\"That is why I have ordered new tough release checks, commissioned an independent investigation into systemic failures, and begun overhauling archaic paper-based systems still used in some prisons.\"The revelation that four prisoners are still at large after being wrongly released came just hours after Kaddour-Cherif was arrested.The Algerian national was spotted by a member of the public in the Finsbury Park area of London just on Friday morning.He was convicted of indecent exposure in November 2024, relating to an incident in March of that year.He was given an 18-month community order and placed on the sex offenders' register for five years.He had been let out of HMP Wandsworth in south London on 29 October, though police said they were not told until Tuesday.Kaddour-Cherif is understood to have entered the UK legally on a visitor's visa in 2019, but overstayed that and was in the initial stages of the deportation process.He was released the day after being found not guilty of breaching the sex offenders' register's requirements - but he was still facing other charges and should have remained in custody.The prison officers' representatives said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold him, and he was let go.It followed a series of prosecutions and court appearances dating back two years.William Smith, the second man released from HMP Wandsworth in the past week, handed himself back in on Thursday. He had been let go on Monday having been sentenced to prison earlier that day.Prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years. The population has continued to balloon, with the number of staff not keeping pace with the number of inmates.Only a hundred or so places were available in male prisons last summer. This triggered the government's emergency release scheme - where some inmates would be freed after serving 40% of their fixed term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. It was implemented to reduce overcrowding and already almost 40,000 inmates have been let out under the scheme.But this has also had repercussions on the number of mistaken releases.The government has pledged to build more prisons to ease overcrowding, with projections showing the prison population will continue to grow but this will take time.Additional reporting by George Wright",

    "body": "15 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,Nairobi and Mayeni Jones,PretoriaExplosions have been heard near the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said it would agree to a humanitarian ceasefire.Residents in Khartoum, which is controlled by the army, told the AFP news agency that they were woken overnight by the sound of drones and explosions.The blasts appeared to take place near a military base and a power station in the early hours of Friday morning, the residents said.The RSF has not addressed these accounts, but Sudan's military-led government said it would be wary of agreeing to a truce as the group did not \"respect\" ceasefires.The two sides have been embroiled in a civil war that has killed at least 150,000 people and forced 12 million others from their homes since it erupted in April 2023.This week a UN-backed global hunger monitor confirmed that famine conditions were spreading in conflict zones.On Friday, drones were heard not only in Khartoum, but also 300km (186 miles) north of the city, in the military-controlled town of Atbara.\"Anti-aircraft defences shot them down, but I saw fires breaking out and heard sounds of explosions in the east of the city,\" a resident there told AFP.The day before, the RSF announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt.The four countries put forward the plan in September - and said it should be followed by a permanent ceasefire and a transition to civilian rule.At the time the Sudanese government rejected \"foreign interference\" and any attempts that equated it with a \"racist terrorist militia that relies on foreign mercenaries\".It is not clear if the proposal has been modified since then.But during a press conference on Friday, Sudan's ambassador to South Africa said it was too early for his country to agree to the plan.\"From our experience, we had many truces at the beginning of the war but every time there was no respect from [the RSF],\" Osman Abufatima Adam Mohammed said.\"They use these truces to move to new areas and make moves against the government.\"The ambassador opposed the UAE's presence at the ceasefire talks, repeating his government's allegation that the Gulf nation was supplying the RSF with weapons and foreign fighters.UN experts say accusations of such military support are credible, but the UAE has denied all involvement with the RSF.The RSF and the military have agreed to ceasefire proposals before, but none have stuck.This time, the RSF waited until it had finally seized el-Fasher, a key city that it had been blockading for 18 months, before announcing it was on board with the truce.Now that the paramilitary group has consolidated control over el-Fasher and, consequently, the vast wider western region of Darfur, it may have greater leverage in future ceasefire negotiations.But the RSF is also facing an international backlash against widespread reports of mass killings and sexual violence during the fall of el-Fasher, which it has denied.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyWatch: Key moments from the 'Nest-flix' 2025 chicksSince the end of August, tens of thousands of Australians have been tuning in to \"Nest-flix\", a high drama 24-hour reality channel that first became a hit during the Covid pandemic.Sometimes compared to Game of Thrones, it features airborne fights, cuckolds, births, breakups and earthquakes, courtesy of its stars - the peregrine falcons who live at the top of a Melbourne skyscraper.Currently fans are waiting for the moment when this year's chicks, which began hatching at the end of September, attempt their first flight.They can be seen running up and down flapping their wings on the ledge – 34 storeys high – while their mother has been flying past with pigeons in her talons. \"She's teasing the chicks, going 'You wanna eat? Well you gotta fly',\" says Dr Victor Hurley, founder of the Victorian Peregrine Project.The goading and deliberate reduction in food encourages them to fly and helps them lose weight, he says. \"Their wings are growing and getting bigger and they get a better wing load ratio to wing load area so they can lift off easier.\"The launch of 'Nest-flix'Dr Hurley was first tipped off to the peregrine nesting site on the office building at 367 Collins Street in 1991, the year he established the Victorian Peregrine Project, a volunteer group dedicated to the preservation of the species.But he realised the falcons were having no success because they had laid their eggs in a metal gutter, which acts as a heat sink, drawing warmth away from the nest. \"Rain gutters in winter in Melbourne, that was always going to end badly,\" he says.Dr Hurley recommended the building managers put in a nest box - which they agreed to do - and the following year three chicks were born.  A CCTV camera was put in to observe the nest in 1993 and every year at breeding time Dr Hurley would drag his large screen TV into the foyer so that people in the building could watch.Then in 2017 a webcam was installed and \"Nest-flix\" was broadcast live on YouTube. The falcons also have their own Facebook fan page with more than 50,000 members. \"It's quite a supportive corner of the internet where people just enjoy watching birds,\" says Kylie Humrick, who joined the group in 2017 and has since become one of its moderators. \"During Covid the group just exploded because it gave people a sense of connection to the world around them.\"\"We hear a lot about how wildlife is struggling and it's good to see some birds that are thriving in the built environment,\" she adds. A favourite moment was in 2021 when the livestream captured a falcon being startled off the nest by an earthquake.Watch: The peregrine falcon’s viral moment reacting to a 2021 Melbourne earthquakeFights and 'floaters'Over the years the nest has been inhabited by six to seven different pairs of falcons, possibly more. The piece of central Melbourne real estate is \"highly prized\" by the birds, Dr Hurley says. \"There's a guarantee of hot and cold running pigeons and sparrows all year round. So food's laid on for them.\"This, and the fact that peregrine falcons are extremely territorial - the closest they'll nest to each other is about 1.6km - has led to some spectacular fights over the nesting site with \"floaters\" - peregrines who haven't paired off or established their own territory - launching raids.In 2022, drama ensued when a male falcon (described as \"wimpy\" by Dr Hurley) was replaced by a younger bird halfway through the incubation period after a weeks-long battle.The older male was almost certainly killed by the \"step-father\" who was \"rubbish\" at his new incubation duties, says Dr Hurley, although he notes that at least he didn't eat the chicks when they hatched as has been known to happen and did in fact provide them with their first feed.\"People started referring to him as the dad that stepped up,\" says Ms Humrick.Then in 2023, the resident female falcon appeared to have sustained brain damage after getting \"beaten up\" by another female. \"She retained the territory for a couple of weeks but she was standing next to the eggs all night one night in winter so she was clearly not alright,\" says Dr Hurley. There were no chicks that year.Years earlier another female falcon was killed in a seven-hour fight that was so loud the building managers called Dr Hurley.Dr Hurley emphasises that these behaviours are natural and has rejected entreaties from falcon watchers to intervene. \"These things kills other birds for a living, that's their specialty and when they're taking over nests there's no prisoner abuse scandal, they just kill each other.\"Peregrine falcons, which were once nearly wiped out in Australia due to the use of pesticides in agriculture, have staged a recovery since the 1980s when DDT and other chemicals were banned. The birds - known as the fastest animals on earth, reaching speeds of up to 389km/h - are now to be found in almost every major city across the country, where tall buildings mimic the cliffs they prefer in nature.The peregrine chicks are expected to fledge any day nowBut they still face challenges, not least their first flight, which for the chicks at 367 Collins Street is expected any day soon. The male chick is expected to fly first, possibly as early as Saturday, followed around a week later by his two sisters. Female chicks are typically 30% heavier than their brothers, so they take a little longer to develop the necessary strength to fly.Dr Hurley hopes they all take their time as that means \"they'll be stronger and more capable\"; an ill-timed gust of wind could blow them into a window or they could land badly. One of last year's chicks had to spend several weeks at a rehabilitation centre after becoming trapped behind a glass balcony screen on another skyscraper.Once they make their first kill they'll be on their own, potentially chased out of the territory altogether depending on the ruthlessness of their parents. A 60% mortality rate in the first year means it's a \"tough gig\" being a young peregrine falcon, Dr Hurley observes, adding that such a rate is common among predators.\"If every lion that was born survived to become an adult and breed, you'd run out of zebra and wildebeest pretty quick.\"It's not clear what has happened to the earlier chicks from Collins Street despite up to 40 being banded, but they will usually travel tens of kilometres away to establish their own territories and avoid inbreeding. If they survive their second year - two thirds do not - they can begin breeding at three.Among the Facebook watchers excitement is building ahead of the expected fledging. \"Headed to Melbourne soon and binoculars already packed, hoping to spot them!\" one group member posted this week. \"Be still my freaked out heart,\" another wrote as one chick perched close to the edge of the ledge.\"It's always an exciting time in the group, viewership definitely goes up the closer we get to fledging. People look forward to seeing them go out into the world,\" says Ms Humrick. \"We don't know what happens to them after they fledge but it's nice to see them reach that milestone.\"",

    "body": "Whip restored to four Labour MPs after rebellion7 hours agoNeve Gordon-FarleighUK ParliamentChris Hinchliff said his focus remains on serving the communities of North East Hertfordshire Four MPs who were suspended from the Labour Party after rebelling against welfare reforms have had their whips restored.Chris Hinchliff, for North East Hertfordshire, was suspended alongside Neil Duncan-Jordan, MP for Poole, Brian Leishman, MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, and Rachael Maskell, MP for York Central, after they voted against the government's Welfare Reform Bill in July.The BBC understands they had the whip restored after discussions with chief whip Jonathan Reynolds on Friday.Hinchliff said: \"As ever, my focus remains on serving the communities of North East Hertfordshire and contributing to Labour's historic mission to create a society that puts people and nature before profit.\"Prior to their suspensions, all four MPs had rebelled against the government on several occasions. The group were among 47 Labour MPs who rebelled against the government's proposed cuts to welfare in July and forced ministers to water down their plans.The rebellion undermined Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's authority, which was weakened after a series of policy reversals, including restoring the Winter Fuel Payment to millions of pensioners.At the time of their suspension, Starmer said he was \"determined\" to change the country \"for the better\". He said: \"Therefore, we have to deal with people who repeatedly break the whip.\"Hinchliff said he welcomed the whip back and added he had \"constructive discussions\" with the new chief whip in recent months.PA MediaNeil Duncan-Jordan says he will continue to work hard for his Poole constituentsDuncan-Jordan said he was \"glad\" to have the whip restored. \"I've been part of the Labour and trade union movement for 40 years, so I'm pleased to have had the Labour whip restored today.\"I'll continue working hard for my constituents in Poole and standing up for Labour values - tackling poverty, raising living standards and building a fairer society,\" he added.  Maskell said she was \"grateful\" that she had been given the whip back. \"I recognise the heavy responsibility on Labour to repair our public services and economy after 14 disastrous years and above all to lift people out of poverty. \"With 4.5m children living in poverty tonight, I am focused on ensuring they have the very best start in life,\" she added. The move comes as the party faces a difficult month in government with growing concern among Labour MPs that taxes will have to rise in the upcoming budget. Newly elected Labour deputy leader, Lucy Powell, urged the government not to raise taxes in the next budget. Powell told the BBC the government \"should be following through\" on its manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national tax or VAT. More on this story",

    "body": "Ariana Grande: Going brunette is not about saying goodbye to Glinda6 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporter, Leicester Square, LondonPress AssociationAriana Grande has said her new darker hair is not about saying goodbye to her Wicked character Glinda, but rather a way of “doing something different”.The singer and actress, 32, has recently swapped her signature, Glinda-era blonde locks with a brunette tone, sending fans wild on social media.It comes as she resumes her role as the Good Witch of the North alongside Cynthia Erivo, who returns as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, in Wicked: For Good.On Monday night, London’s Leicester Square was transformed into the magical Land of Oz, with Wicked-inspired shades of pink and green and a sprawling yellow brick road running through the middle.Fans came dressed in witches' hats and green makeup, while others channelled their inner Glinda in sparkly floor length gowns.Speaking to BBC News, Erivo, who was recently nominated for two Grammys, said it felt “overwhelming” to be closing the Wicked chapter.“It feels beautiful though,” said Grande. “This project will always be part of our lives.”The sequel picks up where the first film left off and covers the years after Elphaba and Glinda's decision to part ways.Elphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard.The sequel will see Grande and Erivo joined once again by co-stars Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard.Bridgerton star Bailey, 37, who reprises his role of Prince Fiyero, has recently made history by becoming People's first-ever openly gay \"Sexiest Man Alive\".When asked by BBC News who his sexiest man of the year is, he didn’t skip a beat.“Jon M Chu,” he said, naming Wicked’s film director. “Because his genius, and his compassion, knows no end.”He then laughed, adding: “And because he cast me in this film, so that is entirely sexy.”PA MediaJonathan Bailey reprises his role of Prince Fiyero in the new filmThe sequel has a romantic plotline, which could lead some to wonder whether Bailey was channelling his inner Anthony (his Bridgerton character).“I’m sure I’m mining something that’s in my bones somewhere,” he says.As a sidebar, I also had to ask him whether would ever do Celebrity Traitors.“The answer is, we’ll have to find out,” he said, pausing dramatically before laughing. “I feel like I’m already exposing my game play.”When Grande unveiled her new look on Instagram recently, many fans speculated that it was a way for her to bid farewell to her Good Witch character.But when asked about that, she said: “No, I think it was just a way of doing something different for the second movie, and playing into the darker tones, with clothing and beauty.“It’s fun,” she said, while Erivo smiled and nodded.The films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel.However, the stage musical was split into two films for its big-screen adaptation, with the second due to be released on 21 November.The two movies were shot simultaneously at Sky Studios Elstree in Hertfordshire between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors' strike.PA MediaThe sequel will see co-star Michelle Yeoh join Grande and ErivoWicked was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design.At two hours 40 minutes, the first film alone was almost as long as the entire length of the stage show.But the second film is slightly shorter, at 2 hours and 18 minutes.Erivo and Grande's chemistry and real-life friendship prompted several viral interview moments during the first film's promotional run last year, and the pair jointly opened the Academy Awards in March with a Wicked medley.One challenge facing the sequel is that most of the best known songs from the musical, such as Defying Gravity, Popular and The Wizard And I, featured in the first film.But the forthcoming follow-up will feature two brand new songs, with Chu telling BBC News that the first time Grande and Erivo heard them, “they just cried”.“It means a lot to now, however many years later, we’re here and people get to see it on the big screen. I’m so excited.”Wicked For Good is in cinemas on 21 November.",

    "body": "Australian scientists have discovered a new native bee species with tiny horns - and given it a suitably devilish name. Researchers found the Megachile Lucifer while observing a rare wildflower that only grows in the Bremer Ranges in Western Australia's Goldfields region, 470km (292mi) east of Perth.The \"highly distinctive, prominent horns\" are only on the female bee and may be used as a defence mechanism, to gather pollen or nectar, or to collect materials such as resin for nests.The study's lead scientist said she was inspired to use the name Lucifer as she was watching the Netflix show of the same name at the time. She adds that it is the first new member of this bee group in 20 years. \"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" said Dr Kit Prendergast from Curtin University .\"When writing up the new species description I was watching the Netflix show Lucifer at the time, and the name just fit perfectly. I am also a huge fan of the Netflix character Lucifer so it was a no-brainer.\"Lucifer - which means \"light bringer\" in Latin - is also a reference to shining light on the need for better conservation of native bee species and greater understanding of how endangered plants are pollinated, she said. The report, which was published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, also called for the area in and around where the new bee species and rare wildflowers were found to be \"formally protected and gazetted as conservation land that cannot be cleared\".\"Because the new species was found in the same small area as the endangered wildflower, both could be at risk from habitat disturbance and other threatening processes like climate change,\" she said, adding that many mining companies do not include native bees when assessing the environmental impact of their operations.\"So we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems.\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realise they're there.\"",

    "body": "'Trump's $1bn BBC threat' and 'You will pay the price' warning for Reeves3 hours agoDonald's Trump's threat to sue the BBC over the editing of his speech in a documentary dominates Tuesday's papers. The Daily Telegraph reports that the US president is demanding an apology, retraction and payout by Friday if the broadcaster wants to avoid legal action. Trump's threat comes as BBC chairman Samir Shah apologised for the editing of the Panorama documentary and acknowledged that an \"error of judgement\" had been made. However, Shah denied the BBC \"sought to bury\" issues raised in an internal memo regarding editorial decisions.\"Trump's $1bn battle with 'corrupt' BBC\" is the Metro's take. The paper quotes the US president's letter to the BBC, accusing the broadcaster of making \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading, and inflammatory statements\" about him. In her statement, outgoing head of news Deborah Turness acknowledged that \"mistakes have been made\" but insisted the corporation was not \"institutionally biased\".The Sun splashes its front page with \"Beeb's billion dollar bungle\", quoting Trump's legal letter which said he suffered \"overwhelming harm\" due to the editing of the Panorama documentary. BBC chair Samir Shah has insisted it was \"simply not true\" the organisation has done nothing to tackle problems that were raised.\"Trump does a Dr Evil\" declares the Daily Star, alongside a photoshopped image of Trump in a Dr Evil pose from the Austin Powers film series.\"Future of the BBC licence fee in jeopardy\" says the i Paper, as it reports that Labour  is considering \"a range of options\" to replace the broadcaster's licence fee. The paper also features quotes from news executives still reeling from the resignation of director general Tim Davie, who say \"the mood is dark. We need leadership\".A photo of BBC's outgoing head of news Deborah Turness is front and centre on the Independent. The paper features Turness' comments to reporters outside Broadcasting House after her resignation, saying: \"The buck stops with me.\"Turness is also pictured on the front page of the Daily Mail, as the paper predicts that \"BBC suits\" might regret turning on \"Hurricane Deborah\".  In its main story, the Mail says lawyers for Trump have put the BBC \"on notice\" - a situation that prompts the headline \"Grovel - or I'll sue you for $1bn\".The Financial Times describes the current crisis at the BBC as a \"fight for the broadcaster's soul\". The paper reports that Downing Street has defended the broadcaster by expressing its \"huge support for a strong and independent BBC\".While other front pages focus on Trump and the BBC's two big departures, the Guardian moves its focus on to a third key BBC figure under pressure. The paper says board member Robbie Gibb, who was appointed to his BBC role by Boris Johnson and previously worked for Theresa May as her communications chief, \"led the charge\" in pressuring the broadcaster's leadership over allegations of systemic bias. The front page references an article inside the paper by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey,  in which he labels Gibb a Conservative crony and urges his removal from the board.\"BBC is told: say sorry or Trump will sue for $1bn\" is the headline leading The Times. But also on the front page, the paper says Chancellor Rachel Reeves has given her \"clearest indication\" that she is prepared to break Labour's manifesto by raising income tax. Reeves says she \"of course\" would like to stick to the pledge, but doing so would require cuts to spending that would damage productivity, the Times reports.The Daily Express follows with a warning to the chancellor from campaigners, who urge her to spare pensioners from \"vindictive\" tax rises. Alongside, the paper teases a \"Wicked reunion\" with a photo of Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande at the film's London premiere.Finally, the Daily Mirror features Prince William opening up on the challenges of dealing with wife Catherine's cancer battle. The paper quotes the prince, saying: \"Hiding stuff doesn't work. We chose to communicate a lot more.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorI don't like the word unprecedented. But I've used it twice in less than 24 hours.The first time was on Sunday night, after the resignations of Tim Davie and Deborah Turness. That, in fact, might have involved a bit of overreach.After all, this has happened before at the BBC. Back in 2004, two senior figures departed - admittedly not on the same day, but on subsequent days.The then BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies, and the director general, Greg Dyke, resigned in light of the Hutton report. That was the inquiry into the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly which found that the BBC's reporting on the Iraq \"sexed-up dossier\" was flawed.But my use of unprecedented on Monday feels entirely appropriate.A US president threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn is completely new territory for the corporation.We've seen a succession of US media operations previously cave in as Donald Trump launched lawsuits. Paramount Global paid him $16m to settle a dispute over an interview broadcast on CBS with former vice-president Kamala Harris. ABC News paid him $15m to settle a defamation lawsuit after its anchor falsely claimed he had been found \"liable for rape\".Now the president has the BBC in his sights. He wants a full retraction of the Panorama documentary, an apology for the \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading and inflammatory statements\" made about him in it, and appropriate compensation \"for the harm caused\".If he doesn't get them by Friday, he's put the BBC \"on notice\" that he will be looking for damages of \"no less than $1,000,000,000\".Whether you are a supporter or a detractor of the BBC, I think everyone would agree these are incredibly testing times for the corporation.Events have developed rapidly over a week.First we got the series of claims about the Panorama documentary and also wider systemic bias first made in the Telegraph.Six days later came the resignations of director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness.Quickly some were voicing concerns about a politically orchestrated campaign against the BBC from the right. Others said this was all about accountability in the face of gross failures.Now the BBC faces a potentially very costly legal battle with Donald Trump.It should be basking in the success of Celebrity Traitors with the programme's hugely popular finale broadcast just last Thursday. Instead the BBC is plunged into a crisis some would argue of its own making.It's taken until Monday to apologise for the Panorama edit and to push back on the notion that the corporation suffers from institutional bias.The interview I did with BBC chair Samir Shah should have been done much earlier - with the DG or Deborah Turness last week, as the headlines ramped up.The apology should have come then. Now the BBC is on the back foot.It will take robust leadership to steer a course through. But two of the leaders most likely to have been able to steady the ship are now on the way out.",

    "body": "The BBC has confirmed that Celebrity Traitors will return for a second series on BBC One in 2026, following a hugely successful debut that became one of the broadcaster's biggest entertainment hits.It will be hosted once again by Claudia Winkleman and filmed at Ardross Castle in the Scottish Highlands. Companion show Celebrity Traitors: Uncloaked will also return.An average of 11.1 million people tuned in to watch the final episode of this year's Celebrity version last week - the biggest live audience of the year for a single TV show.It was the highest overnight audience since the Gavin and Stacey finale, which attracted 12.3 million on Christmas Day last year, the BBC said.In July, England's victory in the Euro 2025 final had an average of 12 million who watched the match from start to finish, split across BBC One and ITV.The Celebrity Traitors finale saw traitors Cat Burns and Alan Carr, and faithfuls Joe Marler, Nick Mohammed and David Olusoga, compete for a £87,500 prize for charity.Comedian Alan Carr was crowned the winner of the series on Thursday evening after he convinced Mohammed and Olusoga that he was a faithful.An economic impact report, published on Monday, suggests the Traitors franchise - including the UK, US, and Celebrity editions – has added an estimated £21.8 million (gross value added) to Scotland's economy since production began in 2022.The report, compiled with Screen Scotland and Visit Scotland, credits the programme with supporting hundreds of local jobs and promoting the Highlands as a filming destination.The Traitors, based on a Dutch format created by Marc Pos, first aired on BBC One in 2022 and has since become an international phenomenon, spawning multiple editions worldwide including in Australia, Canada and Italy.Kalpna Patel-Knight, head of entertainment at the BBC, said the show had \"truly captivated the nation, becoming a bona fide highlight of the year\".She added: \"In 2026 the doors of the castle will be opened again to welcome celebrity players to the game to see who can charm, who can scheme and ultimately who can survive in series two which promises to be just as unmissable as the first.\"A fourth season of Traitors UK will also air in 2026.

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr at the White House & Raffi BergWatch: 'If you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance', says Trump on al-SharaaSyria will join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, a senior Trump administration official has confirmed. The announcement came as President Donald Trump met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House - the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.In an interview with Fox News, al-Sharaa said the visit was part of a \"new era\" in which the country would co-operate with the US. Trump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.Syria will now be the 90th country to join the global coalition, which is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East. Following the meeting, a senior administration official also confirmed that the US Treasury Department, along with the departments of state and commerce, will announce new measures to lift economic restrictions on Syria and provide \"compliance clarity for investors\".As part of the measures, the administration is also issuing an 180-day suspension of the Caesar Act, which since 2019 had sanctioned the former Syrian government.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\" \"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\" Diplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although the US will now allow Syria to re-open its embassy in Washington. This is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September. Al-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist. Not long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties. Even until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head. The Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.But since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war. \"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\" In his interview, al-Sharaa said that he and Trump had not discussed his past, but instead focused on the \"present and the future\" of Syria in which it was a \"geopolitical\" and economic partner of Washington. Al-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.He has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\". In June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\". At the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country.

It's just not like any other book,\" said author Roddy Doyle, who chaired the judging panel. \"It's a dark book, but we all found it a joy to read.\"Actress Sarah Jessica Parker was among the other Booker judges, while Flesh has been championed by Dua Lipa and Stormzy.Getty ImagesDua Lipa interviewed David Szalay at New York Public Library in SeptemberSzalay told the BBC he was feeling a \"bit dazed\" after winning the prize and it was going to take a while to \"sink in\". \"I did maybe too thorough a job of convincing myself that I wasn't going to win in order to get through the evening without too much stress, and now I have to catch up a bit in my head,\" he said. \"But it's fantastic, of course.\" Stormzy recorded an extract of the book for a short film that was played at the Booker Prize ceremony in London on Monday.And Dua Lipa described it as a \"tense and gripping read\" when she picked it for her book club last month.Flesh has had rave reviews across the board.The Guardian called it a \"brilliantly spare portrait of a man\" and a \"thrilling exploration of what it means to be alive\", while the Sunday Times praised how Szalay uses \"just one character, Istvan, to tell these three stages of modern man\".Blank pagesCritics and judges have also praised Szalay's pared-down, minimalist dialogue and descriptions.\"We loved the spareness of the writing,\" Doyle explained. \"We loved how so much is revealed without us being overly aware of it being revealed. \"It's just extraordinary how he uses white space. Grief is depicted by a few blank pages.\"Referring to the writing style, Doyle added: \"I found it riveting, and I thought the dialogue was superb - and the absence of it was superb.\"Booker organisers described Flesh as \"a meditation on class, power, intimacy, migration and masculinity\", and called it \"a compelling portrait of one man, and the formative experiences that can reverberate across a lifetime\".'Honest and heartbreaking'The judges spent more than five hours discussing the six shortlisted novels before settling on the winner. Doyle said it became \"very clear that this was the book that all five of us liked most\".\"They found it spare, disciplined, urgent, honest and heartbreaking,\" said Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation.\"With Flesh, they all agreed, David Szalay breaks new ground. I share the judges' excitement over the work of an author who has been writing with ferocious and stark commitment for many years.\"Flesh is Szalay's sixth novel, and he was previously nominated for the Booker for All That Man Is, another exploration of modern masculinity, in 2016.He collected £50,000 as this year's winner.The other shortlisted novels were:Yuki Sugiura/Booker Prize FoundationSusan Choi - FlashlightKiran Desai - The Loneliness of Sonia and SunnyKatie Kitamura - AuditionBen Markovits - The Rest of Our LivesAndrew Miller - The Land in WinterThe Booker Prize is the UK's most prestigious fiction award and is open to novels written in the English language.Past winners include Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Bernardine Evaristo, Hilary Mantel and Douglas Stuart.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAlys DaviesAFP via Getty ImagesThe Prince of Wales has described how he and the Princess of Wales approached telling their children about difficult moments they have faced over the past two years, such as Catherine and King Charles' cancer diagnoses. \"We choose to communicate a lot more with our children... most of the time, hiding stuff from them doesn't work\", Prince William said during an interview in Brazil.\"Every family has its own difficulties and its own challenges. It's very individual and sort of moment-dependent as to how you deal with those problems\", he added.The prince visited the Latin American country for the first time last week to mark the fifth Earthshot Prize, of which he is the founder and president.The prize celebrates people who have come up with ideas to help tackle issues affecting the planet. The winners of each category win £1m to further develop their ideas.Speaking to Brazilian TV host Luciano Huck in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the awards ceremony, which took place on 5 November, Prince William was asked how he and Catherine navigated the difficult things they have faced over the past two years.\"Sometimes you feel you're oversharing with the children\", said Prince William, who is father to Prince George, 12, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, seven. \"But most of the time, hiding stuff from them doesn't work, and so explaining how they feel, why that's happening, giving them other viewpoints as to why they might be feeling like they are sometimes helps give them a bigger picture, and they can relax more into it rather than being really anxious about 'what are you hiding from me'?\".\"There's a lot more questions when there's no answers.\"\"But it's always a balancing act\", he added, \"How much do I say? What do I say? When do I say it? There's no manual for being a parent, you've just got to go with it\".The Princess of Wales revealed she was in remission from cancer in January. King Charles continues to undergo treatment.In the interview, which covered a range of subjects, Prince William also said they do not allow their children to have phones.\"It's really hard. Our children don't have phones, I think when George moves onto secondary school then maybe he might have a phone that has limited access,\" he said.\"It's getting to the point where it's becoming a little bit of a tense issue but I think [Prince George] understands why, we communicate why we don't think it's right, and again I think it's the internet access we have a problem with. \"I think children can access too much stuff they don't need to see online,\" he said.He added that either he or Catherine do the school run most days and jokingly referred to himself as a taxi driver when conversing with Huck.Speaking about the Earthshot Prize, being held in Brazil for the first time this year, Prince William said: \"We're halfway through the ten years that we've identified as the decade of change, where if we want to leave a lasting legacy and really change the way we protect and restore and live on the planet we have to do it in this decade of change. \"So am I pleased with the progress the Earthshot has made and where the world is headed in environmental and climate leadership? Yes, I think we've made progress. Is there a lot more to do? Yes.\" Winners of this year's prize included a project to restore tropical forests and a global ocean treaty initiative.Following the trip to Rio, officials announced they would be making Prince William an honorary citizen of the city, known as a carioca.",

    "body": "9 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilShutterstockBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks during the opening of the COP30 conferences in Belem, Brazil.The world must \"defeat\" climate denialism and fight fake news, Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has told the opening meeting of the UN climate talks. In a rallying cry to COP30, President Lula again made thinly veiled references to President Donald Trump who branded climate change \"a con job\" in September.The two weeks of talks kicked off on Monday in the lush Brazilian city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest.They take place against a fraught political backdrop and the US has sent no senior officials.On Monday thousands of delegates poured into the COP venue in a heavily air-conditioned former aerodrome, some coming from accommodation in shipping containers and cruise ships moored on the riverside.Members of the Guajajara indigenous group, in traditional dress, performed a welcome song and dance for assembled diplomats.Addressing the conference, President Lula said \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"fake news and misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\".Without naming President Trump, President Lula continued, \"they control the algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear\".\"It's time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers,\" he said.ReutersSince President Trump took office in January, he has promised to invest heavily in fossil fuels, saying that this will secure greater economic prosperity for the US.His administration has cancelled more than $13bn of funding for renewable energy and is taking steps to open up more areas of the US to oil and gas exploration.That puts the country at odds with the majority of nations still committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green energy.UNFCCThe latest UN climate talks talk place in Belém, a city of 1.5 million people in northern BrazilThis backdrop has put the COP talks in a difficult position as nations aim to make progress on tackling climate change without the participation of the world's biggest economy.Some delegates fear that the US could still decide to send officials to undermine the talks. Other environmental talks collapsed this year following US pressure, labelled \"bully-boy tactics\" by some participants.Addressing officials in Belém, UN climate chief Simon Stiell initially struck an optimistic tone. He said significant progress had been made in the last decade to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases.But then he took aim at \"squabbling\" between countries.\"Not one single nation among you can afford this, as climate disasters rip double-digits off GDP,\" he said.Brazil wants to use its presidency of the talks to secure progress on key promises made in previous years.That includes moving away from the use of planet-warming fossil fuels, finance for developing countries on the frontline of climate change, and protecting nature.President Lula's centrepiece is a fund called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that Brazil hopes will raise $125bn to protect tropical forests globally.Fund-raising got off to a slow start. Last week UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, at the last minute, that the UK would not contribute public money.But on Monday, UK climate envoy Rachel Kyte told BBC News that the fund was a \"brilliant idea\" and that the UK \"will make the investment at some point\".After a fight, nations finally agreed a conference agenda on Monday.It promises to consider the question of whether countries can still work towards keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.Groups on the frontline of climate change, including coalition called Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) that mostly represents Caribbean and Pacific countries, had insisted the talks address the long-held goal.In recent weeks even the UN has said it accepts that overshooting this temperature is \"inevitable\".Last week UN General Secretary General António Guterres told leaders in Belém that the failure to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C was a \"moral failure and deadly negligence\".Additional reporting by Esme Stallard",

    "body": "4 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesSmith said he immediately agreed to star in The Death of Bunny Munro after meeting Nick CaveWhen Nick Cave first saw Matt Smith playing Bunny Munro - the sex-obsessed door-to-door salesman from his 2009 novel The Death of Bunny Munro - he was taken aback.\"In the book, Bunny's not good at what he does - he wants to sleep with everyone he can and he's an unsuccessful lothario who women treat like a joke,\" Cave explains.\"Whereas Matt is hot and that adds a complexity that the original Bunny didn't have because when Matt's Bunny hits on women, they kind of like it and he draws them in.\"The Australian musician's darkly comic tale of sex, guilt and grief has been reimagined as a TV series with Doctor Who and The Crown star Smith taking on the titular role of a man spiralling after his wife's suicide.Having kidnapped his son, Bunny sets off on a chaotic road trip, clinging to his job and desires as everything else falls apart around him.Smith says that he signed up to play Bunny immediately after he first me Cave - and thought the role was \"an amazing opportunity and challenge to play a man pushed to the edge by grief, sex and life\".For Cave, the project revisits one of his morally complex characters and the 68-year-old stands by the fact that Bunny isn't wholly a bad person.\"When I look at Bunny, I don't see an aberration,\" he says. \"He's a flawed human being struggling with grief, his own legacy and all the things that make us human.\"Sky UKMatt Smith as Bunny MunroSmith agrees and his version of Bunny is more beguiling and dangerous, and his appeal makes his downfall harder to dismiss.\"He's selfish and difficult, but also funny, mad and kind of charismatic,\" he explains. \"He's human and I saw the good in him, thought he was quite funny and became quite attached to him.\"It's that tension of Bunny being both repellent and relatable that gives the story its emotional punch. Smith says that beneath the chaos, it's \"a really touching story about a father and son\". Cave nods in agreement, adding that the tale of Bunny makes him want to hug his kids. \"It's a reminder of the vulnerability of our children and of the need to hold them while there's still time.\"Set in 2003 in Brighton, the adaptation turns Cave's novel into a period piece that feels close enough to the present day but distant enough to reflect how the world, and its tolerance for men like Bunny, has changed.But both men resist saying that the show makes a statement about masculinity.\"That's for other people to decide,\" Smith says. \"But for me, it's really a story about the sins of the father and about Bunny Junior breaking that cycle.\"Cave calls it a story about inheritance - what we carry from our parents and what we choose to leave behind. \"Little Bunny needs to get away from his father as he's chaotic and a threat to his safety but Bunny is essentially good and we wouldn't want his son to escape those parts of him.\" Sky UKBunny takes his son on a chaotic road trip after his wife takes her own lifeThe singer also suggests it's much deeper than an exploration of masculinity as it reflects \"how we deal with our own nature and humanity.\"That sense of humanity has always been at the core of Cave's work and his music with The Bad Seeds is \"essentially autobiographical\".In 2015, Cave's son Arthur died after falling from a cliff in Brighton and in 2022 his eldest son, Jethro, died at the age of 30.The singer has previously written about the \"vastness\" of his grief and about how the death of his sons changed him. He also moved to Los Angeles because \"Brighton had just become too sad\" but he later returned after he \"realised that, regardless of where we lived, we just took our sadness with us\".\"If you listen to my songs and the words, they paint a very clear picture of what I'm like and what I've gone through,\" he tells the BBC. \"Even the despicable characters, they're not removed from me, they are just part of a complex character.\"In contrast, Cave explains that Bunny Munro isn't autobiographical but there is some overlap between his life and that of his creation.\"I wasn't writing about someone I didn't understand,\" he says. \"I felt extremely connected to Bunny - not that I went around trying to seduce women, though there was a bit of that, being in a band and all – but that interior masculine monologue, that first impulse towards being in the world.\"Most men, if they're honest, understand Bunny on some level.\"However, Cave says that where he differs most from Bunny is when it comes to women as he's \"much shyer around women\".His confession strips away any rock-star bravado as he admits that he's \"quite terrified of women and their power and I've just never been that comfortable around them\".The Death of Bunny Munro is on Sky Atlantic from 20 November.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesSam Fender won the Mercury Prize in his hometown of Newcastle last monthSam Fender has donated the entirety of his £25,000 Mercury Prize winnings to the Music Venues Trust (MVT), which works to preserve the UK's grassroots music venues.The star was presented with the cheque on 16 October as his third album People Watching was named the best record of the last 12 months.He has decided to hand the money over to the MVT, in recognition of the vital role grassroots venues played in his early career.\"I wouldn't be doing what I am doing today if it wasn't for all the gigs I played around the North East, and beyond, when I was starting out,\" said Fender. \"These venues are legendary, but they are struggling.\"Since the start of 2023, more than 150 of these venues have permanently closed their doors – about 16% of the entire UK sector.In the last year, major artists including Pulp, Coldplay, Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran have all supported the MVT in its attempts to keep the scene afloat, by adding a small levy to their ticket prices, which goes to help smaller concert halls.Fender also took part, raising more than £100,000 on his 2024 arena tour to support 38 grassroots venues across England, Scotland, and Wales.The money helped venues that were facing imminent closure due to challenges arising from floods, fires and bereavements, as well as licensing issues, legal disputes and noise complaints.Other venues received financial assistance in upgrading facilities and technical equipment that directly benefitted artists and audiences.\"The idea that money from shows in big venues supports the smaller venues, where it all starts for musicians like me, is just common sense,\" Fender has said.Getty ImagesPulp are one of the many acts who donated their Mercury Prize winnings to charityHe is not the first artist to donate his Mercury Prize winnings to worthy causes. When Pulp won the trophy in 1996 for their album Different Class, lead singer Jarvis Cocker announced that the band would donate their prize money to the charity War Child.In 2002, rapper and singer Ms Dynamite split her bounty between several good causes, including the NSPCC and a Sickle Cell charity.\"And I donated a grand to Highgate Newtown, my local community centre, to their gymnastics class, because I did gymnastics when I was younger and they needed new equipment,\" she told the Guardian in 2013.Two years ago, Ezra Collective gave their winnings to the local youth club that nurtured their band, alongside other grassroots music organisations.And 1994 winners M People donated their prize to a multiple sclerosis charity after a friend was diagnosed with the condition.\"Winning was quite enough,\" said singer Heather Small. \"The money was the cherry on top but we didn't need the cherry, because we had the cake. So our winning touched somebody else's life.\" Last week, the MVT announced it had saved two grassroots venues in south-east England, by bringing them into community ownership.The Joiners in Southampton and The Croft in Bristol were purchased under the  Own Our Venues initiative, which is supported by Arts Council England and music fans who buy \"shares\" in the properties.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterEPA/ShutterstockA second migrant who had been sent from the UK to France under the government's \"one in, one out\" deal has returned to the UK, the Home Office has confirmed.The man was detained immediately, having been detected by biometrics, and will be sent back to France \"as quickly as possible\", the Home Office has said.The \"one in, one out\" pilot scheme with France is aimed at deterring migrants from coming to the UK in small boats across the English Channel.Last month, an Iranian man re-entered the UK by small boat one month after being removed to France. He was deported again last Wednesday.A Home Office spokesperson said officials would continue to catch and return anyone trying to re-enter the UK.\"Anyone looking to return to the UK after being removed under the UK-France agreement is wasting their time and money,\" the spokesperson said.\"This individual was detected by biometrics and detained immediately. His case will be expedited, and he will be returned to France as quickly as possible.\"The message is clear: if you try to return to the UK you will be sent back. We will do whatever it takes to scale up removals of illegal migrants and secure our borders.\"The first flight carrying a cross-Channel small boat migrant, an Indian national, landed in Paris on 18 September.The UK-France deal for a pilot scheme was struck in September and aims to deter small boat crossings by returning migrants.About 100 men were detained after arriving in the UK on a small boat, sent to  immigration removal centres near Heathrow, and told they may be returned to France. Last week, the Home Office confirmed 94 migrants have been returned to France and 57 people have arrived in the UK under the scheme so far.More than 500 migrants crossed the Channel by small boat on Saturday, 349 on Sunday, and 39,075 have made the journey so far this year.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is now considering a major restructure of the UK's immigration rules modelled on Denmark's system. At Labour conference in September, Mahmood promised to \"do whatever it takes\" to regain control of Britain's borders and is said to be impressed that Denmark has driven down its number of successful asylum claims to a 40-year low.Mahmood wants to reduce incentives for people seeking to enter the UK by tightening rules on family reunions, and make it easier to remove those found to have no right to stay.Downing Street insisted that the detection of a second \"one in, one out\" migrant returning to the UK showed the system was working.The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"You've got a person who's arrived at the front door, who's been detected immediately, their journey has been wasted completely.\"They are in line to return to France, just as the previous case was - out of pocket and out of chances - they are destined to go back straight to France and their money spent on this dangerous crossing will have been spent in vain.\"Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson accused the Home Office of \"staggering levels of incompetence\" and called for asylum seekers to be moved out of hotels as well as \"large-scale returns agreements\" with all safe countries. \"Failures like this show just how broken our system is,\" he said. \"Now is the time for Labour to back up their big promises with actions.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp nearly 18,000 migrants had arrived in the UK since the deal was struck, with \"only a handful removed...which is why they continue to flood in\". Philp said only the Conservatives had a clear plan to tackle illegal migration, saying the party would leave the ECHR and remove all illegal immigrants within a week of arrival.He added: \"But Keir Starmer doesn't have the backbone to do this, and Reform are a one-man band with no detailed plans.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "Reeves suggests benefit limits on larger families to be lifted11 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterRachel Reeves: I don't think it's right that a child is penalised for being in a bigger familyRachel Reeves has suggested she favours removing limits on benefits linked to family size at this month's Budget.The chancellor told the BBC it was not right that children in bigger families were \"penalised\" through \"no fault of their own\".The comments are a sign she could remove the two-child limit on working-age benefits introduced under the Conservatives in 2017.Some Labour MPs have been calling for a full reversal of the policy, amid reports she was considering paring back payments after two children instead.In September, the Guardian reported that Treasury officials were considering a tapered approach, under which parents would receive most benefits for their first child and less for subsequent children.Other options under consideration included limiting additional benefits to three or four children, the newspaper reported.But speaking to Matt Chorley on BBC Radio 5 Live, Reeves suggested she did not want to see benefits limited according to family size.\"I don't think that it's right that a child is penalised because they are in a bigger family, through no fault of their own,\" she added.\"And so we will take action on child poverty. The last Labour government proudly reduced child poverty, and we will reduce child poverty as well.\" She added there were \"plenty of reasons why\" parents who decided to have three or four children could see their financial circumstances change. Manifesto pledgesElsewhere in her interview, she all but confirmed the government plans to break Labour's manifesto pledge at last year's general election not to raise income tax rates, VAT or National Insurance.\"It would of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments. But that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending,\" she added.\"What I can promise now is I will always do what I think is right for our country. Not the politically easy choice, but the things that I think are necessary to put our country on the right path,\" she added.Labour's 2024 election manifesto pledged not to raise the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when Reeves announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers.It also promised not to raise Value Added Tax (VAT), a sales tax, although the manifesto did not specify whether this applied to the rates, or which products are subject to the charge.The chancellor has not ruled out continuing to freeze income tax thresholds beyond the 2028 date fixed by the last government, allowing more people to be dragged into higher bands as their wages rise over time. Pressed on whether she could have avoided tax hikes through lower public spending, she said she was \"not going to apologise\" for increased funding for the NHS, adding that reducing waiting lists was one of her three Budget priorities.She also claimed that some of the spending she unveiled at June's spending review had been pencilled in, but not properly funded, by the Tories.'Same choices' The two-child cap prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017.This is different to child benefit, which is paid to families where the highest-earning parent earns less than £80,000. Separately, there is also an overall cap on the amount of benefits working-age families can claim, which has been in place since 2013. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimates fully reversing the two-child benefit cap could take 630,000 children out of absolute poverty, defined as households with an income below 60% median average, at a cost of £3.6bn a year.Pressure to ditch the limit increased during the recent Labour deputy leadership contest, where successful candidate Lucy Powell and runner-up Bridget Phillipson both indicated they favoured more action on child poverty.Reform UK is pledging to scrap the limit for working British couples if it wins power, although the Conservatives say the cap should remain in place, forcing a symbolic vote on the issue in the House of Commons in September. Speaking after the vote, Tory leader said her party believes \"those on welfare should have to make the same choices as those who aren't,\" and Labour and Reform were expecting working people to pay for \"unlimited handouts\".Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "Aamilah Aswat made history at Kempton on Monday when becoming the first black British female jump jockey to ride in Britain.Aswat finished fifth of 10 aboard the Kim Bailey and Mat Nicholls-trained Guchen in the handicap hurdle.The 20-year-old jockey completed the inaugural Riding A Dream Academy scholarship programme in 2021-22, after which she competed in the Magnolia Cup on the flat at Goodwood this year - following a spell at the British Racing School. \"I can't believe that my dream to race has finally come true,\" said Aswat, who is based at the Bailey and Nicholls yard in Gloucestershire.\"I couldn't ask for a better horse - Guchen gave me such a great feeling and I will remember this day forever.\"I just wanted to get round safely and repay the trust that Kim and Mat have had in me.\"I am really proud to be the first black British female jump jockey. When I was growing up I looked up to Khadijah Mellah and I hope that now other young people will look up to me as well and know that they can also reach their dreams.\"Mellah became the first British Muslim woman to win a horse race in Britain when victorious in the 2019 Magnolia Cup, and co-founded the academy.\"I have watched Aamilah progress over the years and I could not be more excited and proud to see her race today,\" said Mellah.\"Visibility is so important and I am excited for her to have the opportunity to display her talent and hard work.\"Fellow academy co-founder Naomi Lawson said the organisation was aiming to \"ensure that young people from diverse ethnic communities have the chance to shine in the sport\".She added: \"Only around 2-3% of licensed jockeys come from these communities, far below the national average, so we hope that Aamilah is the first of many to come through the ranks and succeed.\"",

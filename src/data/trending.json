China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with self-governing Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force.  \nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US wouldn’t abandon the island in exchange for a favourable deal with China. But a tug of war has been playing out inside the Trump administration over whether a military battle for Taiwan – if China did try to seize it – would be in America’s best interests.  \nWe speak to writer and analyst James Crabtree about what to expect from Trump’s visit to Asia and where Taiwan goes from here. \nProducers: Viv Jones and Xandra Ellin \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nMix: Travis Evans \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nImage: Taiwanese people observe the changing of honor guards in Liberty Square in Taipei.

    "body": "8 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorThe Alan Turing Institute Chair has told the BBC there is \"no substance\" to a number of serious accusations which rocked the organisation in the summer.In August, whistleblowers accused the charity's leadership of misusing public funds, overseeing a \"toxic internal culture\", and failing to deliver on its mission.They said the Turing Institute, the UK's national body for artificial intelligence (AI), was on the brink of collapse after Peter Kyle, the then technology secretary,  threatened to withdraw its £100m funding.But speaking exclusively to the BBC, Chair Dr Doug Gurr said the whistleblower claims were \"independently investigated\" by a third party which found them to have \"no substance\".\"I fully sympathise that going through any transition is always challenging,\" he said. \"It's been challenging for a lot of people and a number of concerns have been raised.\"Every single one of those has been independently investigated and we've not found any substance.\"He did not name the third party which had carried out the investigation.But the Turing's woes go beyond the allegations themselves, with three senior directors, the chief technology officer and most recently the chief executive all leaving their jobs.It is also under investigation by the Charity Commission - and Dr Gurr did not give any indication he would consider standing down himself if it concluded there were issues.Instead, he said he loved his job and was proud of what the organisation had achieved under his tenure.Dr Gurr acknowledged for some staff it had been a \"tough\" period, but said he believed the Turing was now \"match fit\".\"There are two things that we have in the UK that are truly special,\" he said. \"We have fantastic talent and we have unbelievable data sets - let's get in, let's focus on those areas that really matter.\"He said he sympathised with staff who had criticised their workplace under his leadership, but did not apologise.And he agreed with Kyle, who is now business secretary, that the Institute should focus on defence - but added it would continue with other projects themed around the environment, sustainability and health.Current projects include increasing the accuracy of weather forecasting, reducing transport emissions, and cardiac research on human hearts using digital twins.Questions remain over how much overlap there will be between the Turing Institute's new direction and other UK agencies carrying out similar work - such as UKRI and the MOD - in addition to commercial tech firms.Dr Gurr acknowledged its defence work, which includes research on how best to secure the UK's national critical infrastructure, was \"not exclusive\" but said it was responding to a request at a time of need.\"The world probably feels like it's become a much more dangerous place over the last couple of years,\" he said.\"I think the other thing that's become very clear when you look at some of the theatres of conflict around the world is that data and technology is to play an increasingly critical role in whatever form of hostilities happen. \"The Turing has had a long track record of working in these spaces.\"But the original whistleblowers, who still remain working at the organisation, believe the reputation of the Institute is \"in tatters\" following recent events. They spoke to me on the condition of anonymity because they fear losing their jobs.\"This is not a new chapter for the Turing,\" they said.\"It is the same words under a new heading.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterHouse of CommonsMatt Collins and Tom Little KC gave evidence at the National Security Strategy Committee, made up of MPs and members of the House of Lords Key figures involved in the failed criminal case against two men accused of spying for China have given conflicting accounts to a parliamentary committee about why the case collapsed. In September, prosecutors dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who had been charged under the Official Secrets Act. Both men deny wrongdoing.The director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, had said the case could not progress because the government's deputy national security adviser, Matt Collins, was unwilling to classify China as an active threat to national security.However, Mr Collins told the committee he had been given legal advice that his evidence would be \"enough\".He said he always knew the case would be \"a challenge\" but that he had been \"trying to ensure that we could support a successful prosecution\". Mr Collins - who was set to be the government's witness in the trial - added: \"And so I was somewhat surprised when I was told on 3 September that the intention was to drop the case.\"In contrast Tom Little KC - who would have been the lead prosecuting barrister in the case - said he would be \"surprised\" if Mr Collins had not realised the prosecution would collapse unless he offered further evidence. Earlier in the session, Mr Little had said Mr Collins had been clear he would not say that \"China posed an active threat to national security at the material time\".\"That was in answer to what I regard as the million dollar question in the case, and once he had said that the current prosecution for those charges was effectively unsustainable,\" he added.He said the case was brought to \"a crashing halt\" when Mr Collins outlined the limits of what he would be wiling to say in court.Asked by the National Security Strategy Committee about the evidence he provided to prosecutors, Mr Collins said: \"What I was able to say is that China poses a range of threats to our national security. \"I was able to say that these include espionage threats, cyber threats, threats to our democratic institutions, threats to our economic security.\"I would be able to say that these threats are very real and persistent.\"He added he believed the CPS was asking him to \"use the generic term that China is a threat, or China is an active threat, which is not in line with government policy at the time\".Members of the committee pressed Mr Parkinson and Mr Little on why they felt Mr Collins had not provided enough evidence that China could be considered a threat.Labour peer Lord Paul Boateng noted that, in his evidence Mr Collins had said \"China's espionage operations threaten the UK's economic prosperity and resilience, and the integrity of our democratic institutions\".He argued the phrase would be enough to indicate \"we are dealing with an enemy\".Lord Mark Sedwill, a former national security adviser, suggested that if Mr Collins was only able to reflect the government view, the prosecution could have sought other witnesses who could have characterised China as a \"threat to national security\". However, Mr Little said the limits of Mr Collins' evidence would have derailed the case, regardless of what others said. Labour MP, and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Dame Emily Thornberry asked why prosecutors could not have trusted a jury to conclude China could be deemed a threat. Mr Parkinson argued that, without the key evidence from Mr Collins, a judge would not have let the case go to trial. Mr Collins submitted his first witness statement in December 2023, after which prosecutors decided they had enough evidence to charge Mr Cash and Mr Berry under the Official Secrets Act 1911. However, Mr Parkinson said a ruling in a separate court case in 2024 changed the requirements of what evidence would be needed and so prosecutors asked Mr Collins to provide further witness statements, in the hope he would label China a \"threat to national security\". In two further statements, Mr Collins detailed threats posed by China in cyberspace and to the UK's democratic institutions but avoided labelling the country \"a threat to national security\". The collapse of the case triggered a political row over who was to blame. The Conservatives have accused the Labour government of allowing the case to fail because it wanted to foster better relations with Beijing.However, the government said ministers had no role in providing evidence for the case and Mr Collins was giving evidence based on what Conservative government policy had been at the time.Mr Collins had a meeting with the top civil servant, Sir Chris Wormald, and National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell on 1 September, shortly before the case collapsed.Sir Chris told the committee that the meeting had been held to discuss how to handle \"different scenarios\" of the UK-China relationship.Mr Collins added that there had been \"at least four lawyers in the room who ensured that there was no discussion about the evidence\" in the case.The Conservatives will hold a vote in Parliament on Tuesday demanding the government releases various documents, including minutes of meetings where the case was discussed by civil servants or ministers.On Wednesday, the committee will hear evidence from Attorney General Lord Hermer and senior minister Darren Jones.

    "body": "Global efforts not enough to curb temperature rise, UN says ahead of climate summit1 hour agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesThe goal to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5C is failing badly according to a UN review of nations' carbon-cutting plans ahead of next week's COP30 summit.Only 64 countries have submitted new pledges to limit planet-warming gases this year, despite all being required to do so by now as part of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.While the UN review shows progress in curbing emissions over the next decade the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past global targets. The report underlines the scale of the task facing world leaders who head to Belém in northern Brazil next week for the COP30 climate gathering.Ten years after the Paris climate pact was agreed in 2015, the efforts of countries to restrict the rise in global temperatures are under renewed scrutiny.Every signatory agreed to submit a new carbon-cutting plan every five years, which would cover the next decade.But only 64 countries managed to put a new pledge in place this year, despite many extensions of the deadline. These represent around 30% of global emissions.In addition, the UN's review includes statements from China and the EU on their future plans made at Climate Week in New York in September.Taken together, the efforts mean that global emissions of carbon dioxide should fall by around 10% by 2035.However, scientists say that such a drop is nowhere near enough to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5C.To keep that goal alive will require steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, up to 57% by 2035, according to the UN last year.\"This report shows that we are going in the right direction but too slowly,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, often referred to as a key architect of the Paris Agreement.\"It is essential to acknowledge the missing national pledges and confront the persistent gap between ambition and actual implementation.\"The 1.5C limit, agreed at Paris, has long been seen as the threshold of very dangerous warming. In 2018, scientists outlined the massive benefits to the world of keeping the rise under 1.5C as compared to allowing them to rise to 2C. Passing 1.5C include more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, increased damage to coral reefs and growing threats to human health and livelihoods, UN scientists have said.However, that limit was breached in 2024 for a whole year for the first time. UN leaders are increasingly accepting the fact that the threshold will be breached permanently by the early 2030s at current rates.Getty ImagesBrazil's President Lula visits Belém ahead of COP30 in November\"One thing is already clear: we will not be able to contain the global warming below 1.5C in the next few years,\" UN secretary general António Guterres told delegates at a meeting of the World Meteorological Organisation last week.\"Overshooting is now inevitable. Which means that we're going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5C in the years to come.\"Despite this, the UN is keen to stress that there are some significant green shoots in the new report that provide hope.Many more countries are expected to lodge plans as their leaders gather for COP30 in Belém in Brazil.Large carbon producers such as India and Indonesia haven't yet unveiled their carbon plans. They will likely do so during COP30 and these may have a significant impact on the overall projections for 2035.Some countries are also likely to cut faster and deeper than they've promised, say experts.\"It's actually completely reasonable to look at China,\" said Todd Stern, former US Special Envoy for climate change.\"They'll put down a certain number, which is not great, and then they will overachieve it, and China does that a lot.\"The UN says they are confident that emissions globally will likely peak and start to decline in the next few years, for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century.They say the plans in place show clear stepping stones to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming \"greenhouse\" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere.One important factor is that the cuts assessed by the UN include the planned US pledge submitted under President Biden.While President Donald Trump has said he will pull out of the Paris agreement, that process is not completed yet, so the UN are keeping the US plans in their calculations even if these won't happen as planned.",

Work is well under way, with more suitable sites being brought forward to ease pressure on communities and cut asylum costs.\"Around 32,000 asylum seekers are currently being accommodated in hotels, a drop from a peak of more than 56,000 in 2023 but 2,500 more than last year.A report on Monday found billions of taxpayers' money had been \"squandered\" on asylum accommodation.The Home Affairs Committee said \"flawed contracts\" and \"incompetent delivery\" had resulted in the Home Office relying on hotels as \"go-to solutions\" rather than temporary stop-gaps, with expected costs tripling to more than £15bn.Commenting on the report's findings, Sir Keir said he was \"determined\" to close all asylum hotels, adding: \"I can't tell you how frustrated and angry I am that we've been left with a mess as big as this by the last government.\"Two former military sites - MDP Wethersfield, a former RAF base in Essex, and Napier Barracks, a former military base in Kent - are already being used to house asylum seekers after being opened under the previous Tory government.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorThe government is facing a bigger-than-expected hole in the public finances as it prepares for next month's Budget.A downgrade to the UK's productivity performance from the government's official forecaster could lead to the chancellor facing a £20bn gap in meeting her tax and spending rules, the BBC understands.Rachel Reeves has confirmed both tax rises and spending cuts are options in next month's Budget.The Treasury declined to comment on \"speculation\" ahead of the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) final forecast, which will be published on 26 November alongside the Budget.The OBR will deliver its final draft forecast, including productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - to the Treasury on Friday.The forecaster had previously assumed a partial bounce back in productivity growth, but this has never materialised.This productivity assumption is essential to long-term growth prospects and so, under the current system, even a small change can alter how much money a Budget needs to raise by several billion pounds.The OBR is understood to have downgraded forecast for productivity by 0.3 percentage points - a figure first reported by the Financial Times - bringing its assumption closer to that of the Bank of England.The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank has calculated that for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to the Budget hole.The changes open up an initial gap of some £20bn, rather than the £10-£14bn widely anticipated.Such a hole could be plugged by hiking taxes, reducing public spending or increasing government borrowing.Reeves has set out two main Budget rules, which she has described as \"non-negotiable\". These are: Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliamentTo get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliamentReeves admitted on Monday to business leaders in Saudi Arabia that the OBR was \"likely to downgrade productivity\" which has been \"very poor since the financial crisis and Brexit\". The OBR is expected to explain the decision in detail, but some ministers have privately pointed out that if it had done this earlier, different choices could have been made at this summer's Spending Review.There are many other moving parts in the Budget which may bring better news for the chancellor, such as the decline in the interest rates paid on government debt.However, with other pressures such as the U-turns on welfare spending and a desire to rebuild a bigger buffer in the public finances, speculation is pointing towards significant tax rises, including some possible breaches of manifesto commitments such as changes to income tax.The Treasury will inform the OBR of its first draft Budget measures next week.",

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterAmazon is planning major job cuts among its corporate workers as soon as this week, multiple media outlets have reported.The online retail giant plans to lay off as many as 30,000 employees as part of cost-cutting measures led by chief executive Andy Jassy, according to the Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Each cited sources stating the same number of layoffs.Amazon declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.If confirmed, the layoffs could be one of the largest seen in recent months. It would be Amazon's biggest cuts since 2022, when the company let go of around 27,000 workers over several months.Amazon's layoff plans were also reported by CNBC and the New York Times, citing sources familiar with the matter. The reports did not say where in the world job cuts will be made. The number of potential layoffs would be around 10% of the company's corporate headcount, but still a small fraction of Amazon's total workforce, which has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide.The company has around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures that Amazon submitted to the US government last year.Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services.Amazon boss Mr Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) tools to boost efficiency.Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks.\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" he said then.",

    "body": "Sudan's military chief has confirmed the army's withdrawal from its last western stronghold of el-Fasher after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) declared control of the city.In a televised address, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said he had approved the withdrawal in response to the \"systematic destruction and killing of civilians\".He said he had agreed with local leaders to \"leave and go to a safe place to protect the remaining citizens and the rest of the city from destruction\".The UN has raised the alarm over reports of atrocities committed by the RSF in recent days, and has called for safe passage for trapped civilians. The RSF have denied accusations they were killing civilians.The fall of el-Fasher could mark a significant turning point in Sudan's civil war, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million people since April 2023.The city's capture gives the RSF control over all five state capitals in Darfur, consolidating its parallel administration in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur.On Monday, the UN head, Antonio Guterres, said he was \"gravely concerned\" over the situation in el-Fasher, and condemned the reported \"violations of international humanitarian law\".He said the 18-month siege of el-Fasher - and the surrounding North Darfur region - have been an epicentre of suffering, with malnutrition, disease and violence claiming lives every day.The UN Human Rights Office also warned that the number of large-scale, ethnically motivated violations and atrocities in el-Fasher was increasing.\"States with influence must act to prevent atrocities by RSF and allied fighters; accountability is key,\" it said in a statement.In his address, Gen Burhan denounced inaction by the international community to end atrocities, and vowed to fight \"until this land is purified\".\"We can turn the tables every time, and we can return every land desecrated by these traitors to the nation's fold,\" he said.El-Fasher was the army's last foothold in the vast western region of Darfur and had since May last year endured a worsening siege, causing a severe shortage of food.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondent  and Lucy Hooker,Business ReporterEPAGrowing concern among drivers, who say they struggle to drive at night due to the dazzle from oncoming lights, is prompting the government to take a closer look at the design of cars and headlamps on UK roads, the BBC understands.Research into the issue on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT), conducted last winter, has still not been published.However, the government now plans to launch a new assessment of the causes and remedies, the BBC has learned.New measures will be included in the government's upcoming Road Safety Strategy, reflecting what is becoming an increasingly fraught issue for road users.Both Ruth Goldsworthy and Sally Burt say bright headlamps makes it harder for them to get to their weekly SO Sound choir meetings in Totton, in Hampshire.\"Some of the lights are so bright you are blinded by them, for seconds,\" says Ruth.Drivers say it is LED headlamps, increasingly common in new vehicles, that are causing them problems. The beam is whiter, more focused and brighter than the more diffuse light from halogen lamps fitted in older cars.\"I'm not sure where to look, I look into the gutter,\" says Sally. They are both relieved if someone else offers to drive.Evening driving becomes a bigger problem as the winter evenings draw in, and especially after the clocks change, which means more people are driving home after dark.The problem is worse for older people, whose eyes take around nine seconds to recover from glare, compared to one second for a 16-year-old, according to road safety consultant, Rob Heard.\"In severe cases, we might need to stop until our sight can recuperate,\" he said.A new survey from the motoring organisation, the RAC, has found that more than a third of drivers are nervous about getting behind the wheel as the evenings get darker. Three quarters of respondents said driving was getting more difficult due to brighter lights.Ruth Goldsworthy (L) and Sally Burt (R) both say they are put off night-driving by the glare from brighter headlampsThe RAC's senior policy officer, Rod Dennis, said so far little progress has been made on tackling glare, with regulations governing headlights dating back to 1989.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We know headlight glare is frustrating for many drivers, especially as the evenings get darker.\"What to do in the face of brighter headlamps:Ensure your windscreen is cleanWear glasses and keep them cleanAvoid looking straight ahead, instead focus on the edge of the roadDo not wear night sunglasses sold for night-driving, as they reduce overall light and won't reduce glare.Source: College of OptometristsNew researchThe results of last winter's government commissioned research into the \"causes and impact of glare\" have been delayed since the summer but are now expected in the next few weeks, the DfT said.They will inform the upcoming Road Safety Strategy, which is also expected to tighten rules on drink-driving and eye-sight tests for older drivers.In addition the BBC understands the government is commissioning new research into the role of vehicle design in causing glare, and possible solutions, which will feed into international discussion of the issue.Getty ImagesLED lamps give off a blue-white lightOne already well-understood source of glare is drivers retrofitting their vehicles, replacing old halogen bulbs with LEDs.The housing for halogen bulbs is not compatible with LED bulbs, and a retrofitted car will not pass its annual MOT check-up.As part of the government's new approach the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has \"stepped up surveillance\" to stop the sale of illegal retrofit headlamp bulbs, the DfT said. Seeing betterCars sold with LED lights can improve road safety, Thomas Broberg, senior advisor for safety at Volvo told the BBC.\"Headlights have become brighter over the years to help drivers see better,\" he said.\"You want to have a lot of light in front of you to understand where the road is going.\"However avoiding dazzle was \"equally important\", he said.\"I would say poor aiming of the headlights and also the road shape are the major factors for glare,\" he told the BBC.For larger vehicles, such as SUVs, where lamps are higher off the ground, there is a requirement for the beam to point more sharply downwards, to protect oncoming drivers. But the angle can be affected by how many passengers it is carrying.Some new cars with \"adaptive features\" adjust the lamps automatically if there is a change in load, but cars without that will need manual adjusting, Mr Broberg said.Some new cars also have automatic headlamp dipping, which lowers the lights when an oncoming vehicle is detected.Getty Images/Stephen Robinson PicturesThree quarters of drivers surveyed by the RAC said bright lights were making night driving harder.However, Daniel Harriman-McCartney, clinical advisor at the College of Optometrists, said automatic dimming features can be \"slow to kick in\".\"If it only works when the car is closer than it needs to be, or doesn't work for cyclists, that can be a problem,\" he said.He is seeing an increasing number of patients concerned about headlamp glare, he added.Dazzling headlights are cited as a factor in around 250 accidents a year, but there is no evidence that brighter lights are causing more collisions than previously, the RAC concedes.Instead, worried drivers may simply be \"taking the risk off the road\" by not driving at night, with a big social impact, the RAC's Mr Dennis warned.He would like to see action that \"strikes a balance\".\"We don't want to go back to worse headlights. It is about what is bright enough.\"",

Now, decades later - and to the delight of Millennials - Scott, Ritchie, J, Sean and Abz are back. \"It was too much too fast. Way too fast,\" Abz tells me, while Ritchie explains it was \"like being strapped to a rocket\". \"I think I was just in survival mode for five years, because I can't remember a thing,\" Sean adds, who was just 15 when the band was formed. They have invited me into the rehearsal studio ahead of their upcoming tour, 25 years after they were last on the road together. And it's clear they're much more comfortable this time around, with J saying they feel \"spectacularly fortunate\" to have a second chance.

What if we think it's going to be this big thing and everyone goes, so what?'\"'Could we still perform together?'But fortunately, the group's fans did care, and the band's arena tour of the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand is almost sold out. \"We knew we'd done well but I don't think we realised how well our younger selves had done. And how much we'd affected some peoples lives and how much they'd loved us,\" Ritchie says.Another thing the band were unsure about was the prospect of singing and dancing together again.Sean explains: \"We sold a tour without even knowing [we could do it]. We believed it but we had to get into rehearsals to actually find out, but we can confirm it's still there!\"GettyFive at the Brit Awards 2025The band are now all in their 40s but had barely left school when they formed. It was clearly an overwhelming time. Ritchie tells me: \"We got into it very young and we thought we'd won the lottery and all our dreams were coming true. In many ways, they did, but in some ways it turned into a nightmare psychologically, [there were] a lot of things we weren't expecting.\"We'd wake up on a tour bus and think, not what country are we in, but what continent are we in?\"J agrees: \"There are loads of blank spots in our memories, and we've spoken about it and come to the conclusion that it was all so fast, and we were in flight or fight mode for the whole thing. It was like you were being chased by something.\"So after all that time apart, I want to know who made the first move about the prospect of reuniting. Scott says that not even being in the same room with his four former bandmates for over 20 years had been playing on his mind. \"I phoned Abz and I hadn't spoken to him for 10 years, and one of the first things he said to me was 'It's so nice to hear your voice'. So we just got together - it wasn't about a tour, it was about being friends again.\"No one outside this bubble knows what we went through,\" he adds.

Ritchie says he had \"performer insecurity\" and feared the crowd wouldn't know who they were, \"but it went off\". Sean adds that Robbie \"knew everything we've been through\", adding the six of them sat for two hours chatting.On the emotional trauma Five went through, Scott says Robbie told them it was like \"carrying a big bag of rocks and you need to empty it day by day.\"For J, the whole experience of being back in the band is \"the antithesis of what it was before.\"\"The people we've got around us, how we're being managed. how we're being looked after, which is the most important thing. We were last time but people were kind of learning on the job.\"They've reconciled and reunited now but would Five go back in time and do it all again? Abz says he would \"but differently\", while Ritchie laughs: \"With this head, I'd love to do it, because I'd be checking the accounts a lot more!\"Five: Still Movin' is on the BBC iPlayer from Tuesday 28 October. Five begin their tour on Wednesday 29 October in Cardiff. ",

    "body": "Men with suspected prostate cancer will be able to get a diagnosis from the NHS within a day, under a new trial hailed as a potential \"game changer\" for identifying and treating the disease.The 15 hospitals taking part will use AI technology to interpret MRI scans and spot areas of abnormal tissue within minutes, according to NHS England.Scans showing a high-cancer risk will be triaged as priority review for a radiologist and patients will be booked for a same-day biopsy.Around one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lives, according to Prostate Cancer UK, with research showing it has overtaken breast cancer as the most commonly diagnosed form of the disease in the UK.But unlike breast cancer, there is currently no national screening programme for prostate cancer.Under current best-practice guidelines, men should receive an MRI and biopsy within a week of urgent GP referral - but waits can be longer depending on radiologist capacity.Data released earlier this month showed that NHS waiting lists have risen for three consecutive months. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the trial would cut \"needlessly distressing\" wait times and improve outcomes for patients.\"By harnessing the power of technology we are revolutionising our NHS,\" he said.The AI software, called Pi, has been developed by Lucida Medical and promoted for its speed and efficiency.\"MRI in the morning, biopsy in the afternoon,\" Dr Oliver Hulson wrote on the developer's website.According to the National Prostate Cancer Audit, 58,218 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in England in 2024 - with a rise of more than 5000 diagnoses from the year prior. Professor Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer at the NHS, said he hoped the technology could be a \"game changer and help save men weeks of worry and uncertainty\".Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said Pi could save men the \"prolonged anxiety and the bother of hospital trips, while also increasing capacity for our hard-working NHS workforce\".The announcement of the trial precedes the release of the government's National Cancer Plan, expected later this year.",

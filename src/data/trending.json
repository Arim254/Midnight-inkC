    "body": "Image source, SNSByMartin Dowden & Richard WintonBBC Sport ScotlandRangers captain James Tavernier insists his side can still reach the knockout stages of the Europa League despite taking just one point from their opening five fixtures.Ten-man Sporting Braga capitalised on Nasser Djiga's defensive error to earn a 1-1 draw at Ibrox after Rodrigo Zalazar was sent off for headbutting Nicolas Raskin.Tavernier had put Rangers ahead in first-half injury-time after Gabri Martinez handled, with the prolific full back's finish equaling former striker Ally McCoist's record of 21 European goals for the club.The draw ends Rangers' seven-game European losing streak, but with trips to Ferencvaros and Porto, either side of the visit of Ludogorets, to come and nine points needed to advance last season, progression would seem a long-shot.\"It feels almost like a loss,\" Tavernier conceded. \"Being a Rangers player, you have to win every single game. That's what we have to do from now to the end of this competition. \"It's definitely not over, but we have to build from this.\"Djiga contrived to head the ball into Martinez's path under no pressure to gift Braga a point, the defender appearing to lose the flight of the ball in swirling conditions.With John Souttar and Derek Cornelius injured, Djigi was paired with Emmanuel Fernandez, with the former ultimately costing Rangers a vital win.\"I've got no complaint with Nasser, everyone makes a mistake, but we ultimately should have that game tied up before that even happens,\" Tavernier added.\"We have to be more patient, probing around their final third instead of trying to shoot maybe when it's not on. I've spoken about it before, about being clinical in both boxes, and we've got to do that.\"If we keep it clean sheet, we win. That's our aim as a team, to keep clean sheets. We should have had that in our pocket with the 10 men that we were playing against.\"'No question we're going in right direction' - what Rohl saidMedia caption, 'First time I felt Rangers competitive in Europe' - RohlRangers boss Danny Rohl: \"I think it's disappointing but I look at the first 60 minutes. It was the first time I felt my team has been competitive in Europe. I think it's a step forward. But in the end we have to win and close the gaps.\"In the second half, I felt we controlled the game. And then it's one moment, we made one mistake and conceded a goal. This goal looks very cheap. I'm not looking for excuses in this case. I know in the second half the wind gave a lot of problems.\"We have to improve to play 90 minutes at our highest level.\"You can see the table. We didn't lose the opportunity just today. It's about the past four games. I've been here for four weeks and for 60 minutes I see a big difference.\"Today I really see the progress in our team performance. There is no question mark that it goes in the right direction. In European competition you cannot make many mistakes and this is something we have to work on.\"For me it's not about the character of the group when I see how hard they work since I'm here, how much effort they put in. There is of course pressure, there is expectation, you have to deliver.\"'I'm not sure they're capable of better' - what the pundits saidFormer Rangers striker & manager Ally McCoist: \"My concern, and it's a big concern, is I'm not sure the team is capable of a lot better than that. I really hope I'm wrong. \"You can't make mistakes like the goal they conceded. I'm not sure these players can take Rangers to the next level. There's an awful lot of work to be done.\"Former Rangers midfielder Andy Halliday: \"I think one of the biggest criticisms you've got is that mental side. It just seems as if there's these lapses of concentration.\"It's just a nothing ball into the box. There's no striker or no Braga opponent anywhere near Djiga. He completely misjudges the flight of the ball.\"What the fans saidGary: Rohl has seriously lost the plot if he thinks that is 100% progress. What's he on, because  the supporters need it after that.Jonny: Djiga and Fernandez aren't good enough. Danilo and Aarons are better but still not good enough. Chermiti isn't good enough. This team needs gutted. I'm sick of watching Tav lose it and start shouting and bawling at them all. Gary: That Rangers team is terrible. One of the worst to ever don't the famous blue jersey. Not one of them deserves to be playing for the club. That's how badly we've plummeted.Denis: Rangers, what a load of rubbish. Team has no backbone, there are a lot of players that are just not good enough. January can't come quick enough. Hopefully the manager will get the support he needs to bring in better players.David: Another dismal pedestrian performance from Rangers, how fans can pay to watch that team every week is beyond me.Steven: Let's accept Rangers are not reaching the next round. Even if we'd achieved a result tonight, we can't beat Porto - not with this defence.Get in touchSend us your views on Rangers",

    "body": "7 hours agoCachella SmithandDaniel Sandford,UK correspondentEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockNet migration to the UK fell by two-thirds in the year ending June 2025 compared with the previous 12 months, provisional figures indicate.The difference between the number of people arriving in the country and those leaving was 204,000, down from 649,000, with the fall mainly driven by fewer arrivals for work and study reasons, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.It comes as Home Office figures show the number of people who claimed asylum in the year to September 2025 reached a record high of 110,051.The figures also show the number of asylum seekers in hotels as of September rose by 2% compared with the same time last year.The statistics form part of two separate releases published on Thursday - the ONS release on net migration to the year ending June 2025, and Home Office figures on the immigration system for the year ending September 2025.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told GB News that the fall in net migration is a \"step in the right direction\".This is the first set of ONS statistics on migration that covers nearly all of Labour's first year in government.The Home Office numbers show initial decisions on asylum claims have increased to 133,502 people receiving an initial decision across the year - almost half of which (45%) were granted.\"Decision making has reached a historically high level and the numbers of cases awaiting an initial decision fell 36% between September 2024 and September 2025, despite a record high number of asylum claims in this period,\" the release said.The backlog of those waiting for a first decision has been declining steadily across the year, but there has been a growing backlog of appeals.The government has committed to end the use of asylum hotels by the end of this parliament.More than 36,000 people were being temporarily housed in hotels in September, Thursday's figures show.This is up 13% on the last three months, but due to fluctuation over the last year represents a smaller increase - of 2% -  from September 2024.It is lower than the peak of 56,018 people in hotels at the end of September 2023.It follows legal battles over the use of hotels with Epping Forest District Council saying earlier this week they would appeal against a High Court decision that rejected its case to close Epping's Bell Hotel to asylum seekers.Responding to Thursday's statistics, a Home Office spokesperson said there were fewer than 200 hotels in use as they vowed \"to close every single one\".\"We are furious at the levels of illegal migrants and asylum hotels.\"Work is well under way to move illegal migrants into military bases to ease pressure on communities across the country.\"Small boat arrivals saw an increase of 53% compared with the previous year, with 45,659 arriving via this route in the 12 months to September 2025. The Home Office release sets out that this figure is close to the 2022 peak which was 45,774.\"The increase in arrivals in 2025 has coincided with an increase in the average number of people arriving per small boat,\" it added.Some 5,151 children (under 18s) crossed the Channel in small boats and claimed asylum in this time period - 2,700 of whom were accompanied.The prime minister's spokesperson said the government \"accepts that the number of small boat crossings is too high\".Separately, 153 migrants have been removed from the UK to France under the pilot \"one in one out\" scheme.A return flight today included the individual who was removed on 16 October and returned to the UK via small boat on 8 November (he has not been counted twice).A total of 134 people have been brought to the UK through this scheme.The figures released by the ONS, on net migration, take into account those who are claiming asylum in the UK after having entered via both regular and irregular routes - as well as other forms of immigration. They relate to people who have changed their place of residence for a period of 12 months or more.The overall figure saw a dramatic fall to June 2025, and comes alongside a drop of approximately 70% in arrivals of non-EU+ nationals on work and study dependent  visas. (EU+ refers to people from EU countries plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.)Responding to the net migration figures, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government would be \"going further\" as she referenced the pressure of migration on local communities.\"Net migration is at its lowest level in half a decade and has fallen by more than two-thirds under this government,\" she said in a statement.\"Last week, I announced reforms to our migration system to ensure that those who come here must contribute and put in more than they take out.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp, reacting to the figures, said the fall had been driven by Conservative reforms \"but we need to go much further\".Meanwhile, Reform UK's head of policy Zia Yusuf said there is \"no better example of Labour's warped priorities than today's migration figures\".Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson, Max Wilkinson, said the figures show the government needs to \"get a grip on small boat arrivals and the use of asylum hotels\".Earlier this month, Mahmood set out proposals to reform the legal migration system including changes to how long it could take some migrants to achieve settled status. It followed a variety of measures to tackle illegal migration such as changing how the right to family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is applied in migration court cases.Migration experts have indicated the net migration numbers - which cover the year ending June 2025 - could reflect measures brought in by the Conservatives such as the increase in salary threshold which was introduced in June 2024.Senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, Peter Walsh, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"For the most complete and accurate picture, it takes at least a year for policy changes to show up in the statistics.\"That's the definition of a long-term international migrant (someone who changes their usual country of residence for at least one year).\"Additional reporting by Robert Cuffe, head of statistics",

    "body": "Track UK's latest migration numbers - including asylum, visas and small boats11 hours agoBBCNet migration to the UK - the number of people arriving, minus those leaving - has fallen close to pre-Covid levels, according to official figures published on Thursday.How does that sit alongside other key migration measures, including overall immigration, small boat arrivals and visas granted? Scroll down to find out more about the latest key figures, and get answers to key questions on a range of topics.Produced by: Rob England, Libby Rogers, Jess Carr, John Walton, Becky Dale, Allison Shultes, Chris Kay, Steven Connor and Scott Jarvis. Graphics by: Jez Frazer and Zoe BartholomewAbout the data*The figure for net migration will not sum exactly to the total of immigration minus emigration, because it is published as a rounded figure by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Figures from government or other official sources used in this report can be revised retrospectively between publications. This page only displays data as it is presented in the latest release.ONS figures for immigration and emigration are update twice per year.Small boats figures from the Home Office are updated daily. Asylum, returns and visa figures from the Home Office are updated every three months. The number of people appealing against a refused asylum decision is updated every three months by the Ministry of Justice at a different time to other government figures on asylum. Immigration, emigration and net migrationFigures for net migration come from the ONS and use the internationally recognised definition of a long-term migrant: \"a person who moves to a country other than that of their usual residence for at least a year.\"Visas for legal migrationData for total entries via visas only includes those granted. It does not include people coming to the UK on a visitor visa or those on a transit visa - whose final destination is not the UK.Visa figures do not show if or when an individual arrived in the UK, but marks the point at which they were granted permission to do so.If someone was granted more than one visa within the year shown, each one is counted separately.The work category refers to new individuals linked to visas and permits, or the extension of an existing permission. This includes sub-categories such as seasonal, health and care, domestic and youth mobility visas.Study visas include all sponsored individuals by approved education providers in the UK, and those on short-term study visas.Family visas lets someone come to the UK or stay longer so they can live with close family members who are already here. It includes joining a spouse, partner, child or parent, or coming to care for a relative.The Other category refers to miscellaneous visas outside the categories of work, family and study. It includes humanitarian routes such as the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme and the British National Overseas route.It also includes family permits for people from countries in the European Union or European Economic Area.Asylum applications and hotelsFigures for asylum seekers in hotels are published by the Home Office under the \"contingency accommodation - hotel\" category.The number of people in all other forms of accommodation includes those in non-hotel contingency accommodation, plus initial, dispersal and \"other\" accommodation.A scale is used to determine how close a local authority is from the average share of the population for an area in the UK. It compares the share in that area to the share across all areas in the UK that use that form of accommodation.Less than half = more than 50% below the average share of the populationLower than = between 25% to 50% below the average share of the population About the same as = within 25% of the average share of the populationHigher than = between 25% to 100% above the average share of the populationMore than double = more than 100% above the average share of the populationFigures on the backlog of people waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application include both applicants and dependants.The number of open appeals against refused asylum applications refers to individuals.Small boat crossings and other illegal arrivalsThe figures for small boat crossings and the average number of people per boat are derived from the UK Home Office's daily timeseries.Entering the UK without permission is an offence under immigration law, but asylum seekers are generally not prosecuted for doing so if they claim asylum on arrival. In some cases, people have been prosecuted for entering the UK without permission alongside other offences, such as people smuggling or re-entering after deportation.The International Organization for Migration (IOM) collects figures for people who died or went missing while crossing from mainland Europe to the UK.These reports are based on  French and UK officials (such as police or coastguard) or media sources, and are considered an undercount by the IOM due to a lack of official statistics.The figures can include people who died in the Channel while crossing, but also those who died at any point while en route to a crossing point.Data for modern slavery only includes final decisions. Modern slavery includes any form of human trafficking, slavery, servitude or forced labour.Figures for other entries without permission are the sum of all irregular arrivals that were not by small boat, including inadequately documented air arrivals, recorded detections at UK ports and other recorded detections in the UK.Returns and deportations from the UKFigures on people who come to the UK but are denied entry at that point and then leave the country are not included in the number of returns in this page.People being returned after being convicted of a criminal offence includes people who are not British citizens who have been convicted in the UK of any criminal offence, or convicted abroad for a serious criminal offence.Returns involving the government include the Home Office categories of enforced returns (also known as deportations) as well as assisted and controlled voluntary returns.Independent returns are referred to by the government as other verified returns.UK migration compared with other countriesSea arrivals figures are taken from the UNHCR European sea arrivals dashboard and combined with UK Home Office figures for small boat arrivals.Asylum applications, immigration and emigration figures for European countries is the latest available data from Eurostat for the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway, Switzerland and Croatia.Population figures for the UK are from ONS, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency 2024 mid-year estimates, and for Europe from Eurostat data as of 1 January 2024.In order to account for smaller populations and make European data comparable with the UK, when calculating figures for net migration and asylum applications, European countries with a population of less than one million have been excluded.Additionally, when calculating net migration, only countries which include asylum seekers or refugees in their immigration figures are included, these are:Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal correspondentIrish author Sally Rooney has told the High Court it is \"almost certain\" she cannot publish new novels in the UK and may have to withdraw her current books because of the banning of Palestine Action under terrorism laws.Rooney says UK legislation may mean she cannot be paid royalties by her British publisher or the BBC because it could leave both at risk of being accused of funding terrorism.In August she said she intended to use royalties \"to go on supporting Palestine Action.\"The group was banned in July after the home secretary accused it of causing serious damage to property. Its co-founder is challenging that ban in the High Court, arguing it interferes with the right to protest.The author of Normal People, which was adapted into one of the most watched BBC dramas of recent years, has supported the campaign to reverse the ban.In two witness statements provided to the High Court, Rooney said she believed that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza - and Palestine Action's activity in the UK was from a \"long and proud tradition of civil disobedience - the deliberate breaking of laws as an act of protest.\"She goes on: \"I myself have publicly advocated the use of direct action, including property sabotage, in the cause of climate justice. It stands to reason that I should support the same range of tactics in the effort to prevent genocide.\"Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence.Rooney said the ban on Palestine Action under terrorism laws also had far reaching consequences for her as an author and her right to free expression.She explained she periodically receives royalties from the BBC's adaptions.In August she declared in an Irish Times article that she intended to use those royalties \"to go on supporting Palestine Action.\"Following that statement, she said she had been advised that any such payment to her for those televised dramatisations could be a breach of terrorism laws.That warning had come from the independent producer of the two BBC dramatisations of her novels. It told her agent that it had received \"unambiguous legal advice\" that if it knew or suspected that Rooney was using royalties from the TV dramas to fund Palestine Action, then sending her the money would be a terrorism offence.\"It is therefore unclear whether any UK company can continue to make payments to me, even when it had agreed to do so,\" said Rooney.Rooney told the court that this legal uncertainty affected her rights as an artist - and her publisher's too.\"If ... Faber & Faber Limited are legally prohibited from paying me the royalties I am owed, my existing works may have to be withdrawn from sale,\" she said.\"My novels have been influential and popular in Britain, where I am among the best-selling literary authors of the last decade.\"The disappearance of my work from bookshops would mark a truly extreme incursion by the state into the realm of artistic expression.\"It is also almost certain that I can no longer publish or produce any new work within the UK while this proscription remains in effect.\"Rooney publicly revealed in September that she did not believe she could travel to the UK anymore because of her stance.\"I am and will continue to be a committed supporter of Palestine Action. If that support is criminalised, I will effectively be prevented from speaking at any future public events in the UK.\"Is it likely that I could ever again collaborate with British public institutions like the BBC as I have done in the past?\"The hearing continues through Thursday with a final day of submissions next week.",

    "body": "One of the two members of the National Guard who were shot in Washington DC on Wednesday has died, US President Donald Trump said. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries, President Trump said on Thursday evening. The second National Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, \"is fighting for his life\", he said. Both were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Police arrested one suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old from Afghanistan.President Trump confirmed Ms Beckstrom's death while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members. \"Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person ... She's just passed away. She's no longer with us,\" he said.Ms Beckstrom had volunteered to work in the nation's capital over the American Thanksgiving holiday, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News after the shooting.Jim Justice, a Republican senator from West Virginia, said he was \"absolutely devastated\" to learn of Ms Beckstrom's passing. \"Our prayers are with her family, friends, and fellow guardsmen during an incredibly difficult Thanksgiving Day,\" he said in a statement.\"We are also lifting up Andrew Wolfe in prayer as he continues his journey to recovery.\"Both soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets, an area where many office workers mill around at lunchtime.More than 2,000 troops have been guarding the nation's capital since August, when the president began deploying troops to cities to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, also meant a number of law enforcement officials were quickly on the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman.The suspect was shot four times while he was apprehended, law enforcement sources told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner.Officials said Mr Lakanwal came to the US from Afghanistan in 2021.He will be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed as well as possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said on Thursday morning at a news conference, before news of Ms Beckstrom's death. \"We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree,\" Pirro added. \"But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge: murder in the first degree.\"Attorney General Bondi told Fox News on Thursday that her office will seek the death penalty against the suspect, calling him a \"monster who should not have been in our country\".Mr Lakanwal reportedly came to the US under a programme named Operation Allies Welcome, which offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of America's withdrawal from Afghanistan.He had helped guard US forces at Kabul airport in 2021 as thousands scrambled to escape Afghanistan before the Taliban took power, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC's Afghan Service.The suspect had been recruited to Unit 03 of the Kandahar Strike Force. His unit was known locally as Scorpion Forces, operating initially under the CIA but eventually for the Afghan intelligence department known as the National Directorate of Security.Mr Lakanwal was a GPS tracker specialist, the former commander told the BBC, describing him as a \"sporty and jolly character\".His whole unit was moved from Kandahar to Kabul five days before the Taliban entered the capital. They continued to protect the airport for another six days, before they too were airlifted out to the US.At a press conference on Thursday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Mr Lakanwal's connection to US forces, saying the suspect \"had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces\", before moving to the US.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application had been granted earlier this year, an official told CBS.On Thursday, Joseph Edlow US Citizenship and Immigration Services chief said the president had directed him to conduct \"a full scale, rigorous re-examination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern\".When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.Hafizullah Maroof and Sayed Abdullah Nizami of BBC Afghan Service contributed to this report",

    "body": "22 minutes agoThe government's plans to drop unfair dismissal safeguards for new employees on the first day of a new job leads many of Friday's papers. \"Day-one dismissal protection axed\" is the lead in the Financial Times, as Labour \"caved to pressure from businesses to soften its workers' rights legislation\". The Daily Telegraph also leads with Labour \"abandoning plans to allow employees to sue for unfair dismissal on day one of their employment\". The paper says it is the \"second manifesto breach in as many days\", following the Budget's \"threshold freeze on income tax\". \"Labour U-turn on worker rights\" is the i paper's take on the government's plan to wind back proposals for day-one dismissal protections. The move is \"criticised by Labour MPs but welcomed by business\", according to the paper. The unfair dismissal threshold will extend to six months, the Guardian reports, under a compromise deal accepted by the TUC. It writes the TUC accepts the arrangement, with general secretary Paul Nowak saying other parts of the workers' rights bill, such as \"day-one sick pay\", are an \"absolute priority\". The Times reports that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faces a \"revolt from Labour MPs\" after scrapping day-one protections, saying the policy was \"championed\" by former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner.New ONS migration figures showing a drop in UK arrivals is the Metro lead story. \"Only 204,000 more people are living in the UK\" reads the headline, noting \"asylum arrivals rising\" while \"fewer coming here to study and work\". The paper quotes Sir Keir who \"hails migration fall\" as he faces \"pressure from Reform UK on migrant arrivals.Britain faces a \"brain drain\", the Daily Mail says, citing migration data revealing \"an exodus of young Britons while asylum seekers now make up nearly half of net migration\".Sir Keir's defence of the Budget leads the Independent. \"Keir Starmer forced to deny he misled public over record £26bn tax rises,\" is the paper's top line, as he denies Labour broke its manifesto pledge \"not to hike tax on working people\", citing criticism from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Terry Smith, Rachel Reeves's uncle, tells the Sun: \"Britain's being fleeced by my niece\", compounding other critics who describe the Budget \"as a bonanza for benefit claimants\". Reeves's 73-year-old uncle joins a \"long line of detractors\", the paper writes.Meanwhile, the Daily Express leads with calls from terminally-ill campaigners pushing for the Lords to end delays to passing an assisted dying law. They say peers' amendments opposing the original bill are \"stealing precious time and choice\", the paper writes. A potential fresh lead in the Jill Dando murder is reported on by the Daily Mirror. The Crimewatch host was shot dead on her doorstop in 1999 and the paper says investigators are probing \"a newly unearthed picture\" of what the paper claims is \"a Serbian assassin\".\"Jack (Osbourne) plots huge comeback\", reads the headline on the Daily Star's front page, saying the I'm a Celebrity... Get me out of here! contestant has been \"secretly filming a paranormal series in a bid to be a huge TV host\". Related Internet Links",

The Home Office said the third man was a naturalised British citizen aged 43.They are being held on suspicion of facilitating illegal entry to the UK and facilitating illegal working.Earlier this month, the BBC found more than 100 mini-marts, car washes and barber shops operating from Dundee to south Devon, were linked to a crime network.Andy Radcliffe, Assistant Director from Immigration Enforcement, is leading an investigation into the BBC's allegations involving HMRC, the National Crime Agency, Companies House, police forces and Trading Standards.An investigation was \"immediately launched\" after the BBC's report, he said, with teams building \"an intelligence picture in the matter of a few weeks\".Mr Radcliffe added this was just the start of the investigation \"to try and tackle the widespread abuse\".\"We're taking this very seriously...people could go to prison for this, we could take assets off them, so we're taking it very seriously,\" he said.Earlier this month, the BBC revealed evidence of criminal networks organising and profiting from undocumented working in barber shops, mini-marts and carwashes across the UK.The Home Office launched an \"urgent investigation\" involving police forces across the country after the BBC uncovered more than 100 businesses linked to a suspected Kurdish crime network enabling migrants to work illegally and sell counterfeit cigarettes in High Street mini-marts.The BBC investigation found an asylum seeker, who says his claim was rejected, trying to sell a mini-mart for £18,000 cash.Undercover reporters also exposed a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had \"customers in every city\" and could wipe illegal working fines worth up to £60,000.Loose regulation of Britain's labour market is acting as a pull factor for those entering the UK illegally, the government has acknowledged.The Home Office launched an \"urgent investigation\" involving police forces across the country after the BBC reportHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood said these kinds of criminal networks \"create an incentive for people to come here illegally\".Questioned by the BBC, last week, on whether the government has lost control of High Streets to Kurdish organised crime gangs, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"What your reporters were able to scrutinise and show is absolutely evidence of why our system is broken.\"It's why this government has been cracking down on illegal working.\"In the Budget, the chancellor announced funding for 45 new Trading Standards officers.Rachel Reeves said the government would be undertaking \"additional enforcement activity on High Streets, focusing on illicit tobacco and vaping products\", which would involve deploying 350 newly-recruited criminal investigators part of the fraud investigation team.Minister for Migration and Citizenship Mike Tapp praised the BBC investigation and its reporting saying \"really it shows the value of the BBC\".On a government level, he said: \"We said we take it seriously and we have and we are.\"I hate what these, you know, hairdressers, nail bars and dodgy vape shops are doing to, so many of our high streets, not just for the look and feel of them, but also for those genuine businesses that are being undercut. So it's really important that we continue to work hard to combat this.\"Additional reporting by Phill Edwards",

    "body": "10 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorGetty ImagesNot a single measure in the government's policy-packed Budget will change the growth forecast for the next five years - that was the damning assessment of the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Reponsibility (OBR).For a government that has declared economic growth as its top priority it is surely a disappointment.Worse than that, although the OBR upgraded its growth forecast for this year – it downgraded them every year thereafter till 2030.Although businesses were relieved they didn't get clobbered the way they did at the last Budget - at which they were handed a £25bn employer national insurance hike – genuinely significant pro-business measures were thin on the ground.Little wonder many business leaders are asking: \"Where is the growth?\"Even the sectors that did get a mention as receiving special help – such as High Street retailers and hospitality – insist their costs of doing business are going to rise significantly through higher business rates and labour costs.Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.The government said it would calculate business rates for 750,000 High Street retail and hospitality firms using a lower percentage of the rateable value of premises, but this lower tax rate wasn't as generous as expected.At the same time, many firms have seen their rateable value increase and face the phasing out of a Covid-era 40% discount from April. The net result is that, despite some transitional relief, lots of them will see significant increases in their business rates bill.An 8.5% pay rise for 18-20 year olds on the national living wage is good news for young people in work and an incentive for those who aren't to find a job, but on top of 16.3% rise for the same group last year, it may put employers off taking on new people.As one FTSE 100 boss told the BBC: \"They are hurting the very people they are trying to help and it will mean fewer jobs, fewer hours, fewer premises, lower growth.\"The cap on salary sacrifice arrangement will hit both workers and businesses, who may reduce future pension contributions, pay rises or investment in growing their business.Budget 2025One measure that got little attention but could prove important is expanding schemes that give tax breaks for investors in young companies – the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts – and allow them to invest in companies that have grown bigger.A Treasury spokesperson said the economy was \"already outperforming forecasts\" and it was driving growth \"with billions of pounds in new capital spending, strong private investment and bold planning reforms\".\"This Budget doubles down on our long‑term plan to grow the economy and create good jobs,\" they added.The truth is that any government or chancellor's ability to \"unleash\" growth is pretty limited. Most people just want not to be over-molested by tax and regulation and allowed to get on with their lives. On that score, this Budget is a big improvement on last year's.By building in a lot more wiggle room in her tax and spending plans over the next five year, Rachel Reeves has reduced the likelihood we will need such a bewildering smorgasbord of policies next year. Stability can be a powerful fertiliser for growth.The former chief economist of the Bank of England Andy Haldane may have over egged it by saying that the \"fiscal fandango\" - the months of speculation before this year's Budget - was the single biggest reason for growth to flatline for the second half of the year, but it sure didn't help.Ahead of the Budget, Steve Rigby, the boss of large private company Rigby told the BBC, \"we just hope [it] isn't too catastrophic for business and we can get on with it\".Test passed he says - but that's a pretty low bar for a government desperate for growth.",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has doubled down on his core demands for ending the war in Ukraine, saying Russia will lay down arms only if Kyiv's troops withdraw from territory claimed by Moscow.Putin has long pushed for legal recognition of the Ukrainian territories Russia has seized by force. They include the southern Crimean peninsula, annexed in 2014, and the eastern Donbas region, which Moscow now occupies for the most part.For Kyiv, which has ruled out relinquishing the parts of the Donbas it still holds, rewarding Russia for its aggression is a non-starter.Speaking after Putin's address, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia \"scorned\" efforts \"to truly end the war\".Speaking to reporters during a trip to Kyrgyzstan, Putin accused Kyiv of wanting to fight \"to the last Ukrainian\" - which he said Russia was \"in principle\" also ready to do. He repeated his view that Russia has the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from Donbas, which is made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" he said.Yet Russia's slow gains in eastern Ukraine have come at significant cost of manpower. According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, at this rate it would take Moscow almost two more years to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. Thursday's remarks were the first time that Putin addressed the hectic diplomatic moves of the last week, which saw the US and Ukraine hold intense discussions over a peace plan reportedly drafted in October by American and Russian officials.The plan, which was heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, was subsequently revised during talks between Ukrainian and US negotiators in Geneva. European representatives were also in the Swiss city.But it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian de facto control but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday that Ukrainian and US delegations would meet \"to translate the points we secured in Geneva into a form that puts us on the path to peace and security guarantees.\" The Ukrainian president did not mention any names, but his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had said US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was due to visit Kyiv later in the week.On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate. There was therefore \"no use\" signing any documents with them, he added.Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. On Wednesday European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesAll domestic cats (Felis catus) are descended from the African wild catIn true feline style, cats took their time in deciding when and where to forge bonds with humans. According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place.A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. \"They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,\" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford.\"That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago.\" Getty ImagesCats were domesticated long after dogsAll modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat.How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists.To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats.The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa.\"Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,\" said Prof Larson.  Ziyi Li and Wenquan FanThe skull of a leopard cat found in a Han-dynasty tomb in Xinzheng City, Henan Province, ChinaThis fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies.Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought.They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China.Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica.GettyThe leopard cat is the most widespread wild cat in AsiaAnd in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene.These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years.The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially \"commensal\" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. \"Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,\" she said.GettyThe Bengal cat is a breed of hybrid cat created from crossing an Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) with domestic catsLeopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia.Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s.The research is published in the journal, Science and in Cell Genomics.",

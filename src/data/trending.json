    "body": "1 hour agoNick Eardley,Political CorrespondentandSue Mitchell,Investigations reporterGetty ImagesAsylum seekers will be banned from using taxis for medical appointments from February, the government has announced.It comes after a BBC investigation found some people had travelled long distances by taxi, with one  asylum seeker saying they went on a 250-mile journey to a GP, costing the Home Office £600.In response the government launched an urgent review into the use and cost of taxis to transfer asylum seekers from their hotels to appointments in September.Now, the government has confirmed it has spent an average of around £15.8 million per year on transport for asylum seekers.Earlier this year, BBC Radio 4's File on Four found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used, including the case of a 250-mile journey to a GP.And on Friday, one subcontractor told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said.But Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this was now going to change.She said: \"I am ending the unrestricted use of taxis by asylum seekers for hospital appointments, authorising them only in the most exceptional circumstances.\"I will continue to root out waste as we close every single asylum hotel.\"She said the government had inherited expensive Conservative contracts.Instead of taxis, ministers want asylum seekers to use alternatives like public transport.There will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy related needs. These will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules.There are other circumstances in which taxis can be used - such as moving between accommodation - but ministers are reviewing the wider use of taxis for asylum seekers and want to extend the principle that they are only used in exceptional circumstances with support evidence.Ministers have pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the next election. They want to increase the use of alternative accommodation, such as large military sites.But figures earlier this week showed 36,273 people were still living in asylum hotels in the UK – an increase compared to June.There has also been criticism of the growing cost of running asylum accommodation – which has gone up significantly since the contracts were signed.When the home secretary was asked if the government was prepared to exercise break clauses in contracts with providers in a BBC interview earlier this year, Mahmood said she would explore all options.But doing so would mean alternative accommodation needs to be found.The government has also announced significant changes to overhaul the asylum system – with refugee status becoming temporary and the ending of guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers.The government has recovered £74m since it came to power – but the chair of the home affairs select committee said that was only a start.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"The issue is that Labour can't get a grip on the illegal immigration crisis.\"As Labour hammer working people with £26 billion in tax rises, they have allowed costs for illegal arrivals to spiral because Labour don't have the backbone to take the tough decisions needed. Namely, deporting all illegal arrivals and leaving the ECHR. Until that happens, the bills will keep mounting.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoImogen FoulkesGeneva CorrespondentThe United Nations committee on torture says there is evidence that Israel is operating a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\". The committee regularly reviews the records of all countries which have signed the convention against torture, taking testimony from their governments, and from human rights groups.During Israel's review both Israeli and Palestinian rights groups gave harrowing details about conditions in Israeli detention centres. It is alleged that thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel since the Hamas attacks of October 7th 2023. Under Israel's laws on administrative detention and on Unlawful Combatants – suspects who cannot be classed as prisoner of war - they can be held for long periods without access to a lawyer or family members. Many Palestinian families say they have waited months to even find out that a loved has been detained, amounting, the UN committee said, to \"enforced disappearance\".The committee was particularly critical of Israel's reported use of the Unlawful Combatants law to detain whole groups of Palestinians, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.But it is the reported conditions in detention which make the grimmest reading in the committee's conclusions, published today. Palestinians, the evidence suggests, are regularly deprived of food and water, and subjected to severe beatings, attacks by dogs, electrocution, water boarding, and sexual violence. Some are allegedly permanently shackled, denied access to a toilet, and forced to wear diapers.The committee concluded that such treatment \"amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity\". It said evidence of a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\" by Israel was one of the acts which constitute the crime of genocide under international law. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.One committee member, Peter Vedel Kessing of Denmark, said he and his colleagues were \"deeply appalled\" by what they heard. Committee members also said they were very concerned at the lack of investigations or prosecutions into allegations of torture. They called on Israel to launch independent investigations, and to ensure those responsible, including senior military officers, are held accountable.Israel, which has long accused the UN of bias against it, did not comment publicly today on the committee's findings, but during the committee hearings its ambassador, Daniel Meron, described the allegations of torture as \"disinformation\". He said that Israel was \"committed to upholding its obligations in line with our moral values and principles, even in the face of the challenges posed by a terrorist organisation\".In its conclusions, the UN committee took care to unequivocally condemn the Hamas attack of October 2023, and acknowledged the security challenges Israel faces. But it also warned that violations of international law by one side did not justify the other side doing the same. Under the convention, to which Israel is a party, the prohibition on torture is absolute: it is not allowed under any circumstances.Israel's domestic law is less clear however, suggesting that the convention only applies to Israeli territory, and not to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank – an interpretation that many international lawyers dispute.The findings come amid increasing pressure on Israel over its human rights record. On Friday in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Office said the killing by Israeli soldiers of two Palestinians in the West Bank looked like a \"summary execution\". Video of the killing showed the two men with their hands up, apparently surrendering to Israeli forces.And UN aid agencies say conditions for people in the Gaza strip remain dire, despite the ceasefire. Thousands of families are facing the winter cold and rain in tents, they warn, not enough aid supplies are getting in, and Israeli air strikes against what Israel says are Hamas targets continue.",

    "body": "60 minutes agoThe fallout over the Budget continues to dominate the front pages of Saturday's papers. \"Reeves on the brink over tax lies\" says the Daily Telegraph, as it reports Chancellor Rachel Reeves is being accused of misleading the public over the state of the country's public finances. The paper says the chancellor is fighting for her job after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revealed a forecast of higher wages - which she had not mentioned - would help her meet spending rules.\"'Liar' Reeves must go now\" is the Daily Mail's take. The paper quotes calls from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch for the chancellor to be sacked, saying she had \"lied to the public to justify record tax hikes\". Downing Street has denied the chancellor misled the public about the state of the public finances ahead of the Budget.The Independent follows with \"Reeves 'misled the public' over fake fiscal black hole\", focusing on the OBR telling the chancellor that instead of a deficit, she had a surplus of £4.2bn.The Sun cites the \"fury\" at Reeves over the revelations, dubbing her \"Chancer of the Exchequer\".The i paper shifts its focus to the verdict from voters on the Budget, summing it up as \"nice ideas but we will be poorer\". The paper says its own polling shows Reeves's Budget is \"the least popular since Liz Truss era\" but voters do like some measures, including higher gambling taxes and the minimum wage hike.Daily Express highlights the Budget's impact on pensioners, saying an extra 200,000 are set to lose their winter fuel payments. The paper cites documents published on a government website that reveal 2.2m pensioners are about to be denied the benefit, with experts warning that number \"will only go up\".The hospitality industry is also facing a \"stealth tax\" after the Budget, according to the Times. The paper says a separate government agency revealed a much higher assessment of the value of the buildings used to calculate business rates, which means the levy \"will rise significantly next year\" for the average high street business.The new \"mansion tax\" leads the Financial Times. Wealthy homeowners are rushing to \"sidestep\" Reeves' council tax surcharge by agreeing to asking prices below the thresholds set out in the Budget, the paper says. Elsewhere, the \"crisis in Kyiv\" takes the top picture spot, showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his top aid Andriy Yermark, who resigned yesterday after anti corruption raids.The chancellor is calling on Britain's wealthy to shoulder the burden of paying to fix the country's \"creaky\" public services, reports the Guardian. In an interview with the paper, Reeves says her decision to increase taxes by £26bn aims to help improve schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, and that she made \"fair and necessary choices\".Meanwhile in entertainment news, the Daily Mirror features an interview with TV host Ruth Langsford opening up about her split from fellow broadcaster Eamonn Holmes.Finally, the Daily Star splashes their front page with football star Wayne Rooney's strong opinions about TV clown Mr Tumble. According to the paper, Rooney jokes about his \"hate\" for the character, saying \"after four children, he's why I got the snip\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the ex-president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post on Friday, congratulating the former president on the pardon, saying he was \"treated very harshly and unfairly\".Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.In the same post, Trump also said he supported conservative candidate Tito Asfura in the upcoming general election in the Central American country on Sunday. Hernández, a member of the National Party who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the United States in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to traffic hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. He was convicted by a New York jury two years later. Polls show the Honduran election remains a toss-up between Asfura, who is the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and now leader of the National Party, Rixi Moncada, the former defence minister with the ruling leftist LIBRE Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla in his Friday post, writing that Nasralla is \"a boderline Communist\" who is only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura. Trump in his post on Friday called Asfura a candidate that is \"standing up for democracy\" and fighting against Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration has accused Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as rigged by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.President Trump on Friday accused Maduro \"and his narcoterrorists\" of taking over Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro of the LIBRE Party, who had forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a cooperative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with the United States. Her country also  hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. In August, the US launched a counternarcotics operation targeting boats it accuses of transporting drugs from Venezuela to America. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on suspected vessels since.According to US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" is to remove \"narcoterrorists\" from the Western Hemisphere. But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning.Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region.Electrical discharges nicknamed \"mini lightning\" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument.Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings.A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days).They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts.Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges.Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: \"These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration.\"He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity.Particle physicist Dr Daniel Pritchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would \"provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges\", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, \"some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning\". He added: \"Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time.\"In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes.It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life.Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",

    "body": "6 hours agoGetty ImagesThe UK's National Screening Committee has recommended that only a very small group of men at high risk of prostate cancer should be screened for the disease.There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men.But there has been some energetic campaigning for change by high-profile figures, including Sir Chris Hoy, who has terminal prostate cancer, and Lord David Cameron, who recently revealed he'd been treated for it.The expert advice will now be consulted on for the next three months, before the screening committee gives its final recommendations to governments in the four nations of the UK in March.What is screening?Screening is when people are invited for a test to look for disease despite them having no symptoms.Examples include women being invited for a mammogram to look for breast cancer or the at-home bowel cancer test that is posted to your home every two years over the age of 50.The idea is to catch cancer before someone starts to get ill and when it can still be treated.What was recommended today?Experts say there is no justification for screening the large majority of men for prostate cancer.They looked at all the available evidence and concluded that screening was only suitable for:men with a genetic risk of prostate cancer (with a confirmed BRCA gene variant)The advice says this group should be screened every two years between the ages of 45 and 61.This means no screening is recommended for other high-risk groups of men such as:black menmen with a family history of prostate cancerWhy did they come to that conclusion?The UK National Screening Committee said a mass screening programme for prostate cancer was likely to cause more harm than good.Tests for the disease are unreliable, and can lead to men being treated for a slow-growing cancer that isn't going to cause them any harm. The treatment itself can cause incontinence and impotence, which can significantly affect quality of life.Balanced against that, finding cancers early and treating them can save lives. But it's difficult for doctors to work out which cancers are going to be aggressive and spread, which means men can be treated unnecessarily.The committe said the number of lives saved by screening does not outweigh its harmful effects on healthy men.Why not screen all high-risk men?Many predicted that all men at high risk of the disease were likely to be included in new screening plans.But the committee stopped short of that recommendation.Despite black men having twice the risk of prostate cancer, it said there should be no screening for black men due to \"uncertainties\" around its impact, and a lack of evidence from clinical trials in these men. It also recommended no screening for men with a family history of the disease, for the same reason - too many cancers would be overdiagnosed and overtreated.But men with specific genetic mutations - called BRCA variants - develop faster-growing and aggressive cancers at an earlier age, making screening for them justified.Treating these cancers earlier is more likely to benefit those men and outweigh the potential harm from unnecessary treatment, compared to men in the general population, the experts said.How do you test for BRCA variant?A genetic test is needed which looks for a mutation of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes.These gene variants can affect men and women, increasing the risk of a range of cancers, including prostate, breast and ovarian cancer.Around three in 1,000 men have BRCA variants, but many will be unaware unless they have family members that are known carriers, and then had it confirmed with a test.Experts say more genetic tests will need to be offered to high-risk men in future, in order to work out how many are affected.How many men get prostate cancer?Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men.Some 55,000 men are diagnosed with the disease each year, and 12,000 men die from it in annually in the UK.Is this the final word on screening?No, a three-month consultation on the recommendations starts today.The committee will meet again after that and give its final advice to ministers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.They will then have to make their own individual decision on prostate screening. Wes Streeting, Health Secretary in England, says he wants screening in place but only if it's \"backed by evidence\". He said he would examine the evidence \"thoroughly\" ahead of his final decision in March.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBBCCameron Barracks is a 140-year-old army recruitment and training baseThe Home Office has delayed plans to house asylum seekers at two military sites in East Sussex and the Scottish Highlands.About 540 men were due to be sent to Crowborough army training camp and another 300 men to Cameron Barracks in Inverness.The UK government originally wanted to move asylum seekers by early December as part of drive to close asylum hotels.The Home Office said it wanted to avoid rushed plans leading to \"unsafe and chaotic situations\". It said it would proceed when facilities were \"fully operational and safe\".Crowborough and Cameron Barracks were both earmarked earlier this year as potential temporary asylum seeker accommodation.In East Sussex, the local authority Wealden District Council passed a motion formally opposing the Crowborough proposal.Highland Council also raised concerns over the scale of the barracks plans and pressures on local services.The 140-year-old base, near Inverness city centre, was previously used to house families fleeing Afghanistan.Charlie Rose/BBCThe Home Office plans to house 540 male asylum seekers at the Crowborough siteThe Home Office said it still planned to \"accelerate\" the movement of people.  But it said it would not do so at the expense of the safety of local communities.A spokesperson added: \"We are furious at the level of illegal migrants and asylum hotels. \"Moving to large military sites is an important part of our reforms to tackle remove the incentives that draw illegal migrants to Britain.\"We are continuing to accelerate plans to move people into Cameron Barracks, when it is fully operational and safe.\"We will continue to work closely with local representatives and authorities throughout this transition.\"PA MediaPeople board a small boat in Gravelines, France.Widespread protests against the housing of asylum seekers in hotels exploded across the UK in the summer.In Scotland, protests were held outside hotels housing asylum seekers in Perth and Aberdeenshire as well as Falkirk during August.A brick was thrown through the window of the Cladhan Hotel in Falkirk in September, months after hundreds of pro and anti-immigration protesters held rival demonstrations outside.The Park Hotel in the town was also targeted after a former resident, Sadeq Nikzad, was sentenced to nine years in jail for the rape of a 15-year-old girl.Highland Council officials recommended writing to the Home Office to seek \"urgent clarity\" on the proposals at the start of November.The local authority previously said that about 60 people per week could arrive at the barracks from the second week of December.They said the plan was to use the site for 12 months, before it reverted back to being an army base.But a report also raised concerns over the scale of the proposal, the potential of protests and the barracks becoming a target for people \"deliberately wishing to incite violence and hatred\".A spokesperson for the council said: \"A multi-agency partnership involving the council, NHS Highland, Police Scotland, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the Scottish government, Cosla, and the Home Office is now meeting weekly to plan for the arrival of asylum seekers and learn from best practice.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterReutersDowning Street has denied Rachel Reeves misled the public about the state of the public finances ahead of this week's Budget.In the run-up to Wednesday's statement, the chancellor repeatedly talked about a downgrade to the UK's predicted economic productivity that would make it hard for her to meet her spending rules.But in a letter to MPs sent on Friday, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revealed a forecast of higher wages - which she had not mentioned - would help her meet the rules.The Conservatives have accused Reeves of giving an overly pessimistic impression of the public finances as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes.Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the letter showed Reeves had \"lied to the public\" and should be sacked.In a letter to the Commons Treasury select committee, OBR chairman Richard Hughes revealed that he told the chancellor on 17 September that the public finances were in better shape than widely thought.The letter also reveals that on the 31 October, the OBR told the Treasury it was on course to meet its main rule of not borrowing for day-to-day spending, albeit by £4.2bn, less than the £9.9bn in \"headroom\" she had left herself last year.On 4 November, Reeves used a rare pre-Budget speech in Downing Street to warn the UK's productivity was weaker \"than previously thought\" and that \"has consequences for the public finances too, in lower tax receipts.\"Then, on 10 November, she told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"These comments, along with her speech, fuelled speculation she needed to raise significant sums to meet her fiscal rules.However, the Office for Budget Responsibility has now confirmed that although it did indeed downgrade productivity, it also predicted this would be \"offset\" by higher wages increasing the government's tax revenues.That meant she had a surplus to meet both of her fiscal rules.A spokesperson for the Treasury said:\"We are not going to get into the OBR's processes or speculate on how that relates to the internal decision‑making in the build‑up to a Budget, but the Chancellor made her choices to cut the cost of living, cut hospital waiting lists and double headroom to cut the cost of our debt.\"Budget 2025But Reeves continued to indicate that she was likely to increase income tax rates.In her Downing Street press conference, she said: \"It is already clear that the productivity performance…is weaker than previously thought.\"She added: \"What I want people to understand ahead of that Budget, is the circumstances we face.\"In the end, Reeves backed away from hiking income tax rates, although her Budget still contained £26bn of tax rises, including by freezing income tax thresholds for a further three years, dragging more people into higher tax bands over time.Conservative shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said that while Reeves had repeatedly talked about the productivity downgrade, she had \"failed to mention\" the offsetting effect of higher wages on the forecast.He added: \"It was all a smokescreen. Labour knew all along that they did not need to raise taxes and break their promises.\"It appears the country was deliberately misled to try to explain away Labour's decision to spend billions more on welfare.\"Asked whether Reeves had misled the public and the financial markets, the PM's spokesperson said: \"I don't accept that.\" He added: \"As she [Reeves] set out in the speech that she gave here (Downing Street), she talked about the challenges the country was facing and she set out her decisions incredibly clearly at the Budget.\"He added the government had increased the headroom for the Treasury to meet the fiscal rules, which would creates \"certainty and stability for business\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames FitzGeraldandMahfouz ZubaideAFP via Getty ImagesTens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the US withdrawal from the country in 2021Afghans living in the US have condemned Wednesday's \"deeply tragic\" deadly shooting attack in Washington DC, while stressing that the suspect - who moved to the US from Afghanistan four years ago - does not represent them.The alleged gunman, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered America under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans who worked with the US in the wake of the its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in Wednesday's shooting, and a colleague, Andrew Wolfe, 24, is said to be fighting for his life.In response, US President Donald Trump has halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghans, ordered a review of green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries, and threatened a wider crackdown on migrants from what he calls \"third-world countries\".The Afghan Community Coalition of United States expressed its sympathy for families of the victims, calling for a \"comprehensive investigation\" but urging the US government not to delay or suspend Afghan immigration claims.\"Twenty years of Afghan-US partnership must not be forgotten,\" the coalition's statement said, nodding to the two-decade effort launched by the US in 2001 to overthrow Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and establish security in the country.Afghans living in America told the BBC they had been horrified by the Washington DC attack, which they emphasised was the act of just one person.Some spoke anonymously out of fear of reprisals by the Taliban, which took back control of Afghanistan following the US troop withdrawal in 2021.One of the Afghans, who made his move after the US withdrawal, described Wednesday's incident as \"deeply tragic\". He noted the timing ahead of Thanksgiving, and amid a \"highly charged political environment in Washington DC\".But he highlighted that the shooting was an \"individual criminal offence, not representative of a community\".\"Afghans in the United States are hardworking, tax paying members of society,\" he added. \"They remain grateful to America for the evacuation efforts during the crisis in Kabul.\"Thousands of Afghans scrambled to escape the country in 2021, many via Kabul, as the US withdrew its troops and the Taliban swept in. The suspect, Mr Lakanwal, is said by US officials to have had a relationship with US forces in Afghanistan while they were stationed there. He helped guard US forces at Kabul airport at the time of the withdrawal, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC.He came to the US the same year. He applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told the BBC's partner CBS News.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanAnother Afghan, who also moved to the US following the country's withdrawal from Afghanistan four years ago, labelled Wednesday's shooting \"really shocking\". He said he was praying for the families of the victims.He suspected that it was an \"individual crime which is committed without any support, participation and co-operation of others\", and said the attack \"should not be counted for the whole community\". Another Afghan man living in the US who spoke to the BBC said the shooting had been a \"very devastating event for all immigrants\", adding that the political reaction had left many people in a state of uncertainty.The situation felt more acute due to the threats in his country of origin, he said: \"For us Afghans there's problem for us in Afghanistan as well as here.\"Crystal Bayat, an Afghan human rights activist who moved to the US after 2021, said that despite having secured permanent residency, she still feared the US government could abruptly change course on accepting Afghan migrants.\"I have a fear every single day that what if the policy changes and they deport us from here?\" Ms Bayat told the Outside Source programme on BBC World Service.\"I hope President Trump changes his mind on this,\" Ms Bayat said. \"It is very dangerous to punish entire immigrant communities, or the people who stood shoulder to shoulder with the (American) people.\"She said there were families who were still in danger in Afghanistan due to their support of the US before the withdrawal.

    "body": "11 hours agoYasmin RufoGeorgia BarringtonDaisy (right) gave birth to Georgia's baby, Ottilie, in October Georgia Barrington has just become a new mother - but she isn't the one who gave birth to her daughter. Instead, that moment belonged to her best friend, Daisy Hope, who carried the baby for her after a promise made when they were teenagers.The women have been inseparable their whole lives. They call themselves \"soul sisters\" and have grown up together as their fathers are best friends. Their childhood closeness would later become the foundation for a life-changing act of generosity. At 15, Georgia was told something no young girl expects to hear - she had been born without a womb and would never carry a child.The diagnosis, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, affects around one in 5,000 women and for Georgia, it felt like her future had been rewritten in a single moment.\"It was devastating, my whole world had fallen apart,\" she recalls. \"I'd always grown up thinking I would be a mum and that was ripped out from under me and everything I ever dreamed of had gone.\"Back then, Daisy wasn't particularly maternal and she remembers the diagnosis vividly and how \"unfair\" it felt that her friend who had always wanted to have a child couldn't.\"I wanted her to feel ok and to give her some hope that it wasn't the end of the world so I said that I would carry a baby for her one day,\" she tells Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett.\"I don't think I understood what I was saying then but I always knew this was something I was going to do for Georgia.\"Georgia BarringtonGeorgia and Daisy (right) have been best friends since childhood and grew up together More than a decade later, Daisy followed through on that promise and in 2023 the two women began the IVF process.Georgia had trained as a midwife, immersing herself in the world she feared she could never be part of. \"I was asked once whether this was the right career for me,\" she says. \"But actually, it helped me heal and deep down I knew I'd have a child one way or another.\" Years later, Daisy had her first child – with Georgia as her midwife - and becoming a mum herself strengthened her conviction to fulfil her promise.\"The love I felt for my child was amazing and I thought everyone should be able to have that feeling,\" she says. She admits she was a \"bit naïve\" at the beginning as she had a straightforward pregnancy with her daughter and so \"assumed everything would go smoothly again\".'Hope dropped away'She became pregnant with the first embryo and everything seemed to be progressing normally and both women allowed themselves to believe the future they'd imagined was finally happening. But a scan at seven weeks revealed an empty womb.Georgia remembers the moment the nurse said she couldn't see anything on the scan.\"I had this sinking feeling, and all hope just dropped away,\" she says.A week later it was confirmed that the embryo hadn't become a baby.\"I thought it was all my fault,\" admits Daisy who found the grief overwhelming, feeling she had let her friend down, while Georgia struggled with the realisation that even their most promising attempt hadn't succeeded.Still, they tried again and on the second time, something felt different as Daisy says: \"When I found out I was pregnant again, I thought the world cannot be this cruel twice.\"Georgia BarringtonDaisy (right) says she always knew she was going to carry Georgia's baby Six weeks in, the pair sat in a hospital room holding their breath as a tiny heartbeat appeared on the screen, but later that day, Daisy began to bleed heavily.\"I thought it was happening all over again and I was terrified,\" she says.She bled for six hours and was convinced she had miscarried but when doctors checked, the heartbeat was still there and the pregnancy continued to full term.Daisy went into labour slightly earlier than expected and a few months ago gave birth to a baby girl.Georgia was so overwhelmed in the moment she \"forgot to check the sex of the baby\".\"As soon as I saw the baby's head, I just lost it and we were all crying.\"She says she still struggles to believe she really has a child and wishes she could \"take this moment and hand it to my 15-year-old self, sitting in that GP surgery\".As Georgia talks of how \"lucky and grateful\" she feels, Daisy says she always knew she would help her best friend out however she could. \"We have this bond that no one will ever have with their friends because we've been through something so personal.\"All episodes of Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett are available on BBC Sounds. New episodes drop every Friday.",

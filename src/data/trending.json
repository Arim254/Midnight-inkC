    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "'I felt really lonely': Joe Swash on being a young dad8 hours agoShola LeeBBC NewsBBC Studios/Eddie Hutton-MillsIn his new documentary, Joe Swash meets young fathers like Wyatt, who is 18\"I remember just feeling so scared and vulnerable,\" says actor and TV presenter Joe Swash of becoming a father in his twenties.Swash found out he was going to be a dad at the age of 24. He says it was a life-changing experience he felt \"grossly underprepared\" for, adding that \"there was no one really for me to talk to\".The presenter says his and his former partner's conversations with midwives were \"rightly\" centred on the mum-to-be, but he felt lonely and no one had asked him how he was doing. There were no father-and-child support groups and having lost his own father aged 11, Swash felt he had no positive male role models to turn to.He worried about small things like how to change a nappy or how hot his baby's bottle had to be, and felt everyone was \"looking down\" at him for being a young dad.It was this feeling of being \"completely unsupported\" as a young father that he explores in the BBC documentary Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads.In the film, the former EastEnders star meets four young fathers and explores some of the problems they face, from social stereotypes to a lack of parental support services.Last year, dads were an average of 34 years old when their child was born, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The fathers in the BBC documentary, meanwhile, are all 18 to 22.Kevin Stoodley is founder of North East Young Dads and Lads (NEYDL), a charity that provides parenting and community support for young fathers.Stoodley says that in his 27 years as a community youth worker, he has \"never encountered a community as stigmatised\" as young dads.'Absent dads'Swash says that as a young dad, he \"really struggled\" with judgement from others and felt that people viewed him as \"irresponsible\".He adds that young dads often get a \"bad reputation\" and are characterised as \"absent\".\"I'd love to find out how many of them 'absent dads' are absent because they wanted to be, or because they were so vulnerable, scared and frightened that they had nowhere to go and had no support,\" he explains.Swash says society needs to \"readjust\" how it sees young dads. Stoodley agrees, saying that young fathers have historically been wrongfully \"perceived as being feckless, disinterested and in some cases, a risk to their children\".He adds that some of the young dads he's met face judgement from their own communities and are \"told that they've ruined their life\".'Alpha male'BBC Studios/Eddie Hutton-MillsSwash urges young dads to speak to each other and met four young  men navigating parenthood during his documentaryFor Swash, having positive male role models is key in supporting young dads.After his father died, Swash says he was \"craving, as a young man, just to have a male role model put their arm around me and look after me - whether that was a negative role model or a positive role model, I was just desperate to have some role model\".\"If all we're seeing is negative role models being put on social media and on TV, you can be mistaken in thinking that's the sort of man you want to be\", he adds.Swash explains: \"We can all get in fights down the streets and go on boys' holidays, but not everyone can change a nappy and love and nurture and cherish a child and for me, that's an alpha male.\"Stoodley says having positive male role models is \"super important\" in helping young fathers navigate their new roles.The founder says NEYDL also looks to address toxic masculinity and steer young men on the path of being a good role model.Recently, Stephen Graham, who starred in Adolescence, which explored toxic masculinity, announced a new book calling for fathers to have more open conversations with their sons.'Fall through the net'Swash says the lack of support available for young dads is \"pretty unbelievable\".In the course of making the documentary, Swash notes that he and the team struggled to find support services for young men and he says there should be a service available to all young fathers.Services that do exist, like NEYDL, provide parenting and community support to young dads. However, Stoodley says there needs to be more national investment.Swash adds that support can mean simple things like having more nappy-changing stations in men's toilets, or bigger shifts: \"Fundamentally, I think society has got to change the way they look at young dads and young families.\"\"I felt really lonely,\" Swash adds of his own experiences as a young dad.Swash, a parent to six children, says he's \"proud\" to have been a young dad and loves his kids \"with a passion\". However, he acknowledges a lot of young men are \"not as lucky\" as him and encourages young dads to have conversations with each other and to \"not suffer in silence\".You can watch Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads on Monday 20 October at 20:00 BST on BBC Three, and on BBC iPlayer.More weekend picks",

    "body": "Most of the front pages have further reaction to the news that Prince Andrew is to stop using his royal titles. The Sunday Times reports that Prince William isn't satisfied with the outcome and he'll take a \"more ruthless\" approach when he's king. This is said to include banning his uncle from his coronation. The paper says Prince William knows that what's referred to as the \"Andrew problem\" will be in his \"in tray at some point\". Kensington Palace has declined to comment.Some of the papers have more details about the run up to the announcement. The Sun on Sunday says Prince Andrew's life as a senior royal came to an end after a \"terse phone call\" with the King. The Sunday Mirror reports the conversation lasted 10 minutes.The Sunday Telegraph says Prince Andrew was urged to \"do the right thing\". The paper says it had become clear a week ago that the \"Prince Andrew issue\" was rapidly coming to a head after further revelations about his links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew denies any wrongdoing.The Observer carries an interview with the broadcaster Emily Maitlis reflecting on her interview with Prince Andrew for BBC Newsnight in 2019. During the programme the Prince told her he had cut all links with Jeffrey Epstein in December 2010. An email has recently emerged, apparently from February 2011, suggesting he had stayed in touch.  Emily Maitlis is quoted as saying Prince Andrew \"lied\" to her.The Mail on Sunday reports that Jeffrey Epstein introduced Prince Andrew to a second woman in 2010, and tried to arrange for them to have dinner in London. The unnamed woman's legal representatives tell the Mail she was abused by Epstein for years and is now rebuilding her life. The paper quotes emails allegedly between Epstein and Prince Andrew discussing dates and availability.  Asked by a reporter whether her client ever met Prince Andrew, the lawyer is said to have replied with a \"stony silence\". The paper says the reported emergence of a second woman will send shockwaves through the Royal Family. A representative for Prince Andrew declined to comment, according to the Mail.The Sunday Times reports that one of the suspects in the Chinese spying case was carrying a \"suitcase full of cash\" when he was stopped by police at Heathrow under terrorism laws, in 2023, after flying in from China. The paper says Christopher Berry was discovered with £4,000 when he was intercepted, six weeks before he was formally arrested. Sources familiar with the case tell The Times the money is believed to have been given to him by his Chinese intelligence handler. Last month charges against Christopher Berry, and a second man, Christopher Cash, were dropped. Both have always maintained their innocence.According to The Mail on Sunday there are \"new spy fears\" in connection with the proposed site of the Chinese super embassy in London. Plans show it would be built directly around the City of London's \"highly sensitive telephone exchange\". It was announced last week that a final decision on whether or not to approve the plans would be delayed to December. In a statement the Chinese embassy said the application complied with local regulations and procedures.The Sun on Sunday says the manager of England's women's team, Sarina Wiegman, is set to receive an honorary damehood. The paper says she's been put forward for a gong in the King's New Year's Honours list after the Lionesses won the Euros for a second time in the summer. Sources say the recommendation is likely to \"sail through\".",

    "body": "The US says it has \"credible reports\" that Hamas is planning an \"imminent\" attack on civilians in Gaza, which it says would be a \"direct and grave\" violation of the ceasefire agreement.A planned attack against Palestinians would \"undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts\", a statement by the state department said.It did not not provide further details - or how this would be a breach of the US-brokered ceasefire agreed with Israel. Hamas rejected the US statement as false. It has, however, been re-establishing control - and has had gunfights with a local clan in Gaza - in the power vacuum that followed the Israeli partial withdrawal.The first phase of the ceasefire deal between is currently in progress - all living hostages have been released and bodies of the deceased are still being returned to Israel.Also part of the agreement, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Washington said it had already informed other guarantors of the Gaza peace agreement - which include Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - and demanded Hamas uphold its end of the ceasefire terms. \"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the statement said.President Donald Trump has previously warned Hamas against the killing of civilians. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier this week.He later clarified that he would not be sending US troops into Gaza.Last week, BBC Verify authenticated graphic videos that showed a public execution carried out by Hamas gunmen in Gaza.The videos showed several men with guns line up eight people, whose arms were tied behind their backs, before killing them in a crowded square.BBC Verify could not confirm the identity of the masked gunmen, though some appeared to be wearing the green headbands associated with Hamas.Israel's military has confirmed that one of two sets of remains handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza on Saturday are those of Ronen Engel. The identity of the second person yet to be announced.So far, the remains of 11 out of 28 deceased hostages had been returned to Israel.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt would remain closed until Hamas returns the remaining bodies.The Rafah crossing is a vital gateway for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave Gaza, and for thousands of others to return.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of committing \"murder\" following a strike carried out on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September. In a social media post, Petro accused the US of violating his country's sovereignty and killing a Colombian fisherman.Posting on X, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"It comes after President Donald Trump said the US had struck a \"drug-carrying submarine\", killing two people.Writing on social media, Trump said two people were killed in the US attack on the  vessel on Thursday, which he said US intelligence confirmed was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The attack is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. It is the first time survivors have been reported.Writing about an earlier attack in September, Pedro wrote on X on Saturday that: \"US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters.\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on September fifteenth when US forces fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the submarine targeted in the latest attack was \"built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs\". \"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine,\" he said, adding that no US military personnel had been injured. The US president also said two people who survived would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.Narco-subs have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery. They are often homemade and constructed using fibreglass and plywood. The US, as well as other coastal nations, have previously intercepted some of these subs.",

    "body": "A police sergeant who jumped to the aid of a colleague who was ambushed by a knifeman has been awarded the King's Commendation for Bravery. Sgt Tim Ansell grappled with 27-year-old Jacob Brown after he held a blade to the neck of his colleague Sgt Marc Foster. Brown launched his attack as the Greater Manchester Police officers and their colleague, PC Marcus Wolstencroft, were speaking to a driver after a road collision in Whalley Range in July 2023. Brown stabbed and slashed both Sgt Ansell and Sgt Foster before PC Wolstencroft stunned him with a Taser.Bodyworn and dashboard camera footage released by the force showed Brown, who was dressed in black with a hood up, run up to Sgt Foster from behind with a knife outstretched. He collided with the officer who stumbled and fell to the ground, before Sgt Ansell jumped in tried to wrestle him to the ground despite being repeatedly struck with the knife.  Bodyworn and dashboard camera footage released by the force showed Brown, who was dressed in black with a hood up, run up to Sgt Foster from behind with a knife outstretched. He collided with the officer who stumbled and fell to the ground, before Sgt Ansell jumped in tried to wrestle him to the ground despite being repeatedly struck with the knife.  PC Wolstencroft drew his Taser and waited for a clear shot, bringing the struggle to an end. After Brown fell to the ground the constable was heard to say \"officer stabbed\" over his radio. Sgt Ansell can be heard to say: \"Can I get something on my neck here, I've been stabbed in the neck.\"Sgt Ansell suffered two open wounds to his neck and further wounds to his arms and body, while Sgt Foster suffered slash wounds. GMP said Sgt Foster used his bare hands to stem his colleague's bleeding before paramedics arrived. The latest recognition comes after the three officers won GMP's own Bravery Awards in October 2023 and the John Egerton Bravery Award from the GMP branch of the Police Federation in April 2024. They were also awarded a North West Bravery Award in July 2024. A statement from GMP said: \"The actions of all three officers ultimately saved each other and meant no members of the public suffered any injuries.\"Brown was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order in April 2024, GMP said.",

With its hip-hop rock style and expletive-laden lyrics, it was a defining sound of the late 90s and credited with helping to bring heavy music to the mainstream.Their hit albums include Significant Other, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, while they also had success with singles such as Take a Look Around and the number one hit Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle).\"We shared so many moments - wild ones, quiet ones, beautiful ones - and every one of them meant more because Sam was there,\" the band said.\"We are in shock\", wrote DJ Lethal, real name Leor Dimant, under the announcement on Instagram.He also asked for fans to respect the privacy of Rivers' family.Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesLimp Bizkit's expletive-laden lyrics and hip-hop rock style dominated the 90s and early noughtiesAlongside his musical talent - Rivers was awarded the Gibson award for Best Bassist in 2000 - the band also championed his charitable work in their tribute to him. \"You will live on through your music and the lives you helped save with your music, charity work and friendships,\" DJ Lethal wrote.The group released a new single, Making Love to Morgan Wallen, in September and performed at Reading Festival in August.It has been four years since their last album, Still Suck. Rivers left Limp Bizkit in 2015 for several years due to liver disease from \"excessive drinking\", he told author Jon Wiederhorn for the book, Raising Hell.\"I quit drinking and did everything the doctors told me,\" he said, as quoted by Loudwire. \"I got treatment for the alcohol and got a liver transplant, which was a perfect match.\"",

    "body": "13 minutes agoSimon JackBusiness editor andJosh MartinBusiness reporterAll 1,287 Betfred shops could disappear from the UK High Street if Chancellor Rachel Reeves hikes taxes on gambling firms, the company's co-founder and chairman has told the BBC.Fred Done, who set up Betfred in 1967 with his brother, said a closure of that size would put 7,500 jobs at risk.The billionaire businessman said tax rises were the \"biggest threat\" to the industry in his 57 years. It echoes similar warnings from other gambling brands.Increasing taxes on betting firms in the Budget has been suggested to the chancellor. She recently told ITV: \"I do think there is a case for gambling firms paying more… they should pay their fair share of taxes and we will make sure that happens.\"Reeves has been encouraged by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to increase taxes on the gambling sector and use the revenue from that to reduce child poverty.The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank estimated over the summer that additional taxes on the industry, as high as 50%, could raise £3.2bn.At the time the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents gambling companies, called Brown's plan \"economically reckless\", saying it would push gamblers into the black market.Betting companies have resisted calls for taxes to rise. Up to 200 William Hill retail outlets could close if the industry faces higher taxes, its owner Evoke said earlier this month.Betfred's Mr Done said that if taxes on UK gambling companies increased he would also feel compelled to close his High Street shops. \"It [tax] doesn't even need to go up to 50%. If it went up to anywhere like 40% or even 35% there is no profit in the business. We would have to close it down. I'm talking job losses. We're talking probably 7,500,\" he said.He said 300 of his shops were \"currently losing money\" and claimed a 5% increase on gambling taxes would raise that number to 430.\"Once the [UK] industry is closed down, it's gone. People will still bet, but they'll bet offshore with it. There's plenty of bookmakers offshore who happen to take the bets, who don't pay anything to this country,\" he said.Punters' winnings from gambling are not taxed in the UK, nor is VAT charged on bets. However, the gambling industry pays extra taxes, including:a tax of 21% on online casino gaming stakesduty of 20% on slots and gaming machinesgeneral betting duty on sports fixtures of 15% general betting duty on horseracing of 25%Mr Done said recent increases in employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and the minimum wage had already added £20m to his company's costs.He agreed that, like with banking or buying clothes, customers are increasingly going online, making it inevitable to close betting shops.Rival firm Paddy Power on Thursday said it would close 57 shops across the UK and Republic of Ireland, citing increasing cost pressures and challenging market conditions.\"Slowly it will go online, but we're talking, without tax increases, we've still got probably 20 years of life on the High Street,\" said Mr Done. \"And you know, the UK High Street is being decimated with closures.\"In its most recent annual results, Betfred took in nearly £1bn of revenue, but made an operating profit of just £500,000 after a series of writedowns on its assets.The family-owned company has bases in the UK, Gibraltar, the US and South Africa, with investment in both online gambling and High Street sports betting.Critics point to the social and financial harm caused by gambling. Office for Health Improvement and Disparities research from 2023 estimated the excess costs of harmful gambling to be between £1bn and £1.77bn.Prof Ashwin Kumar, director of research and policy at the IPPR, said higher taxes were needed on the industry, particularly for online betting, to reflect the negative consequences gambling has on some people.\"We know that most of the profits made by gambling companies come from a very small number of gamblers, many of whom are at risk of serious harm. And so we think that the duties should be higher, just like tobacco and alcohol.\"Charity GambleAware, which supports people with gambling addiction, said \"further regulation\" was needed on advertising to help protect children and young people, as well as to raise awareness about the risks.But Mr Done argues that UK-based, High Street betting shops provide better safeguards for people with gambling problems, as well as tax revenues, than online and offshore rivals.As to whether he thinks his appeal to keep taxes as they are will win over the chancellor, Mr Done said \"we're 10 to one against\", which suggests it's odds on that many betting shops will close.A HM Treasury spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation around future changes to tax policy.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoIan Aikman andRachel HaganThe daughter of the latest dead hostage to be returned to Israel from Gaza and identified has said her father is \"finally home.\"Israel's military has confirmed that one of two sets of remains handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza on Saturday are those of Ronen Engel. The identity of the second person yet to be announced.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF)  said Mr Engel, 54, was killed on 7 October and his body taken into Gaza from Nir Oz kibbutz. He is the 11th of 28 dead hostages to be returned.Mr Engel's daughter Mika wrote on Instagram: \"It's not what we hoped, it's not what we wished for him, but it's finally here.\"Mr Engel's wife, Karina Engel-Bart, and their teenage daughters were also taken hostage but were released in November 2023 during a truce between Israel and Hamas. The following month, the IDF confirmed that Mr Engel had been killed in captivity.Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that Mr Engel was remembered by loved ones as a man with \"hands of gold and the soul of an artist.\"He was a photographer and volunteer ambulance driver for Magen David Adom (Mada), the Israeli equivalent of the Red Cross.The delay in the return of the dead hostages has caused outrage in Israel, as the terms of last week's ceasefire deal stipulated the release from Gaza of all hostages - living and dead. Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the remaining bodies under the rubble in Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has ordered the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to remain closed until further notice, and said its reopening would be considered based on the return of the final hostage remains and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.The Rafah crossing is vital for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave, and for thousands of others to return.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".But the US has downplayed suggestions that the delay amounts to a breach of the ceasefire deal, which President Donald Trump claimed as a major victory on a visit to Israel and Egypt last week.The text of the deal has not been published, but a leaked version that was seen in Israeli media appeared to account for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult, as air strikes on Gaza have reduced many buildings to rubble, and Israel does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into the territory.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. Also as part of the deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire. The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza. There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoBBCA 71-year-old woman has said she feels \"absolutely sick\" after being told she would be evicted from her home on the estate where the BBC sitcom Ghosts was filmed.Baschea Walsh has lived in a cottage on the grounds of West Horsley Place for nearly 20 years but now says she is being kicked out so her home can be turned into a holiday let for fans of Ghosts.She told the BBC: \"I've had such a lovely time here and to leave it, it's going to break my heart.\"Ghosts, which followed the adventures of a living couple sharing a house with a group of spirits, was a ratings hit for the BBC, with 6.2 million people watching the final episode in 2023.A spokesperson for West Horsley Place Trust, which owns the cottage, said they appreciated it was a significant upheaval for the tenant, and had provided an extended notice period and help exploring alternative housing options.West Horsley Place is a 15th Century Grade I listed manor house in Surrey with a 400 acre estate attached. It has been a location for film and television productions including Enola Holmes, Howards End, Vanity Fair and Ghosts, where the building was renamed Button House. Throughout the years the estate has passed through different hands – including Henry VIII's – eventually ending up, in 2014, in the hands of Bamber Gascoigne, the author and former host of University Challenge.Mr Gascoigne and his wife Christina decided to hand over West Horsley Place – and its assets including outbuildings - to a charitable trust aimed at restoring the building and promoting the arts including performance and crafts. Miss Walsh first came across the 17th Century cottage on the estate when she was visiting a friend of her son's who was living there. She says it was her dream house, literally. \"I had already dreamt about it. I know that sounds ridiculous but as soon as I saw it I thought 'that was in my dream'. It genuinely was.\"She moved into the cottage in 2006. \"It's been a place I've adored,\" she says. \"My grandchildren have loved being here - they've enjoyed it as much as I.\"It's been a magical place to live... I thought I was going to be here forever.\" BBC/Monumental/Guido MandozziThe series Ghosts, filmed at West Horsley Place, ran for five seriesSince moving in, Miss Walsh says she has been very aware of \"the privilege\" of living in such picturesque and historic surroundings.\"And when something is a privilege then you do what you can to pay that back and appreciate it,\" she says. To that end, Miss Walsh has thrown herself into looking after the area and getting involved with the local community. That included repurposing an old pushchair in order to go round the estate picking up rubbish. \"I've collected car bumpers, bottles, cans, dog poo and things you don't even want to know about.\"During her time on the estate, she has also volunteered for the opera festival that takes place on the estate every year, and makes decorations for local events including VE Day celebrations. West Horsley Place TrustGhosts fans dressed up as their favourite characters for a Halloween open dayIn July she was sent an email by the West Horsley Place Trust asking for a meeting.\"I thought my rent was going to go up again,\" she says. \"Last time they put it up by 30% which was a bit of a shock.\"Instead, she was told that they wanted to turn her cottage into a holiday let.What were her thoughts after hearing the news?\"I just felt absolutely sick,\" says Miss Walsh. \"I have to admit I've had the worst month.\"I completely flipped out.\"My life has just stopped - I can't do anything for anybody, because I'm in crisis. \"I don't know what the hell I'm doing, I don't know where I'm going to live, I don't know what I can keep.\"Baschea Walsh in the front garden of her ivy-covered cottage, standing next to her model sheep, Mrs DalrympleMiss Walsh has been given until November to move out and says she has been trying to find alternative places to live, but would struggle to afford anywhere in the local area. \"I'm quite capable of going to a different post office, petrol station, supermarket, but my doctor, my hospital... I'm going to have to change everything,\" she says. \"I'm going to be taken out of my community.\"Even when she finds somewhere to move to, she says she will always live with the fear that she could be kicked out again.West Horsley Place, known to Ghosts fans as Button House Christina Gascoigne, the widow of Bamber, told the BBC she was \"shocked and horrified\" to hear of the eviction.\"I don't think it is right and I think he [Bamber Gascogine] would feel the same.\" A spokesperson for West Horsley Place Trust, which last year hosted a Halloween events for Ghosts fans, said: \"We fully appreciate how significant an upheaval this is for the tenant.\"We have provided an extended notice period and offered personalised support, including assistance in exploring alternative housing options.\"We have not taken the decision to end this tenancy lightly.\"West Horsley Place Trust is an independent charity caring for a fragile heritage estate. \"To secure its future and continue our public mission, we are creating diversified, sustainable income through carefully considered changes, including updating and converting two historic cottages into holiday lets.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterPrince Andrew's removal from the last vestiges of royal life has not only reshaped his future - it's sending ripples through his family too.His ex-wife has now lost her duchess title and will simply be known as Sarah Ferguson.Their daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, will continue to have the title of princess as scandal surrounds their parents.Prince Andrew lost use of his Duke of York title over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.So, what does life after the royal shake up look like for the women of the York Family?For Ferguson, 66, the change will be the most visible.For all these years, she has kept the courtesy royal divorcee title Sarah, Duchess of York. Now, she reverts to her maiden name of Ferguson.And while arguably we've always referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer said that will \"no doubt\" have an impact.\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title – even her Twitter bio is @SarahTheDuchess.\"But the loss of her title may impact her much less than the scandal she's facing separately about her own links with Epstein.Accuser's brother urges King to strip Andrew of prince titleSarah Ferguson dropped from multiple charities over Epstein emailAfter all those scandals, why did Andrew quit his titles now?Last month, several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\"I think as far as Sarah is concerned, her own recent controversy involving the email she is said to have sent Epstein is what has had the biggest impact for her of late,\" said royal commentator Victoria Murphy.\"Prior to that, she had sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein and I think may have continued to do so, albeit without calling herself Duchess of York, had that not happened.\"Away from her philanthropy, Ferguson also has various business ventures.And these, too, are more likely to be affected by the Epstein controversy than any change in title, says Murphy.\"I would say it's likely they will be impacted by the revelations of her own contact with Epstein, in the same way her charity work was and the fact that charities didn't want to be associated with her.\"But Ferguson has been a great survivor in royal circles. She's kept bouncing back.Even though she split from Prince Andrew more than three decades ago, she has remained his strong supporter and still lives in his Windsor estate.The Christmas before last, she was back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham for the first time in decades, despite the fact that she and her ex-husband were not working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.That ability to bounce back may help her this time too.\"She's the ultimate survivor and master of reinvention,\" said royal author Katie Nicholls.\"Not only has she been reaccepted by the public, but the late Queen Elizabeth II brought her back into the fold, and Charles is also very fond of her.\"Nicholls argues that over the years Ferguson has been through \"much worse\" and won't be too impacted by the loss of her title.\"Having been a royal outcast for all these decades, she's learnt not to attach too much weight to things like that.\"For the couple's two daughters, Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, there's no formal change.They will still be known as princesses, which they have been entitled to since birth.There is also no change to the line of succession.Andrew remains eighth in line to the crown, followed by his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, in ninth and twelfth place respectively.But in reality their positions are \"low down\" and will likely become much further down as time goes on, says Murphy.\"So practically, their positions have little meaning for the future,\" she says.King Charles III's closest family and line of successionBeatrice and Eugenie are also currently non-working royals, and while they do sometimes take on roles – Princess Eugenie was recently announced as a mentor for the King's Foundation's 35 under 35 network, for example - Murphy also says she \"can't see a world\" in which they would step up into royal duties in any official way.\"I don't think that was ever really on the cards, and I certainly don't see it as an option,\" she said.They have also benefited from all of the contacts their parents have made over the years, says Palmer. And while Andrew still remains a prince, losing the dukedom could have a knock-on impact there.Prince Andrew will also no longer join the King and the rest of the royal family at Christmas at Sandringham, but it's possible his daughters will still attend, says Palmer.\"As far as Beatrice and Eugenie go, I think there's an appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them, and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves,\" says Murphy.\"Their daughters are most unfortunate victims, they've had to suffer in silence and have been dignified in their silence,\" adds Nicholls.\"It can't be easy to see their parents dragged through something like this, and they remain very much loved nieces of the King. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see them at Christmas occasions in the future. They're largely untarnished.\"Ultimately, there seems to be little doubt that the person who will be most affected by all of this will be Prince Andrew himself.For a man who always liked the trappings of royalty, the pomp and the ceremony, the loss of his titles is deeply humiliating.So to not have those, on a personal level, will really matter.",

    "body": "Will giving up his titles really make much difference for Andrew?9 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPA MediaWe're unlikely to see Prince Andrew at a royal public event now for at least six months. And then maybe only once or twice a year.Banned from royal Christmas celebrations at Sandringham he won't be on the annual church walk. It could be April 2026, at the Easter church service, before he reappears on such a family occasion, maybe longer.But when he resurfaces, how much will his life have really changed, despite the drama of the loss of his titles and honours?The move against Andrew followed a public outcry for some kind of sanction and there's certainly been a powerful symbolic message of displeasure - but will it really end the accusing headlines and will his daily life be much affected?PA MediaPrince William has not shown any enthusiasm for being seen with AndrewBuckingham Palace will hope that this will be seen as a decisive intervention, ending the drip-drip of scandal.The King was in Scotland when Andrew made his decision on giving up his titles and reportedly spoke to his brother on the phone.He had consulted Prince William, who has all the warmth of an ice age for his uncle Andrew. When William is eventually on the throne, Andrew's royal appearances might be reduced from rare to never.It had been William who had already intervened to stop Andrew from walking in the Order of the Garter procession.There has been a colossal loss of reputation for Prince Andrew and he'll keenly feel no longer being able to use the Duke of York title and to take part in the Order of the Garter. He's become a persona non-garter.It's a deep blow to his pride. But on a day-to-day basis, he's still a prince and he's still living in a mansion in Windsor. Royal Lodge has got a lease until 2078, so if he leaves it will be his own choice.Living with him still will be his ex-wife, who is now also an ex-duchess. They've gone back to the position when they first met, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew.His downfall has been driven by his links with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But while Andrew has lost his status, if he ever looks at the infamous photo of him and Virginia Giuffre, everyone else in the picture - Ms Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell - and the person who was claimed to have taken it - Epstein - are either dead or in prison. The prince is the only one who has walked away.He can still spend his days watching aviation videos or TV shows. His family life with his daughters, who are still princesses, can continue unchanged.His statement about not using his titles, more or less a resignation letter, didn't have any flicker of remorse, continuing to assert his sense of duty and honour. So no change there.PA MediaSarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew will still be together at Royal LodgeWhen Andrew had to stop being a working royal, in the wake of his Newsnight interview, there was an expectation that he might take the time-worn approach of quiet contrition and some charity work, to gradually regain public respect.Instead he showed no sense of regret. A royal insider, asked about Andrew's chances of a dignified return to public life, simply said to me: \"The grand old Duke of York, he gave 12 million quid, to someone he never met, for something he never did.\"It meant he had never really accepted responsibility for what had happened. Several years later, the only thing that's changed is that he's no longer the Duke of York.The intense pressure applied this week by the Palace to Prince Andrew to accept the loss of titles was driven by two key factors, according to royal sources.First, the Palace wanted to stop the cacophony of terrible headlines about Andrew that kept drowning out the rest of the Royal Family's work. They wanted a line drawn under the scandals.And second, there was genuine disquiet at the discovery that Prince Andrew had stayed in touch longer with Epstein than he had previously admitted. If that part of his account was unreliable, what else might emerge?Getting Prince Andrew to renounce the use of his titles, under the threat of forcibly taking them away, was an attempt to publicly show that the Palace was taking this seriously. They would put an end to his remaining links with royal life.Although this made headlines around the world, it won't stop the underlying questions about Prince Andrew and Epstein and the accompanying headlines.This week will see the publication of the posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who claimed to have been forced to have sex with Andrew.The prince has emphatically denied any wrongdoing, but the questions for Andrew about Ms Giuffre and Epstein seem to be getting louder than fading away. There could also be questions about what the Palace did or didn't know about Andrew and Epstein's circle.Whether he's called a prince or an ex-duke, he could still be caught up in the public and political pressure to reveal more documents about Epstein, particularly in the United States.PA MediaKing Charles had been in Scotland when Andrew had agreed to lose his titlesThe press will keep pulling on other threads, like Andrew's business dealings with China. Whatever the Palace hopes, the headlines are unlikely to stop.At the centre of it all is Prince Andrew, saying nothing now apart from his terse statement, written through gritted teeth, about his titles.Before his Newsnight interview in 2019 he had been much more open to talking to the media. I remember speaking to him at an event in 2017 encouraging entrepreneurs.Looking back it seems unintentionally prophetic.\"One of the things that I was taught at school was that the best way of being successful is to fail,\" he'd said.\"If you can learn about failure, and do it in such a way that it's a safe environment… then you will have learnt something, you will have experienced something.\"How many times did you put your finger in the plug socket as a small child and say 'ow' - and you never did it again.\"If you did it a second time, you'd think that was really stupid. They've failed and then they've learned what not to do next time,\" said Prince Andrew.\"You're always stronger from failure.\" Is that a lesson he was ever good at learning?",

    "body": "Image source, GettyBySimon King Lead Weather PresenterSome of the United Kingdom's most valued trees are struggling to keep pace with climate change and increasing extreme weather.\"We are very concerned that changing conditions are putting our trees under significant stress,\" warns Dr Eleanor Tew from Forestry England.To future-proof our forests, a 'species for the future' list has been released highlighting thirty trees likely to thrive in a warmer climate.It includes familiar names like oak, birch, and alder, alongside less common species such as coast redwood and Corsican pine, which it is hoped will lead to a more resilient woodland.Image source, BBC Weather Watchers/Walking TractorImage caption, Trees are starting to pop with bright red and gold colours as we head deeper into autumnWhile the UK's warmest summer on record has lead to a spectacular display of autumn colours in 2025, generally our trees just aren't coping.Recent heatwaves have led to trees dying, including 460 in the record-breaking heat of 2022 alone at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew.Kevin Martin, Head of Tree Collections there said: \"Something that would have happened once in a decade is going to happen every three or four years.\" Through a detailed assessment of how different species would perform under future conditions, Forestry England - who manage publicly owned forests in England - have devised an inventory of trees, external expected to cope better with rising temperatures, changing rainfall, and emerging pests and diseases.Containing both native and non-native species, the aim is to create stronger, more diverse forests that can adapt to our shifting climate over the coming decades.The rate of climate change is the main issueEarth has cycled through glacial and interglacial periods lasting hundreds of thousands of years. The shift from the last ice age to today's warmer climate took 5,000–8,000 years, where global average temperature rose 4C or 5C, at a rate of around 0.1C every century. Over this time trees adapted to the changing climate by migration - essentially seedlings growing further south as it got colder and further north during warming periods.In contrast, human activity has driven a 1.3C rise just in the last century - ten times faster than previously. Trees simply can't keep up.According to Dr Sarah Dalrymple, plant ecologist at Liverpool John Moores University there are already signs of change with \"tree seedlings falling on the ground not being fertilised and dispersed into suitable habitats because it's too dry\".An example is the oak which makes up approximately 20% of our broadleaf tree species but due to 'acute oak decline' - a disease directly related to heat and drought stress - there has been a drop in numbers in central and south-eastern areas.This is a significant problem because each oak tree supports up to 2,300 species of wildlife including birds, mammals, fungi and insects - the most of any native UK tree - according to the Woodland Trust.Image source, GettyImage caption, Trees such as the common English oak may be under threat in our changing climateAssisting the migration of treesMany trees on the list already grow naturally here but some come from warmer or drier regions like the Corsican pine from the Mediterranean or the coast redwood from North America. Their inclusion reflects growing interest in assisted migration, which means introducing tree species now that are suited to the climate the UK is expected to have in the future.The England Species Reintroductions Taskforce, an independent advisory group, guides conservation and species translocation efforts.Dr Dalrymple, a member of the taskforce, told the BBC: \"We've been tracking biodiversity loss for years...do we just watch it happen or act before it's too late?\"One suggestion would be to plant the the seed of the common oak currently growing in the Georgia and Azerbaijan border in the UK. It grows in similar soil and environmental conditions to southern England and could be used to sustain future oak populations in the UK.However, assisted migration also poses challenges. The UK's increasingly extreme weather, like late spring frosts followed by heatwaves, brings conditions that \"are really difficult for trees to adapt to\", said Dr Tew of Forestry England.While some tree species might thrive in the next 50 to 100 years, they may not be suited to weather conditions in the UK now.All a balancing actAnother concern is the risk of introducing non-native or potentially invasive species.In 2012 a wind-borne fungus from Asia triggered ash dieback in the UK, threatening up to 80% of mature ash trees. The disease has serious ecological, landscape, and economic consequences.But herein also lies the problem.\"If we don't do any conservation and let nature take its course and let say the oak die off, you would lose the wider biodiversity around that,\" said Mr Martin from Kew Gardens.And in selecting trees more suited to our future climate it's vital to understand any invasive nature they might have.Dr Tew explained: \"there's no silver bullet...we need diverse strategies across different areas to help trees adapt.\" The challenge lies in balancing intervention with the risk of doing nothing, which could result in significant biodiversity loss over time.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "8 hours agoJulie Yoonnyung LeeBloomsbury PublishingFor South Koreans, tteokbokki is more than a snack. It's soul food. This sweet and spicy dish made with chewy rice cakes is a staple of Korea's street food culture and beloved by people of all ages.It's the food students turn to after long school days, and as adults, one you seek after a hard day at work.So when readers came across a book titled I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki in 2018, many were immediately intrigued. Its honest yet playful title sparked curiosity, some wondering just how much you must love tteokbokki to write an entire book about it. Many were soon drawn to its raw honesty.It became an instant bestseller that was widely discussed and resonated deeply in Korea. This week, Baek Se-hee, the book's South Korean author, died aged 35. The details surrounding her death remain unclear. The fact the Korean Organ Donation Agency said Baek had saved five lives by donating her organs, emphasised her wish to help others.Her death at such a young age has brought deep sorrow to readers who found comfort and understanding in her words. Social media and blogs have been flooded with tributes and personal stories from those her books have helped, while news outlets around the world reported her passing prominently.At its heart, the book is a record of Baek's conversations with her psychiatrist as she navigates dysthymia - a mild but long-lasting type of depression - and anxiety disorders. Through these sessions, she opens up about her daily struggles - such as overthinking others' opinions, obsessing over her appearance, and wrestling with self-doubt. Rather than examining clinical depression, she reflects on the gentle melancholy many can relate to.What makes her story so compelling is its candour. She captures that delicate human contradiction of living wearily with everyday sadness alongside the simultaneous desire to keep going. Just like a comforting dish of tteokbokki on a difficult day, her words offer warmth and understanding, reminding readers that even in vulnerability there is strength.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line. If you are outside of the UK, you can visit the Befrienders website.Instagram / Baek Se-heeBaek Se-hee's memoir was lauded for its honest portrayal of mental health conversations'It's okay not to be perfect'One of the many young people the book resonated with is Jo Eun Bit, a 25-year-old student at Korea University in Seoul, who found it helped her navigate uncertainty about her future.\"All generations in Korea tend to measure themselves against what others are doing and the achievements they've made, and that only fuels competition,\" she said. \"But I liked this book because it seems to send the message that it's OK not to live according to the standards set by society.\"One of the most memorable passages in her book is that I am a one-of-a-kind being in this world, and that alone makes me special. I am someone I should care for throughout my life. The more I look within myself, the happier I believe I will become.  \"To me, this offered comfort that it's OK not to be perfect, and at the same time reminded me that I, too, am someone who needs to be nurtured and cared for.\"Passages of the book resonated with Jo Eun BitThe relentless competition from school to the workplace, coupled with the pressure to meet family and societal expectations, is leaving many young South Koreans feeling disheartened. In a society still influenced by Confucian values such as righteousness and obedience, mental health issues remain heavily stigmatised and many experience feelings of shame or social judgement.Baek's book inverted the notion that social success is the ultimate measure of a life well lived, openly addressing the mental health issues many commonly face and, in doing so, showing readers that acknowledging your emotions is the first step towards healing.Sangeun Lee, an elementary school teacher in Korea, told the BBC the book has held a particularly special meaning to her for that reason. \"With the rise of social media, we're exposed to other people's lives too much, and it makes us increasingly critical of ourselves,\" the 35-year-old said.\"Being imperfect is natural for everyone, but seeing so much of this kind of information can feel like an attack on yourself, making you wonder if it's even OK to live the way you do. This book encouraged me to accept myself as I am.\"Something many people relate toThe book's popularity has had a real-world impact, supporting many struggling with depression to seek professional help. It has also brought mental health issues into public conversation - RM of BTS, the globally renowned K-pop group known for songs promoting self-love, is among those who have shared the book online.Baek's pages have resonated far beyond South Korea. First published in 2018, it has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated into 25 languages. In the UK, it sold 100,000 copies within six months of its release.It has struck a chord with young women and played a significant role in expanding the reach of Korean literature. Marianna Szucs, a secondary school teacher in London, told the BBC she felt a connection to it and deep sorrow at Baek's death.\"Her book tells you that if you feel depressed or feel like you have problems, you are not the only one. She had all sorts of problems, from tiny little things to quite daunting ones. I think anyone who reads this book can find something they can relate to.\"Seunghye Sun, director of the Korean Cultural Centre UK, said \"it is highly symbolic that Baek Se-hee's voice has found resonance in the UK where great psychoanalysts like Freud and his daughter explored the human mind\", in the process broadening the spectrum of K-literature and K-culture.Her book tells a story that transcends generations and borders, sending a quiet but warm message to countless nameless readers around the world.In the end, the paradoxical title \"I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki\" may, in fact, be another way of saying, \"I want to live.\" Even in moments of deep despair, people often find the strength to carry on through small joys.For her, that joy was tteokbokki, and it shows even the simplest pleasures in daily life can become a sustaining force.More weekend picks",

    "body": "Aston Villa told their matchday stewards that they did not have to work at the club's Europa League fixture against Maccabi Tel Aviv next month, saying they understood that some \"may have concerns\".Staff were informed they had permission to skip their duties before a decision was made to ban fans of the Israeli club from attending the game at Villa Park, sparking widespread criticism.On Thursday, Aston Villa said the city's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) had concluded that Maccabi Tel Aviv's supporters should be blocked from attending over safety concerns.The UK government has since said it is working to overturn the ban, and is exploring what additional resources might be required, with a meeting of the SAG to discuss the match expected next week.However, it has now emerged that some Aston Villa stewards may have chosen to not work at the match.Villa have declined to comment.In an email sent on 3 October by the club's matchday safety team, and seen by BBC Sport, stewards were told that \"regarding the upcoming fixture against Maccabi Tel Aviv… we appreciate that some of you may have concerns about attending work\".Stewards are then informed they \"will be able to submit a one-off absence request\", and this \"will allow you to register your absence for this specific fixture\".The club also make clear that \"this type of absence will not affect your contractual minimum attendance of 80%\".It is not clear how many stewards have so far chosen to take up the offer to miss the match, or whether this was a factor in the subsequent decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv's fans from attending.The BBC has been told that the email followed a number of Aston Villa's stewards raising safety concerns with the club, and that the offer is set to stand if the ban on away supporters is lifted.Requests to miss the match must be submitted at least four working days before the fixture.On Thursday, West Midlands Police said it supported the ban, adding that it had classified the fixture as \"high risk\" based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including \"violent clashes and hate-crime offences\" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam in November 2024.More than 60 people were arrested over the violence, which city officials described as a \"toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger\" over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East.After the ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans was announced on Thursday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the move \"wrong\", adding \"we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets\". There has also been criticism from other party leaders.At the time, Aston Villa said they had been informed of the decision following \"an instruction from the SAG\". They added that West Midlands Police had advised the SAG that it had \"public safety concerns outside the stadium bowl and the ability to deal with any potential protests on the night\".The club said they were in \"continuous dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities throughout this ongoing process, with the safety of supporters attending the match and the safety of local residents at the forefront of any decision\".The SAG, which advises the council on whether to issue safety certificates, will review the decision if West Midlands Police changes its risk assessment for the match, Birmingham City Council has said.Aston Villa are represented on the SAG, along with the local authority, police and other emergency services.The Home Office was briefed that restrictions on visiting fans might be imposed last week, but the BBC was told that officials were not informed about the final decision until Thursday.",

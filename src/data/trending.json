This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "36 minutes agoAlison Roberts,Lisbon and Ian Aikman,LondonAn 85-year-old British woman has died after an extreme wind storm struck a campsite in Portugal.Two others were seriously injured and three slightly injured at Albufeira Camping Park in the Algarve, Faro's district commander for rescue operations told a press conference.At a hotel in Albufeira, which was also hit by the storm at the end of the morning, 23 people were slightly injured, and four were taken to Faro Hospital, he added. National meteorological office IPMA said it was assessing whether there had been a tornado in the area, with radar images indicating the likelihood was very high.It is difficult to predict when or where tornadoes might occur, the IPMA added.The storm hit the area around 11:00 GMT on Saturday and lasted until 15:00, it said. Among the 28 injured across both sites in Albufeira there are six children, aged between two months and seven years, who were all lightly injured, and 23 adults, aged between 24 and 70, Portugal's National Medical Emergency Institute said.Faro, Setúbal and Beja - also in southern Portugal - remain under an orange warning for persistent rain today, sometimes heavy and accompanied by thunderstorms, according to the IPMA website.On Friday, the Faro area was affected by very intense and localised gusts of wind, bringing down trees.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.The corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.The BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation. \"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"The president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.A search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.In a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.Sir Craig Oliver, former BBC editor and ex-director of politics and communications for former Prime Minister David Cameron, told BBC Today programme that this is a \"nightmare\" situation for the public broadcaster. \"The problem is that public money could be spent fighting this or settling this,\" Sir Craig said, adding that Trump doesn't \"understand the BBC, how it is funded or how it works\". Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.The BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutes",

You're talking about public money. It would not be appropriate.\"Lord Hall stepped down as director general in 2020 after seven years in the role.Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.The video edit was a \"serious error\", Lord Hall told the BBC, adding that it should have \"been recognised as such much earlier in the whole process\".Lord Hall also said he worried that the \"hard work, diligence and the belief in impartiality\" of BBC journalists had been lost in the debate.The resignation of two senior figures at the start of the BBC's charter renewal makes the process more difficult \"at a crucial time for its future\", he added.On Thursday evening, the BBC published a statement on its Corrections and Clarifications page in which it said the Panorama programme, which was only broadcast on 28 October 2024, had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.But in an interview with GB News on Saturday, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.The full interview with Lord Tony Hall can be seen on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg at 0900GMT on BBC One, 15 November 2025.",

    "body": "6 days agoNeve Gordon-FarleighCambridgeshireA rare wild orchid has been brought back from the brink of extinction by the work of dedicated conservationists.The Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland's vascular plant red list has revealed that the Fen Orchid Liparis loeselii is officially no longer considered under threat in Britain. Cambridge University Botanic Garden has been working with Plantlife and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew to reintroduce and increase the number of Fen Orchids since 2008.Tim Pankhurt, former conservation manager at Plantlife, said: \"Playing a leading role in reducing the threat status of such a beautiful yet merciful orchid is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a botanist and one I will always treasure.\"The Fen Orchid typically grows among reeds nestled in moss that retains moisture and relies on the presence of specific moss and fungi to grow. The primary cause of the plants decline has been habitat loss through drainage and abandonment of the fens.In 2010, the plant was only found at three sites in East Anglia and at one site in Wales.Now it has been recorded at seven sites in England and three in Wales - with its population in the UK exceeding 10,000 individual plants. Mr Pankhurst, who has dedicated his life's work to protecting the species before his retirement in April, says the most important aspect of the conservation project has been collaboration. \"As we face the enormous challenges of climate and biodiversity loss, this provides a moment of genuine hope for the future and is a testament to what dedicated partnership conservation work delivered consistently over many decades can deliver,\" he said.\"You don't achieve successes like this on your own.\"According to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, this is the first time the Fen Orchid has successfully been cultivated in Great Britain.Peter Stroh, scientific officer at the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland, said the revision of the species threat status was \"excellent news\".He said: \"It's important to remember that the Fen Orchid remains a conservation-dependent species.\"The challenge now is to ensure that the Fen Orchid continues to thrive in its current locations and, either naturally or with a helping hand, flourish in former sites and new places within its native range in the coming years.\" ",

    "body": "BBC now faces tough legal battle with world's most powerful man. What happens next?4 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorAnyone who thought the BBC's apology to Donald Trump was going to stop his threat of a lawsuit was, quite frankly, deluded.The BBC chairman Samir Shah perhaps summed it up in the interview he gave me the day after the director general and the CEO of News resigned. He called the president \"a litigious fellow\".That's an understatement, evident in the number of legal cases Trump has taken out against various US media companies.The president, based on his GB News interview, is clearly hurt by what he sees as an \"egregious\" edit, and he has now apparently upped the amount he says he will sue the corporation for. While on board Air Force One on Friday, Trump told reporters the figure would be \"anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn\".To put this in context, the BBC's annual income from the licence fee was £3.8 billion last year.On Friday, Trump said: \"They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" He wants to know why Panorama edited two clips of his speech together to give a \"totally different meaning\".He doesn't accept the BBC's response that what happened was unintentional.This is a very serious moment in the history of the BBC. It stands or falls by being viewed as impartial - a source to trust in a world where trust in institutions is falling.Instead, the corporation is being accused of the opposite - and faces an expensive and very public battle with the most powerful man in the world.So where does it go from here?Ever since the president first threatened legal action, it was clear that the corporation did not intend to offer him compensation. It believes it has a case that, whatever error was made, no harm was caused to Trump by the Panorama programme. He was elected president soon after it went out and anyway, says the BBC, the programme wasn't broadcast on any US channels, so how could it have harmed him?I think there was a certain consensus, inside and outside the corporation, that the notion of using licence fee payers' money to settle with Trump was a non-starter.As one former senior BBC executive put it to me, after the BBC had rejected offering compensation, \"they've made the right call\". But this person also said, if the president did decide to sue, the BBC would have to \"batten down - and get the best lawyers in Florida\".The reason to settle would have been to bring down costs in the long run.Now it looks as if the BBC will be involved in a protracted, costly court battle at a time when it should be 100% focused on the discussions over the renewal of its charter, which are ramping up.The people at the top of the BBC should be fully concentrating on what is, in normal times, a fundamental moment for the corporation - when what it's for, its scope, how it will be funded, the details of its very existence are all hammered out between government and BBC in time for a new charter at the start of 2028.It's already losing the man who should have led that - Tim Davie, the director general. Now top BBC brains will be diverted, to game out its next moves in what could be a very damaging, even existential fight with Donald Trump. The legal fees alone could get very expensive.This might all have been avoided if the BBC had been open about the error much earlier and corrected it. Instead, it faces a long road. But there may be routes off it. Might the BBC ask the UK government to step in through back channels? Would a call from Prime Minister Keir Starmer persuade Trump to change his mind? Would Starmer even want to get involved and expend his own political capital with the US president?One positive for the BBC this week was the robust nature in which the culture secretary Lisa Nandy defended the corporation. She talked about the widespread trust in BBC News and described the corporation as \"a light on the hill for people in times of darkness\" which brings the country together, whether through Celebrity Traitors or its VE Day coverage.Donald Trump, on the other hand, has called the BBC \"worse than fake news\". He claims the corporation and its journalists are corrupt.The fight is well and truly on.",

    "body": "16 hours agoRobin Levinson-King and Eloise AlannaSubmitted photoThe first thing Lana Ponting remembers about the Allan Memorial Institute, a former psychiatric hospital in Montreal, Canada, is the smell - almost medicinal.\"I didn't like the look of the place. It didn't look like a hospital to me,\" she told the BBC from her home in Manitoba.That hospital – once the home of a Scottish shipping magnate – would be her home for a month in April 1958, after a judge ordered the then-16-year-old to undergo treatment for \"disobedient\" behaviour.It was there that Ms Ponting became one of thousands of people experimented on as part of the CIA's top-secret research into mind control. Now, she is one of two named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit for Canadian victims of the experiments. On Thursday, a judge denied the Royal Victoria Hospital's appeal, paving the way for the lawsuit to proceed.According to her medical files, which she obtained only recently, Ms Ponting had been running away from home and hanging out with friends her parents disapproved of after a difficult move with her family from Ottawa to Montreal.\"I was an ordinary teenager,\" she recalled. But the judge sent her to the Allan.Once there, she became an unwitting participant in covert CIA experiments known as MK-Ultra. The Cold War project tested the effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD, electroshock treatments and brainwashing techniques on human beings without their consent.Over 100 institutions – hospitals, prisons and schools – in the US and Canada were involved.At the Allan, McGill University researcher Dr Ewen Cameron drugged patients and made them listen to recordings, sometimes thousands of times, in a process he called \"exploring\".The Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal is where the CIA-backed experiments were conducted in CanadaDr Cameron would make Ms Ponting listen to the same tape recording hundreds of times.\"It ran over and over again, you're a good girl, you're a bad girl,\" Ms Ponting recalled.The technique was a form of \"psychic driving,\" says doctoral student Jordan Torbay, who has researched his experiments and their ethical implications.\"Essentially the minds of patients were manipulated using verbal cues,\" she says, adding he also looked at the effects of sleep drugs, forced sensory deprivation, and induced coma.Medical records show Ms Ponting was given LSD, as well as drugs like sodium amytal, a barbiturate, desoxyn, a stimulant, as well as nitrous oxide gas, a sedative known as laughing gas.\"By April 30th, the patient had explorations… she had become quite tense and extremely violent when given the Nitrous Oxide, throwing herself half out of bed and starting to scream,\" Dr Cameron wrote in one of her medical files, which Ms Ponting has obtained through a freedom of information request.The harsh truth about the MK-Ultra experiments first came to light in the 1970s. Since then, several victims have tried to sue the US and Canada. Lawsuits in the US have largely been unsuccessful, but in 1988, a Canadian judge ordered the US government to pay nine victims $67,000 each. In 1992 the Canadian government paid C$100,000 (about $80,000 at the time) to each of 77 victims – but did not admit liability.Ms Ponting was not among them, because she did not yet know that she was a victim, she saysWatch: The CIA's secret pursuit of 'mind control'Listen: The Woman Who Resisted Mind ControlFor decades, Ms Ponting said she felt something was wrong with her, but she did not learn of the details of her own involvement in the experiments until somewhat recently.She says she had little memory of what happened at the Allan, or in the years that followed.Ms Ponting eventually married and moved to Manitoba, where she had two children whom she is still close to. Now, she's a grandmother to four grandchildren. But she says she has suffered life-long repercussions from her time at the Allan.\"I felt it all my life, because I was wondering why I would think this way, or, you know what happened to me,\" she said.She says she's had to be on a cocktail of medications her whole life to deal with mental-health issues, which she attributes to her time at the Allan, as well as recurrent nightmares.\"Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night because of what happened,\" she said.The Royal Victoria Hospital and McGill University declined to comment as the case is before the courts. The government pointed the BBC to its previous settlement, in 1992, which it said was done for \"humanitarian\" reasons and did not accept legal liability.For Ms Pointing, the lawsuit is a chance to finally get some closure.\"Sometimes I sit in my living room and my mind goes back, and I can think of the things that happened to me, you know,\" she says. \"Every time I see a picture of Dr Cameron, it makes me so angry.\"Although Dr Cameron's work has since become synonymous with MK-Ultra experiments, Ms Torbay says her research shows he didn't know he was being funded by the CIA at the time. His work with the US intelligence agency ended in 1964, and he died shortly after, of a heart attack, in 1967.But regardless of whether he knew of where the money was coming from, Ms Torbay says he should have known the experiments he was conducting were not ethical.She says she hopes the lawsuit goes forward, and the victims get some sense of justice.\"It isn't really about giving the patients back what they lost, because that's not possible, but sort of almost making sure their suffering wasn't in vain, that we do learn from this,\" she says.",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 3 days agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "18 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentPeople granted asylum in the UK will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, in a major change of policy to be announced by the home secretary on Monday.Shabana Mahmood is expected to declare that the era of permanent protection for refugees is over, as she seeks to reduce asylum claims and small boat crossings.Under the plans, those granted asylum will be returned to their home country when it is deemed safe and their status will be regularly reviewed.Currently, refugee status in the UK lasts for five years, after which they can apply for  indefinite leave to remain and have a route to citizenship.There are currently some temporary schemes for those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. This was initially for three years but extensions have been granted.Government insiders are describing a move to temporary status for all successful asylum seekers as a \"significant shift\".The policy has been copied from Denmark, where a government led by the centre-left Social Democrats has presided over one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.In Denmark, refugees are given temporary residence permits, typically of two years, and in effect have to re-apply for asylum when they expire.A previous presumption in the Danish system to extend permits was scrapped.  Even for those who are allowed to extend multiple times, the route to citizenship has grown longer and harder.The Danish approach is admired by UK government ministers, including Mahmood, who point out that as the Social Democrat party's immigration policies hardened their poll ratings rose - and those of a populist right-wing movement, the People's Party, fell.The home secretary believes that unless Labour takes similar decisions then \"darker forces\" could thrive in the UK.Last week, the BBC revealed that Mahmood had sent senior Home Office officials to Denmark to see what lessons could be learned from their system. And it was not just temporary status for refugees that caught the eyes of her officials.They also looked at Denmark's greater restrictions on \"family reunion\" - when refugees want to bring their spouses, partners or children to the country.Mahmood believes Denmark's policies serve as a disincentive for people to seek asylum in the first place and is impressed that successful claims are at a 40-year low.And she believes that what she sees as the current generosity of the UK system is acting as a magnet, and driving small boat crossings.In a social media video trailing her announcement, Mahmood said: \"We will always be a country that gives sanctuary to people who are fleeing danger but we must restore order and control.\"But copying Denmark too closely would be controversial.Four years ago the Danish government planned to return around 200 refugees to Syria even while a civil war raged - because it said some parts of Damascus were safe.And Mahmood's new approach will certainly face opposition from some Labour MPs. When it was revealed that Denmark was being used as a model for tougher rules in the UK, Labour's Clive Lewis told the BBC the system in that country echoed \"talking points of the far right.\"And he said \"progressive\" voters may migrate to more left-wing parties, such as the Greens, if Labour goes down this route.Another Labour left-winger, Nadia Whittome, said following in Denmark's path would be a \"dead end - morally, politically and electorally\".But the BBC understands Mahmood will issue a warning to her sceptical Labour colleagues in a speech to Parliament on Monday.She will suggest that while some of her plans may seem immoderate, the alternative could be a further rise in support for Reform UK.She is expected to say: '\"If you don't like this, you won't like what follows me.\"The home secretary believes Denmark is an example to emulate because its asylum policy - summed up as \"less in more out\" - has been achieved while remaining inside the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  But both she and her opposite number in Denmark - Rasmus Stoklund - want to see reforms and to rein in \"activist judges\" who might give too much emphasis to the ECHR's provisions on \"rights to a family life\" when deciding on deportation cases. She is expected to address this in her statement on Monday.Both Reform UK and the Conservatives argue that it would be more effective to leave the ECHR entirely.And rather than giving refugees temporary status, Reform UK say they would detain and deport cross-channel arrivals.The Conservatives argue that the only way to stop small boats is to bring back their scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, which was scrapped by Labour.The home secretary is likely to acknowledge on Monday that the UK's borders are \"out of control\".Simply adopting new policies is unlikely in itself to restore the trust of voters tempted by Nigel Farage.But if Mahmood's policies actually reduce numbers, she will hope her party will be granted permission to be heard not just on migration but on other policies too.",

    "body": "3 days agoJasmine SandharBBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesIt will be the first time the US singer will lead a major studio movieSabrina Carpenter looks set to swap her signature Espresso for tea - with the Mad Hatter. The US pop star is going back to her acting roots with plans to star in and produce a musical movie inspired by Alice in Wonderland, BBC Newsbeat understands. The unnamed project is being made for Universal Pictures and will be written and directed by US filmmaker Lorene Scafaria.It's not clear who Carpenter will play in the adaptation or when it will go into production.A 'Busy Woman'If it goes ahead, it will be Carpenter's first time leading a major studio film.The 26-year-old singer approached Universal last year with ideas for it, according to US media outlets. As the wonderland became more of a reality, Scafaria reportedly decided to join the madness.Writer and director Scafaria is best known for her work on Hustlers, a 2019 film fronted by Jennifer Lopez about a crew of strippers in New York City. Carpenter has recently been nominated for six Grammy Awards, including the coveted album of the year prize for her seventh album, Man's Best Friend. She is currently on the last leg of her Short n' Sweet Tour, which included two headline shows at London's BST Festival this summer. The upcoming film will not be the first time she's gone down the rabbit hole of acting. Getty ImagesCarpenter began her acting career on Disney Channel, playing Maya Hart in the TV series Girl Meets WorldCarpenter started out as a child actor on Disney Channel playing a recurring role as Maya Hart on the comedy series Girl Meets World.Since then, she's appeared in Netflix films Work It and Tall Girl, as well as 20th Century Fox's The Hate U Give.More recently, she's been announced as a \"guest star\" in a one-off Muppet Show special for Disney+, which will premiere in 2026.Previous Alice in Wonderland versions include the 1951 animated movie by Disney and Tim Burton's 2010 take with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. The story comes from Victorian author Lewis Carroll, who first published Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a children's novel in 1865.It tells the tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands in a fantasy world of talking animals and creatures.

    "body": "18 hours agoLana LamSydneyAnder LouisAnder Louis has written a 'bogan' version of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War & Peace\"Just then, Prince Andrei rocked up to Anna's joint. He was the pregnant sheila's hubby. Like his missus, he was pretty good looking himself.\"Those lines are straight from a new translation of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War & Peace, set in the world of Russian high society in the early 19th century.Except this is a \"bogan\" version translated by Ander Louis, the pen name of a Melbourne IT worker who moonlights as a writer.He's poured a metaphorical can of Australian beer over the novel by converting Tolstoy's prose into a lingo that wouldn't sound out of place in the popular Aussie sitcom Kath & Kim.\"It's how you'd tell it down the pub,\" Louis, whose real name is Andrew Tesoriero, told the BBC.The 39-year-old started the project in 2018 as a joke, turning Russian princesses into \"sheilas\" and princes into \"drongos\", but is now on the cusp of signing a book deal.\"The number one reason I started doing it was to make me laugh, and I thought if it's making me laugh, maybe other people will too so let's put it out into the world.\"Bogan, a term which first emerged in Australia in the 1980s, initially meant an \"unsophisticated and uncultured person\" with negative connotations, but not for Louis.Getty ImagesLouis's version of Tolstoy's Russian classic describes nobles as 'sheilas' and 'drongos'\"I've never really thought of it as an insult, more a term of endearment,\" he says.And his version of the Russian literary masterpiece - which starts with the phrase \"bloody hell\" - is about being flippant and irreverent.\"It's just a good exclamation of surprise,\" Louis jokes.Elsewhere, a noble is a fair dinkum, while the death of an important character is announced by \"he's cactus\".\"It changes the tone quite significantly,\" Louis laughs.Accidental Tolstoy expertFor years, Louis avoided picking up War & Peace, set during the Napoleonic wars of the early 1800s, given its heft.The novel is divided into 15 books as well as an epilogue, which itself is split into two parts. With more than 1,200 pages to plough through, it's often regarded as the Everest of literature with prose as insurmountable as the famed peak.But in 2016, Louis joined an online community where participants pledge to finish the book in a year by reading at least one chapter – there are 361 – every day.He loved it so much, he did it twice.\"I became a bit of an accidental expert,\" he tells the BBC from Lilydale, on the outskirts of Melbourne.During this time, the part-time indie author was writing a novel with dark psychological themes so to lighten the mood, he started making War & Peace irreverent and funny.And for more than six years, Louis' project remained a little-known hobby he did in his spare time, self-publishing the first two translated books of War & Peace and selling a handful of copies.That all changed earlier this year when a New York-based tech writer stumbled across the bogan version, posting excerpts from Louis' book in which he describes Napoleon as an \"alright bloke\", the high-ranking Prince Vasili as \"a pretty big deal\" and Princess Bolkónskaya as \"smoking hot\".\"Out of nowhere, it just went berserk. Overnight, I sold 50 copies,\" Louis says.The father-of-two thinks the US interest in his bogan translation might be due to a \"Bluey effect\" given the popular Australian children's cartoon has been the most streamed show in the US for almost two years.\"Aussie-isms are in vogue over there at the moment\".How bogan became its own languageAt first glance Tolstoy's book, filled with the lives of rich, powerful Russians, seems worlds apart from modern-day Australia.But Louis argues bogan is the ultimate equaliser as the informal slang works across the social spectrum, whether it's in Australia or the world of Russian aristocrats.\"There's a whole lot of different types of bogan,\" Louis says.Mark Gwynn, a senior researcher at the Australian National University, who helps compile the Australian National Dictionary, agrees. \"Bogans can be wealthy, poor, or in the middle so it's more about the way they behave, dress, socialise and talk,\" he says.He says in more recent times, the term has also been used affectionately of someone considered a bogan or even in reference to oneself such as the term \"inner bogan\".And speaking \"bogan\" refers to casual speech with lots of local sayings, he says.\"Most Australians would know if you said 'speaks bogan' or 'bogan Australian' that the language would be highly informal with many slang and colloquial words and phrases, including uniquely Australian ones.\"But there's no direct translation for the term in proper English – it's uniquely Australian.\"Bogans can live in [both] rural and urban areas so they don't equate to hillbillies, bumpkins, yokels, rustics,\" Gwynn says.Nor are bogans the same as rednecks, as they can hold varied political views, while the British term \"chav\" – also typically used in a derogatory way to describe people from a poor background - doesn't apply either.Those shape-shifting bogan qualities along with Louis' varied resume - kitchen hand, energy analyst, Uber driver, punk rocker, Tokyo resident – makes him \"strangely qualified\" to create a bogan translation.Paul Dano as Pierre Bezukhov, Lily James as Natasha Rostov and James Norton as Prince Andrei in the BBC adaptation of War & Peace.\"When I'm drawing on voices, it's just quite genuinely from things I've seen and done… through all those different walks of life.\"Characters in his bogan version say \"g'day\", friends are \"mates\" and those with questionable ethics are deemed \"shonky\".Beautiful ladies are \"chicky babes\", with one so beguiling she's \"hot as a tin roof in Alice\" – a nod to the extreme heat of Alice Springs' desert landscape.One prince is an \"absolute true-blue legend\" whose vibrant eyes \"blazed like a bushfire\" while another is a \"bit of a yobbo\" who thinks others are \"carrying on like a pack of galahs\".While his version is peppered with plenty of profanity – which the BBC can't publish – part of the appeal is to make the book more accessible.\"The best feedback I've found is people saying how much easier it is to understand what's going on,\" he says.Louis likens himself to Pierre, the main protagonist in War & Peace, who represents the \"everyman\" as the illegitimate son of a rich aristocrat who inherits a huge fortune, catapulting him into Russian high society.He says he feels like he's the \"bumbling buffoon\" in the \"walled garden that is traditional publishing\" and that he's committed a kind of \"literary heist\".\"I've leaned over the fence… and just pinched the crown jewel - their most revered book - and taken it down the pub.\"And what would Tolstoy – who, though born a noble, later in life renounced his privileged upbringing and wealth – think of the bogan version?\"I actually think he would get a kick out it,\" Louis says.

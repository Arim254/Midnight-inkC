    "body": "Scotland's mad for Oasis, Newcastle loves Sam Fender: Music tastes where you live revealed19 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBCOasis are big in Manchester, but even bigger in Scotland. Newcastle is wild for homegrown guitar hero Sam Fender, and Liverpool can't get enough of female pop stars.These are some of the revelations from a breakdown of listening habits on Spotify and YouTube in 2025 in more than a dozen of the UK's biggest cities.Taylor Swift and Drake were the clear winners on Spotify - except in Newcastle, where Fender broke their stranglehold. He was one of several artists to prove particularly popular in their hometown, while there was a clear north-south divide in Oasis's popularity as they reformed.Eminem dominated YouTube in 2025, ahead of the KPop Demon Hunters singers and Ed Sheeran - with Taylor, Drake and other pop giants also among the most played artists.But a number of surprises emerged from the lists, too. Here are the rankings for each of the featured cities:BelfastGetty ImagesLady Gaga's songs were played a million times in Belfast in 2025There's a lot of love for Lady Gaga in Northern Ireland's capital - she was the second most popular artist of 2025 on YouTube in Belfast, higher than in any other UK city.She was pipped to number one by the stars of KPop Demon Hunters, with Eminem in third. The rapper missed YouTube's top spot in just two of the 14 featured cities (the other being Nottingham).Belfast's most played artists on YouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaEminemTaylor SwiftBruno MarsEd SheeranRihannaSabrina CarpenterCalvin HarrisEJAESurprise package: Belfast trance producer Billy Gillies was just outside the top 10, in 12th, and had two tracks in the city's top 20 songs of the year on YouTube - DNA (Loving You) at 10 and Right Here All Along at 17.NB Spotify did not provide data for Belfast.BirminghamWireImage/Getty imagesThe Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Chris Brown are all big in BirminghamDrake is the most-played artist on Spotify in Birmingham, and it is the only place outside London to also have his rival Kendrick Lamar in its top five.Brummie fans are the most devoted to US R&B singer Chris Brown - it's the only place to put him in its top 10 on Spotify (at nine), and also gives him his highest YouTube placing (at eight).D-Block Europe are big in Birmingham, too - the London-based hip-hop duo are second only to Eminem on the list of the year's most-played artists on YouTube, and it's also the only city to have them in its Spotify top 20 (at 15).Birmingham's most played artists on Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestRihannaBillie EilishChris BrownSZABirmingham's most played artists on YouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeAlka YagnikEd SheeranDrakeKaran AujlaArijit SinghChris BrownKPop Demon Hunters castRihannaSurprise packages: A string of Indian singers are bigger than many Western superstars on YouTube in Birmingham - Alka Yagnik was the third most popular act of 2025 overall with more than 7.5 million views in the city (above Ed Sheeran and Drake).Shake It To The Max by Ghanaian singer Moliy and Jamaican producer Silent Addy was also massive - it was the third most viewed track of the year on YouTube, higher than in any of the other featured locations.BristolGetty Images for The Recording AcademyOlivia Dean's highest rating outside London The tastes of fans on Spotify and YouTube differ a lot, judging by their charts. As in many cities, Taylor Swift was most popular on Spotify in Bristol, while Eminem topped the YouTube list.Bristol's listeners are, according to these rankings, the biggest fans of Olivia Dean outside her home city London, placing her ninth on the Spotify chart.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOlivia DeanAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaRihannaThe WeekndBillie EilishEJAESurprise package: It's the only place with any of BTS star Jung Kook's songs in the top 20 Spotify tracks, and he has two (3D at number 13 and Seven at number 18).CardiffGetty Images/Netflix/Getty Images for iHeartRadioEminem, KPop Demon Hunters and Ed Sheeran topped Cardiff's YouTube chartAs well as being number one on YouTube, Eminem was more popular on Spotify in the Welsh capital than in any other city, in ninth.Ed Sheeran is third on YouTube, behind KPop Demon Hunters, and also has his highest Spotify ranking, in 11th in Cardiff.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaBillie EilishEminemTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaD-Block EuropeThe WeekndChris BrownSurprise package: It was big everywhere, but Benson Boone's Beautiful Things had its joint highest ranking on YouTube in Cardiff (in third), and the city was the only place to put the song in its Spotify top 10 tracks (at 10) in 2025.EdinburghGetty ImagesOasis, Gracie Abrams and Chappell Roan were all popular in Scotland's capitalAs Oasis reunion fever gripped the nation last year, Scotland went particularly mad fer it. The band were in the top five most-played acts on both Spotify and YouTube in both Edinburgh and Glasgow - higher than anywhere else, including their home city of Manchester.Edinburgh also likes its pop - it's the only city with Chappell Roan in its top 10 on Spotify, while superstar DJ David Guetta was higher on YouTube than anywhere else. Edinburgh and Glasgow are also the only cities to put Gracie Abrams in their Spotify top 20s.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarChappell RoanThe WeekndTate McRaeYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranOasisKPop Demon Hunters castDavid GuettaRihannaBruno MarsLinkin ParkSurprise package: Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding 2015 cover of Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence was just outside the top 10 most played songs on YouTube (in 11th).GlasgowGetty Images for ABA/Getty Images for SpotifyUS star Zach Bryan and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris proved popular in GlasgowTaylor Swift reigns on Spotify (again), while Glasgow gives Tate McRae her highest placing.It's also the only city where Scotland's superstar DJ Calvin Harris makes it into both the YouTube (11th) and Spotify (18th) lists.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestKendrick LamarZach BryanTate McRaeThe WeekndRihannaYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftKPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaOasisEd SheeranBruno MarsRihannaSabrina CarpenterDavid GuettaSurprise package: Scotland, it seems, is keen on country music - Glasgow is the only place with US superstar Zach Bryan in its Spotify top 10. Edinburgh is the only other UK city with him in its top 20, in 14th place.LeedsGetty Images for Live Nation/RedfernsBillie Eilish and D-Block Europe are among the most popular stars in Leeds, as elsewhereIn the absence of their own home town heroes (sorry Kaiser Chiefs), Leeds listeners are big on other northern acts - it's the only place outside Newcastle to have Sam Fender and the only place outside Sheffield to have the Arctic Monkeys in the Spotify top 10 (Oasis are also not far behind in 14th).Over on YouTube, D-Block Europe are big in Leeds - second to Eminem overall - their joint highest placing, alongside Birmingham.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestRihannaKendrick LamarArctic MonkeysSam FenderYouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeEd SheeranKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsDrakeThe WeekndSurprise packages: Chrystal's infectious The Days was a big hit, but nowhere bigger than in Leeds, where it was the third most played song of the year on YouTube with a million plays - closely followed by her collaboration with MK, Dior, at number four.LiverpoolWireImage via Getty ImagesSkye Newman performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool in MayLiverpool fans can't get enough of female pop stars, judging by these lists. Taylor Swift is top on Spotify, while Billie Eilish gets her joint highest position in fourth, and Ariana Grande gets her highest at number nine.Just outside the top 10, it's also Lady Gaga's joint highest Spotify placing (at 11) and Lana Del Rey's best position of any UK city (at 12).Meanwhile, rising British star Skye Newman was particularly popular on YouTube in Liverpool. She had two songs in the platform's top tracks of 2025 - Family Matters at eight and Hairdresser at 20.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaAriana GrandeTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranMazza L20RihannaCalvin HarrisThe WeekndSurprise package: Liverpool rapper Mazza L20 has crashed the YouTube top 10 in his home city above some global superstars. Real name Malcolm Graham, he was jailed in 2016 for possessing a handgun, before gaining attention online with viral hits like Murdaside.LondonWireImage/Parkwood via Getty ImagesJustin Bieber and Beyoncé only rated on the captial's listTaylor Swift was the most-played artist on Spotify in the UK overall, but Drake beat her to number one in the capital, while Olivia Dean and SZA were also more popular than the national average.Meanwhile, London was the only city to put Justin Bieber and Beyoncé in the Spotify top 20 (19th and 20th respectively).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestBillie EilishOlivia DeanSZAAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemArijit SinghEd SheeranDrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndD-Block EuropeBruno MarsLady GagaChris BrownSurprise package: Arijit Singh, one of India's biggest playback singers, was the second most popular musician of the year on YouTube in London. Singh, who released a duet with Ed Sheeran last year, racked up more than 40 million views in the capital, where he headlined a show at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in September.ManchesterHans Lucas via AFPThe Oasis reunion tour included five sold-out shows in Heaton Park, ManchesterBehind the big North American beasts (led by Drake and Taylor Swift, again), Manchester's (arguably) favourite musical sons Oasis were on repeat in their home city, being the fifth most played act overall on Spotify.That's their highest placing except for the Scottish cities - but the Gallagher brothers were absent from the lists in the south of England (London, Bristol and Southampton).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarRihannaEminemYouTube:EminemEd SheeranD-Block EuropeDrakeTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsThe WeekndArijit SinghSurprise package: The surprise is that Manchester seemingly went less KPop Demon Hunters crazy than elsewhere - the cast are absent from the top 10 YouTube artists (at 12th), and smash hit Golden only makes eighth, its lowest placing in any of the YouTube top songs charts.NewcastlePA MediaSam Fender has performed four stadium shows at the home of Newcastle United FC - two in 2023 and another two in 2025Tyneside's local hero Sam Fender isn't just big in the north-east, he's absolutely massive. The \"Geordie Springsteen\" played two huge hometown shows at St James' Park last summer and was the second most played artist on Spotify, behind the unmovable Taylor Swift. Beside Swift, he's the only person to have beaten Drake anywhere.What's more, Fender has four songs in Newcastle's top 20 Spotify tracks of the year - People Watching (number two), Seventeen Going Under (11), Arm's Length (15) and Hypersonic Missiles (16). None of his songs made the top 20 anywhere else.Spotify:Taylor SwiftSam FenderDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestBillie EilishRihannaKendrick LamarOlivia DeanYouTube:EminemEd SheeranLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsDavid GuettaLinkin ParkD-Block EuropeSurprise package: Scottish dance producer Blair Muir's track Rehab hasn't troubled the main UK charts, but was the 10th most played song of the year on YouTube in Newcastle.NottinghamGetty Images/NetflixBruno Mars and Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys was popular on YouTube, while  SZA made the Spotify listNottingham loves KPop Demon Hunters - the film's cast kept Eminem off the YouTube number one spot. The rap legend is a lowly third, behind Bruno Mars.Meanwhile on Spotify, fans in Nottingham were the only listeners outside London, Birmingham and Manchester to have played Drake more than Taylor Swift, and gave SZA her highest placing beyond London.Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaSZATate McRaeYouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsEminemEd SheeranLady GagaRihannaDrakeD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSurprise package: This is the only city to have preferred Soda Pop by Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys to Golden by their rivals Huntr/x, judging by their YouTube play counts. Soda Pop was second on Nottingham's list of most-played songs, with Golden fourth.SheffieldMyles Wright/ZUMA Press Wire via AlamyThe Arctic Monkeys last performed in Sheffield on June 9 and 10, 2023, with two headline homecoming gigs at Hillsborough ParkArctic Monkeys are another act to get a big hometown boost, coming fourth on the most-played list on Spotify, despite not having released an album or played live for a couple of years.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterArctic MonkeysThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOasisYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftRihannaThe WeekndDenon ReedSurprise package: Birmingham producer and DJ Denon Reed, who is \"leading the revival of bassline\", is in the top 10 most played acts on YouTube in Sheffield - the only city where he features.SouthamptonWireImage via Getty imagesSouthampton is the only city with Coldplay in its Spotify top 10, and also the only place with Bruno Mars in the service's top 20 (at 19).Billie Eilish gets her joint highest Spotify ranking in Southampton, along with Liverpool.

    "body": "26 minutes agoJack BurgessDEAA file photo of El Mencho from the US Drug Enforcement AdministrationMexico's most wanted man and the leader of the feared Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) drug cartel has been killed by the army in a security operation, the country's defence ministry has said.Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as \"El Mencho\", was killed during a military operation carried out at dawn on Sunday in the town of Tapalpa, in the central-western state of Jalisco. The defence ministry said several CJNG members were killed during the operation. El Mencho was seriously wounded during the military operation and died while being transferred by air afterwards to Mexico City, it said.CJNG has spread from its original power base in Jalisco to have an almost nationwide presence across Mexico. The defence ministry also said that several armoured vehicles and weapons - including rocket launchers - were seized during the operation.It added that three members of the military were wounded during the incident and taken to hospital in Mexico City for emergency treatment.Throughout Sunday, there were unconfirmed reports of cars being set alight and sightings of gunmen on the streets in Jalisco and elsewhere.The US State Department issued a shelter-in-place warning for US citizens in Jalisco State, Tamaulipas State, and areas of Michoacan State, Guerrero State, and Nuevo Leon State. The Mexican defence ministry said the US had supplied Mexico with information that assisted its operation.Former US ambassador to Mexico and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on social media that El Mencho's death was \"a great development for Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world\". The US had previously offered a $15m (£11.1m) reward for information leading to El Mencho's capture.",

He is also the patron saint of animals and the environment.The Feast of St Francis is celebrated annually on 4 October to mark the day of his death in 1226.The late Pope Francis, who died last year after leading the Roman Catholic Church for more than a decade, chose his name and modelled his papacy after the radical humility of Saint Francis.St Francis of Assisi's bones will be on display until 22 March.

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe US operates two dedicated hospital boats, including the USNS Mercy Greenland's prime minister has asked US President Donald Trump to talk to him instead of making \"random outbursts on social media\", after Trump said he was sending a US hospital boat to \"take care\" of people on the island.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was going to send a boat filled with medical supplies, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\".Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded \"it's going to be a no thanks from us,\" and said that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens.Trump has long coveted the vast arctic island - but conceded in January that he would not take it by force, after previously refusing to rule out doing so. Soon after, he announced a \"framework for a future deal\" around the US and Greenland, after Denmark and Nato allies made it clear that they would not give in to his calls to relinquish sovereignty.In his post on social media, Trump said that he and his Greenland envoy Jeff Landry were \"going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It's on the way!!!\"The post included what appeared to be an illustrated or AI image of the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships operated by the US navy. It is not clear when the ship would arrive or what prompted the decision.Responding to the post, Nielsen said that Trump's idea \"is noted. But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens.\"\"It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor,\" he wrote on Facebook.Nielsen added that Greenland remained open to cooperating with the US but underlined the importance of discussing issues directly.\"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media,\" he said.Trump's post came soon after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine close to Nuuk. It is not clear if Trump's post was related to the incident.A month on from Trump announcing a \"framework for a future deal\"  over Greenland, details are still unclear, though earlier this month US vice president JD Vance alleged that European countries were \"willing to make a lot of accommodations\".",

    "body": "46 minutes agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesAn armed man has been shot dead after entering the secure perimeter of US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the Secret Service has said.The man was carrying a shotgun and fuel can when he was stopped and shot by Secret Service agents and a Sheriff's deputy, authorities said.The incident happened around 01:30 ET (06:30 GMT) on Sunday morning, when the president was in Washington DC. The suspect has been named as Austin T Martin of Cameron, North Carolina, according to the BBC's US partner CBS.His family had reported him missing on Saturday, CBS reports.Officials are looking into whether he bought the gun along the driving route he took from North Carolina to Florida, according to CBS.Secret Service agents fired at him after they saw him \"unlawfully entering the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early this morning\", agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi posted on X.The suspect \"was observed by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can\", the agency said in a statement.The man was then shot after refusing orders, Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.\"The only words that we said to him was 'drop the items' which means the gas can and the shotgun,\" Bradshaw told a news conference. \"At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,\" he said. At that point, agents fired their weapons to \"neutralise the threat\", he said.FacebookAn image of the suspect was previously posted on social media by his relativesThe officers were wearing body cameras and no law enforcement officers were injured, he added.Bradshaw said that he does not know if the suspect's gun was loaded, and that will form part of an investigation, which the FBI will be assisting in.Security at Mar-a-Lago is extremely tight, with an outer cordon of local Palm Beach sheriffs and an inner one maintained by the Secret Service. Visitors are searched, and cars and bags are swept by dogs and metal detectors.Trump has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts.In July 2024, Trump was shot in the ear as he stood in front of crowds in Butler, Pennsylvania. One bystander was killed and two were injured in the shooting. The shooter, 20-year-old Matthew Crooks, was immediately shot and killed by security forces and his motive remains unknown.Months later, a US Secret Service agent spotted a rifle sticking out of bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The man, later identified as Ryan Routh, fled but was caught. The 59-year-old was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for attempting to assassinate the president.",

The devices were planted in waste bins, it added.President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed \"an individual suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack\" had been detained. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said she was a Ukrainian woman.The police later said the 33-year-old suspect had made and planted the explosives on the \"instruction\" of an agent of Russia's special services.The victim of the attack was named as Viktoria Shpylka. \"She was only 23 years old and had begun her service at the start of the full-scale invasion of the Kherson region,\" the police wrote on Telegram on Sunday morning.National Police of UkrainePolice officer Viktoria Shpylka was killed in the attackPolice said the first blast occurred after a police car arrived at the scene of the reported break-in at a shop in the city centre.\"Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off,\" it added.Eleven people were admitted to hospital, six of whom were law enforcement officers in serious conditions.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said police and the Security Service of Ukraine had detained the suspect, a resident of the north-western Rivne region.\"We are identifying other persons involved in committing this crime,\" he wrote on Telegram.Meanwhile, the regional prosecutor's office said it had started an investigation into the \"act of terrorism that led to grave consequences\".National Police of Ukraine/TelegramA number of officials were also injured after bombs detonated when they arrived to a reported break-in overnightElsewhere, Ukraine faced another night of overnight Russian strikes ahead of the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on Tuesday.Kyiv said its air defences had countered 50 Russian missiles and nearly 300 drones overnight. The attacks targeted the energy sector, residential buildings, and railways, Zelensky said.At least one person was killed in the Kyiv region, top local official Mykola Kalashnyk said, while a woman and a child were taken to hospital with injuries.The latest aerial attack comes two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin has become the biggest war in Europe since World War Two, with hundreds of thousands of military casualties -killed, wounded and missing - believed to be on each side.Western military experts estimate that Russian combat losses have been much higher than Ukraine's.Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it annexed in 2014.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson: \"We are not going to be taking away effective support for children\"The government will not be withdrawing \"effective support\" from children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) under its planned school reforms for England, the education secretary has said.Bridget Phillipson told the BBC the government would be \"spending more money\", not less, on supporting children with SEND as part of its efforts to overhaul the system.But the cabinet minister said children \"will be reviewed in terms of their needs\", following leaks which suggested pupils will be assessed as they move into secondary school.The full details of the government's proposed changes to SEND provision in England will be outlined in a White Paper, which will be published on Monday.The policy paper has been highly anticipated by parents who fear the reforms could mean the support their child receives could be limited in some way.The proposals in the paper come as the government faces significant pressures from the rising costs of a SEND system, widely considered to be in crisis.Leaks from the paper, reported by the BBC, suggest children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) - which are legal documents outlining their extra support entitlement - will be reassessed after primary school from 2029.The BBC understands this will sit alongside an extension of legal rights to include all children with SEND through school-led Individual Support Plans (ISP).Every child with identified special educational needs, including those who do not currently have an EHCP, will have an ISP drawn up by the school, which will have some kind of legal status.Phillipson told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that \"EHCPs will have an important role to play in the new system\".\"The assurance I can give to parents is that under the new system, more children will receive support,\" Phillipson said.\"But they'll receive it more quickly. They'll receive it when they need it and where they need it. Parents won't have to fight so hard to get support through an EHCP.\"She said the new ISPs would have a legal \"underpinning\", meaning \"there are clear routes and clear principles set out in statute that will guide all of this\".When pressed on whether any child who currently receives support would lose it under the proposals, Phillipson said: \"We are not going to be taking away effective support from children.\"She added: \"And what I'll be setting out tomorrow is a decade-long, very careful transition from the system that we have - which everyone recognises isn't working.\"But she acknowledged that children \"will be reviewed in terms of their needs assessed\".\"That should be happening at the moment,\" Phillipson said. \"We're meant to be having a system where every year an EHCP is reviewed. That doesn't always happen.\"In an interview on the same programme, shadow education secretary Laura Trott said the Conservatives \"do have some big concerns about what is being floated\".Trott said too many parents \"had to fight for the support and the idea that they're going to be reassessed will be genuinely frightening\".Shadow education secretary Laura Trott: \"We oppose any support being withdrawn\"For Hannah Luxford, whose teenage son has anxiety, it took 18 months to get him an EHCP.\"It's an unhelpful, adversarial, complex system that is designed to make you give up,\" Luxford told the BBC.Now, Luxford says her son is thriving at a funded virtual school. But she worries about his legal rights under the new reforms. \"I want to hear that for those of us already with EHCPs that we are protected,\" she said noting how her son's is getting the \"education he deserves\" at the school he currently attends.\"If that's taken away, it will take us back to where we were five years ago.\"There is a risk of a backlash against reforms among Labour MPs, whose backing will be required if these plans make it to Parliament.The government has decided to pay SEND costs currently covered by councils from 2028, a move that is forecast to create a £6bn pressure.In recent analysis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the government had three options for addressing this pressure: increase education funding, reforms to slow the growth of SEND spending, or cuts.Luke Sibieta, from the IFS, said the situation is \"worst of all worlds\" with rising numbers of EHCPs and increasing costs but no better quality for children.\"Unfortunately we still have a system that is characterised by conflict, by fight, but also by really patchy levels of quality.\"Under its proposed reforms, the government is also planning to halve the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England by the time children born in this Parliament finish secondary school.It will attempt to do this by reforming how schools target funding for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The latest GCSE results show the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to the Department for Education (DfE).It had previously dropped to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between, but it began widening in the post-pandemic years. In the 2022/2023, it reached the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94.",

    "body": "5 hours agoEd CampbellBBC News InvestigationsGetty ImagesGordon Brown has demanded a police investigation into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor used taxpayer-funded jets and RAF bases to meet the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, according to reports.The former prime minister wrote letters to six police forces suggesting that civil servants be questioned about Andrew's time as UK trade envoy, the the Sunday Telegraph says.Andrew was an envoy from 2001 to 2011, including almost three years when Brown was in No 10.The paper also reports that Brown has demanded a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links the former prince's government work to late financier Epstein.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, who died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.Brown told the BBC last week that he had \"submitted a five-page memorandum to the Metropolitan, Surrey, Sussex Thames Valley and other relevant UK police constabularies\".He said: \"This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women.\"When asked about these flights by the BBC in October 2025, the Ministry of Defence said \"it is standard practice for spare capacity at RAF airfields in the UK to be used for private or commercial aircraft, subject to fees which cover all costs\".It added that such use \"is not automatic and will only be approved when there is no adverse impact to military aircraft and where approval would not interfere with the security or smooth running of the airfield\". The MoD repeated this response when asked by the BBC again on Sunday.In an email message, Jon Swain asks if Andrew had secured permission for Epstein to use military bases. The question is forwarded to Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell - who in 2021 was convicted in the US for her role in luring underage girls for him.Epstein responds to say, \"just spoke to Larry… it's true\". The man named Larry was Epstein's chief pilot, who arranged many of his landings and logistics. Maxwell then responds using an expletive.The Sunday Telegraph says Brown is requesting that police examine whether Epstein was given access to RAF bases after his conviction for soliciting child prostitution in Florida in 2008.Andrew was arrested by Thames Valley Police on Thursday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and released under investigation 11 hours later.He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of files connected to the late financier's case - including claims he shared information with Epstein while trade envoy.Searches are continuing this weekend at his former Windsor mansion Royal Lodge, where he lived for many years.",

    "body": "Met officers working for Andrew told to guard Epstein's home, emails show7 hours agoOlivia Davies,Chi Chi IzunduandHelena Wilkinson,BBC News InvestigationsPA MediaMetropolitan Police officers were instructed to provide security for a dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein's New York home attended by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, according to emails released by the US Department of Justice.The Met says it has not identified any wrongdoing by its protection officers \"at this time\". On Friday, the force said it is \"identifying and contacting\" former and serving officers who may have relevant information. As a senior working member of the Royal Family at the time, the then Prince Andrew would have been accompanied by close protection officers as part of his security.  Andrew has always strenuously denied any wrongdoing.Emails released in the Epstein files appear to show arrangements for Andrew to stay with Epstein in December 2010.In the correspondence, Andrew's private secretary asks for the address where he would have been staying and \"confirmation on whether there is room for both his protection officers at the house\".Internal emails between Epstein's staff confirm that there was \"room for both Andrew's bodyguards… one on the 4th floor and one on the 5th floor\".The emails suggest that Andrew and his Metropolitan police close protection officers were given a temporary security code to \"get in and out\" of Epstein's New York property. In a message dated 1 December 2010, the evening before Epstein hosted a dinner party, an unidentified member of staff wrote to Epstein: \"The Duke's 2 protection officers along with the state security will all be here for tomorrow's dinner party. Rich has given them instruction on the door\".The BBC had previously asked the Met whether the officers stayed at Epstein's home, as suggested in the emails, and whether they were given a security code to come and go as they needed.The force said it does not comment on security arrangements for protected individuals. The Met said that protection officers were held to the same high standards of professional behaviour as all police officers, adding: \"They know their actions will be open to scrutiny.\"The government's Royal Visits Committee is responsible for reviewing plans for official travel by working members of the Royal Family.The committee consists of senior representatives from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), the Royal Household, No10, the Department for Business and Trade, and the Cabinet Office.The BBC approached the FCDO about whether the department knew of various trips made by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to Epstein's properties.A government spokesman said it reviewed the plans for official travel undertaken in 2008 and 2009 by the then Duke of York.It added: \"The RVC is not involved in private travel undertaken by working Members of the Royal Family, or any travel by non-working Members.\"Andrew was arrested on Thursday last week on suspicion of misconduct in public office and released under investigation 11 hours later. Searches at his former Windsor home, Royal Lodge, are continuing. ",

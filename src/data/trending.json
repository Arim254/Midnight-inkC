    "body": "48 minutes agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBBCSaunders (left) and Dame Joanna are better known to millions as Ab Fab's Edina and PatsyJennifer Saunders will play the sister of her Absolutely Fabulous co-star Dame Joanna Lumley in the Christmas special of sitcom Amandaland, the BBC has announced.Saunders will appear as Joan, the sister of Dame Joanna's character Felicity and auntie of the show's titular star Amanda, played by Lucy Punch.Her new character is humorously described as \"a ball of country-living, enthusiastic upper-class bluster - very, very different from Felicity\".Saunders said in a statement she was \"delighted to be joining the fabulous Amandaland gang for a Christmas special\".\"Playing Joanna's on-screen sister is guaranteed to be a laugh,\" she added. \"Who doesn't love a family reunion SoHa style!\"Amandaland follows middle class Amanda and her two children as they adapt to life in South Harlesden - which she refers to, pretentiously, as \"SoHa\" - having been forced to leave Chiswick following her divorce.Saunders will feature in the festive episode before a second series of the show airs in 2026, the BBC confirmed.Amandaland is a spin-off of Motherland, a comedy about motherhood starring Anna Maxwell Martin, which aired between 2016 and 2022.Lucy Punch stars in the BBC sitcom as Amanda, a middle class single mumStar of the show Punch said: \"I'm beyond excited to get started on Amandaland series two with our brilliantly talented, lovely cast.\"She added, in character: \"The Christmas special is going to be an absolute cracker - it's like totes fire, with all the festive feels, for reals. Slay bells!\"The first series of Amandaland, broadcast earlier this year, received rave reviews from critics.Fabulous additionSaunders and Dame Joanna both won Baftas for their portrayals of PR boss Edina and retired model Patsy, respectively, in the popular 1990s British sitcom Absolutely Fabulous - aka Ab Fab.Across a handful of series and a well received feature length movie in 2016, the heavy-drinking, chain-smoking pair attempted to relive their youth - in swinging 1960s London - over and over again, often with funny and cringe-worthy consequences.The show initially aired from 1992 to 2005, before a 20th anniversary special miniseries in 2012.They reunited last year, alongside fellow actresses Julia Sawalha and Jane Horrocks, for a one-off special on UK TV station Gold titled Absolutely Fabulous: Inside Out.",

    "body": "8 hours agoEmily Holt & Yasmin RufoBBC NewsBBCWe all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands. In an industry worth Â£5.8bn in the UK, there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.The truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.Trichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair. 1. Cold water doesn't make your hair shinier Getty ImagesEver shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair? Well luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair. \"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.She does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.2. No product can repair damaged hair Getty ImagesIf you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.Proudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.Walker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"She says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.Proudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"Other stories you may enjoy3. Your hair won't self-clean  Getty ImagesYou may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all. But Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\" Walker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too. Not washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".Proudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.  Laura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.4. Dry shampoo isn't a substitute for washingGetty ImagesFinding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower. Proudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes. The problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out. \"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says. \"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"Ultimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.

    "body": "20 minutes agoKaty AustinTransport correspondent EurostarAn artist's impression of the new double-decker \"Celestia\" high-speed train which Eurostar has orderedEurostar has revealed plans to run double-decker trains through the Channel Tunnel for the first time.The cross-Channel rail operator has confirmed it will order up to 50 trains from manufacturer Alstom, eventually increasing the size of its fleet by nearly a third.The expansion plans would include investing heavily in a crucial London depot, it said.But questions remain over whether the facility has enough space for both Eurostar and potential rival operators to use it.In the â¬2bn (Â£1.74bn) deal, confirmed on Wednesday, Eurostar has ordered 30 \"Celestia\" trains, with the option for 20 more. Eurostar expects to start using the first six trains in 2031.Each train would be 200m long. If two were run together, as happens currently, the resulting 400m service would have about 1,080 seats. These would be the first double-decker high-speed trains to run through the Channel Tunnel.The only other double-decker to ever appear on Britain's railways was an experiment that began in 1949.Eurostar's chief executive Gwendoline Cazenave said she was \"particularly proud to bring double-decker trains to the UK for the very first time\", adding they would bring \"exceptional comfort\".Eurostar carried 19.5 million passengers last year. Ms Cazenove said the company aimed to grow this number to 30 million.The firm said a fleet of new trains, some of which will replace older ones, will lead to a 30% increase in trains that service London.The double-decker train deal comes after Eurostar announced an expansion plan in June that includes new routes to Geneva and Frankfurt from London.Depot questionEurostar also said it would invest â¬80m developing the Temple Mills depot in London, which is the only depot in the UK able to accomodate the larger trains used in continental Europe.That depot, owned by the government's London St Pancras Highspeed organisation, is currently exclusively used by Eurostar.Eurostar is also the only company currently offering cross-Channel rail services between London and Paris, but others want to set up rival services.Those companies include Spanish start-up Evolyn, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.The Office of Rail and Road is reviewing proposals from these firms to use Temple Mills, as well as Eurostar's plans to increase services.The regulator is expected to make a decision on access to the depot within weeks.1949_11_04_NEWSREEL_double_decker_train.mov",

    "body": "Israel's military says the bodies of two hostages returned by Hamas on Tuesday have been identified as Arie Zalmanowicz and Master Sgt (res) Tamir Adar.Zalmanowicz , 85, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and killed in captivity on 17 November 2023, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.Adar, 38, a member of Nir Oz's community security squad, was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen during the 7 October attack. His body was then taken to Gaza.The return of their remains means that Hamas has transferred 15 out of 28 deceased Israeli hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal earlier this month. Their coffins were handed over to troops in the Palestinian territory by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which had earlier received them from Hamas. The IDF said the coffins - which were escorted by the military - had crossed into Israel and will be taken to be formally identified in Tel Aviv. Hamas has handed over a Palestinian body in a previous hostage transfers, which it said was accidental due to difficulties locating the bodies.All 20 living hostages were released shortly after the agreement was reached.Before the latest remains were identified, the IDF stressed that \"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages\".There has been outrage in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the deceased hostages. The Palestinian group says it is trying to do this but that it faces difficulty finding bodies under rubble of buildings bombed out by the IDF in Gaza.Under the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for every Israeli hostage's remains.The first phase of the agreement has also seen an increase of aid into Gaza, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in fighting - though deadly violence flared up over the weekend as both sides accused one another of breaching the terms of the deal.The IDF launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.More than 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBBCThe i Paper's lead headline says \"problems pile up for Reeves\" as it says benefits are set to rise by 4%. The paper reports the chancellor is now facing a \"triple whammy of high borrowing costs and pension and benefit rises\".The Times also focuses on Rachel Reeves who it says \"plans Â£2bn tax raid on middle class\". It reports her budget is expected to see a charge added on those who use limited liability partnerships, in a move the paper calls \"targeting the wealthy\". It also carries an image of ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy hand-in-hand with wife Carla Bruni as he heads to jail for the start of a five-year sentence.Brexit hit the economy \"even harder than feared, says Reeves\" is The Independent's top story. \"Leaving the EU 'needlessly' added costs for British businesses\" it quotes the chancellor as saying. Now, with \"one month to go until crunch Budget\", the UK is \"rebuilding ties with Brussels\". Bruni and Sarkozy are also featured having a farewell kiss.The governor of the Bank of England is hearing \"alarm bells\" writes the Financial Times as it reports Andrew Bailey drawing comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. The paper also carries the image of Sanae Takaichi after the \"historic vote\" that saw Japan elect its first female PM.\"Putin defies Trump as peace talks collapse\" is the lead story for the Daily Telegraph. No meeting for the leaders is on the horizon as the paper reports the Russian leader \"refuses to freeze front lines\". It also carries a big image of Carla Bruni with her hands together on the day her husband went to prison.Former PM Boris Johnson's admission to the Covid inquiry that \"our lockdowns failed kids\" headlines the Metro. The paper quotes him as saying children paid a \"huge, huge price\", while standing by his handling of the pandemic.The Daily Mail reports the grooming gang inquiry is \"in chaos\" after three abuse survivors resignations from the process. The paper calls one of the withdrawal of one of the candidates in the running to the lead the review as a \"farcical development\".\"Family law shift hailed as victory for children facing domestic abuse\" headlines The Guardian. I says family courts will no longer have to operate under the presumption that contact with both parents is in the best interests of a child after the \"landmark change\".The Daily Star dubs Johnson \"Bozo the killer clown\" after he gave evidence at the Covid inquiry. The former PM described himself as \"homicidal\" after schools minister Gavin Williamson's \"U-turn\" on A-levels.\"Off you trot, Mr Windsor\" says the Sun after \"fury over free rent\". Following its story of Katie Price's ex-husband Kieran Hayler being charged with three counts of rape and one of sexual assault, the paper claims Ms Price may speak at his trial.The Daily Express headlines with a plea from the sister of 16-year-old Sasha Marsden, who the Express says was stabbed \"100 times\". It pictures Katie Brett who has called for MPs to scrap a 28-day limit on appeals against \"lenient\" sentences.The Daily Mirror leads on its Pride of Britain campaign - after its award ceremony on Monday night. Its headline reads: \"Britain isn't broken, you're all amazing\". Sir Keir Starmer gave the award winners a personal tour of No 10, it writes.The Daily Telegraph leads with the breakdown of talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump over Ukraine. It says they were called off because Russia refused to accept America's terms for a ceasefire. The paper says Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Moscow would not settle for an agreement that \"froze\" the front lines in Ukraine.Reports that the chancellor is planning to use the Budget to impose a new charge on professionals employed by \"limited liability partnerships\" is the lead in The Times. The paper says such partnerships, which are common for lawyers and GPs, offer a significant tax benefit, as workers are treated as self-employed. It is, the Times says, a \"tax raid\" on the middle class which could yield Â£2bn for the Treasury.A shift in family law meaning that courts will no longer assume it is in the best interests of children to be in contact with their parents is the Guardian's lead. The paper says campaigners have hailed it as a \"victory\" for children facing domestic abuse and a move that will \"save so many children's lives\".A number of papers continue to explore Prince Andrew's living arrangements at Royal Lodge on the Windsor Estate. The Daily Mail quotes property experts as saying that he has a \"cast iron lease\", and a Whitehall source saying his lease appeared to be \"watertight\".But the Daily Telegraph says Prince Andrew's future at Royal Lodge is in doubt after the collapse of a business deal. The paper says its sources have confirmed that a commercial partnership the prince had with a Dutch company, which gave him proof of an independent income to pay for the upkeep of the estate, was now \"dead in the water\".The Sun's front page carries a photo of Prince Andrew on horseback with a headline reflecting the call from some MPs and trafficking survivors for him to leave the mansion and be formally stripped of his dukedom. \"Off you trot, Mr Windsor\", is the main headline.Related Internet Links",

A line of riot police prevented the protesters getting to the hotel.GardaÃ­ (Irish police) said protesters attempted to breach the police cordon by charging the line with horse-drawn sulkies (carts). Some carried garden forks and tools, while others damaged walls to get missiles.The police helicopter was targeted with lasers, and one female officer received medical attention for a foot injury.Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly said: \"The actions can only be described as thuggery. This was a mob intent on violence against gardaÃ­.\"I utterly condemn the attacks on gardaÃ­ who did their jobs professionally and with great courage to keep people safe.\"He said about 300 officers were on duty, with about half from the public order unit. A water cannon was deployed, as well as officers on horseback and a dog unit.Broadcaster RTÃ reported that several thousand people had gathered near the hotel.Riot police kept protesters away from the migrant hotelTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said there could be no justification for attacks on police.\"There can be no justification for the vile abuse against them, or the attempted assaults and attacks on members of the force that will shock all right-thinking people,\" he said.\"I pay tribute to the frontline gardaÃ­ (Irish police) who acted courageously and quickly to restore order.\"TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Harris said \"there is no excuse for this type of violence and thuggery against the men and women who serve to protect us and victims of crime every day\".PA MediaThe violence in Dublin has been condemned by various politicians Ireland's Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan said the violent scenes were \"unacceptable and will result in a forceful response from the gardaÃ­\". \"Those involved will be brought to justice,\" he said.\"It is clear to me from talking to colleagues that this violence does not reflect the people of Saggart. They are not the people participating in this criminality, but rather the people sitting at home in fear of it.\"Speaking during the final Irish presidential debate on Tuesday, Heather Humphreys described the violence as \"absolutely awful\".\"This is not what we are as a country,\" she said.The other presidential candidate, Catherine Connolly, said the scenes in Saggart were \"very upsetting\".She added that \"we need to be careful in this country\" about the divisions emerging.'Gardai were more prepared'RTÃ's crime correspondent, Paul Reynolds, said on Wednesday that gardai believe the violence \"was pre-planned, but they were also more prepared\" than they had been during trouble in the city in 2023.He added that officers had better and more effective equipment, and had stronger incapacitant spray, as well as water cannon \"which they didn't have to fire up\".\"The threat of it was enough to disperse the crowd last night and also the violence was more self-contained, because there was a particular area and location outside the hotel where these demonstrators, protesters and violent agitators had gathered,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster.\"So it was concentrated in one area, unlike the Dublin riots of two years ago, where sporadic violence broke out in so many different parts of the city and it took far longer to contain that.\"Last night the gardai clearly had a plan.\"He says detectives have already started gathering \"very good quality\" CCTV footage and also have bodycam footage which \"will be used to identify further violent demonstrators\".",

A couple in their 60s were killed when a drone hit their high-rise building in the city, and four people were killed in the wider Kyiv region. Among the victims were a woman, a six-month-old baby and a girl aged 12.The capital was under a ballistic missile warning for most of the night, and echoed to the sound of explosions. By morning rescue teams fought fires in residential buildings.Across Ukraine, Russian attacks once again targeted energy infrastructure and emergency power outages were imposed in several areas.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSima Kotechasenior UK correspondent andMyranda MowafiBBCMore than 300 people have contacted the BBC with allegations of racism, corruption and bullying of victims by police after a Panorama undercover investigation.The secret filming over seven months revealed evidence of racism, misogyny and officers revelling in the use of force at one of London's busiest police stations.One of the main themes among the hundreds of people getting in touch was misogyny when they reported domestic abuse and sexual violence - with some saying reporting their rape to police \"was like being raped again\".In response to the latest allegations, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said it was \"working hard to build a culture based on integrity and trust\" and improving vetting and misconduct procedures.We have spoken to many of the women who contacted us with stories of mistreatment, whose experiences span police forces across England - from rural counties to big cities. We have changed their names to protect their identities.A police officer allegedly told Joanna to \"grow a pair\" when she reported being punched in the face by her partner several months ago, she told us.Her partner had been drinking excessively when he returned home and angrily attacked her, she says. She found herself at the local police station in tears.\"I was devastated and the police made it 10 times worse. My face had a bruise from the punch and one of the officers looked at me as if I was exaggerating the whole thing,\" she said.\"He told me to grow a pair... followed by a chuckle. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It took so much to go there in the first place and then I wished I hadn't.\"Unmasked: Secret BBC filming exposes hidden culture of misogyny and racism inside Met PoliceWhy BBC sent undercover reporter into a busy London police stationMet officers face fast-track hearings after Panorama investigationOne woman was motivated to get in touch with the BBC by a scene Panorama filmed of a Metropolitan Police officer being dismissive of a pregnant woman's allegations of rape and domestic violence. The officer said of her account to a colleague: \"That's what she says.\"Ava was also pregnant when she fled her abusive partner, who she says repeatedly raped and hit her. She said the treatment and attitude of the officers she met that night meant she would never turn to the police in future.She said she was devastated that they did not believe her, telling her that \"nobody gets raped more than once\".\"It was like being raped all over again,\" she said. \"What they put me through was worse than what I was going through before\".Sgt Joe McIlvenny was filmed dismissing an alleged rape victim's testimonyAva says evidence that would have supported her case was \"wilfully ignored\" and she was told that without CCTV evidence of an attack, \"it is just your word against his\".She believes being a black woman made matters worse.\"The colour of my skin meant everything was stacked against me. The language they used and how dismissive and mocking they were, was both misogynist and racist,\" she said.\"They asked why I thought he was doing it to me - as if I was the problem, as if I'd brought it all on myself.\"Policing Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC that the government would not tolerate these \"sickening comments\" and urged people to report them.She said police chiefs had been given new powers to dismiss officers who commit gross misconduct. \"We will root out those unfit to serve the public,\" she said.Another woman, Claire, told us how she escaped her abusive former partner, who had coercively controlled her for 12 years, only to find that police did not want to get involved when he breached court orders to stay away from her.On one occasion, her former partner entered her home and locked her out, despite an injunction banning him from the property.She said it took the police more than seven hours to arrive and then \"they just stood laughing and chatting with him\". She and her three children ended up having to stay with a friend for months.\"I felt even more afraid and more isolated after speaking to the police. It's a boys' club - a network across police stations, police forces and county lines,\" Claire said.\"I would never call the police and I still worry he'll find me and show up.\"Getty ImagesCharing Cross station was the focus of the BBC's investigation, but the latest allegations come from across EnglandA training programme called Domestic Abuse Matters was developed by the College of Policing in 2016. It is used by 37 out of 44 police forces in England and Wales to improve the way they deal with victims of sexual and domestic violence.And part of the NPCC and College of Policing strategy on violence against women and girls says that one of its priorities is to challenge sexism and misogyny among officers.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Millichap, NPCC lead for violence against women and girls, told the BBC police chiefs were working with survivors of domestic abuse and sexual offences to continue to reform training, \"with a key focus on first responders' understanding of the dynamics of abuse and their empathy with victims\".She said \"officers must feel confident in calling out misogyny and sexism within policing\" but that improved vetting and misconduct procedures were \"having an impact in identifying and dismissing those who should not be in policing\".One of the women who contacted the BBC said that having watched the Panorama programme, she was shocked that nothing had changed in the decades since she was raped as a teenager.\"I have never had a night without a nightmare as a result, I've buried a lot of what the police officers asked me. They spoke down to me - like I was part of the problem,\" the woman, now in her 40s, said.\"Watching Panorama, I realised I must be one of thousands, I'm not the only one. They made me feel I was.\"",

    "body": "Mosquitoes have been found in Iceland for the first time after the country experienced record-breaking heat this spring.Insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason encountered the mosquitoes over several nights last week while using wine-soaked ropes to observe moths, local media reported.Mr Hjaltason found two female mosquitoes and one male which were later confirmed to be Culiseta annulata, one of few species that can successfully survive winter.Iceland was one of only two mosquito-free havens in the world prior to the discovery, partly due to its cold climate. The only other recorded mosquito-free zone is Antarctica.The mosquitoes were found in KjÃ³s, a glacial valley to the South West of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.Mr Hjaltason shared the news of his discovery on a Facebook page for local wildlife alongside pictures of the insects, describing \"a strange fly on a red wine ribbon\", according to Icelandic media.\"I could tell right away that this was something I had never seen before\" he said in the post, which was screenshotted and shared by Iceland's MorgunblaÃ°iÃ° news site, adding \"the last fortress seems to have fallen.\"Mr Hjaltason sent the insects to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History to be identified, where entomologist MatthÃ­as AlfreÃ°sson confirmed his suspicions.The species are common across parts of Europe and North Africa but it it isn't clear how they reached Iceland, AlfreÃ°sson told CNN. Iceland's cold climate and lack of stagnant water in which the insects can breed are key contributors to the country's former lack of mosquitoes, the World Population Review said.But this year, the country broke multiple records for its high temperatures. Typically, Iceland rarely experiences highs of more than 20C (68F) in May, and when it does those heatwaves will last for no more than two to three days, its Met Office notes. That threshold was exceeded for 10 consecutive days this year in different parts of the country, though.Iceland also saw its hottest ever day in May, with temperatures reaching 26.6C (79.8F) at EglisstaÃ°ir Airport.A June study published by the Global Heat Health Information Network noted that such shifts could have \"significant\" impacts on delicate ecosystems, which have adapted to the cold climate and are sensitive to temperature shifts.Last year was the world's hottest on record, and the UN's climate body has established that human influence has \"unequivocally\" warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land.Further monitoring will be required in spring to see if the mosquito species has \"truly become established in Iceland\", AlfreÃ°sson added.Hjaltason, meanwhile, has speculated on the origin of the specimens he observed.\"One always suspects Grundartangi - it's only about six kilometers from me, and things often arrive with ships and containers, so it's possible something came in that way,\" he told MorgunblaÃ°iÃ°.\"But if three of them came straight into my garden, there were probably more.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoe TidyCyber correspondent, BBC World ServiceThe cyber attack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will cost an estimated Â£1.9bn and be the most economically damaging cyber event in UK history, according to researchers.Experts at the Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC) have analysed the continuing fallout from the hack, which halted the car giant's production on 1 September for five weeks and caused widespread delays across JLR's supply chain.According to the CMC, 5,000 businesses have been affected in total and a full recovery will not be reached until January 2026.JLR declined to comment on the research but said it is bringing portions of manufacturing back online in a phased approach.The CMC is an independent, non-profit organisation that analyses and categorises cyber events, which impact the UK financially. It has classified the JLR incident as a Category 3 event, which is significant. Category 5 is the most severe.Ciaran Martin, chair of the CMC's technical committee said: \"With a cost of nearly Â£2bn, this incident looks to have been by some distance, the single most financially damaging cyber event ever to hit the UK.\"That should make us all pause and think. Every organisation needs to identify the networks that matter to them, and how to protect them better, and then plan for how they'd cope if the network gets disrupted.\"This is the second report published by the CMC, which uses publicly available information, surveys and interviews with industry experts and victims to make its assessments.Although the National Cyber Security Centre also categorises cyber attacks depending on how severe they are, it does not publish its findings. The hack began in late August causing an IT shutdown and a halt in global manufacturing operations, including its major UK plants at Solihull, Halewood, and Wolverhampton.Dealer systems were intermittently unavailable, and suppliers faced cancelled or delayed orders, with uncertainty about future supply.The CMC estimated the damage to be in the range of Â£1.6bn and Â£2.1bn but predicted the most likely cost will be Â£1.9bn.More than half of the cost will be shouldered by JLR itself including loss of earnings and the cost of recovery.The rest is estimated to be incurred by the 5,000 firms in JLR's supply chain, as well as the local economy including hospitality and other services.But CMC researchers admit their estimates are based on assumptions about the hack as JLR has not said publicly what type of cyber attack it's dealing with.A data theft and extortion attack is far easier to recover from, for example, than a ransomware attack which scrambles a victim's computer network.A wiper attack that infects computer networks and destroys data with no hope of reversal is even more serious.Shortly after the hack was revealed on JLR, a group of hackers thought to be young, English-speaking and linked to previous high profile hacks claimed to be behind it. But this has not been confirmed.The CMC also says it has not factored in any potential ransom payment that JLR might have paid to hackers which could be in the tens of millions.Previously the CMC categorised the wave of retail hacks against M&S, the Co-op and Harrods in the spring as a Category 2 event.It estimated those cyber attacks would cost between Â£270m and Â£440m, which was lower than the Â£506m cited by M&S and the Co-op.",

    "body": "Storm Benjamin has been named by MÃ©tÃ©o France and will bring wet and windy weather to the United Kingdom on Thursday.However, the most severe impacts will be felt across France, Belgium and the Netherlands.In the UK heavy rain could lead to localised flooding and strong winds have the potential to bring travel disruption and minor damage.The Met Office has issued yellow severe weather warnings for both the wind and rain.Heavy rain will spread north-east across England and east Wales into Thursday.The Met Office yellow warning for rain covers much of southern and eastern England from midnight on Wednesday night into Thursday, and through until 21:00 BST.Rainfall totals by early Thursday morning could be widely 20-30mm (around 1in), and for some places 30-50mm (up to 2in). There is a small chance a few places could exceed this, most likely over Devon and Cornwall and more generally in eastern England.Localised flooding and some transport disruption is possible.The wind will also strengthen with an additional yellow warning from the Met Office covering west Wales and south-west England from 04:00 until 18:00 BST.A separate wind warning has also been issued for eastern England from 09:00 Thursday until 23:59 BST.Very strong north-westerly winds gusting to 45-55mph (70-90km/h) in both areas are possible, while locally 65mph (105km/h) on the east coast is also possible.While there is still some uncertainty on the intensity of this weather system, the Met Office warns that there is potential for gusts up to 75mph (120km/h) for a small period of time later on Thursday morning and into the afternoon. These wind speeds have the potential to topple trees or their branches, cause travel disruption and even bring power cuts.For many in the UK Storm Benjamin will probably end up bringing nothing more than a typical autumnal wet and windy day.Impacts would not have been severe enough for the Met Office to name this weather system.However, large parts of northern and western France will experience strong winds with gusts widely up to 50-65mph (80-105km/h) and 80mph (130km/h) on some coastal areas.Because this is likely to bring impacts with some damage and travel disruption, MÃ©tÃ©o France - the equivalent of the Met Office in France - took the decision to name this Storm Benjamin.Orange warnings have been issued for seven areas along the Atlantic coast and English Channel.Strong winds will also bring the possibility of some damage and disruption to Belgium and the Netherlands later on Thursday with gusts of wind up to 80mph (129km/h), especially near the coast.Once a meteorological agency takes the decision to name a storm, there is agreement that all nations use the same name to allow consistency and clearer communication of the impacts.So, while impacts in the UK will be relatively minor with yellow warnings, the wet and windy weather is still associated with Storm Benjamin.Benjamin will not replace Bram in the list of UK's named storms. So we can still expect the next weather event deemed serious enough to be named by either the Met office, Met Eirean in Ireland or KNMI in the Netherlands to be Bram. ",

It was a move that infuriated America's Arab allies but gave Trump leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into making a deal.Trump benefited from a long record of siding with Israel dating back to his first term in office, including his decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, to change America's position on the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, more recently, his support for Israel's military campaign against Iran.The US president, in fact, is more popular among Israelis than Netanyahu â a position that gave him unique influence over the Israeli leader.Add in Trump's political and economic ties to key Arab players in the region, and he had a wealth of diplomatic muscle to force an agreement.In the Ukraine war, by contrast, Trump has much less leverage. Over the past nine months, he has swung between attempts to strong-arm Putin and then Zelensky, all with little seeming effect.Trump has threatened to impose new sanctions on Russian energy exports and to provide Ukraine with new long-range weapons. But he has also recognised that doing so could disrupt the global economy and further escalate the war.Meanwhile, the president has publicly berated Zelensky, temporarily cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine and suspending arms shipments to the country - only to then back off in the face of concerned European allies who warn a Ukrainian collapse could destabilise the entire region.Trump loves to tout his ability to sit down and hammer out deals, but his face-to-face meetings with both Putin and Zelensky haven't seemed to move the war any closer to a resolution.Getty ImagesTrump and Putin's meeting in August yielded no concrete resultsPutin may actually be using Trump's desire for a deal â and belief in in-person deal-making - as a means of influencing him. In July, Putin agreed to a summit in Alaska just as it appeared likely that Trump would sign off on congressional sanctions package backed by Senate Republicans. That legislation was subsequently put on hold.Last week, as reports spread that the White House was seriously contemplating shipping Tomahawk cruise missiles and Patriot anti-air batteries to Kyiv, the Russian leader called Trump who then touted the possible summit in Budapest.The next day, Trump hosted Zelensky at the White House, but left empty-handed after a reportedly tense meeting.Trump insisted that he was not being played by Putin.\"You know, I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,\" he said.But the Ukrainian leader later made note of the sequence of events. \"As soon as the issue of long-range mobility became a little further away for us â for Ukraine â Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,\" he said.So, in a matter of days, Trump has bounced from entertaining the prospect of sending missiles to Ukraine to planning a Budapest summit with Putin and privately pressuring Zelensky to cede all of Donbas â including territory Russia has been unable to conquer.He has finally settled on calling for a ceasefire along current battle lines â something Russia has refused to accept.On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised that he could end the Ukraine war in a matter of hours. He has since abandoned that pledge, saying that ending the war is proving harder than he expected.It has been a rare acknowledgement of the limits of his power â and the difficulty of finding a framework for peace when neither side wants, or can afford to, give up the fight.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSean FarringtonBusiness presenter andMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe head of global theme park giant Merlin Entertainments says its \"biggest competition\" is people choosing to stay at home on their phones and other devices. Fiona Eastwood says a day out at one of its UK attractions - which include Legoland, Thorpe Park and Alton Towers - was the \"perfect antidote\" for spiralling screen time. In a wide-ranging BBC Big Boss Interview, the chief executive reflected on challenges in the forthcoming Budget, big brand partnerships, and how its customers were responding to cost-of-living pressures.Eastwood also highlighted the importance of seasonal attractions to its customers - with Halloween now rivalling its summer season in driving profits at some attractions. Having been in the job since February, Eastwood has taken over at a time when her industry is facing challenges from a dip in consumer confidence. Her company's latest half-year update flagged concerns over a \"softening of demand\" in the UK theme park sector and fewer international visitors. Last year the company's overall revenue was down slightly to just over Â£2bn, with an operating loss of Â£132m. Despite the challenging environment, Merlin drew just shy of 63 million people to its attractions in 2024. Escapism was something people were willing to spend on, Eastood says.\"The moments to be together are increasingly precious, and what we provide is quite distinct,\" she says. \"It's all about families coming together to play.\"Getty ImagesFiona Eastwood said she was not a big fan of riding on Alton Towers' Nemesis roller coaster - and that the Wicker Man attraction was more here speed Talking about its UK attractions, which include Madame Tussauds, Sea Life and the London Eye, Eastwood says seasonal windows are key.Its major theme parks have hosted Halloween events, like Scarefest at Alton Towers and Fright Nights at Thorpe Park, since 2002. \"We're a very seasonally led business,\" says Eastwood. \"So you have spring break, Easter, summer and Halloween. \"Halloween, that we're in now, we're seeing some really strong performance. That's in view of the amazing product we have. You take Thorpe Park, increasingly Halloween is almost half of its annual profits.\"Along with seasonal offerings, big brand partnerships are also a key part of Merlin Entertainments' strategy - creating rides themed around children's tv hits to tempt families away from their screens and into the parks.Next year it will open its first Bluey ride at Alton Towers as part of CBeebies land, as well as PAW Patrol land opening at Chessington World of Adventures. One of next year's biggest launches is a collaboration with video game Minecraft - an enduring mega hit since it was launched in 2009, spawning one of the highest grossing films of 2025.With Eastwood citing screen time as Merlin's toughest competition, it hopes an Â£85m investment in immersive experiences will attract Minecraft fans with themed rides, restaurants and accommodation in the UK and US during 2026 and 2027.\"What I'm really excited about in terms of Minecraft is bringing [the game] to life in a physical way that will mean the massive fans of that game can then be in the game with their friends, their parents,\" says Eastwood. Call for a VAT cut Eastwood is on the board of Hospitality UK, an industry trade body which has been calling for VAT on hospitality to be cut from 20% to 12.5%.\"What we really want is a growth-led Budget,\" says Eastwood. She adds that cutting VAT would put the UK on a \"level-playing field\" with its European neighbours - where hospitality businesses often face a rate of about 10%. Making the case for this, Eastwood pointed to a period during Covid when VAT was cut to 12.5%. \"We saw a bump, and we saw demand, and we saw people wanting to spend,\" she says.In a statement, the Treasury said the government was supporting all UK businesses and the upcoming Budget would aim to encourage growth and investment.\"We are a pro-business government that has capped corporation tax at 25%, the lowest rate in the G7, we're reforming business rates, have secured trade deals with the US, EU and India, and have seen interest rates cut five times since the election, benefiting businesses in every part of Britain.\"While Eastwood has been CEO for less than a year, her time with Merlin stretches back a decade, with her joining shortly after Alton Towers Smiler rollercoaster crash in 2015.Coming into the chief executive role, she says her focus was trying to take an \"outside view\" of the company - aware that she could have bias and blind spots. She adds one of the best parts of her role is getting out to visit the sites. \"Nothing beats going to the theme park, that is my job,\" she says. \"Spending time with the team, seeing kids having an amazing experience at our attractions.\" However, asked about getting to the front of the queue for Nemesis - the Alton Towers ride that is one of the best known in the country - Eastwood did not have any concrete advice, despite joining front-line workers on the ride last year. \"I'm not a big fan of Nemesis,\" she says. \"My favourite's actually Wicker Man, I love Wicker Man.\" ",

    "body": "7 hours agoJonah FisherEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesUnder the new proposals water companies could face automatic fines for some rule breachesFining English water companies for spilling raw sewage will soon become quicker and easier, the government has said.New proposals would see automatic fines of up to Â£20,000 issued for some minor offences and make it simpler to punish more serious ones. In recent years data from the water industry's own monitoring equipment has shown how frequently rules are broken around sewage spills. But the regulator, the Environment Agency, has by its own admission struggled to act.\"I want to give the Environment Agency the teeth it needs to tackle all rule breaking,\" said Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds, announcing the proposals.\"With new, automatic and tougher penalties for water companies, there will be swift consequences for offences â including not treating sewage to the required standard, and maintenance failures,\" she said.The plans will be put to a six-week public consultation starting on Wednesday.The English water companies welcomed the proposals, with a spokesperson for trade body Water UK saying: \"It is right that water companies are held to account when things go wrong.\"Getty ImagesWater companies are only supposed to spill raw sewage under specific exceptional conditions like very heavy rain.  For the most serious pollution offences, the enforcement system remains the same. The EA has to take water companies to court and prove to a criminal standard that an offence has been committed \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". If that prosecution results in a conviction the company could have to pay a large fine, possibly in the millions of pounds.The new proposals are focused on more minor offences which happen frequently and have in the past gone largely unpunished. The plans would see automatic financial penalties of up to Â£20,000 introduced for rule breaches such as failure to report a significant pollution incident within four hours, failure to report spill data properly or if emergency overflow outlets discharge sewage more than three times in a year.For some more serious offences the government wants to make it easier for the EA to take action.So it's proposing that the burden of proof be reduced from \"beyond all reasonable doubt\" - the norm for criminal proceedings - to \"on the balance of probabilities\", which is used in civil cases. The fines which the EA can impose without going to court could be increased to a maximum of half a million pounds.The reduced burden of proof for some offences is already written into law, having been part of the Water (Special Measures) Act which received Royal Assent in February 2025. This six-week consultation is to determine which offences should be included, and the level of the fines.\"Fines of Â£500,000 are pocket change to billion-pound companies like Thames Water,\" says James Wallace, the CEO of campaign group River Action.\"Higher penalties and urgent, wholesale reform are essential to prevent negligent firms polluting our rivers and short-changing their customers.\"",

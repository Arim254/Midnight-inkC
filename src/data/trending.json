    "body": "14 hours agoAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spiesThe government is facing questions after a case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed, just weeks before the trial was due to go ahead.In September, prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the charges, sparking a political row over who was to blame.The background to the case is complicated - so here we try and walk you through how we got here and the political impact.What was the case about?Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry - who have both consistently maintained their innocence - were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Why did it collapse?Last week, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.In a rare intervention, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, who is the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales, said the CPS had tried to obtain further evidence from the government \"over many months\" but witness statements did not meet the threshold to prosecute.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.However, some legal experts have questioned whether the CPS would have needed this evidence to go ahead with the prosecution.What was the political fallout?Downing Street has insisted the decision to drop charges was made by the CPS, with no ministers or members of the government involved. The government has maintained that it is frustrated the trial collapsed.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also sought to shift the focus to the previous Conservative government, which was in power when the alleged offences took place.He argued the prosecution could only be based on the Tory government's position at that time, when he says China was not designated a \"threat to national security\".Current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected this claim, pointing out that a number of former senior security and legal officials have also questioned the government's argument.Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat.However, they claim there are hundreds of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence.The Tories have suggested that the PM's national security adviser Jonathan Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it needed to secure convictions.Ministers have insisted Powell had no involvement in the substance or evidence of the case.Why is this a problem for the government?Badenoch has accused the government of deliberately collapsing the trial because \"the prime minister wants to suck up to Beijing\" - something it has denied.Since last year's general election, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China to help achieve its aim of growing the economy.Then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Powell have all visited the country over the past year.The government has insisted its approach to China is rooted in the UK's national interests.However, Badenoch has claimed that following the collapse of the case it seems the PM has been \"too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security\".",

    "body": "The organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have postponed a vote on whether Israel should be allowed to perform in next year's competition.The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said \"recent developments in the Middle East\" had prompted it to cancel the virtual meeting to vote on the matter, which was scheduled to take place in November.It said Israel's participation would instead be discussed at an in-person meeting in December, though it did not make clear whether a vote would still take place.Israel's participation in Eurovision has faced opposition from some other participating countries due to the war in Gaza.On Monday, all 20 living Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas in exchange for the return of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. It comes after a ceasefire came into force on Friday.Ceasefire live updates'You're my life, my hero': Hostages reunite with families after two yearsPalestinians celebrate return of detainees freed by IsraelIn a statement, the EBU said: \"In the light of recent developments in the Middle East, the EBU's executive board (meeting on October 13) agreed there was a clear need to organise an open and in-person discussion among its members on the issue of participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026.\"\"Consequently, the board agreed to put the issue on the agenda of its ordinary winter general assembly, which will be taking place in December, rather than organising an extraordinary session in advance,\" it added.The EBU announced last month it would invite 68 member countries to give their view on whether Israel should take part at a general assembly meeting in November.Austrian national broadcaster ORF, which will host the contest in 2026, said it welcomed the EBU's decision.It had previously urged countries not to boycott the contest next year in Vienna, with its Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger saying Eurovision and the arts in general are \"not the appropriate arenas for sanctions\". Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Iceland and the Netherlands have all said they would consider boycotting next year's contest if Israel were to take part. Dutch broadcaster AvroTros said last month it would not change its position if a ceasefire in Gaza was reached. \"If a ceasefire is reached in the near future or the conflict develops differently, that will not change our position for 2026. We will reassess participation in subsequent years, depending on the circumstances at that time,\" it said in a statement. The BBC has asked Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, for comment.In September it said it should be allowed to take part, saying it was \"one of the contest's longstanding, popular and successful participants\". Israel came second in the the most recent Eurovision Song Contest in May, with its act Yuval Raphael receiving the largest combined public vote.However, the inclusion of jury votes led to Austria being declared the overall winner.",

    "body": "4 hours agoEvery paper on Tuesday focuses on the release of Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of a US-brokered plan to end the war in Gaza, which also saw Palestinian prisoners and detainees freed. A number of fronts feature full-page picture spreads - a photograph of hostage Alon Ohel smiling with his family leads the Daily Express, paired with the headline \"The long, painful nightmare is over\".\"Two years of torment over\" declares the Times, picturing hostages Alon Ohel, Evyatar David and Avinatan Or reuniting with their respective loved ones. The paper says US President Donald Trump hailed an \"end of an age of terror and death\" in his speech following the hostage release, and urged members of the Israeli parliament not to resume hostilities.Monday was a \"rare moment of joy among both Israelis and Palestinians\", according to the Guardian, which carries a photograph of people rejoicing in Tel Aviv and another photo of a released Palestinian hugging his son. The paper reports that large crowds also gathered in Khan Younis for the return of nearly 1,700 Palestinians who had been detained during the war, while the West Bank capital Ramallah received 88 detainees who were serving life sentences in Israel. \"We did not give up faith, we did not lose hope\" reads the headline of the i Paper, detailing the \"jubilation and relief\" for Israeli families after the release of the 20 remaining living hostages.The Financial Times leads on Trump's speech to the Israeli parliament, and reports that the president received multiple standing ovations as he \"set out a grand postwar vision\". The paper hones in on the second phase of the ceasefire, which it says diplomats believe will be \"far more complicated\", and notes that it has not been formally agreed to by Israel and Hamas.Trump also used his speech to touch on other peace deals he hopes to broker, and the Telegraph says he told the Knesset that he plans to \"focus on Russia first\". The paper reports that the Ukrainian prime minister and his top aide flew to Washington DC on Monday to begin \"high level talks to strengthen Ukraine's defense\", amid \"mounting\" speculation over the US president's decision to ship Tomohawk weapons to the nation. \"Home and now it's time for peace\" reads the headline of the Metro, alongside a photo of the moment twin Israeli hostages Ziv and Gali Berman reunited.The front page of the Star also focuses on the twins, featuring a full-page photograph of the brothers embracing with the headline \"Hug of love\".All 20 Israeli hostages have been pictured on the front page of the Sun, with the paper declaring they have been \"freed from hell\" after 737 days in captivity.\"Noa's hero is home\" says the Daily Mail, reporting on hostage Avinatan Or being reunited with his girlfriend and former hostage Noa Argamani, who was rescued in 2024. And the Mirror features a poignant image of Mr Or holding his hands up in a heart, calling it a \"message of love for the world\". Its headline is: \"Day we thought we'd never see.\" Related Internet Links",

    "body": "14 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBettmann / GettyWoody Allen and Diane Keaton in Annie HallUS actor and director Woody Allen has paid a lengthy, glowing tribute to Diane Keaton who died on Saturday aged 79.Writing in The Free Press, Allen described Keaton as \"unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again,\" adding that \"her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered\".In a long personal essay, Allen recalled first meeting Keaton in 1969 during rehearsals for his play Play It Again, Sam before going on to make eight films with her including Annie Hall, which she won best actress for at the 1977 Academy Awards.\"As time went on I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton,\" wrote Allen.\"I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it.\"In Annie Hall, Keaton played the role of the film's quirky, insecure and free-spirited titular star, who Allen's character, Alvy Singer, falls in love with.The pair were at one point romantically involved in real life.Reminiscing on the first time they met, Allen remembered thinking: \"If Huckleberry Finn [writer Mark Twain's fictional vagabond] was a gorgeous young woman, he'd be Keaton.\"He added that the world was now a \"drearier\" place without her in it.\"Still, there are her movies. And her great laugh still echoes in my head.\"She starred in other Allen titles such as Manhattan, Sleeper and Radio Days.Silver Screen Collection / ContributorThe pair pictured together on the set of comedy film Sleeper in 1973Keaton remained a supporter of Allen, a controversial figure, who was accused of molesting his daughter Dylan, which he has always denied.No charges have ever been brought against the star.She told the Guardian in 2023: \"He gave me everything. He really did. Woody made it loose. That helped me enormously.\"Silver Screen Collection / ContributorLos Angeles-born Keaton shot to fame in the early 1970s through her role as Kay Adams-Corleone in the Godfather films, before going on to feature in movies like Father of the Bride and Fellow First Wives Club.Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, like fellow US filmmaker Allen, also paid tribute to the \"extraordinary\" actress over the weekend.In a post shared on social media, Coppola wrote: \"Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful.\"From her earliest performances in Hair and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor.\"He said he had seen her performance in the film Lovers and Other Strangers and \"knew\" that he \"had to have her play Kay in The Godfather\"; adding that Keating later told him she had based her portrayal on his own wife, documentary maker Eleanor Coppola, who died last year.He noted her \"wonderful work in Annie Hall\" while simultaneously \"setting a new fashion trend.\"\"Everything about Diane was creativity personified.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoJoe TidyCyber correspondent, BBC World ServicePeople should plan for potential cyber-attacks by going back to pen and paper, according to the latest advice.The government has written to chief executives across the country strongly recommending that they should have physical copies of their plans at the ready as a precaution.A recent spate of hacks has highlighted the chaos that can ensue when hackers take computer systems down. The warning comes as the National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) reported an increase in more serious cyber attacks this year.Criminal hacks on Marks and Spencer, The Co-op and Jaguar Land Rover have led to empty shelves and production lines being halted this year as the companies struggled without their computer systems.Organisations need to \"have a plan for how they would continue to operate without their IT, (and rebuild that IT at pace), were an attack to get through,\" said Richard Horne, chief executive of the NSCS.Firms are being urged to look beyond cyber-security controls toward a strategy known as \"resilience engineering\", which focuses on building systems that can anticipate, absorb, recover, and adapt, in the event of an attack.Preferably the plans should be in paper form or stored offline, the agency suggests.Although the total number of hacks that the NCSC dealt with in the first nine months of this year was, at 429, roughly the same as for a similar period last year, there was an increase in hacks with a bigger impact.The number of \"nationally significant\" incidents represented nearly half, or 204, of all incidents. Last year only 89 were in that category.A nationally significant incident covers cyber-attacks in the three highest categories in the NCSC and UK law enforcement categorisation model:Category 1: National cyber-emergency.Category 2: Highly significant incident.Category 3: Significant incident.Category 4: Substantial incident.Category 5: Moderate incident.Category 6: Localised incident.Amongst this year's incidents, 4% (18) were in the second highest category \"highly significant\".This marks a 50% increase in such incidents, an increase for the third consecutive year.The NCSC would not give details on which attacks, either public or undisclosed, fall into which category.But, as a benchmark, it is understood that the wave of attacks on UK retailers in the spring, which affected Marks and Spencer, The Co-op and Harrods, would be classed as a significant incidents.One of the most serious attacks last year, on a blood testing provider, caused major problems for London hospitals. It resulted in significant clinical disruption and directly contributed to at least one patient death. The NCSC would not say which category this incident would fall into.The vast majority of attacks are financially motivated with criminal gangs using ransomware or data extortion to blackmail a victim into sending Bitcoins in ransom.Whilst most cyber-crime gangs are headquartered in Russian or former Soviet countries, there has been a resurgence in teenage hacking gangs thought to be based in English-speaking countries. So far this year seven teenagers have been arrested in the UK as part of investigations into major cyber-attacks. As well as the advice over heightened preparations and collaboration, the government is asking organisations to make better use of the free tools and services offered by the NCSC, for example free cyber-insurance for small businesses that have completed the popular Cyber-Essentials programme.",

    "body": "Nato chief Mark Rutte joked about the condition of Russia's naval fleet on Monday as Moscow denied one of its submarines had to surface because of technical problems. Russia's Black Sea Fleet said the diesel-powered submarine Novorossiysk had surfaced off France to comply with navigation rules in the English Channel, through which it was shadowed by a UK warship and helicopter.Dutch authorities had said on Saturday the submarine was under tow in the North Sea.\"What a change from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel The Hunt for Red October. Today, it seems more like the hunt for the nearest mechanic,\" Rutte said in a speech in Slovenia, saying the \"broken\" vessel was \"limping\" home. Rutte said there was \"hardly any Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean left\". VChK-OGPU, a Telegram channel that publishes purported Russian security leaks, reported on 27 September that fuel was leaking into the hold of the Novorossiysk in the Strait of ­Gibraltar, raising the risk of an explosion.As it was returning from its deployment in the Mediterranean, the Royal Navy said it tracked the vessel over three days, from 7 to 9 October. Taking part in joint Nato efforts, the navy said HMS Iron Duke monitored the surfaced Russian Kilo-class submarine and its support tug as they passed through the Channel and into the North Sea.On Saturday, the Dutch defence ministry said the Dutch navy had then escorted the Novorossiysk and the accompanying towing vessel.The Russian Black Sea Fleet said on Monday that the submarine, part of a group of submarines that carry Kalibr cruise missiles, was conducting a \"scheduled inter-fleet transit\".\"Information disseminated by a number of media outlets about an alleged malfunction and, as a result, the emergency surfacing of the diesel-electric submarine Novorossiysk off the coast of France does not correspond to reality,\" the Russian Black Sea Fleet's press service said, as quoted by Interfax news agency.\"In accordance with international navigation regulations, submarines are to navigate the English Channel only while on the surface,\" it added.The incident comes two weeks after the Royal Navy tracked a Russian frigate and cargo vessel through the Channel. Al Carns, minister for the armed forces, said the navy's latest operation was \"a clear sign of how the UK stands strong with our NATO allies to push back against Russian aggression\". In June, a Russian warship disguised itself using a fake ID signal while travelling through the English Channel with two sanctioned oil tankers, a BBC Verify investigation found.It travelled alongside two vessels known to be part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a network of tankers whose ownership can be obscured and are used to transport sanctioned oil products.",

    "body": "Vodafone admits 'major outage' as more than 130,000 report problems11 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThousands of Vodafone customers across the UK have reported its services are down.Downdetector, which monitors web outages, showed more than 130,000 people had flagged problems affecting their Vodafone broadband or mobile network on Monday afternoon.According to its website, the firm has more than 18 million customers in the UK, including nearly 700,000 home broadband customers.In an updated statement on Monday evening, Vodafone apologised to customers and said its network was \"recovering\".\"This afternoon the Vodafone network had an issue affecting broadband, 4G and 5G services,\" a company spokesperson said.\"2G voice calls and SMS messaging were unaffected and the network is now recovering.\"We apologise for any inconvenience this caused our customers.\"It comes after people on social media said they were struggling to access Vodafone customer service operators, amid ongoing issues affecting mobile data and broadband.Many also said they have had difficulty accessing the company's website and app, which typically allow people to view the status of its network services.Customers have also taken to social media to complain of \"complete outages\" in their area.The issues appear to have begun for customers shortly after 15:00 BST.Internet monitor Netblocks said in a post on X that live network data showed Vodafone was experiencing \"a national outage\" impacting both broadband and mobile data.Some customers expressed being doubly frustrated by not being able to access their Wi-Fi or mobile data.\"Sort it out soon please,\" wrote one frustrated X user - who said they were having to use a coffee shop's Wi-Fi to access online services, without the means to do so using their mobile data or broadband.Another said they were self-employed and could not work because of the outage, adding: \"Never regretted more having my mobile and broadband on the same network.\"The issues are also understood to have impacted some Vodafone shops.BBC NewsA Vodafone store in Clapham, south-west London, was seen by BBC News to have  information signs on its windows, with multiple customers waiting outside asking staff what was going on with their signal.'Dropped off the internet'The issues affecting Vodafone services have also impacted customers of other telecoms firms that use its network.Downdetector saw a similar spike in reports on Monday afternoon from users of the mobile network Voxi, which is owned by Vodafone.Lebara, which piggy-backs off Vodafone's network, has also been affected by the company's outage.\"Outages have been reported across multiple networks across broadband and mobile services,\" said Sabrina Hoque, telecoms expert at Uswitch.These, she added, can be \"a really frustrating experience for customers, especially when it's not clear how long it could last\".Vodafone has not yet said how long it expects its outage to last - though its website since appears to have come back online.Cloudflare Radar, which tracks and displays patterns in global internet traffic, said in a post on Bluesky earlier it had \"effectively dropped off the internet, with traffic dropping to zero\".The company has also not said what caused the issue affecting its networks.\"Incidents like this are often caused by a technical fault or configuration error rather than a major cyber-attack, so until more details are confirmed it's best not to speculate,\" said Daniel Card, a cyber expert with BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.\"Having teams capable of diagnosing and responding rapidly to network failures is key to maintaining public trust and keeping the UK's digital infrastructure running smoothly.\"Additional reporting by Ewan Somerville.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNatalie ShermanJanani Mohan/Yagappa PhotographyJanani Mohan is missing a dress she wore at her wedding in April, which was also worn by her motherGraduate student Nicole Lobo moved back to the US in late August after a year in the UK, shipping 10 boxes of possessions back home to Philadelphia that she expected to arrive within a few days. Six weeks later, she is still waiting for the shipment - and fears it is lost, destroyed by UPS as the company struggles to handle a flood of packages facing new customs and tariff rules. \"It's been horrific,\" says the 28-year-old, who was notified last month that her boxes would be disposed of, leaving her to make frantic phone calls and send emails to try to head off the outcome. It's an ordeal facing many UPS customers since the Trump administration in late August stopped allowing parcels worth less than $800 to enter the US without inspection, taxes or tariffs.The decision abruptly made an estimated 4 million packages each day subject to new, more onerous processing and documentation rules.As the influx leads to longer processing times and higher, sometimes unexpected, costs across the industry, some customers of UPS like Nicole, say they fear their packages have been lost in the backlog. \"It's beyond comprehension to me,\" says Janani Mohan, a 29-year-old engineer living in Michigan, who has also spent hours on hold and sent repeated emails since a tracking alert listed a box sent by her parents in India as set for disposal.The parcel held her wedding dress, which had also been worn by her mother, an heirloom sari from her grandmother and wedding photos, among other items. \"I literally cried to them on the phone,\" she says. \"Everything in there is very close to my heart.\"Oregon-based Mizuba Tea Co, which has used UPS for more than a decade to import matcha from Japan, has five shipments together worth more than $100,000 held up in processing.The firm has received conflicting alerts about their status, including some saying the items were set for disposal. \"My whole team is basically on scan watch,\" says Lauren Purvis, who runs the business with her family and is now starting to worry about running out of inventory if the limbo continues. \"It's just clear to us that the current importing systems were not prepared to handle the sheer amount of volume and paperwork.\"Mizuba TeaLauren Purvis says her whole team is on \"scan watch\"Importers typically have 10 days after goods enter the US to submit documentation about the goods, pay tariffs and other fees, allowing the package to go to its recipient. But the Trump administration's rapid changes to tariff rules have made it increasingly difficult to meet customs deadlines requirements, say shipping companies like FedEx and UPS, which offer customs services and often act as importers of record.For example, businesses are now responsible for paying tariffs on any steel or aluminium contained in a product , and in many cases vouching for its country of origin - information that many businesses, let alone their shipping companies, do not know. \"Because of changes to US import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance,\" a UPS spokeswoman said. While acknowledging longer shipping times, the company said it was still successfully clearing more than 90% of international packages within a day of arrival. The spokeswoman said its policy was to contact customers three times before moving to dispose of a package. But seven people interviewed by the BBC, including several businesses responsible for shipping the items, said they had received no word from UPS about issues before seeing the tracking alert that their package would be trashed.FedEx, another major player in the industry, said it does not typically destroy packages, unless directed to do so by the shipper. Nicole, the graduate student, says she has been asked to supply more information about her items, which she did promptly in early September.  She did not hear more until seeing the notice about disposal in late September. After the BBC enquired about her package, the tracking information was updated for the first time in weeks to say it was \"on the way\", raising her hopes. Likewise, Janani says the company reached out last week, after the BBC got in touch, for a few more documents and her package now appears to have cleared customs.Swedish Candy LandDaniel and Tobias Johansson, co-founders of Swedish Candy Land, say lost packages have cost their company $50,000But for businesses, the chaos has already had real costs. Swedish candy exporter Swedish Candy Land says more than 700 packages it sent via UPS to customers in the US in the first few weeks of September have been held up.Co-founder Tobias Johansson says the business switched to FedEx after becoming aware of the problem and its shipments were now arriving without incident, although the process took a few days longer than before . But the lost packages, some of which have been reported destroyed, have cost the firm roughly $50,000 in refunds, not including the expenses they incurred in shipping and brokerage fees. \"That was a big hit for us and we haven't gotten any answers yet for anything,\" says Mr Johansson.Experts say the ripple effects are being felt across the supply chain, even on businesses, like Mizuba, that were not bringing in shipments using the $800 exemption from tariffs, known as de minimis.  \"This can be felt pretty much across the board,\" says Bernie Hart, vice president of business development at Flexport, a logistics and customs business. In a call with financial analysts last month, FedEx executives said it had been a \"very stressful period\" for its customers, especially smaller players. \"That is a big headwind,\" chief executive Raj Subramanian said, warning that changes to the trade environment would likely lead to a $1bn hit this year, including $300m in additional expenses as the firm hires and faces other costs related to the new rules. But John Pickel, vice president of supply chain policy for the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents many shipping firms, fears the issues may get worse before they get better. Overall trade volumes last month were lower than is typical, in part because many businesses rushed goods into the US early to beat tariffs. \"There's always been this prevailing thought that companies will figure it out,\" he says. \"What we've seen is that is much harder than anyone anticipated.\"",

    "body": "The government's national security adviser Jonathan Powell made no decisions about the content of any evidence provided in the collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China, a minister has said.Prosecutors unexpectedly dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who deny the allegations - in September.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed the case collapsed because the government had refused to give the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) \"vital information\" as it wanted to \"curry favour\" with China.Security Minister Jarvis dismissed claims the government deliberately collapsed the case as \"baseless\".Mr Powell, who is one of the prime minister's most senior advisers and political allies, is facing pressure over whether he played a role in the collapse of the trial, with the Conservatives saying he has \"questions to answer\". Sir Keir Starmer has insisted he has \"full confidence\" in his national security adviser, telling broadcasters: \"He is doing an excellent job.\"Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.But last week the head of the CPS said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.Giving a statement to MPs in the Commons, Jarvis denied reports Mr Powell had ruled China could not be defined as a national security threat at a meeting of Whitehall officials in September, shortly before the charges were dropped.\"Of course, [the national security adviser] takes part in discussions about national security and diplomatic relations. That is literally his job,\" he said.\"But any discussions were on the basis that the case would be going ahead and how to handle the implications. \"The national security adviser was not involved in any decisions about the substance of the evidence.\"Jarvis said it was deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins who provided a witness statement in December 2023 under the previous Conservative government, with further witness statements requested and provided in February and July this year.He said Mr Collins was given \"full freedom to provide evidence without interference\", adding: \"Ministers and special advisers did not take decisions about that evidence and they were not cited on the contents.\"Jarvis said all the evidence provided was based on the law and the Tory government's position on China at the time of the alleged offences.He added that the decision about whether to proceed with the prosecution was taken by the CPS, \"who were hamstrung by antiquated legislation\".The Official Secrets Act of 1911 has since been replaced by the 2023 National Security Act, which Jarvis said closed \"the loopholes that have been exposed by this particular case\".\"Suggestions that the government concealed evidence, withdrew witnesses, or restricted the ability of witnesses to draw on particular bits of evidence are all untrue,\" he said.\"The [deputy national security adviser] did not materially change his evidence and was under no pressure from anyone to do so...\"What has changed is the CPS's assessment of the case law.\"Jarvis sought to blame the previous Tory government for not classifying China as a threat to national security and being too \"slow\" to update national security laws.Defending her party's record, Badenoch pointed to a number of examples where Tory ministers and government documents had described China as a \"threat\".\"The trial has collapsed because for months and months, the government has been refusing to give the CPS vital information,\" she said.\"This wasn't a mistake. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This looks like a deliberate decision to collapse the case and curry favour with the regime in China.\"She added: \"I suspect that [ministers] have decided that closer economic ties with China were more important than due process and our national security.\"The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to \"come clean on why this case fell apart\" and publish all correspondence between the deputy national security adviser and the CPS.The party's foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said: \"The government's attempts to duck scrutiny and scapegoat a single official simply won't wash.\"It's inconceivable that neither Keir Starmer nor his national security adviser knew what evidence was being submitted in such an important case. \"The buck for this fiasco ultimately stops with the prime minister.\"Meanwhile, Jarvis confirmed that MI5's National Protective Security Authority had published new advice for politicians on how to protect themselves from espionage and foreign interference.The guidance warns MPs they are a potential target for foreign spies, with China, Russia and Iran identified as particular risks to British institutions.",

    "body": "9 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentPA MediaAn undercover officer was part of clashes when the five men originally accused of Lawrence murder appeared at an inquiry in 1998An undercover police officer took part in clashes during the Stephen Lawrence inquiry as part of his cover so he could better spy on anti-racism groups, one of the UK's longest-running public inquiries has been told.The decade-old Undercover Policing Inquiry, which began its latest phase of hearings on Monday, heard that there may be evidence of overt racism in how a now-disbanded team targeted black justice campaigners in the 1990s.Officers gathered information relating to Baroness Lawrence and Dr Neville Lawrence as they fought for justice over their son's 1993 racist murder, even though they had nothing to do with groups which the police force believed could be a danger to public order.The inquiry - which has cost £114m so far - began in 2015 after allegations emerged of abuses by undercover officers, including deceiving women into sexual relationships.In an opening statement on Monday, the inquiry's lead lawyer David Barr KC said it would hear \"deeply moving\" evidence from justice campaigners including the Lawrence family and Sukdev Reel, whose son Ricky died in 1997 in what many suspect was a racist murder.Mr Barr said that the inquiry would look at why Scotland Yard had deployed undercover officers to gather information relating to campaigns such as these and to what extent those operations may have been motivated by racism.One of those officers was a man known only as HN81 or \"David Hagan\" due to an anonymity order.By 1997 he had been deployed to gather intelligence on the anti-racism movement in London at a time when the force was preparing to face a public inquiry over how it had botched the investigation into Stephen Lawrence's murder.Stephen, 18, was stabbed by a gang as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London.While the thrust of the evidence so far is that HN81 did not get close enough to the family to have become a key figure in their campaign, he has admitted being part of infamous clashes on the day that the five murder suspects gave evidence to the Lawrence inquiry in 1998.\"He [HN81] accepts being involved in the public disorder,\" Mr Barr said.\"HN81 describes that day as the most serious incident of public disorder he witnessed and participated in. He describes shouting, aggressive posturing and joining in with the pushing and shoving once that had begun.\"The police ultimately used CS gas to try to control the crowd - leading to Baroness Lawrence appealing for calm.\"It is undeniable that the Stephen Lawrence Campaign was conducted throughout in a manner that defied public disorder, advocating for order and calm, even where some would have had it otherwise,\" said Mr Barr.\"Dr Neville Lawrence is appalled that a police officer was involved in such action. He has stated to the inquiry that it is (I quote) 'particularly troubling that an officer who sought to justify surveillance on the grounds of public disorder actively contributed to it'.\"Another key witness for the latest tranche of evidence is Peter Francis, a former officer of the now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad at the heart of the allegations of wrongdoing.His revelations were one of the factors that triggered the public inquiry.When he gives evidence in December, Mr Francis is expected to say that in 1993 - six months after Stephen's murder - he was receiving racially-motivated orders from a manager known only as \"HN86\" to gather information relating to that justice campaign and other causes.\"Mr Francis portrays HN86 as a thoroughly and overtly racist man who, amongst other things, instructed him to seek out intelligence for the purpose of undermining black justice campaigns,\" said Mr Barr.\"In particular, information about the Lawrence family which could be used to discredit them and to destroy the Stephen Lawrence Campaign.\"Mr Francis asserts that he was also expected to report information that might discredit Duwayne Brooks [Stephen Lawrence's friend who had been with him on the night of the fatal attack].\"HN86 denies these allegations. We will be looking at them very closely indeed.\"In a brief opening address, Peter Skelton KC, representing the Metropolitan Police, said the force apologised to the family of Stephen Lawrence, his friend Duwayne Brooks, Sukhdev Reel, and other justice campaigners.\"There was a collective failure to exercise ethical judgment about the purpose of undercover policing and the propriety of reporting on family justice campaigns,\" he said.\"This is reflective of an 'us against them' culture that prevailed within the MPS at that time, which didn't properly distinguish between legitimate intelligence targets, such as groups committed to inciting serious public disorder, and illegitimate targets such as grieving black and Asian families who were complaining about injustice and the actions of the police.\"",

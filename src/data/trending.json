    "body": "At least 11 people have been killed in a mass shooting at a hostel in South Africa.Fourteen others were wounded when gunmen stormed the venue in Saulsville township, west of the capital Pretoria, early on Saturday. A three-year-old is among the dead.\"At least three unknown gunmen entered this hostel where a group of people were drinking and they started randomly shooting,\" police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said.The motive of the shooting is unknown and no arrests have been made. It is the latest in a string of mass shootings that have rocked the crime-ridden country in recent years.The gunmen reportedly entered the premise at 04:30 local time (02:30 GMT) and opened fire on a group of men who were drinking. A 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl were among those killed in the attack.\"I can confirm that a total of 25 people were shot,\" Mathe said. Describing the hostel as an \"illegal shebeen\", she added: \"We are having a serious challenge when it comes to these illegal and unlicensed liquor premises,\" where she said the majority of mass shootings occur.\"Innocent people also get caught up in the crossfire,\" she told public broadcaster SABC.In a major crackdown, police shut down 12,000 such premises outlets between April and September this year and arrested more than 18,000 people across the country.South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, at 45 people per 100,000 according to 2023-24 figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Some 63 people were killed every day between April and September, according to police data.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoEmma RossiterTake Back PowerFour people have been arrested after custard and apple crumble were flung at a display case containing part of the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.Police were called shortly before 10:00 GMT on Saturday after the case containing the Imperial State Crown - which is typically worn by the King at formal ceremonies - was defaced.The Metropolitan Police said four people had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. The Tower's Jewel House was temporarily closed to the public while the police investigated.Take Back Power, which describes itself as a new non-violent civil-resistance group, claimed it was behind the act.The group said it carried out the stunt to demand the UK government establishes a permanent citizen's assembly - a \"House of the People\" - with the power to \"tax extreme wealth and fix Britain\".Policing minister Sarah Jones said that the incident was \"disgraceful\", adding: \"There is a clear difference between the democratic right to protest and unacceptable behaviour.\"Footage shared by Take Back Power on social media showed one protester removing a large foil tray of crumble from a bag before slamming it against the glass protecting the Imperial State Crown.Another then poured a tub of bright yellow custard on the front of the case.\"Democracy has crumbled,\" one protester could be heard shouting. Another added: \"Britain is broken. We've come here to the jewels of the nation to take back power.\"Meanwhile, surprised tourists could be seen reacting to the stunt.Historic Royal Palaces confirmed that the Imperial State Crown was not damaged.The Jewel House reopened to the public early in the afternoon.This is the second demonstration claimed by the group in the past few days.On Wednesday, three protesters emptied bags of manure onto the floor of the Ritz hotel lobby under its 25ft Christmas tree.The Imperial State Crown is a famous symbol of the monarchy and was worn by King Charles III as he left Westminster Abbey on his coronation day in 2023.Beyond coronations, the priceless working crown is only used during formal occasions, such as the State Opening of Parliament.When it is not being used, it is kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.It was originally made in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI and contains 2,868 diamonds, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, four rubies and 269 pearls and weighs over a kilogram.",

    "body": "3 hours agoCharlie BucklandBBC WalesOne of Britain's busiest ports has closed one of its terminals following a \"berthing incident\" caused by severe weather conditions.The incident took place on Friday at Terminal 5 of Holyhead Port on Anglesey, Stena Line Port announced, who said the terminal will remain temporarily closed to ensure safety.It added that the port \"continues to facilitate the full sailing schedule for ferry operators\". Holyhead faced months of disruption after Storm Darragh hit Wales in December 2024, having only fully reopened in July after seven months of partial closure. Two berths at Holyhead were damaged hours before the height of a rare red weather wind warning that battered Wales last December.The port was closed for five weeks, including over the Christmas period, as engineers fixed one of the damaged berths - Holyhead partially reopened in January and services resumed to a revised timetable.The other berth took seven months to repair and reopened in July, but the economic impact of the closures was estimated at £500m in lost trade.Rhun ap Iorwerth, Member of the Senedd for Ynys Môn, described the announcement as \"worrying\" one year on from the previous disturbance, which had implications for the local community.\"The priority now must be to understand what exactly has happened and what the implications might be,\" he said in a statement.More than 1.5m people pass through Holyhead every year making it the most popular sea route between the UK mainland and the Republic of Ireland.Stena Line said current weather conditions prevent a full assessment but that services would continue according to \"the full sailing schedule\".

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, International Space Station in the skies above New ZealandByShireen JordanBBC WeatherThere is plenty to keep stargazers amused through the rest of December.From a planetary conjunction to the astronomical start of winter to some of 2025's most prolific meteor showers.The month has already got off to a stunning start with a third consecutive supermoon lighting up night skies with the added interest of a rare double lunar halo and the Northern Lights also putting on a dazzling show. Of course these delights rely on clear weather conditions. Check the viewing potential where you live at BBC Weather.Not one but three meteor showers to enjoyThe Geminid meteor shower is active from 4 to 20 December and is one of the last major showers of 2025. It peaks on 14 December when the Moon is waning crescent. This should help viewing conditions as there will be less light pollution at a time when the Geminids have been known to produce over 120 meteors per hour. Meteors are pieces of debris that enter Earth's atmosphere, passing through the debris of a comet or an asteroid at speeds of up to 150,000mph (241,000km/h), vaporising and causing beautiful streaks of light caused by particles as small as a grain of sand.The meteors associated with the Geminids are some of the brightest and most abundant in the skies and appear as multi-coloured streaks of white, yellow, green, red and blue due to elements such as sodium and calcium found within the celestial debris. They were first observed in 1862 and according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich are thought to be intensifying every year.Image source, Carl JacoletteImage caption, Geminids meteor shower at St Aldhelm's Chapel, Dorset, in December 2023This is followed by the Ursid meteor shower which is active from 17 to 26 December, peaking between the 22 and 23. Meteors will appear to radiate from the constellation Ursa Minor, hence its name with a peak rate of just 10 meteors per hour. If you miss both the Geminids and Ursids, don't despair. The Quadrantids are active from 28 December and are one of the strongest and most consistent meteor showers of the year. They peak between 3 to 4 January 2026 in UK.Pre-Christmas planetary conjunctionAn early Christmas present of Moon and Jupiter in close proximity can be seen on 7 December. According to the Royal Museums Greenwich they will be best observed low on the horizon just after the Moon rises in the north-east.Whilst they look close together they are actually millions of miles apart.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, An image showing new Moon near planet JupiterMysterious comet at closest point to EarthThe Comet 3I/ATLAS  will be at its closest point to Earth on 19 December.It is an interstellar object (only the third ever detected) meaning it originates from outside our solar system. It is not bound to the Sun and will never return.It was first discovered in July and recent observations show that 3I/ATLAS has developed a faint bluish hue, suggesting a possible colour change - the third shift in its colouring since its discovery.The comet is more ancient than our solar system at over seven billion years old and provides valuable clues about planetary formation in other star systems.Speculation has arisen about it being an alien object, but NASA has dismissed these claims. It won't be visible to the naked eye but should be able to be viewed using an amateur telescope.The winter solstice and the start of astronomical winterImage source, D.Lentz/gettyimagesImage caption, Stonehenge at night with starry sky on winter solstice.The winter solstice marks the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere in the UK when Earth's axis is tilted at its furthest point from the Sun.It is also the longest night here and the start of astronomical winter.The solstice is actually a specific moment, not a whole day and in 2025 it happens at 15:03 GMT on 21 December.We have solstices because the Earth is tilted on its axis by 23.5 degrees, which affects which part of the planet's surface the Sun is directly overhead at any given time.International Space Station fly-byThe spacecraft should be visible above the UK for approximately four minutes at 05:56 GMT on 25 December. Although it will be dark, the International Space Station will be high enough to reflect the sunlight, helping it to be seen. It will be the third brightest object in the sky after the Moon and Venus and appear as a single, fast-moving bright star, easily spotted with the naked eye.And whilst you may have marvelled at the Cold Moon earlier in December, a fourth consecutive supermoon is on its way in early January. This one is known as the Wolf Moon and the last chance to see the Moon looking so big and close in our night skies until November 2026.",

    "body": "6 hours agoHelen Catt,political correspondent,andTabby WilsonTrans women will not be able to take part in the main session at the Labour Women's Conference next year.It follows a legal review into how the event should operate after the Supreme Court ruled in April that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities legislation.Trans women will not be able to take part in formal proceedings, including speeches in the main hall and policy debates, but will be able to attend fringe events, which will be open to everyone regardless of their sex.It is understood the party considers the format to be the least restrictive way of balancing accessibility and compliance with the law.The Women's Conference, which is usually held the day before the party's annual conference in the same venue, was cancelled in 2025 after the party received legal advice in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.Prior to that ruling, Labour had allowed people to self-identify as a woman, so trans women could attend the event and also take part in \"positive action\" measures such as all-women shortlists.Labour launched a \"comprehensive legal review\" of the rules around its women's conference following the Supreme Court decision, a spokesperson said, before confirming the 2026 event would go ahead with new attendance rules in a place.The spokesperson continued: \"This reflects our commitment to addressing the under-representation of women in the Party and compliance with the law.\"It comes as the government continues to weigh a new code of practice in light of the ruling, guidance which issued to public bodies and businesses on how to apply the Equality Act.The code has been redrafted by the equality watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and submitted to the government for ministerial sign off before coming into force.Equalities minister Bridget Phillipson received the draft three months ago but said she would take the time needed to \"get this right\" before publishing. The EHRC under its current leadership has previously called on the government to sign off on the guidance quickly. Outgoing EHRC head Baroness Falkner of Margravine told the Times she was \"so certain\" of the lawfulness of the guidance and suggested one explanation for the delay could be that the government was \"terrified of their MPs who would wish for trans self-identification or trans inclusion to prevail across all areas of society\".She said the delay had led to a \"grey zone\" being created around single-sex spaces.\"Some organisations are implementing [the ruling] in one way, others are not,\" Baroness Falkner said.",

Even a decent score can land you in the bottom half of the leaderboard, and with so few couples remaining, there's everything to play for.And on Sunday night, two more couples will face the dreaded dance-off, with another set to be sent home.Strictly Come Dancing is on Saturday at 18:50 on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.",

    "body": "1 hour agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, BethlehemEPAFor two years during the Gaza war, all public celebrations for Christmas were cancelled in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank – where Christians believe Jesus was born.But after the recent ceasefire, the holy city decided that this year the festivities would return as symbolised by the lighting of its traditional, giant Christmas tree in front of the historic Nativity Church.\"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work,\" says Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati. \"We're all living here from tourism and tourism was down to zero.\"The mayor accepts that the idea of resuming celebrations was not without controversy, as suffering continues in Gaza – including for those in its tiny Christian community, many of whom have relatives in Bethlehem.\"Some may say it's not appropriate and others say it's appropriate,\" Mr Canawati tells me. \"But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us.\"Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to BethlehemOne tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin American and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare systemAlaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurantThe grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.",

    "body": "Twitch star QTCinderella says she wishes she never started streaming18 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterBBCThe popular Twitch streamer QTCinderella says she would be a \"happier person\" if she could go back and tell her younger self to choose a different career.The 31-year-old, real name Blaire (she does not make her second name public), became famous for playing video games and cooking meals in live videos for her 1.2 million followers online.In 2021 she created the annual Streamer Awards, which will be streamed online on Saturday.But she told the BBC while she felt \"incredibly lucky\" to be in her position, the negatives of the role - ranging from being under constant scrutiny to at times being concerned for her safety - makes it difficult to enjoy.\"If I could go back and never experience some of the things I've experienced because of this job, I do think I would be a happier person overall,\" she said.\"The biggest thing I wish I could do, if I went back and was able to whisper in my ear, I would say, don't do it.\"Getty ImagesQTCinderella at the Streamer Awards in 2024Throughout 2025, several female content creators have spoken out about concerns of their safety, particularly when attending public events.In March, three US Twitch streamers, Cinna, Valkyrae and Emiru, were taking part in a week-long marathon stream when a man threatened to kill them.Then, at the annual streamer event TwitchCon in October, a man from the crowd grabbed Emiru and tried to kiss her without her consent.While her personal security were able to intervene, she accused the on-site security team of not detaining him until hours after the event - something Twitch refuted in a statement.Harassment - or the threat of it - is an issue which Blaire says she has also had to face since her rise in popularity online.\"I could open my Instagram DMs right now and read you 100 horrible things about why or how I could be harmed by people,\" she said.In 2021, Blaire said she spent over $2,000 (£1,500) every month to have heavily edited photos of her removed from the internet.Then in January 2023, she discovered a deepfake website was using a likeness of her in pornographic material, alongside other popular female streamers.Now, she said despite opening a craft shop in Los Angeles earlier this year, it's rare she ever visits - because of men turning up to the shop and asking for her.\"I thought it'd be fun,\" she said.\"Unfortunately, it's gotten to the point where I can't go there because we've had men show up looking for me.\"I don't want it to be unsafe for my employees.\"From drama to positivityBlaire said she thought security at the Streamer Awards would be \"aggressive\" in comparison to other events, as she hopes to help the attendees from the streaming world feel as safe as possible.The ceremony recognises top creators across various categories like Gamer of the Year and Best Community, while this year's Streamer of the Year nominees includes the most-followed Twitch streamer with 20 million followers, Kai Cenat.A mix of 70% fan votes and 30% industry panellists decide the winners.In November, Blaire faced accusations from viewers claiming certain popular streamers were blocked from particular categories for being too \"problematic\" - which she denied.Clips of the streamer tearfully replying to criticisms of the event soon spread online.\"I think I need to respond less\", she said.\"But as a human, you just want to be understood\".The constant ebb and flow of streamer \"drama\" which many content creators like Blaire experience is one of the reasons she finds the job tough - but she said it was also why she started the awards.\"For me, it's really important to bring people together, because I do think there's lots of toxicity on the internet,\" she said. \"And if people were just able to have a dinner together or reach across the board, it makes a big difference.\"For one night of the year, the negativity is silent\".",

    "body": "11 minutes agoNardine SaadandHarry SekulichRussia has launched a major aerial bombardment against Ukrainian infrastructure targets as talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida are set to enter a third day.Overnight Russia launched 653 drones and 51 missiles, most of which were downed, authorities said. One strike hit a railway hub at the town of Fastiv southwest of Kyiv, destroying the main station building and damaging rolling stock.Russia says it targeted military-industrial sites, and energy and port infrastructure.Condemning the new attacks, French President Emmanuel Macron announced he would go to London on Monday for a meeting with Ukrainian, British and German leaders aimed at putting pressure on Moscow. \"We must continue to put pressure on Russia to force it towards peace,\" Macron posted on X.He said he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in London to take stock of the ongoing negotiations being mediated by the US.     Earlier US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\" after talks in Moscow failed to produce a breakthrough.Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy sector and infrastructure in recent weeks. On Saturday Ukraine's energy ministry said Russian attacks had hit energy facilities in eight regions, causing blackouts. Zelensky said the attack on the rail hub had been \"meaningless from a military point of view, and the Russians could not have been unaware of this\".Meanwhile the UN's nuclear watchdog said the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had temporarily lost all external power overnight - the 11th time this has happened since Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour.While it is not currently producing electricity, it needs power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.In Florida, a statement posted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff said two days of talks with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, had been \"constructive\".Witkoff and Umerov \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" that could such an agreement and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\", their statement said without giving details.The prospect of ending the war depended on Russia's readiness to take \"steps towards de-escalation and cessation of killing\", the statement added.The negotiations, which are also attended by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, will continue for a third day on Saturday. The Florida talks saw Ukraine's team briefed on a recent meeting between Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Witkoff spent almost five hours with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, after which the Kremlin said \"no compromise\" had been reached on a draft US peace plan. The Kremlin said Putin was ready to continue meeting the Americans \"as many times as needed\", but Ukraine and its allies in Europe have called into question the Russian leader's commitment to ending the war.On Friday, Zelensky said he wanted to \"obtain full information about what was said in Moscow and what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war\".Kyiv pushed for revisions to the initial US peace plan, which was widely seen as favourable to Moscow when an initial version leaked to the media. An updated version has not been shared publicly.Major points of contention remain between the two sides, including security guarantees for Ukraine post-war and territorial concessions. Russia currently controls roughly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory, including swathes of the Donbas area in the east – made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In an interview with India Today on Friday, Putin warned Ukrainian troops to withdraw fully from the region this week, saying Russia would otherwise \"liberate these [Donbas] territories by force\".Kyiv and its European allies believe the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato, or to provide comprehensive security guarantees. Russia is staunchly opposed, while Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Ukraine join the military alliance.The prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Trump said those talks were \"reasonably good\", but it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".",

    "body": "9 minutes agoJames DelaneyBBC ScotlandLord Malcolm Offord was welcomed on stage by Nigel FarageThe former Conservative business and Scotland Office Minister, Lord Malcolm Offord, has defected to Reform UK.He was unveiled by Nigel Farage at a rally at the Macdonald Inchyra hotel in Falkirk on Saturday.Lord Offord was the serving Treasurer of the Scottish Conservatives and served on the Lords front bench from 2021 until 2024.He told the rally he planned to stand down from the Lords and campaign as a candidate for Reform in the 2026 Holyrood elections.Announcing his defection, Lord Offord accused the Conservatives of \"giving up\" on Scotland.He called the party \"parochial, not political\" and described them as a \"party without a vision\".\"I'm concerned for Scottish politics, very concerned about what happens in Scotland,\" he said.\"And that's why I'm leaving the Scottish Conservative Party, because the Scottish Conservative Party, I believe, have given up on Scotland and, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do that.\"He added: \"From today, for the next five months, day and night, I shall be campaigning with all of you tirelessly for two objectives.\"The first objective is to remove this rotten SNP government after 18 years, and the second is to present a positive vision for Scotland inside the UK, to restore Scotland to being a prosperous, proud, healthy and happy country.\"It is not possible to renounce a life peerage, but peers can resign their membership of the House of Lords.Members of the House of Lords are disqualified from becoming members of the Scottish Parliament under legislation passed earlier this year.PA MediaFarage said Offord would help take Reform \"to a new level\"Reform has one MSP at Holyrood, the former Conservative Graham Simpson, who defected to the party in August.Farage  said he was \"delighted\" to welcome Lord Offord to Reform, describing his defection as \"a brave and historic act\".He added: \"He will take Reform UK Scotland to a new level.\"A spokesperson for the Scottish Conservatives said: \"Any vote for Reform next year will only tighten the SNP's grip on power at Holyrood.\"Nigel Farage has been clear he is fine with John Swinney staying as first minister, his party stood pro-independence candidates in the last election, and he is still courting others who would break up the UK.\"Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie called Reform a \"party of failed Conservatives playing political musical chairs\".She said: \"This defection proves what we already know, Reform aren't even Tories in disguise anymore, they are just Tories - the same Tories that broke the immigration system, collapsed the economy and left working Scots to pay the price.\"This isn't change - it's the same failed politicians and failed ideas trying to divide our country.\"Meanwhile, Patrick Harvie, Scottish Greens constitutional spokesman, said: \"Reform is the party of the super rich. They have no interest in improving the lives of ordinary people and families.\"Who is Lord Malcolm Offord?Lord Offord, who founded investment firm Badenoch and Co, was made a life peer in 2021 under Boris Johnson.He had previously donated almost £150,000 to the Conservative party.Following his peerage, he became Baron Offord of Garvel, of Greenock in the County of Renfrew, and was appointed as a junior minister in the Scotland office.He also served as served as a minister of exports from 2023 until the general election in June 2024.He was previously director of the Vote No Borders campaign during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.The group attracted controversy after being forced to withdraw a cinema advert which claimed Scots would lose access to the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in the event of a Yes vote.The hospital complained about the message, saying it did not endorse the content and was not consulted prior to it being broadcast.Lord Offord also stood as a Conservative list candidate for the Lothian region in the 2021 Holyrood election, but finished fifth and did not gain a seat.Malcolm Offord isn't a household name, but Reform's Scottish operation will be very happy to have him on board.He's held a number of UK government ministerial posts, and was a serving Conservative frontbencher in the House of Lords.He wants to be a candidate at the next Holyrood election. And he'll bring both business and political experience to the party.Taking to the stage in Falkirk, he complained about the \"monopolitics\" of Labour and the Conservatives. He seems to have fallen out of love with his old party.The crowd here was delighted to welcome him, despite his very recent Tory past.But, some of his old colleagues aren't too sad to see him go.One Scottish Conservative insider messaged me calling him a \"treacherous snake\".

    "body": "Mohamed Salah says he feels like he has been \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool and his relationship with head coach Arne Slot has broken down.Salah was an unused substitute in Saturday's 3-3 draw at Leeds United - the third straight game the Egypt forward has started on the bench.After the game, the scorer of 250 goals in 420 Liverpool appearances said in an extraordinary interview with journalists: \"I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.\"I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager, and all of a sudden we don't have any relationship.\"I don't know why but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club.\"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.Read the full interview at the bottom of this page\"This club, I will always support it. My kids will always support it. I love the club so much and I always will.\"It [the situation] is not acceptable to me, to be fair. I don't get it. It's like I'm being thrown more under the bus. I don't think I'm the problem. I have done so much for this club.\"I don't have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone but I earned my position. It's football. It is what it is.\"Salah, who is going to the Africa Cup of Nations on 15 December, added that he was unsure about his Liverpool future, despite signing a new two-year contract in April.Salah, 33, scored 29 times in the 2024-25 Premier League as the Reds won the title in Slot's first season in charge.However, he has struggled for form since as Liverpool have been unable to match the heights of last term.Salah, who was brought to the club from Roma by Jurgen Klopp in 2017, has scored just four times in 13 top-flight appearances this season.The Saudi Pro League has for a long time held ambitions to add Salah - arguably the most recognisable Middle Eastern player on the planet - to a roster of global superstars that includes the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane.Sources have indicated that Al-Hilal, managed by Simone Inzaghi, are among the teams interested in Salah.BBC Sport has been told Liverpool are open-minded about Salah's future amid the Saudi interest.After the Leeds game - when Liverpool led 2-0 and then 3-2 before conceding a 96th-minute equaliser - Slot told Sky Sports why he did not use Salah off the bench.\"It was more about controlling the game [at 3-2] and we didn't need a goal,\" said Slot before Salah's interview. \"Normally when you need a goal, like last week against Sunderland, I brought Mo on.\"Speaking at his pre-match news conference on Friday, Slot said he understood the talk surrounding Salah after being dropped from the team.\"The chatter, yes, because he deserves that, he has been so influential for me and [for] six or seven years. It's completely normal people talk about it when he isn't playing,\" added Slot.Salah, third on Liverpool's all-time list of scorers behind Ian Rush (346) and Roger Hunt (285), made his most recent start in the 4-1 Champions League home defeat by PSV Eindhoven on 26 November.If Mohamed Salah has played his last game for Liverpool, then the 'Egyptian king' will still go down as a Liverpool legend.Since signing for £34m from Roma in 2017, the 33-year-old has scored 188 goals in the Premier League alone.Only Alan Shearer (260), Harry Kane (213) and Wayne Rooney (208) have more than Salah's 190 in the Premier League - he scored two for Chelsea during his time there in 2013-14.Salah was named the PFA players' player of the year for last season after scoring 29 goals and adding 18 assists on his way to the Golden Boot and Liverpool's title.Yet the backdrop to that campaign was the story of his contract, with a deal he had signed in 2022 making him Liverpool's highest-paid player of all time having been set to expire in the summer of 2025.In April, Salah signed a two-year extension, ending rumours he was going to depart on a free transfer, but he has been less productive this season, scoring just five goals in 19 appearances.After starting 53 Premier League games in a row for Liverpool, Salah was benched for the last three games by Arne Slot, with the Reds boss still describing him as a \"top professional\" and insisting Salah had responded like any top player would.Yet the fact that Salah chose to stop and speak in the mixed zone to reporters at Elland Road is telling. He clearly had something to say.It's unusual for Salah to stop, and it was after Liverpool beat Southampton in November last year that he came across and declared he was \"probably more out than in\" after revealing he had yet to be offered a new contract.Back then, team-mates were shocked to see him seek out reporters and they will be feeling the same after his latest extraordinary remarks.\"I'm very disappointed. I have done so much for this club, especially last season,\" he said. \"It seems to me that someone doesn't want me in the club.\"At Liverpool, Salah has won the Premier League twice (2019-20 and 2024-25), the Champions League (2018-19), FA Cup (2021-22), EFL Cup (2021-22) as well as both the Uefa Super Cup and the Fifa Club World Cup in 2019.On an individual note, he has won the Premier League's Golden Boot top scorer award four times, tying Thierry Henry for the record. Only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt have scored more goals for Liverpool.Yet unless Salah can see a way past sitting on the bench, it looks like it could be a sour end for the Premier League legend.Next weekend, he will leave for the Africa Cup of Nations and right now, the question is whether he will return in January as a Liverpool player.What were you thinking sat on the bench? \"I don't know what to say. It's funny but I couldn't believe it. It is a really disappointing result for us as a team because we expect to win a game like that.\"We managed to score two goals in the beginning and the game was going in our direction but we conceded silly goals. I'm not attacking my team-mates because I was on the bench, but we conceded silly goals as we did before. We just have to try to keep a clean sheet and win games.\"What couldn't you believe? \"That I'm sitting on the bench for 90 minutes! The third time on the bench, I think for the first time in my career. I'm very, very disappointed to be fair. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season.\"Now I'm sitting on the bench and I don't know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That's how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.\"I got a lot of promises in the summer and so far I am in the bench for three games so I can't say they keep the promise.\"I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship. I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club.\"This club, I always support it. My kids will always support it. I love the club so much. I will always do. I called my mum yesterday - you guys didn't know if I would start or not, but I knew.\"Yesterday I said to them, come to the Brighton game [on 13 December]. I don't know if I am going to play or not, but I am going to enjoy it. In my head, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now.\"I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to Africa Cup of Nations. I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.\"What do you do with the situation now? \"It is not acceptable for me. I don't know why this is happening to me. I don't get it. I think if this was somewhere else, every club would protect its player. How I see it now is like you throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now. But I don't think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club.\"The respect, I want to get. I don't have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone, but I earned my position. It's football. It is what it is.\"Have you played your last game for Liverpool? \"In football you never know. I don't accept this situation. I have done so much for this club.\"How frustrated are you? \"With respect, I love everyone. I love [Erling] Haaland, I will talk about him. I am the current top goalscorer in the Premier League. He is not yet. He is going to win it hopefully and that is fine for him. I love him and he knows that.\"I am top goalscorer, best player, winning the league in such a style, but I am the one who has to defend himself in front of the media and fans.\"Does this hurt you more? \"Absolutely. After what I have done for the club it really hurts. You can imagine, really. After going from home to the club and you don't know if you are starting. I know the club too well, I have been here many years. Tomorrow [Jamie] Carragher is going to go for me again and again and that's fine.\"Saudi interest? \"I don't want to answer this question, because the club is going to take me to a different direction.\"Situation impossible now to solve? \"I cannot say it is impossible, but from what I feel, I have done so much for the club, I love the fans and the club so much, but I don't know what is going to happen next.\"Doubly frustrating that you didn't even come on? \"I have been at this club, scoring more than anyone in this generation, since I came to the Premier League, I don't think anyone has scored more goals and made more assists than me. In the whole Premier League. If I am somewhere else, everybody would go to the media and defend the players. I am the only one in this situation.\"I remember a while go, Harry Kane was not scoring for 10 games, everyone in the media was like 'oh, Harry will score for sure'. When it comes to Mo everyone is like 'he needs to be on the bench'. I am sorry Harry!\"When you say about someone wanting you out, who? \"I don't know. I don't know. I really don't know.\"Sporting director? \"No, no, don't put the words in my mouth. From the situation I see that's it.\"Had anyone sort of communicated and explain the situation to you. Have you actually asked for that? \"I did. I did, but I don't see an explanation. Like I knew yesterday that I was not going to play and that's it, so take it and swallow it and go home.\"Were you told personally you weren't going to be playing by Arne? \"Yeah, he told me yesterday and had a meeting with him.\"Did you let your feelings be known then, you were disappointed? \"He knows my feeling. He knows my feeling.\"Regret signing that contract? \"Imagine how bad that I have to answer it, honestly. That hurts, even the question hurts. This club, signing for this club, I will never regret it. I thought I'm going to renew here and end my career here, but this is not according to the plan, so I'm not regretting signing for the club for sure.\"You're one of the greatest players in Liverpool's history. Can you believe it might end like this? \"Somehow it will end, but the thing in my head is like why it should end this way? Because I am too fit. Just five months ago I was just winning every individual award so why should it go this direction?\"I'm sorry everybody in a team is not in his form, yet I'm the one who has to defend himself now.\"Now is the next step for you to [speak with] Arne again? \"No, I don't think so. We spoke a lot.\"Has the relationship broken down? \"Yeah, there's no relationship between us. It was very good relationship and now all of a sudden there is no relationship.\"Something changed behind the scenes? \"You guys know better than me. I don't know.\"Do you feel let down from the team-mates as well? \"No, no, no. These guys, they know how much I love them. They know how much I support them, even inside before the game, after the game.\"I'm an experienced player, I've been in their position. I always support them, I always give them experience. But no, no, the players they're not connected to the situation. \"Even they support me so much, so there's just much love between us as players and respect.\"",

    "body": "Can you ban kids from social media? Australia is about to, but some teens are a step ahead13 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyBBC/Jessica HromasIsobel is convinced the social media ban won't stop kids like herIt took 13-year-old Isobel less than five minutes to outsmart Australia's \"world-leading\" social media ban for children.A notification from Snapchat, one of the ten platforms affected, had lit up her screen, warning she'd be booted off when the law kicked in this week – if she couldn't prove she was over 16.\"I got a photo of my mum, and I stuck it in front of the camera and it just let me through. It said thanks for verifying your age,\" Isobel claims. \"I've heard someone used Beyoncé's face,\" she adds.\"I texted her,\" she gestures to her mum Mel, \"and I was like, 'Hey Mummy, I got past the social media ban' and she was just like, 'Oh, you monkey'.\"It made her laugh, Mel explains: \"This is exactly what I thought was going to happen.\"Though she had let Isobel use TikTok and Snapchat with tight supervision – preferring that to the teenager using it covertly – she had been hoping the ban, as promised, would help parents like her protect their children from the dangers of the online world.That hope has now wavered, as a series of experts – and kids themselves – sound the alarm on the viability and safety of the landmark policy, which is being closely watched around the globe and eyed with trepidation by some of its most influential companies.There's concern about the reliability of the technology enforcing the ban, along with fears it could isolate vulnerable children and push others into darker, less-regulated corners of the web.The question nervously being asked in the halls of Canberra, in households across the nation, and in tech boardrooms around the world: is this actually going to work?'Parents are worried sick about the safety of kids online'You'd struggle to find anyone in Australia who feels social media companies are doing enough to shield users – particularly children – from harm on their platforms. Their protestations to the contrary fall on unsympathetic ears.\"We have zero faith the tech companies will do anything other than protect their profits,\" Dany Elachi, a father of five and anti-smartphone campaigner, tells the BBC.\"They've had ample opportunity to show they take children's wellbeing seriously and they've failed at every turn.\"Detailing how bullying – inescapable due to social media – had culminated in her 15-year-old daughter's suicide, Emma Mason asked world leaders at the UN last month: \"How many more Tillys must die?\"The pair were among the parents and public figures who lent their voices to a headline-grabbing national campaign calling for a new minimum age for social media.Some experts, including Australia's online safety tsar, warned banning children from social media was not the solution, but their concerns were swept away by a tide of parental passion and political pressure.EPAAlbanese has charged Communications Minister Anika Wells with the rolloutIn November 2024, the prime minister announced the legislation, promising parents and children wouldn't be penalised. It'd be up to the platforms to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure account-holders were at least 16 years old, or face fines of up to $49.5m (US$33m, £25m) for the most serious breaches.\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\" Anthony Albanese said.The policy – limited versions of which have been attempted with little success by other jurisdictions around the world – would help free children from addictive algorithms exposing them to harmful content like violence, pornography and misinformation, proponents said. It would also reduce cyber-bullying and online child exploitation. It would force kids outside, help them sleep better, improve their physical and mental health, it was suggested.Noticeably absent from Albanese's announcement was a plan on exactly how the government was going to do this – it gave itself a year to work that out.Within weeks, it had rushed a skeletal bill through parliament, after allowing less than 48 hours for the public to make submissions on the law.How will it be enforced?Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 secondsA year later, and days out from the official start of the law, questions remain.A government-funded, industry-run trial looked at the main methods of age assurance and earlier this year reported all were technically possible – but none were foolproof and all carried risks.Verification using IDs was the most accurate approach, but that requires users to hand over sensitive and important documents when polling shows most Australians don't trust social media firms.Age inference, which draws conclusions based on users' online activity, and facial assessment technology both lacked the precision to be reliably applied to teenagers.For example, the accuracy of face scans – already rolled out by Meta and Snapchat for suspected underage users – falters for people two to three years either side of 16; the intended target.Still, the report found age assurance technologies can be \"private, robust and effective\", especially when layered.\"When you go to a bottle shop and they look you up and down and go, 'Mmm not really sure', they ask you for some ID… It's the same principle,\" says Tony Allen, who heads the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme and ran the trial.Its findings weren't without controversy. Two former advisory board members levelled accusations of bias and \"privacy-washing\". And though the trial considered ways teenagers might bypass barriers, it was not tasked with testing them.Getty ImagesA facial scan is one of the age check methods offeredTips have flooded social media: everything from signing up with a parent's email and moving to platforms not explicitly named on the government's hit list, to using VPNs, which can disguise a user's location. There was a temporary surge in VPN use in the UK after it introduced tougher age checks for pornography earlier this year, and experts are expecting the same here.Polling conducted for the government in May indicated a third of parents intended to help their kids circumvent the ban, and an experiment by the University of Melbourne showed that a $22 Halloween mask was enough to defeat facial assessment technology in some cases.Proponents of age assurance contend that the technology to thwart circumvention exists. A photo, like Isobel says she used, is not supposed to fool these checks.The BBC asked Snapchat about this, and a spokesperson said the firm had consistently expressed concern about the \"technical challenges\" of enforcing the ban: \"This is one such challenge.\"\"It's a constant running battle to ensure that the mitigations are improving, literally on a daily basis,\" added Luc Delany, an executive for K-ID, which performs age assessments on Snapchat's behalf.BBC/Jessica HromasMel worries the ban has distracted from other meaningful online safety reformsIsobel, buoyed by her experience, says she's pretty sure the ban won't work.\"I'm not a screen addict… but I think Anthony Albanese's idea of us touching grass is stupid,\" she says, referring to the prime minister's comment about getting kids outside.\"If I do end up getting banned, I'll just find another app to use.\"That's up for discussion, Mel clarifies. But she and a host of others fear the platforms and the regulator are set for a relentless game of \"whack-a-mole\" – identifying and shutting down loophole after loophole, and listing emerging platforms only for kids to flock to another.The social media firms also have a motive to subtly undermine the policy, lest other countries follow suit, analysts say, and the vague \"reasonable steps\" outlined by the government leave the door ajar.\"They're going to try to drive a truck through [it],\" says Stephen Scheeler, who led Facebook in Australia and New Zealand between 2013 and 2017.\"It's like getting your kids to do something like load the dishwasher - they'll do it, but they won't do it well, and they won't do it with a smile on their face.\"The fines offer little incentive to behave, he says. Facebook, for example, earns that amount globally in under two hours. \"It's a parking ticket.\"Getty ImagesFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been accused by US Senators of putting profits over safetyThen there's the inevitable legal challenges. Two teenagers have already filed a case in the nation's highest court, alleging the law is unconstitutional and Orwellian. Alphabet, which owns YouTube and Google, is also apparently considering its own challenge. Human rights groups and a smattering of legal experts have raised their hackles too.While the government has insisted the social media companies have the money and the technology to make the ban happen, it has at the same time sought to manage expectations.\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through. Big reforms always do,\" Communications Minister Anika Wells has said.The key question is not can children get around it, Mr Allen says; that answer is yes. But will enough of them be bothered to?\"To be a successful policy, it doesn't have to get to a point where 100% of children aren't on social media,\" he says. \"It only really has to get about 80% of them and the rest will follow.\"Some exasperated parents just want to be able to say it is illegal. They don't want their kids to feel entitled – or pressured – to access social media.\"We've always said, whether the law was enforceable or not, our main aim in all of this was to establish a new social norm,\" Mr Elachi says.Will it reduce harm?Putting aside the question of whether it can be done, many are still asking: should it?First, there is concern that this policy pushes children into darker parts of the web.Will it be gaming site chatrooms, which the Australia Federal Police have warned are hotbeds for radicalisation but are excluded from the ban?Will it be sites like Omegle, which previous generations turned to when told they were too young for mainstream social media? It allowed users to video chat randomly selected strangers and was shut down two years ago over its failure to protect minors from predators. Copycats have quickly replaced it.Children can also still browse on several of the apps, like TikTok and YouTube, without accounts, a potentially riskier minefield of unfiltered content and advertisements - several platforms currently limit these on minors' accounts. \"This law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,\" a spokesperson for the company said this week.There's plenty of criticism of big tech over moderation, but few dispute that these large platforms do it better than their smaller peers. Facebook, for example, has systems which set off alarms bells if an adult is messaging a child frequently.\"You're not stopping behaviour, you're just moving that behaviour to other platforms,\" says Tim Levy, head of online safety company Qoria and one of the trial advisers who quit. \"Telling the concerned Australian parents that it's all good now is a very dangerous message.\"The science on social media and health is complex and still evolving too. Alongside the studies linking it to poor outcomes is also evidence it can be a lifeline for some children, particularly for those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities.\"We've heard very little officially about what is being done to address the unmet needs of these more vulnerable children who for positive reasons have sought help or a sense of belonging and connection online,\" former children's commissioner Anne Hollonds tells the BBC.Her term finished just a few weeks ago, but Ms Hollonds has spent years lobbying the government on greater online guard-rails for kids and was surprised, frustrated even, to learn this \"blunt\" tool was the one they've chosen.What could be achieved if this regulatory effort and attention was used to pull other levers, she wonders.Many have suggested the focus should be on forcing socials to better police harmful content and limit the power of algorithms, while also preparing children for the reality of life on the web.More than 140 leading Australian and international experts signed an open letter raising these concerns, among others, before the legislation passed.\"There's nothing magical about the age of 16,\" Ms Hollonds says. \"[This] really does nothing on its own.\"Getty ImagesAustralia's top eSafety official (right) once advocated against a banBefore her agency was officially charged with implementing this policy, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant made similar arguments.\"We do not fence the ocean or keep children entirely out of the water, but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,\" she said in June last year.To that, Minister Wells counters: \"We can police the sharks\" – a biting reference to social media firms.Many of the critics are right about the challenges ahead, she told the BBC. But this is just a starting point – a digital duty of care, a legal obligation that firms prevent foreseeable harm to their users, is next on her list.\"For every person that says to me, 'Why haven't you included these big elements?', someone else is saying to me, 'It is impossible for you to do what you've even set out to do now'.\"\"This isn't a cure. It's a treatment plan, and treatment plans will always evolve.\"\"This is, at the end of the day, work to try and save a generation. It's worth doing.\"",

The greeting inside reads \"Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year\".The King - standing on the left - is wearing a dark blue suit and grey tie, while the Queen is wearing a white and beige coat dress.This photograph is their fourth Christmas card since Charles became King.The image, captured by photographer Chris Jackson, was taken in the grounds of the Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence in Rome.It was taken to mark the King and Queen's 20th wedding anniversary.The Queen is also wearing a lily of the valley brooch, a symbol of enduring love.This year's photograph, like last year's, is a more informal picture than the one chosen for Christmas 2023.Last year's picture was captured by Millie Pilkington, and was taken as the King returned to public duties following his cancer diagnosis and treatment.The couple were pictured smiling in the garden of Buckingham Palace on what appeared to be a sunny day.In 2023, the King and Queen chose a photograph of themselves in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace following the coronation.Christmas images used to decorate official festive cards are regularly released by senior members of the Royal Family.It will take the royal couple several days to personally sign all the cards, which will be sent to people across the globe including family, friends, world leaders and organisations.",

    "body": "4 hours agoVikas Pandey,GoaandHarry SekulichTwenty five people have been killed in a fire at a popular nightclub in the coastal region of Goa, India, local officials say.The majority of victims are believed to be staff at the club in Arpora, North Goa, while tourists are also among the dead. Police believe a gas cylinder exploded in the club's kitchen, causing a blaze to rip through the venue on Saturday at midnight local time.On Sunday morning, officials said the death toll had risen from an earlier figure of 23. Six more people are in a stable condition in hospital.The BBC has spoken to witnesses at the scene who described scenes of panic in the bustling nightlife area.\"The fire was mainly concentrated around the kitchen area on the ground floor,\" said Alok Kumar, Goa's Director General of Police.\"The fire occurred around midnight. It has now been brought under control.\"Most of the bodies were found around the kitchen \"suggesting that the victims were employed at the club,\" Mr Alok Kumar added.Goa's chief minister Pramod Sawant told journalists three people died from burn injuries, while others died by suffocating.He said \"three to four\" tourists had died but did not provide their ages or nationalities. The Indian Express reports the fire broke out at a club called Birch by Romeo Lane at Baga, located at the one of the coastal region's most popular beaches.The area where the fire occurred is lined with similar nightlife hotspots, where tourists and partygoers can be seen pouring out of the bustling clubs.A chef who works at a nearby venue told the BBC he knew some of the workers at the Birch club.\"People from all over the country and also from Nepal work in different clubs in Goa,\" he said.\"I am really worried for some people who I knew at the club. Their phones are off.\"Rescue efforts were still ongoing in the early hours of Sunday morning. Crews were combing through the charred wreckage to determine the cause of the blaze.A heavy security presence remained at the scene on Sunday morning, with the doors to the nightclub shut and no one allowed inside.The BBC saw what appeared to be charred and melted remains of chairs, tables and plants in one corner of the club.One eyewitness said that it was a usual Saturday night and holidaymakers were enjoying themselves.He said: \"I was outside the club when I heard screams, I didn't initially understand what was going on. \"In a bit, it became clear that a massive fire had broken out. Nobody could do much. The scenes were just horrific.\"Rescue workers have taken the bodies of the victims to Goa Medical College in Panaji.One of the firefighters at the scene told the BBC they are still identifying the victims and will then notify their families.A formal inquiry into the cause of the fire has been launched, the chief minister said.\"Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly,\" Dr Sawant said.\"I am deeply grieved and offer my heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved families in this hour of unimaginable loss.\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Goa fire \"deeply saddening\" in a post on social media.Goa is former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.About 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of the year, government data showed, with 270,000 visiting from abroad.India has seen a number of deadly fires at entertainment venues in recent years.A fire at a three-storey building killed 17 in the southern city of Hyderabad in May, while a hotel blaze in north-east Kolkata left 15 dead a month earlier.Last year, 24 died at an amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat after visitors were trapped inside due to the collapse of a temporary structure at the entrance. An official review later found poor safety standards contributed to a higher death toll.",

    "body": "4 days agoIndy Almroth-WrightSouth of EnglandOpus ConservationWorking on scaffolding inside the Great Hall to access the paintings art restorers started finding names and datesConservators restoring paintings at Blenheim Palace are hoping to track down workmen or their relatives who left their names in the ceiling area decades ago.About 11 names have been found scribbled high up in the Great Hall of the stately home in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, by art restorers working on the paintings.The team, who thought they were the first people for centuries to access the ceilings, said they were \"amazed\" after they started finding names and dates doodled on the ceiling area as they worked about 67ft (20m) up.Among those who left their mark are a group believed to have worked on the coving in 1968 and the earliest, a plasterer, T Harwood whose signature is dated 1843. Opus ConservationThe palace is hoping to link people whose parents or grandparents may have scribbled their names on the ceiling during previous workThe palace wants to hear from anyone who can help link the names with previous work on the ceilings.Lizzie Woolley, director of Opus Conservation, said: \"We were excited to discover these pieces of graffiti. We didn't have any documentary evidence of previous work to the Great Hall and Saloon and these are a tantalising clue as to what was done, and when. \"It would be brilliant to solve the mystery of who these people were, and what they were doing in the Great Hall.\"Amongst the scribbles and scratched names are:F. R. Rambone, 292 Abingdon Rd, Oxford, 10 February 1931G T Higgs 1921 Oxford, who is thought to have varnished windowsT Riley 2011J F Brennan 1968J.

    "body": "15 hours agoEmma RossiterTake Back PowerFour people have been arrested after custard and apple crumble were flung at a display case containing part of the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.Police were called shortly before 10:00 GMT on Saturday after the case containing the Imperial State Crown - which is typically worn by the King at formal ceremonies - was defaced.The Metropolitan Police said four people had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. The Tower's Jewel House was temporarily closed to the public while the police investigated.Take Back Power - which appears to be an offshoot of Just Stop Oil and which describes itself as a new non-violent civil resistance group - has claimed it was behind the incident.The group said it carried out the stunt to demand the UK government establishes a permanent citizen's assembly, or \"House of the People\", with the power to \"tax extreme wealth and fix Britain\".Policing minister Sarah Jones said that the incident was \"disgraceful\", adding: \"There is a clear difference between the democratic right to protest and unacceptable behaviour.\"Footage shared by Take Back Power on social media showed one protester removing a large foil tray of crumble from a bag before slamming it against the glass protecting the Imperial State Crown.Another then poured a tub of bright yellow custard on the front of the case.\"Democracy has crumbled,\" one protester could be heard shouting. Another added: \"Britain is broken. We've come here to the jewels of the nation to take back power.\"Meanwhile, surprised tourists could be seen reacting to the stunt.Historic Royal Palaces confirmed that the Imperial State Crown was not damaged.The Jewel House reopened to the public early in the afternoon.This is the second demonstration claimed by the group in the past few days.On Wednesday, three protesters emptied bags of manure onto the floor of the Ritz hotel lobby under its 25ft Christmas tree.Take Back Power has emerged in recent weeks on social media channels used by Just Stop Oil activists. The environmental protest group refers to Take Back Power as a \"new project\".Just Stop Oil - responsible for a number of high-profile protests including throwing soup on Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers and climbing onto motorway gantries - announced it was ending its use of direct action in March.The Imperial State Crown is a famous symbol of the monarchy and was worn by King Charles III as he left Westminster Abbey on his coronation day in 2023.Beyond coronations, the priceless working crown is only used during formal occasions, such as the State Opening of Parliament.When it is not being used, it is kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.It was originally made in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI and contains 2,868 diamonds, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, four rubies and 269 pearls and weighs over a kilogram.",

    "body": "Russia continued its air strikes on Ukraine overnight, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a \"very constructive\" phone call with Donald Trump's negotiating team following three days of talks in Florida.Early on Sunday the mayor of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in central Ukraine, said the city had been repeatedly struck in a \"massive\" attack. No deaths have been confirmed so far.Meanwhile, Russia said it had shot down 77 Ukrainian drones in several locations.Aerial assaults have continued even as efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified, including detailed Ukraine-US talks in Miami aimed at drafting a peace settlement acceptable to both sides.On Saturday, Zelensky said he was \"determined\" to continue working with the US after speaking to Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the conclusion of those negotiations. Zelensky said they had discussed how to ensure that Russia stuck to any potential deal to end the war.Hours later, Kremenchuk Mayor Vitaliy Maletsk said his city had sustained a \"massive combined strike\" on its infrastructure. The extent of the damage was unclear as of Sunday morning but the mayor said water, electricity and heat had been cut off for some.The city, which is roughly halfway between Kyiv and the frontline in the east, has been repeatedly targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The White House has pushed Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a multi-point plan to end the war but there has been little sign of a breakthrough, despite both sides engaging with the US-led process.\"Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,\" Zelensky said on X. \"We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full scale invasion.\"The Russian strikes in the early hours of Sunday followed a wider attack 24 hours earlier, which drew condemnation from Kyiv's European allies.In a social media post, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken to Zelensky and offered his \"full solidarity\". \"France is determined to work with all partners to secure de-escalation measures and to impose a ceasefire,\" Macron added. Macron, Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are due to hold in-person talks in London on Monday.Europe has pushed back against early versions of the US-led peace plan and has sought to win support from the White House for its own proposals, including comprehensive security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, including the possibility of a peacekeeping force.Sir Keir has led the push for a so-called coalition of the willing, a loose collection of Ukrainian allies who are committed to continuing to underwrite Kyiv's defence in the event of a ceasefire to deter a second invasion. He has called that proposal \"vital\" for Ukraine's long-term security.Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the idea of such a force saying any troops deployed to Ukraine would be \"legitimate targets\".Also on Saturday, US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\".The joint statement was issued days after Witkoff returned from talks with Putin at the Kremlin which failed to produce a breakthrough.Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, newly installed as Zelensky's most senior negotiator, said they had \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\".",

    "body": "An accusation by senior barristers that Justice Secretary David Lammy has \"misrepresented\" figures about the collapse of rape cases is the lead in the Sunday Times. It has claimed he did this in order to push through the abolition of some jury trials in England and Wales. The paper reports that the Lammy suggested 60% of victims are pulling out of cases because of delays in the court system. But the paper quotes two barristers who say the true statistics show the vast majority of reported rape claims are abandoned before a charge is even brought. The Ministry of Justice said the lawyers' comments were \"completely misleading\".The Sunday Telegraph claims Labour's biggest union backer, Unite, is considering a vote on whether to split from the party. It reports that senior union officials are in talks about whether to call an emergency conference to vote on formal disafiliation from the party. But a source from Unite has told the BBC that such a conference will not take place.A full page photo of Sir Keir Starmer splashes the front page of the Observer. In an interview with the paper, the prime minister insists he will fight on in the role, predicts that the former Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, will return to the cabinet, and attacks Reform UK and the Green Party.The Sunday Mirror leads with details from a new Covid report which it says show that schemes developed by Boris Johnson's government cost the taxpayer £10.9bn in fraud. The paper reports that furlough handouts, bounce back loans and the Eat Out to Help Out scheme were easily abused by scammers.The Sunday Express leads with claims that dozens of foreign nationals - who are deemed a threat to national security - face constant monitoring because human rights laws prevent them from being deported. The paper says there are fresh calls for the UK to \"overhaul\" these laws and leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Border Security and Asylum minister Alex Norris told the Express new laws were coming.The Duchess of Sussex's father, Thomas Markle, has told the Mail on Sunday that he still hasn't heard from his daughter as he recovers in hospital after reportedly having his left leg amputated below the knee. Mr Markle tells the paper he wants to see Meghan \"one last time before he dies\".",

    "body": "Young people on benefits will be offered job opportunities in industries such as construction and hospitality in a bid to tackle rising youth unemployment.The government will fund 350,000 training and work experience placements, and will guarantee 55,000 jobs in areas it says are in the highest need from spring 2026.Funding will come from the £820m announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in the Budget last month to finance a raft of measures aimed at getting young people off Universal Credit and into work.Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the plans would help out-of-work young people \"make something of their lives\". But the Tories blamed the Budget for driving youth unemployment up.The number of 16-24-year-olds not in employment, education or training - known as Neets - has been trending upwards since 2021, with the latest figures showing nearly a million young people are now not earning or learning.The government had already announced in September that it intended to provide guaranteed work placements for 18-21-year-olds who had been out of work or education for longer than 18 months, with those not taking up the offer without good reason facing losing their benefits.The new training and work experience opportunities for young people on Universal Credit will be in sectors including construction, hospitality, and health and social care, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced on Saturday.It said that the government-backed jobs will not necessarily be in the same sectors, but that they would be in the following regions: Birmingham and Solihullthe East MidlandsGreater ManchesterHertfordshire and EssexCentral and eastern ScotlandSouth-west and south-eastern WalesThe government says that 900,000 young people in total who are on Universal Credit and are looking for work will be given a \"dedicated work support session\", followed by four additional weeks of \"intensive support\".An employment coach will then refer them to one of six pathways: work, work experience, apprenticeship, wider training, learning, or a workplace training programme with a guaranteed interview.The government expects more than 1,000 young people to start a job in the first six months of the scheme.\"Every young person deserves a fair chance to succeed. When given the right support and opportunities, they will grasp them,\" McFadden said. He described the funding as \"a downpayment on young people's future\".But shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately criticised other measures announced in the Budget, saying: \"The Chancellor's tax hikes are driving up youth unemployment, snatching a career from a generation of young people.\"She added: \"This scheme is nothing more than taking with one hand to give with the other.\"Further plans are expected to be set out in the coming week as the government prepares to publish its national youth strategy.Reeves previously announced that the government would be funding a scheme to make apprenticeship training for under-25s at small and medium businesses \"completely free\".There were 946,000 young people who were Neet in the UK in the three months to September - equivalent to 12.7% of all people aged 16-24.A quarter cite long-term sickness or disability as a barrier to work or education, while the number claiming health and disability benefits is also on the rise.The government announced last month that it was launching an independent review into the rising number of young people not working or studying.

    "body": "17 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, BethlehemWatch: Bethlehem Christmas tree lights up for first time since Gaza warFor two years during the Gaza war, all public celebrations for Christmas were cancelled in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank – where Christians believe Jesus was born.But after the recent ceasefire, the holy city decided that this year the festivities would return as symbolised by the lighting of its traditional, giant Christmas tree in front of the historic Nativity Church.\"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work,\" says Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati. \"We're all living here from tourism and tourism was down to zero.\"The mayor accepts that the idea of resuming celebrations was not without controversy, as suffering continues in Gaza – including for those in its tiny Christian community, many of whom have relatives in Bethlehem.\"Some may say it's not appropriate and others say it's appropriate,\" Mr Canawati tells me. \"But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us.\"Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to BethlehemOne tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare systemAlaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurantThe grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.",

    "body": "2 hours agoTessa WongSingaporeGetty ImagesHongkongers are mourning the worst blaze the city has seen in more than 70 yearsHongkongers are voting in an election seen as a test of public sentiment following a deadly fire that angered some in the city.The government has mounted a huge campaign to encourage Hongkongers to choose members of the Legislative Council (LegCo). All of the candidates have been vetted to ensure they are loyal to China.The election takes place as many are mourning the Tai Po fire last month which killed nearly 160 people.In recent days, authorities have distributed aid to survivors, arrested suspects and sought to improve building safety, as some Hongkongers raise questions about the incident.A total of 161 candidates are competing for 90 seats in the LegCo, which acts as a mini parliament and can make and amend laws.The election is the second since 2021 when China made sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system to ensure only \"patriots\" could run for seats. Beijing has said the changes, which were put in place shortly after the 2019 protests, were necessary to ensure stability in Hong Kong, but critics say they weakened democracy.The last poll, which took place shortly after those changes, saw its lowest-ever turnout of 30% amid widespread voter apathy.This year, the government has blanketed the city with posters urging Hongkongers to head to the polls, while dangling freebies and shopping discounts.After casting their vote, each person will receive a \"thank you card\" that could be redeemed for vouchers in selected shops and restaurants, or for beauty services, medical check-ups and insurance policy premiums.Authorities are also offering free entry to public swimming pools and museums on the polling day, organising carnivals in various neighbourhoods, and holding a televised variety show and gala. They have also created cartoon mascots and a theme tune for the election, adapted from a 2001 hit song by Cantopop star Aaron Kwok, called \"Let's Vote, Together We Create The Future\".Chief Secretary Eric Chan told reporters last month that the measures were aimed at ensuring \"a happy and festive mood\" and to \"let residents recognise the importance of the election\".VCG via Getty ImagesThe Hong Kong government has launched a campaign urging residents to voteBut in recent days the city has been focusing on the 26 November fire that engulfed high-rise residential blocks at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po.The blaze was the worst seen in Hong Kong in more than 70 years. The death toll, which currently stands at 159, is likely to rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.As Hong Kong mourns its dead, some are asking whether the fire could have been prevented and questioning building safety standards. Many Hongkongers live in ageing high-rise buildings similar to Wang Fuk Court.Authorities have since ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of the fire, and have arrested 13 people for suspected manslaughter. They have also ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh used in all building renovations across the city. Investigators have found that a scaffolding mesh used for renovations in Wang Fuk Court failed to meet flame retardant standards, and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings.Authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent. Police have reportedly detained a man, who was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry, for suspected sedition on Saturday. The petition was also wiped from the Internet.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police.Political campaigning for the LegCo election was immediately suspended following the fire, though government-organised debate forums resumed after a few days. Carnivals organised for the election campaign have also been cancelled.Hong Kong chief executive John Lee has insisted the LegCo election continue as planned as \"we must move forward before we can turn our grief into strength\".He said that the new legislators would be able to quickly support reconstruction and reforms.John P Burns, emeritus professor and Chinese politics expert with the University of Hong Kong, said he believed the government would interpret a high turnout as a sign that voters perceive Hong Kong's reshaped political system as \"relatively legitimate\".But he expected the numbers to be low, in part due to the Tai Po fire.He pointed out that most Hongkongers have traditionally supported the pan-democrat opposition - which have been effectively barred from taking part. \"I think they won't be convinced to participate this time, just as they mostly stayed away in 2021,\" he said.Mobilising the pro-establishment voters following the fire would be difficult for the government as well, he added.Some in that camp will be impressed by how authorities have speedily re-housed those made homeless in the fire and the aid authorities have provided, \"which by any measure has been rapid and relatively generous\", noted Prof Burns.But others \"may stay away from the polls\" as they are \"disappointed, even angry, by the governance problems the fire has exposed\", he said.Hong Kong's national security office this week reposted a commentary from a pro-Beijing news outlet that urged residents to vote to show support for government's reconstruction efforts.\"Building a good future together starts with this vote. If you truly love Hong Kong, you should sincerely vote,\" the commentary said.VCG via Getty ImagesHong Kong has been blanketed with posters for the Legco electionThis year's LegCo election will feature a number of new faces with about a quarter of the incumbent lawmakers stepping down.Local media have reported that Beijing pressured several lawmakers to retire as they have unofficially set an age limit. A number of those stepping down are aged above 70, including the prominent politician Regina Ip, a former security chief nicknamed the \"Iron Lady\". ",

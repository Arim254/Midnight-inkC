    "body": "14 minutes agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday, in his insistence that the US needs Greenland for national security reasons. Is he prepared to use force to seize it, journalists asked him? \"No comment,\" said the president, sending chills down the spine of Greenland's anxious inhabitants. Again.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato. President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums. Especially those reliant on exporting to the US, like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said, \"we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed\" after an emergency meeting with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The Met Office said \"severe geomagnetic storms\" were observed, producing \"widespread auroras visible across the UK, with reports extending as far south as northern Italy\". The activity is expected to decline but may still be visible in parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland on Tuesday, it added. The Met Office said the aurora was the result of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) - when the Sun emits really large clouds of particles.Colours are then produced when those particles hit oxygen and nitrogen gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.Denise CaseyGreen skies above Prestatyn, North Walesdani_photography83/BBC Weather WatchersA pink haze frames an overturned ship in Pin Mill, Suffolk GDW/BBC Weather WatchersA scarlet, pink and green-toned sky in Dartington, DevonSkywatcher/BBC Weather WatchersBeams of green and pink light illuminate Haddington in East Lothian, ScotlandGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "9 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesSir David and Lady Victoria Beckham have not publicly acknowledged the much-rumoured rift with their eldest son and his wife NicolaBrooklyn Peltz Beckham has said he does not want to \"reconcile\" with his family - in his first public comments addressing reports about his relationship with his parents.In a series of posts on Instagram, the eldest child of Sir David Beckham and Lady Beckham accused his parents of \"attacking\" him and his wife in the press, saying they tried \"endlessly to ruin\" his relationship with Nicola Peltz Beckham.After months of speculation about a feud in the high-profile family, he said he had tried to keep the situation private but was left with \"no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth\".The BBC has contacted Sir David's and Lady Beckham's representatives for comment. The pair have never acknowledged the rift.\"I have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,\" the 26-year-old wrote in a series of posts to his 16 million followers.\"Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.\"I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.\"He added: \"Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.\"Much of the statement focused on his relationship with his wife - an American actress and the daughter of billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz - whom he said had been \"consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one\".He accused his parents of trying to derail their wedding, claiming his fashion designer mother had \"cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress\".Reports emerged at the time that Nicola, now 31, had refused to wear one of Lady Beckham's designs. She later told the Times that her mother-in-law had realised her atelier could not finish it in time, denying speculation that there was a feud.He also accused Lady Beckham of \"hijacking\" their first dance - claiming that when he was called to the stage, \"my mum was waiting to dance with me\" instead of his wife and \"danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone\".He said they renewed their vows in 2025 to create new memories \"that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment\".Peltz Beckham also alleged that his parents had \"repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name\" weeks before the ceremony. It is not clear to which rights he is referring.He said he had refrained from agreeing to do so - which \"affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since\".Getty ImagesThe pair joined the rest of the family at the premier of their Netflix documentary, Beckham, in October 2023He also addressed another incident which had fuelled speculation about the rift: the couple's absence from Sir David's 50th birthday party in May.Peltz Beckham said he and his wife had travelled to London for Sir David's birthday but were \"rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him\".\"He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner,\" the influencer wrote.He said his father \"finally agreed\" to meet him but on the condition that his wife was not present, which he called a \"slap in the face\", adding that his family then refused to see him on a subsequent trip to Los Angeles.At the time, a source told the BBC that the 26-year-old had chosen not to go to the party as his younger brother Romeo was attending with a woman to whom he had previously been linked.The influencer's post alleged that his mother had \"repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable\".The eldest son criticised his family for valuing \"public promotion and endorsements above all else\".\"Brand Beckham comes first,\" he wrote, adding that \"family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media\".He said: \"I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared\".Peltz Beckham said he had been subject to \"endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders\".He added that his younger brothers had also been \"sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last summer\".Cruz Beckham, 20, said in December that their parents would \"never unfollow their son,\" in response to a Daily Mail story claiming they had done so.\"Not true. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son. Let's get the facts right,\" he wrote on Instagram.\"They woke up blocked as I did.\" Ex-England football captain Sir David and former Spice Girl Lady Beckham have two other sons and a daughter - Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper Seven, 14.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Spain to hold three days of mourning for victims of high-speed train crash3 hours agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsWatch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced three days of national mourning for victims of a high-speed train crash that killed at least 40 people. Sanchez also promised to get to the bottom of why the two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, as rescuers continue to search the wreckage.More than 120 more people were injured as carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.The crash is the worst the country has seen in more than a decade.Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, according to Transport Minister Óscar Puente. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Sanchez visited the site of the crash with senior officials on Monday afternoon.\"This is a day of sorrow for all of Spain, for our entire country,\" he told reporters.\"We are going to get to the truth, we are going to find the answer, and when that answer about the origin and cause of this tragedy is known, as it could not be otherwise, with absolute transparency and absolute clarity, we will make it public.\"Puente said an investigation could take at least a month, describing the incident as \"extremely strange\".ReutersRescuers are still searching the wreckage at the crash siteEPAPedro Sánchez travelled to Spain to pay tribute to the people killedBut Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed source briefed on initial investigations as saying experts had found a faulty joint on the rails, which was causing a gap between rail sections to widen as trains travelled over it. They added that the joint was key to identifying the cause of the accident.Spain's El País newspaper said it was not clear whether the fault was a cause or a result of the crash.Four hundred passengers and staff were on board the two trains, the rail authorities said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 41, including children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care.Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\". Officials are working to identify the dead.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\".\"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"All high-speed services between Madrid and the southern cities of Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla and Huelva have been suspended until Friday.Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuate from crashKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\" and offered their \"most heartfelt condolences\". The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "7 hours agoHelen Briggs,Environment correspondentandGwyndaf Hughes,Science videographerWatch: hedgehogs have been busy in our gardens at nightBritish gardens matter more than ever for hedgehogs, according to a study of the secret night life of the spiny mammals.Scientists gave householders wildlife cameras to spy on hedgehogs in more than 400 gardens in Chester in one of the largest studies of its kind.The animals turned up in more than half of gardens studied, with food a powerful attraction.As numbers fall, scientists say these night-time visits could hold vital clues to the nocturnal mammal's survival.A rescued hedgehog recovers in a field hospital in South WalesHedgehogs are listed as vulnerable to extinction in the UK, with populations falling, particularly in rural areas, due to habitat loss, intensive farming and death on roads.Lead researcher, Kelly Hitchcock, of Nottingham Trent University and Chester Zoo, said: \"The pattern that we've seen is that hedgehog populations in rural areas have declined – gardens seem like a really important habitat – so it's really important that people are aware of that.\"The researchers analysed thousands of images from 415 gardens, alongside each garden's specific characteristics, to examine how often hedgehogs were detected and which features most influenced them stopping by.Leaving food out was the biggest factor, but the experts say providing wildlife friendly features is essential too as hedgehogs struggle to find space to hibernate and breed.These include patches of wildflowers, native plants, leaf litter and log piles, and holes in fences so hedgehogs can roam over large areas.If you are providing wildlife food, be mindful of what that food is and whether it's suitable for hedgehogs, said Hitchcock. \"It's not that we want to say everybody feed hedgehogs because we don't know the long-term impacts,\" she added.Chester Zoo/Nottingham Trent UniversityNumbers of hedgehogs have fallen by up to 30% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas since 2000The study comes as increasing numbers of hedgehogs need help from rescue charities as they lose their natural habitats.Any hedgehog out in the day is a cause for concern – as are hedgehogs seen limping or injured, said Sarah Liney of the charity, Hedgehog Helpline, in South Wales.\"If we can release a healthy hedgehog back into the wild, to be the hedgehog it is supposed to be, and it can produce or help to produce more litters then at least that is going to help with the hedgehog population to continue for years to come within our country,\" she said.Chester Zoo/Nottingham Trent UniversityHedgehogs roam side by side with foxes in our gardensConservation biologist, Dr Rebecca Thomas, of Royal Holloway, University of London, who is not connected with the study, said gardens are increasingly becoming important habitats for hedgehogs as numbers fall in the countryside.\"The best thing people can do for hedgehogs in gardens is to create wild spaces for them - areas where they can over-winter, mate, live happily, and hopefully we can keep the populations going in these suburban environments,\" she said.And if you do choose to feed hedgehogs use appropriate food, such as cat biscuits, and practice good hygiene, she said.\"In the wild hedgehogs wouldn't come together too much... and obviously hedgehogs don't need anything else affecting their populations through the spread of disease.\" The research is published in the journal Urban Ecosystems.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoDearbail Jordan & Jemma CrewWage growth in the UK eased to 4.5% between September and November, official figures suggest, following a sharp slowdown in private sector pay increases.The pace of pay growth for those employed by private businesses slowed to the lowest rate in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).In contrast, public sector workers saw their wages jump but, the ONS said, this was likely due to pay rises being awarded earlier than in the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of people on company payrolls continued to fall - down 135,000 in the three months to November - with a particular decline in shops and hospitality.This was despite the economy heading for the key Christmas season when companies traditionally hire more pub and shop workers.Average wages, excluding bonuses, slowed from a 4.6% rise recorded between August and October. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said easing pay growth was \"really encouraging\" for increasing the likelihood of future interest rate cuts.\"I know this sounds odd when we say lower pay growth is a good thing,\" Raja told the BBC's Today programme. \"But for a Bank of England that's trying to control inflation…that is good.\"It allows the Bank to be more comfortable with the future path in terms of inflation getting back to that 2% target.\"Inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - hit 3.2% in November, down from 3.4%. The ONS will release data for December on Wednesday. Higher pay growth typically drives inflation because consumers demand more goods and services and can pay more for them. The Bank of England uses higher interest rates to counter this, but can cut them when there is less demand in the economy.Since August 2024, the Bank of England has cut interest rates six times, more recently in December when borrowing costs were trimmed from 4% to 3.75%.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBrooklyn Peltz Beckham's statement addressing his strained relationship with his parents features prominently on Tuesday's front pages. \"Brooklyn goes nuclear\" says the Daily Mail as it quotes the eldest son of Sir David Beckham and Lady Victoria Beckham, accusing his parents of being \"controlling\" and putting their family brand first. The Sun carries the same headline as the Mail, providing more details from the six-page Instagram statement from Peltz Beckham saying he has no wish to reconcile with his family.\"Brooklyn blasts Posh and Becks\" is the Daily Star's take. Elsewhere, the paper pays tribute to legendary Italian fashion designer Valentino who has died aged 93.The i Paper reports that Nato insiders are warning that Donald Trump's ambition to annex Greenland is \"destroying trust\" and \"tearing apart longstanding agreements\". The headline suggests that UK and US relations is at its \"lowest ebb\" since the 1956 Suez crisis.Staying with Donald Trump, the Guardian reports the US president has linked his threats to seize control of Greenland to his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize. In a text message sent to Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre on Sunday, Trump said he no longer felt the need to think \"purely of peace\" after being snubbed for the award, the paper says. In the top picture spot is Prince Harry arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice in London for the trial against the Daily Mail for alleged unlawful information gathering.The Metro focuses on the response from Norway's prime minister, saying he has repeatedly tried to explain to Donald Trump that he was not purposely snubbed for the award. \"A prize idiot\" is the headline. The Times follows with reports that Trump has refused to rule out military action to seize Greenland despite intense opposition from European allies. The US leader is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday where the paper says he is likely to face some \"tense encounters\" with Nato allies.\"Trump maintains Greenland seizure threat\" echoes the Financial Times. It features responses from Nato allies, with Denmark bolstering its military troops and Germany saying \"we will not be blackmailed\".In news closer to home, the Daily Telegraph's lead story reports the government confirmation that it is consulting on plans for an Australian-style social media ban for teenagers under 16 in the UK. The paper says the final decision is expected to be made in the summer. The story also gets a mention on a number of other front pages.Finally, the Daily Express fills its front page with a photo of four nurses, who have  spoken to the paper after they complained about a transgender woman using their changing room at a hospital - leading to an employment tribunal ruling in their favour. The possibility of a social media ban for under-16s in the UK makes many of the front pages. The Daily Mail says the government has begun the consultation to \"see off another backbench rebellion\". According to the Daily Telegraph, more than 60 Labour MPs want the prime minister follow Australia's model of a ban for under-16s. The editorial in the Times says such restrictions are \"worth examining\". But writing in the same paper, the online safety campaigner, Ian Russell, says a ban is \"flawed\". He points out that \"vulnerable children use social media for connection, peer support and trusted advice\".The i paper declares that the UK and US relationship is at its lowest ebb since the 1956 Suez Crisis.  The paper says that Donald Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland is \"destroying trust\" on both sides of the Atlantic. The Times suggests that a \"potential route for de-escalation\" has emerged.  It highlights a claim that Trump told the prime minister that he may have been misinformed about the true purpose of a European and British military deployment to Greenland.\"Brooklyn's bombshell\" is how the Daily Mirror describes the attack on Sir David and Lady Victoria Beckham by their eldest son. The Daily Mail and the Sun both say Brooklyn Peltz Beckham has gone \"nuclear\", having accused his parents of \"trying endlessly\" to ruin his marriage. The Daily Star declares there is now \"no way Beck\".The head of one of the UK's leading cinema companies has told the Guardian that directors should make shorter films if they want their work on the big screen. The paper says steadily lengthening runtimes  are causing \"substantial scheduling problems\". Clare Binns from Picturehouse Cinemas says what's happening should be a \"wake-up call\" to directors because you only get one evening show per screen.\"The king of haute couture\" is how the Daily Telegraph remembers the fashion designer, Valentino, following his death at the age of 93. The Times describes his style as staying faithful to a \"specifically Italian ideal of womanhood\". It says while his critics believed modern women no longer wished to be \"packaged as a gift for a man\", Valentino found many who wanted nothing more than to be fairy tale princesses, wrapped in bows and adored without question.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "10 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe government will consult on whether social media should be banned for under-16s in the UK.It said \"immediate action\" would give Ofsted the power to check policies on phone use when it inspects schools, and it expected schools to be \"phone-free by default\" as a result of the announcement.A similar ban took effect in Australia in December 2025, the first of its kind in the world. Other countries are said to be considering such a law.It comes after more than 60 Labour MPs wrote to the prime minister about the issue, with the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey also calling on the government to act.\"Some argue that vulnerable children need access to social media to find their community,\" Brianna's mother Esther Ghey wrote in a letter seen by the BBC. \"As the parent of an extremely vulnerable and trans child, I strongly disagree. \"In Brianna's case, social media limited her ability to engage in real-world social interactions. She had real friends, but she chose to live online instead.\"According to The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology, the consultation will \"seek views from parents, young people and civil society\" to determine the effectiveness of a ban.It would also look at whether more robust age checks could be implemented by social media firms, which could be forced to remove or limit features \"which drive compulsive use of social media\".And Ofsted will give tougher guidance to schools to reduce phone use - including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.The government will respond to the consultation in the summer.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the laws in the Online Safety Act were \"never meant to be the end point\" and said she understood \"parents still have serious concerns\".\"We are determined to ensure technology enriches children's lives, not harms them - and to give every child the childhood they deserve,\" she said.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has already said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it was in power.She said the consultation was \"more dither and delay\" from Labour.\"The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,\" she said. Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said there was \"no time to waste in protecting our children from social media giants\" and \"this consultation risks kicking the can down the road yet again\".National Education Union (NEU) general secretary Daniel Kebede called the move a \"welcome shift\". \"Every day, parents and teachers see how social media shapes children's identities and attention long before they sit their GCSEs, pulling them into isolating, endless loops of content,\" he said.Getty ImagesThe Association of School and College Leaders also welcomed the consultation on social media, but said the government had been \"sluggish\" in responding to the online risks posed to children.The union's general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio said there was \"clearly a much wider problem of children and young people spending far too much time on screens and being exposed to inappropriate content\".And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, also welcomed the plans to consult on a potential social media ban.But he said the suggestion that Ofsted should \"police\" phones in schools was \"deeply unhelpful and misguided\".\"School leaders need support from government, not the threat of heavy-handed inspection,\" he added.'Not strong evidence'It comes as the government faces additional pressure from the House of Lords, which is expected to vote on a proposed ban on Wednesday.The amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill has backing from several prominent figures such as former children's TV presenter Baroness Benjamin and former education minister Lord Nash.There is also a separate amendment calling for the introduction of film-style age ratings which could limit the social media apps children can access.Professor Amy Orben, who leads the Digital Mental Health programme at the University of Cambridge's MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, told the BBC there was \"broad agreement\" more needed to be done to keep children safe online.However, she said there was still \"not strong evidence\" that age-based social media bans were effective.Dr Holly Bear from Oxford University, whose work focuses on developing, evaluating, and implementing mental health interventions for young people, agreed the evidence for the effects of a social media ban was \"still unfolding\".\"A balanced approach might be trying to reduce algorithm-driven exposure to harmful content, improving safeguards, supporting digital literacy and carefully evaluating any major policy interventions,\" she said.The NSPCC, Childnet, and suicide prevention charity the Molly Rose Foundation were among 42 individuals and bodies to argue a ban would be the \"wrong solution\" on Saturday.\"It would create a false sense of safety that would see children - but also the threats to them - migrate to other areas online,\" the organisations wrote.\"Though well-intentioned, blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children's safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need.\"",

    "body": "Australia's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of a national gun buyback programme, firearms and hate speech reforms, a month after the deadly shooting at Bondi Beach.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the gunmen would not have legally had access to firearms if had such legislation was in place prior to the attack. The individuals who killed 15 people on 14 December had \"hate in their hearts and guns in their hands,\" Burke told parliament.The father in the father-son duo allegedly behind the attack legally owned six firearms, while his son had been on the radar of intelligence agencies. Both bills will now move to the Senate and are expected to be passed later on Tuesday. The gun reform bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 96 to 45, includes stricter firearm import controls and provisions to improve information sharing between intelligence agencies on people trying to obtain gun licences. The buyback scheme will target \"surplus and newly restricted firearms\", Burke said, reducing the country's four million registered guns.Burke added that it \"comes as a shock to most Australians\" to know that the country has more firearms that it did before the 1996 Port Arthur attack, in which a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania. That attack, the country's worst such mass shooting, had prompted the then government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun controls.The lower house of parliament also passed reforms to hate speech on Tuesday aimed at tackling antisemitism. The hate speech reforms had originally been included in an omnibus bill with the gun reforms but the government split the legislation last week after both the Liberal-National opposition coalition and the Greens said they would vote against them.While the Labor government has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it needs the support of other parties in the Senate.Coalition MPs cited concerns about free speech and said the legislation was not clearly defined among other things, while the Greens said they could not support it unless changes were made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest.But on Tuesday, Liberals leader Sussan Ley, who last week said the bill was \"unsalvageable\", said her party had reached agreement with the government on a watered down version.The Liberals had \"stepped up to fix legislation\" that the government had \"mishandled\", she said in a statement, adding that the bill had been \"narrowed, strengthened and properly focused on keeping Australians safe\".The bill includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and will be subject to a review every two years by a parliamentary joint committee. The opposition will also be consulted on the listing and delisting of extremist organisations.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSimon Jack,Business editorandJonah Fisher,Climate correspondentGetty ImagesInspections without notice, regular MOT-style checks and compulsory water efficiency labels on appliances are among the key measures in the government's overhaul of the water industry.The government is describing the measures as the biggest overhaul of the water industry in England and Wales since privatisation.Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said there would be \"nowhere to hide\" for poor performing water companies.The proposed changes come after widespread public anger at increasing numbers of pollution incidents, leaks and water outages that have affected thousands of customers across England and Wales in recent years.\"We've had a system whereby water companies are marking their own homework,\" Reynolds told the BBC.\"This has been a whole system failure,\" she said. \"A failure of regulation, a failure of regulators, of the water companies themselves.\"The Water White Paper promises to set up company-specific teams to monitor, supervise and support individual firms and their particular issues rather than rely on a \"desk based, one size fits all\" approach.Smart meters and mandatory water efficiency labels on appliances including dishwashers and washing machines will also help households monitor their usage and costs, the government said.It is also creating a chief engineer role at the regulator that will be set up to replace Ofwat.Government officials have told the BBC that the establishment of a new regulator may take a year or more and water companies say it will take time for the benefits of new investments to be felt.The government's reforms come after a review by Sir Jon Cunliffe, who issued 88 recommendations to improve the industry.However, he was asked not to consider whether to nationalise the sector, which was privatised in the late 1980s.Campaigners said the proposed reforms did not go far enough.River Action chief executive James Wallace said the measures showed the government \"recognises the scale of the freshwater emergency, but lacks the urgency and bold reform to tackle it\".The new regulator must be \"truly independent\" and properly funded, he warned, and said major gaps remain. \"None of these reforms will make a meaningful difference unless the failed privatised model is confronted head on. Pollution for profit is the root cause of this crisis,\" Wallace said.Surfers Against Sewage chief executive Giles Bristow said the government's proposed changes were \"frankly insulting\" and fell short of much needed structural reform.\"The truth is glaringly obvious to everyone except this government. As long as the industry is structured to prioritise profit, the public will keep paying the price through soaring bills and polluted water,\" he said.Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at Oxford University, said the government had not wanted to explore that because its self-imposed spending rules have already been stretched to the limits.\"In addition to that, I think there's a very sensible view around government that the government probably isn't competent and capable to run these businesses,\" he said.\"The government should think really quite carefully about this, because if they're supervising the companies, and something goes wrong, whose fault is it?\"Problems in the beleaguered sector have been thrown into focus recently after tens of thousands of South East Water customers were cut off for several days both before and after Christmas.Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said the \"miserable disruption\" underlined the importance of \"meaningful change\" in water regulation.A new, powerful ombudsman service would also be welcome, Keil said, given CCW has had a 50% increase in customers asking for help with complaints relating to their water provider.\"One of our key asks of the Independent Water Commission was to make our existing voluntary ombudsman service mandatory, as this is vital to giving customers robust protection,\" he said.'Proof in the river'Peter Devery testing the water of the River PangThe River Pang in Berkshire is regarded by some as one of the inspirations for Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows classics. Its environmental status has deteriorated from \"good\" in 2015 to \"poor\" now, with campaigners blaming regular sewage discharges.On the banks of the Pang, Pete Devery from the Angling Trust told the BBC he was sceptical of the government's plans.\"I won't hold my breath,\" he said.\"The proof will be in the river. Do the rivers across the country improve? That's the end result. Doesn't matter what you call that regulator. It doesn't matter how many regulators there are. If the difference isn't made in the rivers, they will have failed.\"In 2024, water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours, a slight increase on 2023.Ageing infrastructure, wetter winters and drier springs and farming runoff into rivers and lakes have all contributed to poor water service and quality.Ofwat is currently the water industry's economic regulator for both England and Wales. In October 2025 the Welsh government said that when Ofwat is abolished it plans to form its own stand-alone economic regulator to replace it.In 2025, water supply interruptions across England and Wales rose by 8% and pollution incidents by 27%, while customer satisfaction fell by 9%.Average water bills rose by 26%, or £123 a year, from last April after years of below-inflation increases that some have blamed, along with high executive pay and shareholder dividends, on under-investment in the sector.The sharp rise in bills is meant to address that under-investment by funding spending of £104bn over the next five years, more than 40% of which is earmarked for new infrastructure.",

    "body": "1 hour agoTiffanie Turnbull,SydneyandKoh EweA surfer has been bitten by a shark, the fourth attack along Australia's New South Wales (NSW) coastline in under 48 hours.The 39-year-old man \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board on the Mid North Coast on Tuesday morning, police said. He has been released from hospital.It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police. The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney.Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was \"very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries\", ABC reported. \"We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate,\" Pearce said. \"If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there.\"A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with \"life-changing\" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach.Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in most of the recent attacks.Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast.Bull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the \"water is at their preferred temperature\", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC.Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute - making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon. \"This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual,\" said McPhee.Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility.\"I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,\" Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters.Rain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that \"bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain\". \"Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks. Unfortunately, that sometimes occurs at popular beach locations.\"",

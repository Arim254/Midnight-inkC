    "body": "Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed again until November 20262 hours agoLaura CressRockstarGrand Theft Auto 6 tells the story of lovers Jason and LuciaGrand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed - for a second time - until 19 November 2026.One of the most anticipated gaming releases ever, the sequel by developer Rockstar Games was due to come out in May 2026.It had already been postponed once before, from autumn 2025. But in a statement on Thursday, Rockstar said it needed extra months to to finish the game with the level of polish fans had come to \"expect and deserve\".GTA 5, the latest in the series, was released in 2013 and is the second best-selling game of all time.Despite being 12 years old, it remains extremely popular with fans today due to its online mode.In its statement, Rockstar said it was \"sorry for adding additional time\" to a long wait and thanked fans for their patience.It said it was \"incredibly excited\" for players to experience the game's setting of Leonida - a fictional US state based on Florida - and a modern-day version of the Miami-inspired Vice City.Rockstar GamesGTA 6 takes place in a fictional, yet familiar, version of the USAAs ever, GTA news sparked the usual mix of anger, jokes and acceptance on social media.Streamer IShowSpeed gave a typically over-the-top response to the news during one of his online broadcasts.\"I'm gonna be 50 before this game comes out,\" he said.\"I might have kids, I might have a wife.\"The account for animated character Lofi Girl, who has been locked in a never-ending study session on YouTube since 2017, joked that she \"might actually graduate before GTA 6\".While an official Domino's Pizza account encouraged Rockstar to \"call us if you need help delivering\". Others were more measured, saying they would rather developers take their time than rush out an unfinished game.The announcement follows the firing of 31 workers from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October.The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, has accused the developer of sacking UK staff to stop them unionising.Members led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday. The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment.IWGBPickets have taken place outside Take-Two Interactive's UK head office in London.Rockstar has stayed tight-lipped about GTA 6, releasing only two trailers so far, with the second arriving in May this year.With over 100 million views, the nearly three-minute video gave players more insight into the backstory of protagonists Jason and Lucia - a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida - as well as revealing new characters and map locations.Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism, with its previous big release - Red Dead Redemption 2 - delayed by roughly a year from its original release date.Increased demand for complexity and scope from players, as well as soaring development costs, has meant publishers are less willing to take risks on unfinished products.When it finally lands, GTA 6 is likely to be one of the most expensive video games ever made, but also expected to set records with its launch sales.Whether it will live up to the hype remains to be seen.",

The baby died at the scene.Assistant Chief Constable Vicki Townsend said the arrests were made as part of a \"wide range\" of inquiries and urged people \"not to speculate\".The force said the man in his 30s and the woman in her 20s were also arrested on suspicion of child neglect and released on bail.Gwent Police said the six-year-old dog was registered and that a certificate of exemption had been issued in 2024, before a ban on the breed was introduced.ACC Townsend warned the community over any speculation online, adding if anyone had information \"on the dog involved - a male, black XL bully - and its previous behaviour, please contact us directly\".\"I understand that there is a lot of interest about this in our communities, but this is now a live criminal investigation,\" she said.\"It is vital that people think about how their online commentary, in particular social media comments or posts, could impact the ongoing investigation and the criminal justice process.\"There is a \"profound sense of shock\" in the community, says a local councillorPeople in the village said they saw police cars and ambulances on the street late on Sunday evening, with the \"quiet community\" finding it difficult to come to terms with the \"horrendous\" events.Rogiet county councillor Peter Strong described the village as being in mourning, but vowed residents would \"stand together\".\"It's a deep and profound sense of shock that such a thing should happen in amidst our quiet community.\"Mr Strong appealed to local people to \"give the family the space they need to grieve in peace\".Getty ImagesAn XL bully - shown here in a stock image - is the largest kind of American bully dogIt has been a criminal offence to own an XL Bully without an exception certificate since 1 February 2024, but the number of dog attacks actually increased in 2024 compared to a year earlier.There were 31,920 dog attacks on people recorded in England Wales in 2024 – a 2% increase on 2023 – according to Freedom of Information figures obtained from police forces. However, the figures may not show the full picture, as three police forces did not provide useable data.Related internet links",

    "body": "55 minutes agoRebecca Curran,BBC Scotland and Ken Banks,North east Scotland reporterGetty ImagesCoastguard helicopters can be essential in offshore emergenciesThousands of North Sea oil workers are being told they must lose weight if they are to keep flying offshore - or face losing their jobs.From November next year, industry body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the maximum clothed weight for a worker heading offshore should be 124.7kg (19.5 st) - so they can be winched to safety in an emergency.The 249kg (39st) maximum Coastguard rescue helicopter winch load is made up of that figure plus the average 90.3kg (14st) weight of a rescue worker, a 29kg (4.5st) stretcher and the 5kg (0.8st) kit.OEUK said more than 2,200 workers were currently above the weight limit, and jobs could be lost in the worst case scenario.The new safe weight limit policy comes after the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) warned that rescue winches - which are critical during offshore emergencies - cannot safely lift heavier people.OEUK said the average weight of offshore workers had risen by almost 10kg (1.5st) since 2008.The decision to implement a safe weight limit for offshore workers follows a review by industry experts over the past two-and-a half years.Rules about shoulder size were previously introduced for workers travelling to and from offshore installations by helicopter.Passengers with a shoulder width of 22in (56cm) or more were classed as \"extra broad\" and had to sit next to a similarly large helicopter window, so they could escape.Could jobs be lost?Graham Skinner, the health and safety manager at OEUK, said it was hoped the new safety policy - as part of a \"robust safety culture\" - would not lead to job losses, but he could not rule it out.\"That would be the absolute worst-case scenario.\"Employers will have a duty to support their workers through this and try to find reasonable solutions for it, but in the very worst cases that would be the case for some people.\"Mr Skinner described it as \"really important\" that there was a clear message to the workforce that the new rules were going to come in.\"Hopefully that is the impetus for everyone to get behind the policy and lose weight in time for November next year,\" he said.Graham Skinner said workers had a year to lose weight\"There are those who are going to have a real challenge over the next 12 months to lose weight to get under the weight limit.\"There is about 2,270 that are going to have to lose a little bit of weight to make sure they can continue working after November next year.\"At that point an offshore worker who weighs over 124 kg will not get their medical and that will preclude them from getting on a helicopter.\"However, Mr Skinner said they were \"really confident\" that the \"vast majority\" of workers were going to get under the weight limit.Some are extremely fitHe cited the support they would get from their employers, the offshore operators, and the offshore community itself.\"We have already heard of offshore workers who are offering circuit training and gym sessions for workers,\" he added.\"So it's a great opportunity for the community to come together.\"John Boland, the regional officer at the Unite union, said: \"We would hope that nobody loses their job through this and there can be support put in to stop that from happening.\"The biggest concerns we have had are from individuals that are naturally larger built and in some cases are extremely fit but are above that actual weight limit.\"Those are discussions we need to have, how we can support those individuals as well.\"The mandatory implementation of the new policy will be from 1 November 2026.More on this story",

    "body": "14 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentThe government has recovered £74m from excessive profits made by companies running asylum accommodation, the BBC can reveal.The Home Office said it had recouped the money following a review of contracts after Labour came to power last year.Ministers had faced criticism from MPs for neglecting day-to-day management of the contracts.But the amount recouped remains a small percentage of the overall cost of asylum accommodation.Home Office figures show the overall cost was £2.1bn in 24/25 - an average of about £5.77m per day.That makes the sum recovered less than the cost for the government of accommodation every fortnight.Accommodation providers had previously told Parliament they would be returning some profits to the government, under the terms of their contracts.The cost to the taxpayer of the contracts has increased significantly since they were signed.Dame Karen Bradley, the Conservative chair of the home affairs select committee, said the recovery was \"welcome\" but only a \"first step\".She added: \"This is only a small part of the many billions that the contracts have and will cost. \"The government must now set out its long term plan for how it will deliver a resilient and cost effective asylum accommodation system.\"Ministers have promised to end the use of asylum hotels before the next general election - and the prime minister has said he would like to bring that deadline forward.But the Home Office has also sought to bring down the immediate costs of hotels and other types of accommodation, like private flats.The costs for 2024/25 were a reduction from the previous year - when accommodation cost £3bn - or £8.3m per day.Much of that was down to reducing the average nightly cost per person, as a result of room sharing and cheaper accommodation being used. Ministers are also planning to use alternative accommodation- such as military sites - to house asylum seekers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"This government inherited asylum hotel contracts that were not delivering good value for taxpayers' money.\"We have already saved £700m in hotel costs. Now we are recouping millions more in excess profits. And by the end of this parliament, we will have closed every asylum hotel.\"Last month, the Home Office was strongly criticised by the home affairs committee for its handling of asylum accommodation.MPs on the committee said the government had \"squandered\" billions of pounds of taxpayer money.They also accused the Home Office of under-utilising mechanisms to reclaim excess profits made by accommodation providers.There are break clauses in some contracts that would allow ministers to end use of some accommodation in 2026.The home secretary told the BBC last week that all options were on the table - and that she would study the legal arrangements \"carefully\".Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: \"The only way to end this crisis is to end the use of hotels altogether. \"The Home office is spending £5.77m per day on asylum hotels, meaning these savings will disappear in just 12 days.\"The truth is the Labour government is accommodating more illegal immigrants in hotels than at the election, and the first nine months of this year have been the worst in history for illegal immigrants crossing the Channel.\"\"Only the Conservative Party has a serious, hard-edged plan to take control of our borders,\" the shadow home secretary added.",

    "body": "Typhoon which killed almost 200 in Philippines and Vietnam weakens7 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Sen NguyenWatch: Typhoon Kalmaegi barrels through central VietnamTyphoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 188 people in the Philippines and five in Vietnam, according to the latest figures from the two countries.The storm is now headed west to Cambodia and Laos after it barrelled through central Vietnam on Thursday with winds of up to 149km/h (92mph).Towns along Vietnam's central coast were littered with debris this morning after taking the full brunt of the storm overnight. The strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. Thousands of people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings as the army was deployed to help deal with the damage. Vietnamese authorities have warned of possible flooding in low-lying areas. Central Vietnam has already seen record rainfall in the past week which has killed 50 people.Earlier this week the same storm devastated parts of the Philippines when heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods. The death toll reported on Friday was a jump from the 114 reported the previous day. Another 135 people are listed as missing. The Philippines government has declared a state of calamity across the country as it prepares for another typhoon which is building up in the Pacific Ocean.Ahead of Typhoon Kalmaegi, Vietnam's military on Thursday deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel for relief efforts, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and six aircraft. Some airports and expressways in the country were closed and hundreds of thousands were evacuated.Shortly after the typhoon made landfall at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT), hundreds of residents in Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.Many people said their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.AFP via Getty ImagesTrees came down in high winds near Quy Nhon beach in Gia Lai, central Vietnam, as Kalmaegi approached on ThursdayAccording to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" Before making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 188 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month's worth of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.In Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction, Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she told the BBC. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.EPAWaves crashed on the beach in Cua Dai, Da Nang, central Vietnam, on Thursday",

    "body": "10 hours agoAnnabel RackhamCulture reporter Dan KennedyBroadcaster Emma Barnett has said finding out she was going through perimenopause at the age of 38 felt like she had been \"mugged, robbed\". Barnett, now 40, said it was the \"first time in my life I haven't really wanted to be a woman - it's the first time I've thought, I'd really quite like to be a bloke\".She was speaking on her new BBC podcast, Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett, the first episode of which was released on Friday.Perimenopause, which commonly occurs around the age of 46, is when you have symptoms of menopause but your periods haven't yet stopped. These symptoms can include anxiety, mood swings, brain fog, hot flushes and irregular periods.Barnett joined the presenting line-up of BBC Radio 4's Today programme in 2024In the episode, Barnett says perimenopause made her feel as though she had lost her identity - and that she is still waiting to \"come back\" to who she was before.Speaking to friend and guest Kate Thornton, she goes on: \"I do feel there has been a theft. I do feel there's no emergency number to call. 'I'd like to report a crime. Yeah, someone stole me.' There is no one to report this to.\"Thornton, also a journalist and broadcaster, talked about her own experience of perimenopause, saying the \"worst\" thing she experienced was going from being somebody \"who can multitask... being very capable\" to somebody who felt \"entirely incapable\". Barnett has previously spoken out about her health. In 2019, she wrote the book Period: It's About Bloody Time, chronicling her experience of endometriosis.During the podcast episode, she said it was \"pretty nerve-wracking\" to share certain parts of her life - but that she \"wanted to create this space for other people to be ready to talk about things\".Barnett, who hosted Radio 4's Woman's Hour until last year, said she ultimately wanted to make the podcast so she could not only tell the stories of others, but give listeners her perspective and experience.\"I'm usually the interviewer, I'm usually hosting,\" Barnett told Thornton.\"It's not easy to share and I know that, and I think that's why it's important that somebody who interviews does, when appropriate - not all the time, because that's not my job and it's not about me - but where appropriate and especially when you're asking others to do the same, share themselves.\"Rounding off the episode, Barnett could be heard saying she hoped that \"the normalisation - which we both said needs to happen around perimenopause and this degradation of one's hormones that happens from... the age of 30s right through in women - can move into common parlance\".\"And it doesn't mean what happens feels any less extraordinary or outrageous, but how we meet it could change,\" she added.How to treat menopause symptomsA growing number of women take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to alleviate menopause symptoms.HRT tops up and stabilises oestrogen levels, sometimes in combination with a synthetic or bioidentical version of progesterone.But it may not be suitable for people who have a history of some cancers, blood clots and high blood pressure.Women may also be able to improve how they feel by:eating a balanced diet, low in fat and high in calcium to strengthen bones and protect the heartexercising regularly, to reduce anxiety, stress and guard against heart diseasestopping smoking, to prevent heart disease and hot flushesavoiding alcohol, to reduce hot flushesThere is also research that suggests eating plant oestrogens - contained in soy and red clover - could help with symptoms. Talking therapy known as CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) may be offered to women over 40, alongside HRT - or, if the patient's individual circumstances call for it, in place of it.",

    "body": "'I thought it was a prank' - How a Brazilian woman became the face of India vote fraud row2 hours agoLuiz Fernando Toledo in London and Geeta Pandey & Yogita Limaye in IndiaBBC NewsCongress PartyLarissa Nery has found herself at the centre of a storm since Rahul Gandhi's press conference on WednesdayA Brazilian hairdresser Larissa Nery, who has been making headlines in India this week after her photograph was splashed over the news in an allegation about alleged election fraud, has told the BBC she initially thought it was all a mistake. Or a prank.But then her social media blew up and people started tagging her on Instagram.\"At first it was a few random messages. I thought they were mistaking me for someone else,\" she told the BBC. \"Then they sent me the video where my face appeared on a big screen. I thought it was AI or some joke. But then lots of people started messaging at the same time and I realised it was real.\"Nery, who lives in Belo Horizonte, capital city of southeastern Brazil's Minas Gerais state, and has never been to India, says she searched on Google to understand what was going on.What had happened was the fallout of a press conference by Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday where he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party BJP and the Election Commission (EC) of committing voter fraud in last year's election in Haryana state. The BJP has denied the allegations. Hours after the press conference, in a post on X, the Chief Electoral Officer of Haryana shared a letter they said they had sent to Gandhi in August asking him to sign an oath with the names of ineligible voters \"so that necessary proceedings could be initiated\". They did not respond to the specific allegations he made and did not comment on Nery's case. The BBC has reached out to the poll panel for response.Gandhi has made a series of accusations of \"vote theft\" against the poll panel since early August.In his latest claims, he said his team had looked through the Election Commission's voter list data and found that of the approximately 20 million voters, 2.5 million were irregular entries - including duplicates, bulk voters and invalid addresses. He blamed his party's loss in the Haryana election on this alleged manipulation of the voters' list.To prove his claims, he showed a number of slides on a big screen. One of them showed Gandhi standing in front of a big image of Nery, while another showed a compilation of 22 voters with different names and addresses but all with her photos.BBC speaks to Larissa Nery\"Who is this lady? How old is she? She votes 22 times in Haryana,\" Gandhi said.He explained that a single stock photo of a woman, taken by Brazilian photographer Matheus Ferrero, had been used repeatedly across multiple voter entries under different names. He described Nery as a model who had appeared on the voters' list under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati.The 29-year-old confirmed to the BBC that it was indeed her in the photograph. \"Yes. It is me. Much younger, but it is me. I am the person in the images.\" She clarified that she was a hairdresser and not a model and that the photo was taken in March 2017 when she was 21, just outside her home. The photographer, she said, \"thought I was pretty and asked to take photos of me\".Now years later, all the attention in the past two days from \"people from India, many of them journalists\", has left her scared.\"I became scared. I cannot tell if it is dangerous for me or if speaking about it could harm someone there. I do not know who is right or wrong because I do not know the parties involved,\" she said.\"I did not go to work in the morning because I could not even see messages from my clients. Many journalists were calling me. They found the number of the place where I work. \"I had to remove the salon name from my profile because they were disturbing my workplace. My boss even spoke to me. Some people treat it like a meme, but it is affecting me professionally.\"Matheus Ferrero, who took Nery's photo, is also overwhelmed by the sudden attention. Until recently, he says India meant only Caminho das Índias - the 2009 Brazilian primetime show - to him.He's still trying to make sense of the events of the last few days in a country thousands of miles away.Some people had reached out to him from India a week back, asking him who the woman in the photo was, he told the BBC.\"I didn't reply. I'm not going to give someone's name like that. And I hadn't seen this friend in years,\" he told the BBC. \"I thought it was a scam. I blocked and reported it.\"But since Gandhi's press conference, \"things have exploded\".Congress PartyGandhi said Nery had appeared on the voters' list in Haryana under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati\"People were calling me on Instagram and Facebook. It was terrible. I deactivated my Instagram to try to understand what was going on. Later I googled it and realised what was happening, but at first I had no idea.\"Ferrero says some websites put his pictures next to the Nery's photo without permission. \"People were making memes, like turning it into a game show joke. It's absurd.\"In 2017, Ferrero was just starting out as a photographer when he invited Nery, who he knew, to come out for a photoshoot. Ferrero said he shared the photos on his Facebook and also posted them on Unsplash - a photo website - with her consent.\"The photo blew up… reached around 57 million views,\" he said.He has now deleted the link from his Unsplash account but he sent us screenshots taken earlier that showed other photos of Nery from the same shoot.Why India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibility  \"I deleted them out of fear, because the photos were being misused. I got scared imagining this happening to other people I photographed. I felt invaded. A lot of random people coming at me. You think 'Did I do something wrong?' But I didn't. The platform was open and I uploaded like millions of others.\" He's also now made the original Facebook post with her photos private.\"When you see people entering your Twitter, Facebook, personal Instagram, you panic. The first reaction is to shut everything down and understand later. Some people thought it was funny, like a soap opera, but I felt invaded.\"Neither Ferrero nor Nery have ever been to India and are still trying to understand how something that happened at the other end of the world could turn their lives upside down.We asked Ferrero if all this helped uncover electoral fraud, would that be positive?\"Yes, I think that would be positive. But I don't really know the details,\" he said.Nery who has never left the country says: \"This is far from my reality. I do not even follow elections in Brazil, let alone in another country.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoNick ThorpeBudapest correspondentReuters\"There is a war-opposing network in the world, with two focal points: one of power led by the US president and one of spirit found here with the Holy Father,\" Viktor Orban said last week after meeting Pope Leo at the Vatican.\"We draw strength, motivation, and blessing from both,\" said the Hungarian prime minister.If his ally in the White House, US President Donald Trump, was on his mind, then his thoughts could well have turned to a tricky meeting that awaits him on Friday in Washington.The man Trump has called a \"great leader\", and who has long provoked admiration in Maga circles, suddenly finds himself in an unusual position - at odds with the US president on an issue of critical importance.At the centre of those talks will be new US pressure on Hungary and Slovakia to wean themselves urgently off Russian oil - Trump's latest gambit in his efforts to pressurise Russia into ending its war on Ukraine.Asked recently whether Trump had gone too far in imposing sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies, Orban said \"from a Hungarian point of view, yes\".Orban has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas to advance his own agenda in several ways.He has used it as a weapon to attack Brussels, as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, and as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.He will go into this election portraying himself as a safe pair of hands in an increasingly uncertain world. But Orban is trailing in most opinion polls, after his government was shaken by the meteoric rise of opposition Tisza party leader Peter Magyar. The Hungarian PM has also been angered by repeated Ukrainian drone attacks on the Druzhba pipeline this summer, which briefly disrupted supplies to his country.The 'strongman' PM who inspired Trump's playbookOrban accused of using Ukraine spy row in fight for political survivalSenior Hungarian officials have been hinting for months that they believe the war in Ukraine could be over by the end of the year - a seemingly absurd claim, until news of a planned summit in Budapest between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin broke last month.But Orban's carefully laid plans began to unravel on 21 October, when the White House announced that the summit  had been called off.Orban's government had been secretly working on the summit plans for months. Balazs Orban, Orban's political director (no relation), enjoys close relations with US Vice-President JD Vance, and is believed to have played an important role.Orban hopes to persuade Trump to ease the pressure on Hungary at least until the election when the pair meet in Washington.The Hungarian government appears to be counting on the idea that Trump is bored by the war in Ukraine, and wants to turn his back on it if no deal is done soon.Orban has sharply opposed Western military and financial support for Ukraine, and rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato and the EU. He portrays Trump as a pro-peace president, giving short shrift to what he sees as the warmongers of the EU. The climax of the cancelled summit in Budapest would have been the moment he appeared on the balcony of the Carmelite Convent on Castle Hill, overlooking the Danube, flanked by Presidents Trump and Putin. How could Hungarians vote against such an internationally successful leader, he might have asked.In Rome last week, despite US dismissals, Orban insisted the summit would still happen - it was just a question of time. At the weekend, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov quietly suggested the same.Under US pressure, will Orban follow Czech lead?The biggest issue souring US-Hungary relations is oil.In 2024, Hungary even increased the amount of oil it receives through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline from Russia. On 23 October, just as Orban was addressing a rally of his supporters in front of Parliament in Budapest, the US announced sanctions on the two giant Russian oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft.Hungary received 64% of its oil through the Friendship pipeline from Russia, via Belarus and Ukraine, in 2020. By 2024 that figure stood at 80%, or 5 million tonnes a year.The Hungarian government argues that land-based pipelines are the cheapest way to receive oil, and that with no sea coast of its own, it has no alternative. Much smaller quantities are also imported from Kazakhstan, Croatia, Iraq, and Azerbaijan.Another issue is that Russian Urals crude has a higher sulphur content than the Brent crude supplied from elsewhere. The major Hungarian refinery at Szazhalombatta, run by Hungarian oil giant MOL, and the Slovnaft refinery in Slovakia, also run by MOL, are both set up to process mostly Urals crude, not Brent.Within the EU, Orban is now the longest standing leader. Far from leaving the bloc, he wants to remake it in his own image, as a union of sovereign nations. For this, he has also won praise from Putin.But Hungary's argument that it cannot change is undermined by the Czech example. That is a country with a similar population to Hungary, and also landlocked.The Czech Republic traditionally relied heavily on Russian crude for the eight million tonnes of oil it needs a year.Starting in early 2022, following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Czech government under Prime Minister Petr Fiala invested heavily in improving the existing Transalpine pipeline to the Italian port of Trieste.At the same time, its refineries at Kralupy and Litvínov were adapted for Brent crude. In April 2025, the Czech authorities announced proudly that they were no longer receiving a drop of Russian oil.Energy experts say that while MOL, the Hungarian oil giant, is quietly changing its technology, what is missing is a political decision from the government to shift to the Adria pipeline from the Croatian port of Omisalj. There are also disputes between the Croatian company Janaf and MOL - over just how much oil the pipeline could support.ReutersOrban has frequently found himself at odds with the EU, and has won praise from Russian President Vladimir PutinWhen the pair meet, Trump will urge Orban to show some political will to wean itself off Russian supplies. But Orban might see that as a hard decision to explain to Hungarian voters. After arguing for years that Hungary cannot survive without Russian oil and gas, he would lose face if it turns out it can.Matt Whitaker, US ambassador to Nato, said in a Fox News interview last week that Hungary had still \"not made any active steps\" to end its dependence on Russian oil. \"There's a lot of planning our friends in Hungary will have to do,\" he said, and promised US help to Hungary and Croatia to make it happen.As the seagull flies, Omisalj is only 44 miles (70km) from Trieste. Seaborne oil from Kazakhstan, Libya, Azerbaijan, the US and Iraq could soon be flowing through the Adria pipeline to Hungary too.Despite Orban's dire warnings of price hikes, there is no data - so far at least - to suggest that Czech consumers have to pay more.There is nothing his old friend Donald Trump likes more than striking a deal.Orban is about to find out how persuasive the US president can be.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesRosalía emerged in 2018 and has become one of the biggest Latin stars in musicOver her brief discography, Rosalía has never met a convention she couldn't break.Born in Barcelona, the singer has spent the last seven years innovating at a speed that makes her contemporaries look comically lazy.Her breakthrough album El Mal Querer (recorded as her graduate thesis in 2018) took the folkloric traditions of Flamenco and fused them to addictive R&B rhythms.The follow-up, 2022's Motomami, was a wildly innovative pop smash, twisting Latin American genres like cumbia and reggaeton around glitchy hip-hop beats and her playful, sinuous melodies.With lyrics about fame, sex and self-discovery, Motomami debuted at the top of Spotify's global albums chart, took home album of the year at the Latin Grammys, and became 2022's best-reviewed record on Metacritic - even topping Beyoncé's celebrated Renaissance.After Rosalía's tour for her critically acclaimed album ended three year ago, her fans were left wondering where she'd go next.The answer is revealed on her fourth album, Lux, released on Friday. Rosalía/Columbia RecordsThe album cover shows Rosalía hugging herself while wearing a nun's headdress, reflecting themes of self-acceptance and spiritual yearningRather than walk in the footsteps of its predecessors, Lux carves its own, unique path - harnessing Rosalía's classical training at the prestigious Catalonia College of Music.Recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, and featuring multiple arrangements from Pulitzer Prize winner Caroline Shaw, it's a radical, rebellious operatic opus that sounds like nothing else in the pop sphere.Lead single Berghain riffs on Verdi's Dies Irae, the strings played with serrated knives as a German chorus chants about fear and anger, until Bjork arrives to inform everyone, \"the only way to save us is through divine intervention\".Another early highlight, Reliquia, chops and splices a chamber quartet into unrecognisable electronic patterns, as Rosalía reconciles herself to the idea that she loves too hard, and locates the beauty in that vulnerability.\"Take a piece of me, keep it for when I'm gone / I'll be your treasure, I am your relic.\"Fellow pop iconoclast Madonna has already declared herself a fan, posting a message to Rosalía on Instagram, saying: \"I can't stop listening! You are a true visionary!!!\"'Emotional terrorist'Pieced together over three years, Lux reflects on a period of personal and professional upheaval for the 33-year-old.In that time, Rosalía broke off her engagement to Puerto Rican reggaetón star Rauw Alejandro, ditched her management in favour of Adele's manager, Jonathan Dickins, and landed her first major acting role in the teen drama Euphoria.The split from Alejandro seems to inspire the record's most barbed lyric. La Perla is aimed at a man she calls an \"emotional terrorist\" and \"the Olympic gold medallist of sons of whores\" – with a jaunty waltz arrangement that suggests she's thoroughly enjoying her litany of insults.The cathartic Focu 'Ranni (only available on CD and vinyl copies) pairs a desolate melody with a scrambled vocal sample; reflecting the emotional turmoil of a bride who calls off her wedding at the last moment.In an interview with France's Le Monde, she said the song was inspired by her namesake, Saint Rosalia de Palermo, who fled the altar to dedicate her life to God.\"I found that coincidence pretty insane,\" the star added, but refused to elaborate, simply saying it was a \"long story\".Getty ImagesThe singer's tour for her album Motomami featured a minimalist stage and backing dancers The quest for spiritual fulfilment underscores the rest of Lux – whose title is the Latin word for \"light\".Sauvignon Blanc is a gossamer ballad that contains the self-deprecating pledge: \"I will listen to my God / I will throw away my Jimmy Choos\"; while the dazzling dopamine rush of Divinize finds her, in the word of Loki, burdened with glorious purpose.\"Bruise me up, I'll eat all of my pride / I know that I was made to divinize.\"But it's the more reflective moments that steal your breath. The closing track, Magnolias, is a delicate acceptance of death: \"What I never did in my life, you'll do when I'm dead.\"And the tender, subdued La Yagular is an acknowledgement of the divine on earth that celebrates our shared humanity.\"I fit in the world / And the world fits into me / I take up the world / And the world occupies me,\" she sings, in wide-eyed wonder.The song ends with a recording of Patti Smith in 1976, encouraging artists to shatter expectations.\"Break on through to the other side,\" the rock star exclaimed. \"Going through one door isn't enough, a million doors aren't enough.\"As an encapsulation of Rosalía's creative impulse, it's almost too perfect.Rosalía/Columbia RecordsRosalía studied 14 languages including Hebrew, Ukrainian and French during the creation of the latest album Ahead of the album's release, the singer advised fans to play Lux on headphones in a darkened room, calling it an antidote to TikTok trends and viral videos.\"The more we are in the era of dopamine, the more I want the opposite,\" she told the New York Times. \"I know it's a lot to ask, but that's what I want.\"Anyone who accepts the challenge will be richly rewarded.Despite its grand orchestral sweep, Lux is a thoroughly modern album, with cutting edge production and hip-hop phrasing sneaking into Rosalía's stunning, operatic vocals.A lesser artist might have been crushed by its conceptual weight – singing in 14 languages, over four movements, inspired by the mystical writings of French philosopher Simone Weil – but somehow she avoids the trap.\"I just want to have fun making music,\" she told Nick Grimshaw on BBC 6 Music, \"and the only way is always trying to do it different. You want extremes. You want opposities.\"It's como un péndulo (like a pendulum). In Motomami it was about inventing words. On Lux it's like, let me try to figure out a way to make lyrics that can be set in stone.\"The result is an album that's audacious but accessible. Turn off the lights, give it your full attention, and discover one of the most singular, original artists of our time.",

If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares.The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name.\"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said.\"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added.The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include:Delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles and one million robotsGeting 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's Full Self-Driving featureBringing one million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operationEarning up to $400bn in core profitEventually lifting Tesla's overall market value to $8.5tn, currently $1.4tnHe won't receive a salary under the agreed deal.But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm's market value is raised high enough.Musk's early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business.Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an \"autonomous humanoid robot\" performing \"unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.\"Using the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm's future.He's previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would allow it to play a key role in his factories - and in future, in homes.\"Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X.\"His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet.\"Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\" US regulators are investigating Tesla's self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries.Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months.Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring.Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks \"another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business.\"Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.ReutersElon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targetsIt is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added.Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over \"the polarisation of [Musk's] persona\" which has \"demolished the value of the brand\".\"Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,\" he said.Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla's biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote.\"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.Watch: Elon Musk dances in sync with Tesla robotsTesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon MuskAnn Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he \"hit those milestones ahead of schedule\" in 2018.She said his political interests had created some \"polarisation\", but his pay package did not \"put any constraints on his activities\" outside of the company.Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did.But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk.Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision.The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors.Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting.ReutersMusk said everyone would want an Optimus robotIn recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts.A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk.Kathryn Hannon, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said the new pay deal would give Musk \"increasing voting power over the company\", which he had long been requesting for a number of years.\"Elon Musk, whether you like him or not, he is a visionary in this space and I guess putting the correct governance and incentivisation structures around him to deliver this does align him, hopefully, with shareholders on that success journey.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoCatriona MacPhee and Rachel Coburn,BBC DisclosureBBCNadia ended their date early because of \"red flags\"A woman who matched on Tinder with predator Christopher Harkins says she was subjected to death threats and abuse that destroyed her mental health for years - after spending just 20 minutes in his company.Speaking for the first time about going on a date with the notorious fraudster and rapist in 2018, Nadia said the abuse started after she ended their date early because of \"red flags\".The sports massage therapist is among half a dozen women who shared their distressing, and often bizarre, experiences with one of Scotland's most prolific romance fraudsters in new BBC Disclosure podcast: Matched with a Predator.Christopher Harkins was eventually jailed for 12 years after women came forward to report his crimesThe BBC investigation revealed that 11 women tried to report Harkins to Police Scotland as far back as 2012.Despite allegations of physical attacks, frauds, threats and abuse, Harkins was not investigated by police until late 2019.Police Scotland said earlier reports were \"mainly around the financial situation\" and they were all treated in isolation - a situation it hoped \"wouldn't be replicated now\".Harkins spent almost a decade carrying out crimes against women he met online in Scotland and London, before being jailed in 2024.Nadia believes he should have been stopped earlier. She is among several victims who have called for Police Scotland to apologise to those who tried to report him.Nadia, who is now 34, and Harkins, now 38, matched on Tinder seven years ago.They chatted over messages and after a few weeks, they decided to go out for dinner in Glasgow.For Nadia, the first red flag came when she arrived to pick up Harkins from his flat in Cumbernauld. He opened the door wearing jogging trousers and a vest, saying he was too tired to go out. He suggested they stay at his flat and order takeaway.\"This is where it gets bizarre,\" said Nadia.\"I went in. The place was bare. No furniture. The living room was totally empty apart from a TV on some boxes.\"Harkins offered to make Nadia a vodka. When she declined the alcohol and poured herself a Diet Coke, she says the atmosphere changed.\"It was as if he had an internal man tantrum,\" she said.\"He looked at me as if, 'who do you think you are? Why are you pouring yourself a drink?'\"I was a bit nervous and I poured it right to the top of the glass. As I turned, I spilled the Diet Coke.\"The look in his eyes was crazy. He said something like, 'You're so clumsy, you don't respect my property. You're a clown'.\"I remember thinking, 'Are you for real?' It was laminate flooring.\"I said, 'look, I'm just going to go'. And he pointed to the door and swore.\"Nadia says: \"I was terrified. I thought he was going to follow me out. I jumped in my car, I locked the doors and that was it.\"I thought it had ended there but it just got so much worse. \"You wouldn't believe that my life was affected so badly by a 20-minute interaction with this guy.\"The rejection appears to have been a major trigger for Harkins, who started to bombard Nadia with calls and messages as soon as she left.The first one read: \"How dare someone like you have the audacity to leave a date with me?\"As things escalated over the following hours, Nadia says Harkins threatened to \"petrol bomb\" her home, kill her and attack her dad.He also sent a barrage of insults about her appearance. This had a devastating impact on Nadia's self esteem - something she'd worked hard to restore after going through a difficult period in her life.\"I got messages saying I was a fat cow,\" she said.\"I was a catfish. I looked like a pig. I wore too much make-up. That continued all through the night. I cried that much I got a headache. At six in the morning he was still sending me abuse.\"I remember looking in the mirror and I was ashamed of myself. \"He knew I'd lost weight and had been going to the gym. \"When I thought I was at my best he literally ripped it away from me.\"Nadia and Harkins matched on Tinder and chatted over messagesThe day after their date, Nadia reported the threats and abuse to Police Scotland. She also played a recording of a phone call from Harkins.In it, he can be heard saying he would go to her dad's house, drag him out and give him a kicking.\"I was told nothing could be done for me,\" Nadia said.\"They said there was no direct threat - if and when he did something to call them straight back.\"Nobody took a statement. They did not want to help me. I was screaming from the roof, 'I can't have this, you don't know what he's capable of, he's threatening me'.\"Nadia said: \"If they'd have done something then, then a lot of things could have been done for the girls that were after me.\"Harkins continued his abuse long after their date ended. Nadia blocked his number but more than a year later, he was still harassing her by contacting people she knew on social media.She said: \"The frame of mind he put me in, if I didn't have my daughter, I would have ended my life.\"Harkins' scams included pretending to book romantic holidays for women he met on dating appsHarkins is currently serving a 12-year jail sentence after being convicted of 19 offences against 10 women, including physical and sexual violence.He was initially charged with threatening and abusive behaviour towards Nadia, and of threatening her family.As part of a plea-deal, a not guilty plea was accepted to that charge - and Harkins pleaded guilty to stealing more than £214,000 from women, via holiday scams, fake investment schemes and by using their identities to take out bank loans.What finally sparked an investigation by Police Scotland was one of the women turning to the media in a desperate bid to expose Harkins and protect others. She had also been turned away by the police when Harkins scammed her out of £3,247 for a fake holiday.Police ScotlandHarkins was convicted of 19 offences including rapeHer story was published in October 2019. The extent of Harkins' crimes quickly became apparent and police launched a formal investigation.Nadia and others who made historical reports were revisited and, this time, they were asked to give statements.Harkins stood trial in 2024. As Nadia read about the testimony of a woman who was raped by Harkins, she made a sickening realisation - it was two months after his date with her.\"That lassie could have been totally saved,\" she said. \"He could have been arrested and she would never have had an interaction with him.\"Vile. That's all I can say about that. It's disgusting.\"Harkins got away with his crimes for yearsOur investigation has uncovered further alleged frauds by Harkins of almost £70,000. The BBC understands he targeted at least 30 women.We wrote to Harkins in prison to ask about these allegations. He did not reply.DCI Lyndsay Laird led the Police Scotland investigation into Harkins.She said it was difficult to say why the reports weren't investigated earlier.\"Each one was reported at different stages, so they weren't all reported together, they were reported in different divisions throughout Police Scotland,\" she said.\"There was no reports of physical or sexual abuse ever made to the police at that time.\"It was mainly around the financial situation, which when they're treated in isolation, they have been taken as civil investigations.\"I think it's safe to say policing has evolved massively since the time those initial reports have come in.\"Successful court resultSeveral women have told the BBC they did report physical assaults and sexual misconduct in the years before the police investigation.Asked if Police Scotland would apologise to the victims who tried to report Harkins, DCI Laird said: \"I think that's a very difficult question to answer.\"I think they've got a successful court result now, based on the investigation that was conducted.\"I would say with everything that we've put in place since then, I would hope that that experience wouldn't be replicated now.\"In response to those comments, Nadia said: \"I know they really did work hard when they decided to actually do something about it but they should have done something sooner.\"He was doing this for years. It could have been avoided. They should apologise. They could have stopped him.\"Harkins was jailed last year, almost five years after he was first arrested. He was convicted on the evidence of 10 women.Nadia received a phone call to tell her about the outcome.\"Those women achieved more than what you think,\" she said.\"Now all these other people that could have met him in future don't need to. What they did was just amazing - huge.\"The mother-of-two has managed to rebuild her life and her confidence but the experience has left its mark.\"I'm so good now,\" she said.\"It's a totally different me and so much more confident. I'm not afraid to speak up and I will never ignore a red flag again.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoMerlyn Thomas, Matt Murphy, Peter Mwai & Richard Irvine-BrownBBC Verify    BBCWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions of executions.Fighters laugh as they ride on the back of a pick-up truck, speeding past a row of nine dead bodies and driving towards the setting Sudanese sun.\"Look at all this work. Look at this genocide,\" one cheers.He smiles as he turns the camera on himself and his fellow fighters, their Rapid Support Forces (RSF) badges on display: \"They will all die like this.\"The men are celebrating a massacre that humanitarian officials fear killed more than 2,000 people in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher last month. On Monday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said it was investigating whether the paramilitary may have committed \"war crimes and crimes against humanity\".El-Fasher was a key target for the paramilitary RSF. It was the last stronghold in Darfur held by the Sudanese military - with whom the RSF has waged a devastating war since their ruling coalition collapsed in 2023.More than 150,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the fighting over the past two years and both sides stand accused of a litany of war crimes - many of which were repeated by the RSF after the fall of el-Fasher.A city cut off from the worldHaving held the city under siege for almost two years, from August the RSF moved to consolidate its position and blockade the remaining civilian population.Satellite images show that troops started to construct a massive berm - a raised sand barrier - around the perimeter of el-Fasher, sealing off access routes and blocking aid. By early October the ring completely surrounded the city - with a smaller barricade encircling a neighbouring village.As the siege intensified, 78 people were killed in an RSF attack on a mosque on 19 September, while the UN said 53 more were killed in drone and artillery strikes on a displacement camp in October.Videos shared with BBC Verify also suggested that the RSF sought to impose a blockade of food and essential supplies. In October, footage shows a man with his hands and feet tied behind his back, hanging upside down from a tree with metal chains. The man filming the video accused him of trying to smuggle supplies into the besieged city.\"I swear to God you will pay for this you dog,\" he shouted, before demanding that the captive beg for his life.Meanwhile, the RSF pushed forward into the city with troops engaged in frenetic street-to-street clashes.Graphic footage shows unarmed people gunned downBy sunrise on 26 October the RSF overwhelmed the final army positions and seized the main base in the city, the headquarters of the 6th Infantry Division, as the military withdrew.Soldiers were filmed laughing as they toured the abandoned headquarters carrying a grenade launcher. Later that day RSF commander Abdul Rahim Dagalo - brother of RSF chief Mohammad 'Hemedti' Dagalo - was seen inspecting the base.The RSF - which emerged from the Janjaweed militia that killed hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur between 2003-2005 - has long been accused of committing atrocities against non-Arab groups across Sudan. Footage posted online suggested that paramilitary fighters intended to unleash violence against the civilian population in el-Fasher.RSF fighters make threats ahead of the el-Fasher massacrePrior to the paramilitary's seizure of el-Fasher, very little information had emerged from the city for months. But within hours of the military's collapse, footage of atrocities committed by the RSF started to appear online, shattering the silence that had fallen on the city.One of the most graphic videos to emerge and analysed by BBC Verify showed the aftermath of a massacre at a university building on the western side of the city, where dozens of dead bodies were seen scattered across the floor.An elderly man wearing a white tunic sat alone amongst the bodies. He turned to look as a fighter armed with a rifle walked down the stairs towards him. Raising his weapon, the gunman fired a single shot at the man, who collapsed to the floor motionless. Fellow soldiers, unfazed by the act, immediately spotted another man's leg twitch in the tangle of bodies.\"Why is this one still alive,\" one fighter cried. \"Shoot him.\"Satellite images taken on 26 October appeared to confirm that executions were also carried out on the streets of el-Fasher, according to a report published by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab.Its analysts highlighted large \"clusters\" visible in the images, which they said were \"consistent with the size range of adult human bodies and are not present in previous imagery\". It also pointed to \"discoloration\" which the report said may have been marks caused by human blood.One eyewitness who spoke to the BBC said he had witnessed \"many of our relatives being massacred - they were gathered in one place and all killed\".Another witness recalled seeing a woman being killed after the RSF \"shot her in the chest\" before throwing her body aside \"after taking all her belongings\".While the main RSF force rampaged through el-Fasher, a separate group of fighters remained on the periphery of the city, where they engaged in the brutal executions of a number of unarmed captives.Most of this violence occurred at a site around 8km (5 miles) away from el-Fasher. Verified videos show dozens of dead bodies in civilian clothing - some of whom appear to be women - lying in a trench running along the periphery of the sand berm constructed by the RSF.Other clips display scenes of destruction, with fires raging and the burnt-out shells of trucks littered across the landscape. Videos from the scene also show bodies scattered between the vehicles.Fighters laugh near site of RSF executionsA key figure in the violence was previously identified by BBC Verify as an RSF commander who goes by Abu Lulu online. He was shown executing unarmed captives in two videos, while an eyewitness told the BBC that he \"gave an order to his men to kill several innocent people, including children\".One clip showed an RSF soldier attempting to intercede as Abu Lulu prepared to execute an injured man, while the captive pleaded: \"I know you. I called out to you a few days ago.\"Abu Lulu dismissed the man's pleas with a wave of his arms, stating: \"I will never have mercy. Our job is only killing.\" After aiming his rifle almost casually, the fighter unleashed a storm of bullets that tore through the unarmed man.Another video showed him killing a group of nine unarmed captives. Footage that emerged days later revealed the bodies were left where they had fallen - still lined up execution-style and lying on the dusty Darfuri ground.Many of those involved in the killings wore RSF badges, including the group who later celebrated the massacre as a \"genocide\".RSF commanders seek to carry out damage controlIn the days that followed the massacre, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted that his troops had committed \"violations\" and said the incidents would be investigated. A senior UN official said last week that the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects within their ranks.Among those detained was Abu Lulu after BBC Verify published a report documenting his killings. Carefully choreographed and edited footage posted on the RSF's official Telegram account show him being led into a cell at a prison on the outskirts of el-Fasher.Yale analysts also accused the RSF of \"conducting clean-up of their alleged mass atrocities\". A report issued on 4 November noted that satellite images show the removal \"of objects consistent with bodies from a location north of RSF's berm\" and identified graves near the children's hospital in el-Fasher.BBC Verify measured white shapes seen in the hospital courtyard on 30 October as between 1.6m and 2m in length. This is similar to the height of an adult human and consistent with a body in a burial shroud commonly seen in Sudan.Meanwhile, the RSF and affiliated social media accounts began seeking to reframe the narrative.Posts showing its fighters handing out aid to civilians were shared by some users, while the paramilitary's media office shared several clips purporting to show the humane treatment of army prisoners of war.Despite the social media campaign being deployed by the RSF, their actions in el-Fasher have sparked global outrage.BBC Verify approached the RSF, offering it an opportunity to reply to the allegations contained in this investigation. The group did not reply.Additional reporting by Kevin Nguyen, Alex Murray, Barbara Metzler, Lamees Altalebi, Ahmed Nour and Kumar Malhotra. Graphics by Jess Carr and Mesut Ersoz.",

    "body": "Media caption, I've not written book to tear anyone down - EarpsByBBC Sport women’s football news reporterComments made in Mary Earps' autobiography about former England team-mate Hannah Hampton and manager Sarina Wiegman have dominated headlines.It is rare for a current player to release a book detailing conversations and events with people who remain in the game.Goalkeepers Earps and Hampton have both hit the heights of the game, earning top individual accolades, as well as winning European titles with England and Wiegman.So it is understandable Earps' words have caused controversy. What has the reaction been and how could it impact the Lionesses going forward?'It's not nice to see it obviously'In her book, of which extracts were released in the Guardian, Earps claimed she told Wiegman she was rewarding \"bad behaviour\" by recalling Hampton to the England squad, having previously been dropped for being \"disruptive and unreliable\".In response, Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor backed her goalkeeper Hampton, saying she had shown \"class\" and that she felt Earps had disrespected Wiegman.Following the negative reaction, Earps told BBC Sport in an exclusive interview that she had not written the book to \"tear anyone down\".Manchester City goalkeeper Khiara Keating, who made her England debut against Brazil last month, says she has \"a lot of time\" for both Earps and Hampton, and hopes they can resolve issues that have arisen from the book.\"At the end of the day, we're all here to do the same job. Feelings aside, we were always a close-knit group. As goalkeepers, we normally stick together,\" she told BBC Sport. \"That's what we'll do going forward. I'm sure they will sort out what they need to sort out - but I love them both. People have different opinions. \"Their issues are their issues. They know what happened so that's not for me to share anyone's business. It's not nice to see it obviously. \"We've done so many good things with England winning back-to-back Euros. The media will be what it is - it comes with the job. I just hope it will all brush over and we can focus on what matters again.\"'I would never go into what happened'Media caption, Should Earps' 'negative' comments on Hampton been made public?The stir the book has caused is widespread. Former England striker Ellen White was in the Euro 2022 squad alongside Earps and played with Hampton at club and country in her career.She said she felt \"uneasy\" and \"nervous\", as well as \"a lot of sadness\" discussing the outcry on the Women's Football Weekly podcast.\"I feel like we almost have this unwritten oath when you're in a team, that the togetherness and what happens in the dressing room, in training, and in your bubble, stays within the team and that environment,\" said White. \"I was there in 2022 and I would protect my team with my life. I would never go into what happened within that environment. That's not for me to speak about. \"Mary has gone into what she wanted to. What I would say is when Sarina [Wiegman] came in, we built a culture, philosophy, togetherness, and that family-like feel so it felt unbreakable and beautiful at the same time. \"It just feels like that has been penetrated a little bit and that is quite hard to take.\"Ex-Scotland and Arsenal defender Jen Beattie added that there were \"really difficult times\" in team environments but they are \"better left behind closed doors\".Sources close to many of the Lionesses say there is confusion over why Earps felt the need to publish her book so close to their Euro 2025 success.Many of the players Earps won Euro 2022 with still remain in the England squad and those who have played alongside her and Hampton feel caught in the middle.A number of Lionesses have asked to be kept away from media, not wanting to get caught up in the headlines or to create further division among their team-mates. Whether it was intended or not, Earps' comments about Hampton have created the illusion that it is this person's side, or the other's - and nobody wants to choose. In Hampton's case, sources close to the Chelsea goalkeeper say she is trying to block out the noise and focus on the crucial Women's Super League game against Arsenal on Saturday, but she has been affected by the unwanted attention.Earps herself said she hoped the \"noise of this situation hasn't changed\" her relationship with Wiegman.But most are braced for a distracting period as Wiegman is set to name her squad for England's upcoming friendlies against China and Ghana in two weeks' time. Those matches will bring further scutiny on the situation and Wiegman will be forced to address the issues in media conferences, alongside her players.It is not an ideal way to end 2025 - a year in which the squad became the first English team to defend their European title, and to win it on foreign soil. These matches are meant to complete a four-game 'homecoming series' to celebrate their Euro 2025 success. It doesn't feel like much of a celebration now. Former England midfielder Fara Williams wrote in her TNT Sports column that people might \"look at Mary a bit differently\" but her legacy will not be tarnished.\"She will always be in the history books after becoming the first goalkeeper to win the Euros with England, making that memorable penalty save in the World Cup final, fighting for young girls to buy goalkeeping shirts, and making goalkeeping fun and popular for the next generation,\" said Williams.But Williams said she \"didn't like\" the comments on Hampton and is \"baffled\" by Earps' decision to speak out publicly about their relationship. \"If Mary is going to be open and honest about the situation, she needs to go into more detail about the supposed bad behaviour rather than leave it up in the air,\" added Williams. \"I personally don't know if there was bad behaviour from Hannah, but even if that was the case, she served her punishment after being left out of the squad. \"If there was any doubt about Hannah's behaviour in the past, it is clear from her actions that she has learnt from that experience.\"",

    "body": "So much for the 'rise of the machines'.BBC Sport's predictions expert Chris Sutton saw off the joint challenge of AI and the Football Manager 26 computer game to triumph last week - his first victory since the start of September.This week, as well as AI, he takes on a human guest, but one who is a star in a different sport - Bath and England rugby player Ollie Lawrence, who supports Chelsea.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image caption, Lawrence, 26, returned from an Achilles injury in time to start the new Prem Rugby season and is in the England squad for the Autumn Internationals. England's next match is against Fiji at Twickenham on Saturday - kick-off is at 17:40 GMT and you can listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.Lawrence also excelled at football and cricket as a boy, and was with the academies of Aston Villa and Birmingham City, as well as Worcester Warriors, before focusing on rugby at the age of 16.Sutton is a keen cricketer himself, and has regularly turned out for Norwich cricket club in recent years, but says his rugby career did not really take off.\"I only played rugby once, for my school team,\" Sutton said. \"We were really excited on the bus on the way there, but we lost 72-0 and I never played again.\"Anyway, it's great that Ollie played for Villa's academy, but I'd like to remind him I actually played for their first team.\"Being compared to a rugby side is not usually seen as a compliment for football teams, but Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta revealed recently that he has been inspired by New Zealand rugby head coach Scott Robertson.From playing both sports, Lawrence can understand why both coaches have shared ideas successfully.\"It definitely makes sense,\" he told BBC Sport. \"There's lots to learn from both sports, for example in the way teams try to contain the opposition or set up for a counter-attack.\"I saw Paris St-Germain coach Luis Enrique was watching games from the stands recently, like we do in rugby, rather than the touchline. It is only a small thing but it can make a big difference because you see the game from a different perspective.\"Arteta has been using the rugby term 'finishers' rather than 'substitutes' too. I think the first time we started using that was with Eddie [former England coach Eddie Jones] who was massive on the bench having an impact on the game, and I can see why Arteta likes that mindset.\"Image caption, Lawrence was a constant presence at centre for Bath and England before his Achilles injury in March. It robbed him of any further involvement for Bath as they lifted a first league title in 27 years and also the chance to tour Australia with the British and Irish Lions.Lawrence grew up in the midlands but became a Chelsea fan because of their kit.\"A lot of my best mates and my family support Villa, while my dad supports Wolves and my grandad was a West Brom fan - so I had a few different influences there,\" he explained.\"But when I was about five or six I went in a sports shop that had all the different shirts in there. I saw a blue one I liked so I picked that, and my dad said 'you know that's a Chelsea kit?' and I was like 'yeah - but I like it!'\"It was around 2004 or 2005, when Jose Mourinho was in charge, so it was pretty good timing to start supporting them. From then, I have stuck with them through the good times - and the not so good times too!\"Chris Sutton and Ollie Lawrence were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.Premier League predictionsSaturday, 8 NovemberTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 12:30 GMTIt's hard to know how to view Tottenham at the moment, especially at home where they have been pretty underwhelming in the Premier League so far.Spurs have taken only one point from their past four league games in their own stadium since beating Burnley on the opening weekend of the season, including last week's defeat by Chelsea when a couple of their players gave Thomas Frank the cold shoulder afterwards.They did beat Copenhagen comfortably there in the Champions League on Tuesday, but it is still hard to make a case for them to overcome Manchester United because I am not really sure where their goals are going to come from.Mind you, I am still not convinced by United either. There is no doubt they have shown strong signs of improvement but I still don't fully trust them to turn up, especially on the road.Tottenham beat United four times last season, including in the Europa League final. This time? If I had to pick a winner I would actually back United, but I don't - so I am going for a draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Ollie's prediction: Spurs will take this one. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-2Hill Dickinson Stadium, 15:00Everton were superb in the first half hour against Sunderland and, had Thierno Barry not ballooned his shot over the bar from close range at 1-0, they would have gone on to win that game.Instead it was another reminder they are missing a top-class centre-forward. I feel sorry for Toffees boss David Moyes because Beto has also missed so many wonderful opportunities that his side have created this season.Fulham's win over bottom side Wolves last week ended a run of four straight league defeats but it's hard to really gauge their form off that - it was only Wolves they beat.That makes this a really tough game to predict. I don't think there are going to be loads of goals in it, and I can see it ending up in another draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Ollie's prediction: Everton have been playing quite well, but Fulham are a good team. 2-2AI's prediction: 1-1London Stadium, 15:00Which West Ham will turn up? If they rock up and play in the manner they did when they beat Newcastle here last week then there is only one winner, but will we see Nuno Espirito Santo's side play with that same intensity? I thought Freddie Potts did well on his first senior start against the Magpies, Lucas Paqueta was at his mercurial best and Jarrod Bowen impressed me with his strong running.But the problem here is that this is exactly the kind of game where you expect West Ham to win, and they will mess it up.Burnley are awkward opponents and they have got a bit about them. They are nothing like the open and expansive side under Vincent Kompany a few years back.There was a softness about that Clarets side, which simply isn't there any more.So, West Ham are going to have to work hard to win this and maybe Callum Wilson holds the key.He was a nuisance for the Hammers last time out. It meant Bowen did not have to carry the team, and Wilson could make the difference this time too.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Ollie's prediction: West Ham to edge it. 1-0AI's prediction: 2-0Stadium of Light, 17:30Sunderland improved a lot as their game went on against Everton, but they got a real good going-over in the early stages.They cannot afford to start like that against Arsenal, who have superior players and are such a threat from set-pieces too.The Gunners don't have to play well to win, they just grind away until they find a way through.Mikel Arteta's side weren't pretty when they beat Slavia Prague in the Champions League but they don't care, and why should they?Some of the football they play might get people asking whether that is the way you'd want to win a title, but do you think the Arsenal players will be bothered when they are popping open the champagne?It is about knowing how to do it, not how you do it. There is a lot of the old '1-0 to the Arsenal' in this current Gunners team, although I do expect them to take more goals off other teams at times.It is at the back where they are so strong. Can Sunderland cause them problems? Absolutely, but I think this latest Arsenal win will come off the back of another Arsenal clean sheet.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Ollie's prediction: This should be quite comfortable for Arsenal. 0-3AI's prediction: 0-3Stamford Bridge, 20:00Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said after Wednesday's draw with Qarabag that he is rotating his team so much because the Club World Cup is taking its toll on his squad.That must be a factor in their inconsistency, but I don't think it will matter here because Wolves have been such a rabble recently.He has gone now but after last weekend's 3-0 defeat by Fulham, their former boss Vitor Pereira said that technically, tactically and physically they were not at the required level, and I don't expect anything to change at Stamford Bridge.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Ollie on Chelsea's prospects: Hopefully we are making a turn for the better now. We just need to be a bit more consistent, so having a few defenders stay fit would be great and getting Cole Palmer back from injury would definitely help too.Ollie's prediction: I'd back us to win this, it is just whether we can keep a clean sheet. It's either 3-1 or 3-0 so I am going to be confident and say we will keep them out. 3-0AI's prediction: 3-1Sunday, 9 NovemberVilla Park, 14:00Aston Villa were on a really good run until they lost at Liverpool last weekend, and they were quite unlucky at Anfield too.Even so, I find it very difficult to write Bournemouth off in games like this. They can cause any team problems and I always feel like they will score.I admire Villa boss Unai Emery for sticking to his guns tactically. He has his principles and even with people talking about teams having success by going direct this season, he hasn't changed his approach.That might have given Liverpool a bit of encouragement, however, and it may give Bournemouth some encouragement too.Playing in the Europa League on Thursday won't help Villa either, and that toll of games could catch up with them at some point.The Cherries rescued a point with a 96th-minute goal in this fixture last season and I have a feeling it will end up all square this time too.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Ollie's prediction: Bournemouth are going to score because Antoine Semenyo is on fire, but I am going with Villa to win. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-0Gtech Community Stadium, 14:00I didn't recognise Newcastle when I watched them lose at West Ham last weekend.They were better when they beat Athletic Club at St James' Park in the Champions League in midweek, but their away form - or lack of it - must be a concern for boss Eddie Howe.They are still solid defensively most of the time but scoring goals seems a particular problem for them when they are on the road. I can see why from watching that West Ham game because they just did not work the goalkeeper enough.The way Brentford play under Keith Andrews, he is happy to set them up to play on the counter-attack even when they are at home, and I can see Newcastle struggling to break them down too.I know I have gone for a few draws already this week, but this game smells of another one to me.Sutton's prediction: 0-0Ollie's prediction: This will end up in a draw. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-3Selhurst Park, 14:00The M23 derby is one of my favourite games.Crystal Palace won it home and away last season but it's so hard to call this time.The two teams are next to each other in mid-table, with Palace ninth, one place above Brighton.Both teams won comfortably last week too, but Palace have got the Uefa Conference League on Thursday and that is going to affect them.Without Europe, I probably would have gone for the Eagles to win but the more I think about it, the more I think the Seagulls will get something.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Ollie's prediction: I am backing Brighton to nick this. 1-2AI's prediction: 1-2City Ground, 14:00This is a big game for both teams because they could both really do with a positive result going into the international break.Nottingham Forest nearly got over the line against Manchester United last week and they had a bit of spirit about the way they played, but Sean Dyche is still waiting for his first Premier League win with them and he will want to get that monkey off his back.Leeds have done pretty well at Elland Road but, so far, the only time they have picked up any points or even scored a goal away from home was when they beat bottom side Wolves in September.Their fragility on the road means this is a great opportunity for Forest, even though they play away in Europe on Thursday.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Ollie's prediction: Neither side is doing too well at the moment but I feel like Forest's luck has to turn after last season. 1-0AI's prediction: 2-1Etihad Stadium, 16:30Did Liverpool turn a corner with their great win over Real Madrid in midweek? Maybe, but this will show us where they are really at.I feel like a lot of the time these two teams have cancelled each other out when they have met in recent years, but this time it feels like a game they both have to try to win - and it is City I am backing to come out on top.The big call for all Fantasy Premier League managers is whether to triple-captain Erling Haaland. I am not going to do that, but I do think he will score - seriously, how can you go into any game at the moment and think he won't?Whoever wins this, I feel like both teams are fighting for second place anyway, because I don't see anyone catching Arsenal now.People sometimes get angry when I say things like that but I do think they will win the title from here and I have changed my prediction from before the season started, when I went for Liverpool. I don't often do that so early, but I don't think Liverpool can win it any more - we've already seen in the first 10 games how, defensively, they are too vulnerable, and then you look at how good Arsenal are at the back.It is a similar story with City. I feel they will need Rodri at his very best to push the Gunners, but his injury problems don't appear to be over.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Ollie's prediction: I can see this being a game where City go 2-0 up, Liverpool get back into it and then City score another one at the end. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-2How did Sutton do last week?Chris was trailing the collective efforts of the BBC readers until the final two matches of week nine, but then got two exact scores from Manchester City's 3-1 win over Bournemouth and Everton's 1-1 draw at Sunderland.That meant Chris ended up with eight correct results from 10 matches, including those two exact scores, for a total of 140 points.He edged out the BBC readers, who got seven correct results with two exact scores, for a total of 130 points.AI, who won outright for the first time in week eight, did not come close to a repeat triumph. It got six correct results with one exact score, giving it 90 points.Chris' guests, the computer game Football Manager 26 and Miles Jacobson, the studio director of the company behind it, finished further back.FM26 got four correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 40 points, while Miles got four correct results with one exact score, giving him 70 points. That meant they ended up with an average score of 55 points that counts towards the guests' total in the table below.Weekly wins, ties and total points after week 10WinsTiesPointsChris40770Guests21640You20910AI11760Source: BBCGuest leaderboard 2025-26PointsJames Skelly190James Walsh110Addison from JJFC100You *91Rod Jones80Chris Sutton *77AI *76Kid Wild& Miles Jacobson70Mark Collins& Tommy Longhurst60Blanco, Orlando Bloom,Theo Ellis & Tom Grennan50Football Manager 2640Aya from JJC30Katherine Parlour10* Average after 10 weeksSource: BBC",

Alongside Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York and the governor races in New Jersey and West Virginia, the party also won important - albeit less glamorous - races in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nIn this episode, Justin, Anthony and Sarah unpack how and where the Democrats won, and what it means for the party and next year’s midterm elections.\nFor Republicans, the inquest has already begun into a bruising night for the party that has raised fears ahead of the 2026 midterms and the party’s congressional majority. Donald Trump is blaming poor results on the ongoing government shutdown and his name not being on the ballot.\nAnd we’re joined by Jim Messina, a Democrat strategist and former deputy chief of staff to Barack Obama. He gives his take on what he thinks lies behind Tuesday’s wins, what he thinks the party has learned since 2024 and whether he agrees with Prop 50 - the redistricting measures passed in California to redraw the state’s political lines to favour Democrats.\nHOSTS:\n* Sarah Smith, North America editor\n* Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n* Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGUEST:\n* Jim Messina, Former deputy chief of staff to Barack Obama\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed again until November 20265 hours agoLaura CressRockstarGrand Theft Auto 6 tells the story of lovers Jason and LuciaGrand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed - for a second time - until 19 November 2026.One of the most anticipated gaming releases ever, the sequel by developer Rockstar Games was due to come out in May 2026.It had already been postponed once before, from autumn 2025. But in a statement on Thursday, Rockstar said it needed extra months to to finish the game with the level of polish fans had come to \"expect and deserve\".GTA 5, the latest in the series, was released in 2013 and is the second best-selling game of all time.Despite being 12 years old, it remains extremely popular with fans today due to its online mode.In its statement, Rockstar said it was \"sorry for adding additional time\" to a long wait and thanked fans for their patience.It said it was \"incredibly excited\" for players to experience the game's setting of Leonida - a fictional US state based on Florida - and a modern-day version of the Miami-inspired Vice City.The announcement follows the firing of 31 workers from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October.The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, has accused the developer of sacking UK staff to stop them unionising.Members led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday. The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment.IWGBPickets have taken place outside Take-Two Interactive's UK head office in London.Rockstar has stayed tight-lipped about GTA 6, releasing only two trailers so far, with the second arriving in May this year.With over 100 million views, the nearly three-minute video gave players more insight into the backstory of protagonists Jason and Lucia - a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida - as well as revealing new characters and map locations.Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism, with its previous big release - Red Dead Redemption 2 - delayed by roughly a year from its original release date.Increased demand for complexity and scope from players, as well as soaring development costs, has meant publishers are less willing to take risks on unfinished products.When it finally lands, GTA 6 is likely to be one of the most expensive video games ever made, but also expected to set records with its launch sales.Whether it will live up to the hype remains to be seen.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesMore airlines are banning the use and charging of power banks during flightsA man has caught fire at Melbourne international airport after a lithium power bank in his pocket ignited, leaving him with burns to his leg and fingers.The man, aged in his 50s, was in the Qantas business lounge on Thursday morning when the overheated power bank burst into flames, filling the exclusive area with smoke and prompting about 150 people to be evacuated.Staff quickly helped the man into a shower before paramedics arrived to treat his injuries. He was taken to hospital in a stable condition and later released.A witness said they saw \"battery acid flying everywhere,\" according to the Age newspaper. A Qantas spokesperson said the lounge was cleaned and re-opened two hours later.Australian film producer Leanne Tonkes was in the lounge on Thursday morning when she heard the commotion. She posted an image of the burnt power bank moments after it had exploded.\"Hoping the man who caught fire holding it is ok,\" she wrote on Instagram.\"Quick thinking from the man who jumped in to help and the staff who got him in the shower and everyone else out of the lounge.\"Qantas is currently reviewing its policy on passengers carrying any type of lithium batteries, including portable power banks, and is expected to provide an update shortly.Many airlines now advise passengers travelling with power banks to keep them within reach - either in their seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front of them - and not in the overhead luggage compartment.In July, a fire broke out on a Virgin Australia flight from Sydney to Hobart, with a power bank in an overhead locker to blame. The airline is looking to update its policy and customers are asked to keep portable power banks \"in sight and within easy reach\" during flights.A portable power bank was also likely the cause of a fire that engulfed and destroyed a passenger plane in South Korea in January. Several international airlines such as Emirates, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines have banned the use of power banks and the charging of them during flights.There are also limits on how many rechargeable batteries passengers can carry based on their capacity. For instance, some airlines only allow two power banks with a capacity between 100Wh and 160Wh. ",

    "body": "A British grandmother who spent 12 years on death row in Indonesia after being convicted of drug trafficking flew home on Friday, as part of a deal between the UK and Indonesian governments.Lindsay Sandiford, 69, was sentenced to death on the island of Bali in 2013, after she was found with nearly 5kg of cocaine worth £1.6m ($2.1m) when she arrived on a flight from Thailand in 2012.Indonesia has some of the world's most stringent drug laws, but it has freed several high-profile detainees, including the infamous \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, in the past year.Sandiford was repatriated along with another British national Shahab Shahabadi, who had been serving a life sentence for drug smuggling.Their flight left Bali at about 00:30 local time (16:30 GMT Thursday), Indonesian officials said. Sandiford and Shahabadi were both said to be suffering from health problems while in prison. Last month, Indonesia's senior law and human rights minister, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, said Sandiford was \"seriously ill\" while Shahabadi had \"various serious illnesses, including mental health issues\", AFP news agency reported.Sandiford attended a press conference in the Bali prison in a wheelchair hours before she was due to fly home.She had admitted to the offences in 2013, but said she only agreed to carry the cocaine after a drug syndicate threatened to kill her son.The UK's Deputy Ambassador to Indonesia Matthew Downing said Sandiford and Shahabadi were being repatriated on \"humanitarian grounds\". They will be given necessary treatment while being \"governed by the law and procedures of the UK\" upon their return, he added.In December 2024, Indonesia repatriated the five remaining members of the \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, after they served nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons. The two ringleaders were executed by firing squad in 2015.Also in December, Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was repatriated to the Philippines. The mother of two, who was nearly executed, had always maintained she was tricked into carrying the drugs found on her.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesReutersMeghan Markle and Prince Harry look on in the third inning between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers during Game 4 of the 2025 MLB World Series at Dodger Stadium. The Duke of Sussex has apologised to Canada for wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers hat while attending a World Series game against the Toronto Blue Jays.Prince Harry joked that he was \"under duress\" when he wore the bright blue cap during the epic Game 4 of the World Series in Los Angeles. He thought it was \"the polite thing to do\" after being invited to the game by the Dodgers' owner.His headgear choice upset many in Canada - a Commonwealth nation- who criticised him for not showing his allegiance to the realm, or to the only Canadian team in Major League Baseball. Prince Harry's father King Charles is the head of state of Canada and of 13 other Commonwealth realms. \"Firstly, I would like to apologise to Canada for wearing it,\" he said in a CTV interview while in the commonwealth this week for Remembrance events. \"Secondly, I was under duress. There wasn't much choice.\"The prince - wearing a Blue Jays hat during the interview - quipped that \"when you're missing a lot of hair on top, and you're sitting under flood lights, you'll take any hat that's available\".He plans to wear a Blue Jays hat from now on and rooted for the Toronto team in subsequent games, appearing to do so in a clip posted on social media by the Duchess of Sussex - a Los Angeles native - when the Dodgers won the series in Game 7 a few days later.Prince Harry, who was given a Blue Jays hat while meeting with Canada's oldest veterans on Thursday, also said that admitting that he is a Toronto fan would likely make his  reception in California more difficult. Nathan Denette /The Canadian Press via APPrince Harry received a Toronto Blue Jays hat as he meets with some of Canada's oldest veterans, joining them in a creative arts program at Sunnybrook Hospital's veterans centre in Toronto on Thursday.The prince and his wife, a former actress who lived in Canada while filming her TV drama Suits, moved to California after stepping back as full-time royals in 2020.The couple's presence in the Chavez Ravine-set stadium in Los Angeles also disgruntled many Dodgers fans in the US. They took to social media to voice their upset over the couple's plum front-row seats during the 18-inning game, while local legends such as Magic Johnson and former pitcher Dodgers Sandy Koufax were seated behind them. Incidentally, Prince Harry published an essay this week about \"What it means to be British\" ahead of his visits with military veterans in Canada this week.In it, he said \"banter\" in pubs and sports grounds and a spirit of good-humoured \"self-deprecation\" are some of the things that he loves about Britain and what he thinks define British culture.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSPOILER WARNING - The Celebrity Traitors winner is revealed in today's newspapers review. The Times leads with the latest on the forthcoming Budget, noting that Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"has informed the Office of Budget Responsibility that a rise in personal taxation is one of the 'major measures' on tax and spending she is preparing to announce\". The paper writes this move is the \"clearest signal yet that the chancellor is preparing to break Labour's manifesto pledge not to increase income tax rates\". Ahead of the 2024 election, Labour vowed not to increase taxes on national insurance, income tax and VAT.\"Labour splits at the top\" over Reeves's mooted budget tax rises, reports the Metro newspaper. The paper writes the newly elected deputy leader of the Labour Party. Lucy Powell, \"warns the PM [Sir Keir Starmer] and Chancellor that breaching the party manifesto pledge on taxes would damage 'trust in politics'\".The Guardian also leads with Powell's \"challenge to Reeves\" to not follow through with tax increases. It also features a tribute of Pauline Collins, who died aged 85, known as the Oscar-nominated star of the 1990 film Shirley Valentine.Interest rates \"kept on hold at 4% in knife-edge BoE [Bank of England] decision\" is the top story in the Financial Times. Policymakers voted 5-4 in favour of leaving rates unchanged, after \"cutting rates five times since 2024\". It reports BoE governor Andrew Bailey, who voted to keep rates on hold, \"could change his stance in favour of a rate cut as soon as December\".\"Grinning Billy Smith laughed as he gave himself up at the jail that mistakenly freed him,\" headlines the Metro newspaper, leading on the latest development on the two men mistakenly released from Wandsworth prison earlier this week. It writes Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy \"was asked five times in the Commons whether more asylum seekers had been freed in error\". He has since promised the \"strongest checks ever\" to prevent further errors.The Daily Mirror leads with the US Democrats' formal request for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to appear before a congressional committee to give evidence about his connections to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \"More pressure for ex-prince on day he officially lost his title,\" is the paper's take.\"Andrew is summoned to US Congress\" also tops the Sun, quoting the Democrats' letter suggesting the former prince could hold \"valuable information\" on Epstein.Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is calling for BBC Director General Tim Davie to \"'explain or resign' over the bias scandal engulfing the broadcaster\", the Daily Telegraph reports in its lead. Earlier this week, the paper \"disclosed that a Panorama documentary had spliced together different parts of a speech by Mr Trump and made it seem as though he had told supporters to go to the Capitol and 'fight like hell' on the day of the 2021 riot\", quoting a leaked complaint. In response, the BBC has said it does not comment on leaks and that it considers feedback carefully. The Telegraph contrasts the Panorama response with the BBC's decision yesterday to uphold 20 complaints relating to \"Martine Croxall, the BBC newsreader who rolled her eyes while changing the phrase 'pregnant people' to 'pregnant women'\", saying she \"broke impartiality rules\". The Daily Mail also leads with accusations of \"double standards\" levelled at the BBC over its impartiality, including from Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. The Celebrity Traitors finale is also splashed on the front page, revealing comedian Alan Carr as the winner – describing his gameplay as \"ruthless\".\"Carr Smash\" reads the Daily Star's headline, referring to Alan Carr being declared the victor of the Celebrity Traitors. Fans are questioning \"how on Earth could the Faithfuls miss that? They're 100% numpties\", in reference to non-traitors playing in the popular show.\"Nigel Farage ramps up calls for parliamentary probe into grooming scandal,\" is the headline of the Daily Express. It reports on Farage's remarks, saying \"grooming gang survivors fear the government's national inquiry is 'less about the truth and more about a cover-up\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "6 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentThe government has recovered £74m from excessive profits made by companies running asylum accommodation, the BBC can reveal.The Home Office said it had recouped the money following a review of contracts after Labour came to power last year.Ministers had faced criticism from MPs for neglecting day-to-day management of the contracts.But the amount recouped remains a small percentage of the overall cost of asylum accommodation.Home Office figures show the overall cost was £2.1bn in 24/25 - an average of about £5.77m per day.That makes the sum recovered less than the cost for the government of accommodation every fortnight.Accommodation providers had previously told Parliament they would be returning some profits to the government, under the terms of their contracts.The cost to the taxpayer of the contracts has increased significantly since they were signed.Dame Karen Bradley, the Conservative chair of the home affairs select committee, said the recovery was \"welcome\" but only a \"first step\".She added: \"This is only a small part of the many billions that the contracts have and will cost. \"The government must now set out its long term plan for how it will deliver a resilient and cost effective asylum accommodation system.\"Ministers have promised to end the use of asylum hotels before the next general election - and the prime minister has said he would like to bring that deadline forward.But the Home Office has also sought to bring down the immediate costs of hotels and other types of accommodation, like private flats.The costs for 2024/25 were a reduction from the previous year - when accommodation cost £3bn - or £8.3m per day.Much of that was down to reducing the average nightly cost per person, as a result of room sharing and cheaper accommodation being used. Ministers are also planning to use alternative accommodation- such as military sites - to house asylum seekers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"This government inherited asylum hotel contracts that were not delivering good value for taxpayers' money.\"We have already saved £700m in hotel costs. Now we are recouping millions more in excess profits. And by the end of this parliament, we will have closed every asylum hotel.\"Last month, the Home Office was strongly criticised by the home affairs committee for its handling of asylum accommodation.MPs on the committee said the government had \"squandered\" billions of pounds of taxpayer money.They also accused the Home Office of under-utilising mechanisms to reclaim excess profits made by accommodation providers.There are break clauses in some contracts that would allow ministers to end use of some accommodation in 2026.The home secretary told the BBC last week that all options were on the table - and that she would study the legal arrangements \"carefully\".Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: \"The only way to end this crisis is to end the use of hotels altogether. \"The Home office is spending £5.77m per day on asylum hotels, meaning these savings will disappear in just 12 days.\"The truth is the Labour government is accommodating more illegal immigrants in hotels than at the election, and the first nine months of this year have been the worst in history for illegal immigrants crossing the Channel.\"\"Only the Conservative Party has a serious, hard-edged plan to take control of our borders,\" the shadow home secretary added.",

    "body": "McDonald's faces new crackdown on sexual abuse4 hours agoNoor Nanji & Zoe ConwayBBC NewsGetty ImagesMcDonald's will bring in new sexual harassment training for managers in strengthened measures agreed with the equality watchdog to protect its staff from abuse.The move was \"in response to serious allegations raised\", the watchdog said, after it initially intervened in the company.A BBC investigation two years ago was told that workers, some as young as 17, were being groped and harassed. Earlier this year, McDonald's staff told us they still faced sexual abuse and harassment. McDonald's said it welcomed the new measures, adding that they would \"build on the significant progress we have already made in this space\". But one former worker said the announcement would not make a difference.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is now extending its original plan agreed in 2023 to protect staff at the fast-food chain from sexual harassment.The new training will focus on the grooming of young workers and the use of social media.McDonald's has agreed to bring in an external body to review whether it was handling sexual harassment claims appropriately, the EHRC said.The new measures apply to McDonald's restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales. Although franchises are not directly party to the agreement it is expected that they will adopt some of the action points.McDonald's - A toxic workplace for teenagers?The fast-food chain signed its legally binding agreement with the EHRC in February 2023.The BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's after that agreement was signed. In July 2023, the BBC heard from more than 100 current and recent workers at the fast-food chain who claimed they faced sexual assault, harassment, racism and bullying.At the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.But since then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations, while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.In January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.One former McDonald's employee, who previously spoke up as part of the BBC's initial investigation, said she did not think the changes would make any difference.\"They've looked at what they can possibly do, in terms of what will sound promising enough, but not actually what will bring change,\" she said.\"I don't actually think they have any personal desire to make the change, I don't think they care enough,\" she added.\"It's a check box for them to tick, like just with the training, it's something on a to-do list and they think they'll do it and it'll go away, but it just won't happen.\"Earlier this year, law firm Leigh Day said it had been instructed to start legal action against McDonald's by hundreds of staff and former staff, with more than 450 restaurants implicated in the claims.\"I think we can assume that the equality watchdog wouldn't be taking this action if things were ok at McDonald's,\" Leigh Day employment lawyer Kiran Daurka said.\"They already had their initial agreement with McDonald's in 2023. So the EHRC appear to be concerned that not enough progress has been made.\"Ms Daurka said the firm would like to see \"more interrogation\" of the relationship between the corporate side of the business and the franchises, \"as we've seen how issues of sexual harassment can fall between the gaps\".Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chairwoman of the EHRC, said: \"After serious allegations were raised, we decided we needed to update the action plan with stronger actions that were more specific to the way McDonald's operates.\"We're pleased with the significant steps McDonald's has agreed to take towards a safer working environment for its staff and recognise the hard work they've done so far.\"Other measures to which McDonald's is now committing include strengthening risk assessments and continuing to encourage staff to speak out when something feels wrong.It will work with external experts to design and implement a new safeguarding plan to protect vulnerable workers, to be rolled out across McDonald's restaurants and franchisees' restaurants.\"Once completed, the actions that make up this legal agreement will ensure that there is zero tolerance for harassment at McDonald's and there are clear routes to report and resolve complaints if it does occur,\" Baroness Falkner said.Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers Union which represents food workers, said there needed to be \"real change\" at McDonald's.\"It's a huge problem. Workers should be entitled to go work without being sexually harassed, and employers should have a duty to act,\" he told BBC News.Other claims the BBC heard include:A 19-year-old worker said managers would \"touch up\" other members of staff and some colleagues were scared of going into work. He quit the branch in the Midlands last year.A 21-year-old worker said managers had inappropriately touched her and customers sexually harassed her. When she raised it, she said she was told to \"suck it up\". She quit her job in the West Midlands at the end of 2023.A 16-year-old employee based in the West Midlands said he had been bullied, shouted at and sworn at by managers.A 20-year-old said a male manager had sent her topless pictures. She left her McDonald's branch in the East of England in August last year.Earlier this year, the watchdog wrote to every McDonald's in Britain warning that their owners could face legal action if they failed to take steps to protect staff from sexual abuse.The boss of McDonald's in the UK has been summoned twice to Parliament to answer questions in front of MPs since the BBC's initial investigation.In January, Alistair Macrow said 29 people had been dismissed over sexual harassment allegations over the past 12 months. Mr Macrow left McDonald's in September.A McDonald's spokesperson said: \"Over the last three years, alongside our franchisees, we have embedded an extensive set of robust and far-reaching initiatives, as part of our steadfast commitment to ensuring a safe working environment in McDonald's restaurants.\"We welcome the fact that these measures have been formalised within the latest EHRC agreement. This will build on the significant progress we have already made in this space.\"The agreement incorporates many of our existing measures which have been developed in consultation with leading experts. This includes a range of initiatives, from enhanced training programmes and onboarding practices, to the launch of a new digital Speak Up channel designed with our crew - for our crew, providing a 24/7 channel that reflects the way young people feel most comfortable engaging.\"We are confident the measures we have implemented are working and making a difference to the 148,000 people currently employed by McDonald's and our Franchisees across the UK today. In the latest anonymous employee survey, 95% of people are aware of ways in which they can speak up.\"We look forward to continuing our work with the EHRC and believe it will help us remain at the forefront of the industry when it comes to creating a safe and respectful workplace culture that embeds safeguarding across every one of our restaurants.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "Manfred Goldberg, a Holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to educating school children about the genocide of European Jews during World War Two, has died aged 95.Mr Goldberg was just 11 years old when he, his mother Rosa and his younger brother Hermann were deported to the Riga Ghetto in Latvia in 1941 before he was moved to the Stutthof concentration camp.After being liberated by the British army in May 1945, Mr Goldberg and his mother moved to the UK the following year to be reunited with his father who escaped just before the war began. His younger brother did not survive.He was made an MBE by the King in September for his services to Holocaust remembrance and education.\"He was truly extraordinary,\" said Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, adding: \"Manfred understood the power of education. He spent decades sharing his story with young people across the country.\"At the beginning of the year, Mr Goldberg visited children in Shropshire to talk about his experiences, describing the \"hell on earth\" that followed when the Nazis closed his Jewish school in Germany, where he was born in 1930, and deported him.Between then and being imprisoned in a number of concentration camps, Mr Goldberg's brother was taken away, \"his fate unknown\", said the trust.When he came to the UK, Mr Goldberg learned English and went on to complete an engineering degree. Learning was important to him, according to the trust \"having been forced out of education as a young child\". In 1961, he met his wife Shary and they went onto to have four sons, several grandchildren and one great grandchild.Mr Goldberg visited a school in Newport earlier this year as Holocaust Memorial Day marked the 80-year anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on 27 January 1945.He told pupils: \"My purpose for coming here is because what happened must never be forgotten, in order to make sure it can never ever happen again.\"He said: \"Once people understand what the Holocaust represents, I think every single one of them contributes to preventing it ever happening again.\"Silence never helps the oppressed.\"More than six million Jewish men, women and children were murdered by the Nazis between 1939 and 1945. Hundreds of thousands of Romani people were also killed by the regime, as were gay men and political opponents of the Nazis. ",

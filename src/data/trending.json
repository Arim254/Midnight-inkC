    "body": "7 minutes agoAlexander Ledermanin Tucson, ArizonaReutersPolice activity connected to the search for Nancy Guthrie, the missing mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie, is under way at a residence about two miles from her home.Armed police teams have been seen coming in and going from the area, with a sheriff's vehicle blocking the road.It comes after local officials said investigators had found DNA at Guthrie's address which does not belong to her or anyone close to her.The 84-year-old disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, nearly two weeks ago. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.In a social media post, the sheriff's department said \"law enforcement activity\" was ongoing \"related to the Guthrie case\" without providing further details.More than a dozen law enforcement vehicles, both marked and unmarked, have been seen in the area by BBC News, including Swat teams and forensics.Investigators have also found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home.The sheriff's department said reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property are inaccurate. All collected evidence has been sent for laboratory analysis, they added.It said investigators had been able to establish identifying details about the suspect after analysing footage from a doorbell camera outside Guthrie's home.Getty ImagesSavannah Guthrie and her mother US news anchor Nancy GuthrieThe suspect was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack in the footage, the FBI said. After the doorbell footage was released, investigators received more than 13,000 tips, including 4,000 in the 24 hours.The FBI has also increased the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.The county sheriff department said the suspect description \"remains a key focus\", adding: \"However, investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities.\" Investigators have also issued a wider appeal for video footage from Guthrie's neighbours.Police have said Nancy Guthrie, 84, needs daily medication and has limited mobility.Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's abductor.They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her safe return.Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's home",

    "body": "Queen's letter of support left Pelicot 'overwhelmed'  2 hours agoTiffany WertheimerPA MediaThe Queen is a long-standing campaigner on domestic and sexual violenceRape survivor Gisèle Pelicot has said she felt \"overwhelmed\" and \"very honoured\" to receive a personal letter of support from Queen Camilla.The Queen had commended Ms Pelicot for her \"courage\" and \"grace\", writing: \"I very much wanted to write to express my heartfelt admiration for the courage, grace and dignity with which you have faced the horrific crimes committed against you.\"Over the course of nearly a decade, Ms Pelicot was repeatedly drugged and raped by her then-husband, who also invited men he met online to abuse her as well.  The Queen told Ms Pelicot that she had \"inspired women across the globe\" and \"created a powerful legacy that will change the narrative around shame, forever\".Gisèle Pelicot waived her right to anonymity during the 2024 trial to make the \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist. She became a global figurehead of strength and feminism, and during the 15-week trial in Avignon, supporters stood outside the court every day with signs thanking Ms Pelicot for her courage, and calling for justice.\"It was an honour for me to receive this letter, I wasn't expecting it at all,\" Ms Pelicot, 73, told Victoria Derbyshire for BBC Newsnight.\"I was overwhelmed that the Queen could send me this letter.\"CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFP via Getty ImagesCrowds of  supporters greeted Pelicot outside the Avignon courthouse every day of the trialThe Queen is a long-standing campaigner on domestic and sexual violence and has worked with organisations that support survivors for years.\"Thank you for all that you have done,\" she wrote to Ms Pelicot. \"You are very much in my thoughts and prayers, and I hope that you will now be able to rest and recover from this devastating ordeal.\"It is the first time the contents of the letter have been revealed. But with the Queen and Ms Pelicot's permission, it was shared with the BBC during Ms Pelicot's interview with Newsnight ahead of the release of her memoir: A Hymn To Life.Ms Pelicot said she was surprised and felt \"very honoured\" when she received the note, \"because although my words touched the whole world, I wasn't expecting a letter from the Court of England\". \"I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoIan CaseyGetty ImagesGordon Ramsay and David Beckham pictured together in 2019Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsay has said Sir David and Lady Victoria Beckham are \"good parents\" and that time will help heal their relationship with son Brooklyn, in the wake of a public family fall out.In a series of Instagram posts in January, following months of online speculation of a feud, Brooklyn said he did not want to \"reconcile\" with his family.He also made a series of claims about his parents, many relating to his wedding to Nicola Peltz - an American actress and the daughter of a billionaire businessman. The Beckhams have yet to formally respond.One of the most explosive claims Brooklyn made is that Lady Beckham \"hijacked\" the first dance at his wedding, which - he says - had been planned \"weeks in advance\" to a romantic love song.\"She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life,\" he said.A report from British Vogue, who were at the wedding, said: \"Brooklyn invited his mother on stage for a dance and they were joined by David and their 10-year-old daughter, Harper.\"In his interview with the Sun, Ramsay, who was at the wedding, insisted nothing \"salacious\" or \"inappropriate\" took place.Ramsay said \"the relationship with David and Brooklyn is very, very deep and I know how much David loves Brooklyn\".\"I think it's only going to be a matter of time before Brooklyn takes a good look at himself,\" the chef said.He added: \"It's easy to get up on that roller coaster and get carried away, but it will come back\". Asked if he had spoken to Brooklyn, Ramsay said they had messaged \"a little bit\" and that he \"loves him\".\"He's desperate to stand on his own two feet,\" Ramsay said, but he urged Brooklyn to remember \"one day you're not going to have your Mum and Dad\".Ramsay was speaking to the Sun ahead of the release of his new Netflix documentary Being Gordon Ramsay.Sir David has not directly discussed the fall out, but speaking generally about social media in January, he said children are \"allowed to make mistakes\".",

    "body": "Trump says Iran regime change is 'best thing that could happen'7 hours agoHarry SekulichReuters/ EPATrump previously refused to back calls to replace the government led by Ayatollah Ali KhameneiUS President Donald Trump says regime change in Iran is \"the best thing that could happen\", signifying one of his clearest endorsements for replacing the clerical establishment.\"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives,\" he said on Friday.Trump declined to specify who he wants to lead Iran, but noted \"there are people\" who could take over. Iran's clerical ruler Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not yet responded to Trump's latest remarks.Meanwhile, the US sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to add pressure on Iran to secure a nuclear deal.The USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship and the newest US aircraft carrier, is set to relocate \"very soon\" from the Caribbean to the Middle East, Trump said. On his Truth Social platform, Trump shared an aerial photograph of the carrier,  which appears in transit on its way to join a second US vessel – the USS Abraham Lincoln – already stationed in the Middle East.The Pentagon sent the aircraft carrier in January after the US threatened to strike Iran to stop a government crackdown on mass protests in which thousands of people were killed.The wave of demonstrations marked some of the most dramatic upheavals in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, which installed the clerical system led by a Supreme Leader.While Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no nuclear agreement can be reached, he insisted after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday at the White House that talks with Tehran would continue.Speaking at Fort Bragg on Friday evening, Trump said Iran should \"give us a deal that they should have given us the first time\" when asked what the Middle East country should do to avoid an attack.The US has pushed for Iran to halt its uranium enrichment, while Netanyahu's government has insisted Tehran should cut its ballistic missiles programme and support for proxy groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.Iran has so far suggested it is ready to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, but the country's President Masoud Pezeshkian warned it would \"not yield to their excessive demands\".Trump withdrew the US from an Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran in his first term in office and reinstated sanctions that have severely strained its economy. The administration restarted talks last year to reach a new deal before the 12-day war between Israel and Iran.",

Adam Ernest Pickard beat seven other comedians in the jokey battle royale at De Montfort Hall on Monday to claim the 2026 title.The 22-year-old Master's student said the UK Pun Championships show, which was hosted by comedian Jason Byrne and involved comics competing in a boxing ring, was the biggest of his career so far.\"It's just very overwhelming, but very exciting as well,\" he said.Pickard got the audience laughing with his wisecrack: \"The song Greensleeves was composed by Henry VIII. I'd play some of it here, but it's not royalty-free.\"He also quipped: \"I've compiled everyone who works at my local takeaway pizza place into a book. It's my Domino's Who's Who.\"Another gag went: \"Only women can use the herbal dumbbells. Thyme weights for no man.\"'Always loved comedy'Pickard said he thought winning the award was a \"very elaborate prank\". \"I'm very overwhelmed,\" he said. \"It's the biggest gig I've ever done and I'm very pleased that there is a competition for something that I'm good at.\"It's a skill I've always liked, rushing puns. It's something I've always been good at.\"I've always loved comedy.

You get a lot of very interesting shows here,\" he said. \"I really wish I could have stayed longer than I did.\"The festival, now in its 33rd year, comprises 700 shows across 76 venues in Leicester and Leicestershire.It features known comedians including actor and writer Sir Stephen Fry and Sue Perkins, and up-and-coming talent.Michael Harris-Wakelam, chief executive of Big Difference Company - the charity behind the festival - said: \"The skill on display this year was outstanding. \"This event is a flagship of our festivals programme and celebrates and champions the art involved in great word play. \"Congratulations to all involved and to our worthy winner.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours ago\"Palestine Action ban ruled unlawful in blow to ministers\" leads the Guardian, after the High Court ruled on Friday that the decision to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation was unlawful. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will appeal the decision, which the paper says will leave the fates of the 2,500 people who have been arrested for their support of the group uncertain.The Mail has focused on Lord Mandelson, and claims he took \"ghost flights\" on a Russian oligarch's private jet to a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, while serving as EU trade commissioner. The paper also features a photo of British skeleton racer Matt Weston, who won a gold medal in the Winter Olympics in Italy on Friday night.Weston is also front and centre of the Times, which highlights the fact that it is Team GB's first medal of the games. But the paper leads on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's upcoming speech at the annual Munich Security Conference. It says he will use the moment to launch his \"strongest attack to date\" on Reform UK and the Green Party, declaring both \"ideological extremists who would undermine Britain's national security\". Reform says the comments come from a \"prime minister on the verge of being hounded out of office\", while the Greens said he is a \"caretaker prime minister running scared\".The Electoral Commission has said that ministers do not have sufficient reasons to delay local elections, according to the Telegraph. Vijay Rangarajan, the chief executive of the watchdog, told the paper that ministers had created a \"conflict of interest\" by allowing councillors to decide whether ballots should be postponed. The government is in the midst of a major overhaul of local government structures, and has previously said the \"vast majority\" of elections would still be going ahead.An interview with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay leads the Sun. He told the paper that Brooklyn Beckham, who has had a \"bitter falling-out\" with his parents, needs to remember where he came from. The chef is a close family friend of Sir David and Lady Victoria Beckham, and the paper says he has been \"acting as peacemaker\".The Prince of Wales is pictured alongside Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on the front page of the Mirror, with the headline: \"A stain on the family\". The paper alleges that Prince William clashed with King Charles III and the late Queen Elizabeth over his uncle's 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, and told them that Mountbatten-Windsor was a threat to the monarchy.The weekend edition of the i also hones in on the former prince, reporting that his former royal protection officer has spoken to police \"offering to help their inquiry into links\" with Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously strenuously denied any wrongdoing relating to the convicted sex offender.Meanwhile, the FT reports on quotes from the chief executive of London's Heathrow Airport, who said that passengers in the \"wrong place\" make it feel overcrowded. \"The problem is that all the British people keep to the left and normally Europeans keep to the right,\" he said.The Express leads with its own campaign to honour emergency workers who put their \"lives on the line\" with a medal.And in the Daily Star, \"race ace\" jockey Ruby Walsh is guest editing the Saturday edition. He says: \"Cheltenham's the best of Britain\".The Times reports that Thames Valley Police have held \"informal discussions\" with the government about emails and documents relating to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Jeffrey Epstein. The paper says police are assessing whether there are grounds for an investigation into emails suggesting the former prince leaked confidential information to Epstein. Government sources have told the BBC they are not aware of any discussions but it would not be surprising if they had happened between civil servants and the police. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing.  Thames Valley Police have been approached for comment.The Daily Mail leads on claims that when he was European Union trade commissioner in 2004, Lord Mandelson travelled on a private jet belonging to a Russian oligarch, to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. They were attending an EU-Russia summit at The Hague. The Conservatives call the revelations disturbing and say they should be investigated. Lord Mandelson tells the paper he cannot remember travel arrangements from so long ago.The Daily Telegraph leads on an interview with the chief executive of the Electoral Commission. Vijay Rangarajan criticises ministers for allowing 30 local authorities to postpone elections due in May. Ministers have argued, the paper notes, that councils cannot afford to both hold elections and prepare for a re-organisation of local government. Rangarajan tells the Telegraph that constraints in capacity are not a sufficient reason to take away from voters the chance to choose who represents them.Heathrow Airport feels so crowded because passengers keep bumping into each other, its chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, is reported as saying in the Financial Times. He says British people keep to the left and Europeans to the right - so they crash into each other and the terminals then feel busier than they actually are.Related Internet Links",

With the title role in coming-of-age teen drama Dawson's Creek, he walked some of the industry's hottest red carpets, and his face plastered magazine covers - one even dubbing him a \"new superstar\".But when tragedy struck later in life, his family needed to rely on the kindness of his friends - and fans - for financial help, shedding light on the precarious financial situation of not just many actors, no matter how famous, but millions of everyday Americans struggling with medical bills.Van Der Beek - who had six children with his wife - died on Wednesday at the age of 48 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer three years ago.The cost of his medical treatments were so financially draining, his wife says, that she has now made a public plea for donations so they would not lose their home. They have raised $2.3m (£1.7m) thus far.Getty ImagesJames Van Der Beek auctioned off the shirt he wore in this promotional stillIn the months before his death, Van Der Beek had shared how cash-strapped the cancer treatments had left him and his family. He even publicly auctioned off items he'd saved for decades from the roles that defined his career - a plaid buttoned shirt he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, a necklace he gifted to Katie Holmes' character on the teen drama series and sports shoes he wore when he starred in the 1999 film Varsity Blues.\"I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now,\" Van Der Beek told People Magazine last November.On top of the costly treatments, Van Der Beek was not making the same cash that he'd seen in the prime of his career decades ago. He had said he was paid \"almost nothing\" for Dawson's Creek and his contract didn't include residuals - payments writers, actors and directors receive when their work is re-aired on television. Actors on other still-popular shows from that same period, like Friends, are said to make about $20m annually from such payments.\"There was no residual money,\" Van Der Beek told Today in 2012.  \"I was 20.  It was a bad contract. I saw almost nothing from that.\"He continued working after his diagnosis, appearing in two episodes of the television show Overcompensating in 2025, but it's unclear whether that was enough to qualify him for health insurance from the prominent actors' union in Hollywood. Actors can qualify for health insurance through SAG-AFTRA only if they work 108 days a year or earn at least $28,090 on union shoots. The BBC has contacted the union.Van Der Beek is not the first high-profile American actor to highlight the issue. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty, who died in 2024, said she did not have insurance when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Getty ImagesVan Der Beek and his Dawson's Creek co-stars pictured in 1997Benjamin Byron Davis, 53, an actor who has appeared on television shows as well as in movies like Marvel's Ant Man, told the BBC that decreased residuals have become a problem for actors across the board.\"Revenue streams that actors have depended upon have disappeared,\" he said, noting that the rise of streaming has affected how production companies compensate performers. He said many actors depend on these payments both for income and to qualify for health insurance through their union SAG-AFTRA. \"I work when I'm hired and I survive when I'm not.\"Davis said he lost his health insurance during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes. \"There wasn't work,\" he said, adding that he ended up getting it back when the strikes were over and he was able to meet the qualifications again.Davis said that just 10 years ago, the union's minimum earnings for health insurance was a third of what it is now, at a level today that is out of reach for the vast majority of actors.Those who are covered by the union plan get good health coverage, said Valerie Yaros, an archivist with SAG-AFTRA.But it was possible Van Der Beek no longer received the union plan because of his fewer work hours, she added.In 2024, Van Der Beek told People that it had become a \"full-time job\" dealing with cancer treatment appointments and his insurance.A heated debate on health insuranceHis death put a new celebrity face on the debate about rising healthcare costs in the US - an issue that Republicans and Democrats have long recognised needs reform but have disagreed on the best ways to resolve the problem.The US has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, with spending on health care estimated to reach $5.9tn in 2026, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.About 100 million people in the US are estimated to struggle to pay off their medical and dental healthcare debt, according to recent data.The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek's widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from 4 to 15.His wife shared the page, which noted the \"significant financial strain\" the family had seen as they \"did everything possible to support James and provide for his care\".\"In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,\" the page reads. \"They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.\"Even with health insurance, cancer treatment can prove extremely costly for those in the US. Some studies suggest the average monthly cost of chemotherapy can range from $1,000 to $12,000.This is because in the US private health-care system, even those with insurance can face high deductibles and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, said Eva Stahl, the vice president of policy at Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that has paid off about $25bn of medical debt for almost 15 million people.\"People simply can't afford vital, life-saving treatments without going into debt,\" she said. \"When even someone with James Van Der Beek's resources has no option but to fundraise for treatment, it's clear how fundamentally unfair our healthcare system is.\"Michael Short, a graphic artist in Tennessee who has had his own battles with medical debt, told the BBC that his sister has had to declare bankruptcy because of medical debt for treatments for her endometrial and another cancer, even with insurance coverage.\"It's in the hundreds of thousands if not millions for these cancer treatments,\" he said. \"The prices on these medications and on these treatments are just so high.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "2 days agoJonny HumphriesNorth WestNCDSMichael Woods, whose son Joseph plays Aled in Coronation Street, says Mount Everest will be the \"toughest challenge of my life\"The father of a child Coronation Street star is preparing to take on the world's highest mountain to raise money for deaf children. Michael Woods, who is deaf himself, is set to climb Mount Everest in Nepal and said the  8,849 m (29,032 ft) ascent would be in honour of his son Joseph - who is also deaf and plays Aled Winter-Brown on the ITV soap. Woods, 36, is aiming to raise money for the National Deaf Children's Society which supported his six-year-old son from an early age. The climb is scheduled to begin on 7 April and is expected to take six to eight weeks. Woods, who communicates using British Sign Language (BSL), is strength-training three times a week with a personal trainer, alongside endurance work and altitude preparation, and is also using an altitude tent at home. The expedition is part of an effort to complete the Seven Summits challenge - climbing the highest peak on each continent.NDCSIn January, Michael Woods climbed Aconcagua in Argentina, the highest peak in South America.In January, Woods reached the 6,961 m (22,840 ft) summit of Aconcagua in Argentina, the highest mountain in South America after 17 days. He said: \"Aconcagua tested me in every way imaginable, from battling fatigue to facing the harsh elements, but standing at the summit made it all worth it. \"The sense of achievement and awe at the mountain is indescribable.\"He said he expected the toughest challenges of Everest to include the extreme altitude and the cold - which can reach -30°C and below.Woods will also face the mental pressure of long summit pushes, particularly navigating the treacherous icefall between Base Camp and Camp 1.He will climb with a guided team, communicating visually and through written methods when needed, as no BSL interpreter will join the expedition.Woods said: \"I want deaf children – including my own – to see that nothing is out of reach for them.\"After his father reached the summit of Aconcagua, Joseph said: \"Wow, that's good, I love you and you did it, proud of you.\"Melissa Jones, community and events fundraiser at the National Deaf Children's Society, said: \"Michael's determination is extraordinary. \"Taking on Everest is an enormous challenge for anyone, and he's doing it to inspire deaf children and raise funds for others who need support just like his family once did.\"More like this",

    "body": "5 hours agoGetty ImagesIan CaseyTwo Britons and one French person have died in an avalanche in the French Alps on Friday.The British pair were part of a group of five people skiing off-piste with an instructor in the Manchet valley, near Val d'Isère, a spokeswoman for the resort told the BBC.The French national was skiing alone when the avalanche struck at 11:30 local time (10:30 GMT), Albertville prosecutor Benoit Bachelet said in a statement announcing the deaths.Another British person has minor injuries, he added.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told the BBC they are aware of the death of the two British men and they are \"in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance\".A manslaughter investigation has now been launched by the Albertville public prosecutor's office and will be carried out by CRS Alpes mountain rescue police.The ski instructor, who was unharmed, tested negative after taking alcohol and drug tests, according to Bachelet.Antoine MartignonAntoine Martignon and his wife were in La Vallée du Manchet on Friday morning, and captured the avalanche on video. The pair had initially tried to ski in Val d'Isère, but found the slopes too crowded and decided to go for a walk.\"I was watching people free riding and skiing off-piste, and thought it looks very dangerous,\" said Martignon. \"In 20 seconds there was an avalanche, it went down and took people below.\"Val d'Isère has already experienced avalanches this winter, with one person dying in the resort of Tignes nearby last month.France's national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk across the Savoie region on Thursday, which was then lifted on Friday. But the risk level remained high across the Alps with \"very unstable snow cover\".The avalanche comes in the wake of Storm Nils, which passed through France the day before, leaving between 60cm and 100cm of snow, the weather service said.\"We have had some very complicated, very unstable snow since the beginning of the season,\" Luc Nicolino, slopes manager at La Plagne, told AFP.\"It's a kind of mille-feuille with many hidden, fragile layers.\"You can also get in touch the following ways:Email: yourvoice@bbc.co.ukWhatsApp: +44 7756 165803",

    "body": "Standing at the top of the winding Cortina sliding track with Olympic gold in his sights, Matt Weston knew what he had to do.Having laid the foundations for skeleton gold on Thursday - tidying up errors from his first run to produce a statement second, each time setting the track record - the Briton needed more of the same on Friday.What he produced was not only a masterclass in sliding but also a remarkable display of composure and focus to clinch gold - Team GB's first medal of the Games - and cement his place at the top of the sport.\"It means everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally, I've worked so hard for this,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\"But everyone back home - my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone who has sacrificed everything for this. I've missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment. It feels amazing. Hopefully I made you proud.\"Weston set a track record on all four of his runs and could have eased off in his final attempt, having already built a significant margin of 0.39 seconds.However, he ramped things up for a victory lap lasting 55.61secs, finishing with a sensational overall time of 3:43.33.It left an almost impossible task for the chasing pack. Germany's Axel Jungk finished 0.88secs behind to take silver, while compatriot and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer secured bronze, 1.07secs behind Weston.The pressure to deliver was there. The 28-year-old from Redhill was the heavy favourite to top the podium in Italy having dominated the sport in the past four-year cycle, but no British man had won an Olympic skeleton gold medal before.He also carried the weight of Team GB who, having been tipped for a record medal haul at Milan-Cortina, had been watching those ambitions begin to slip away.Weston blocked out the noise of 'helmet-gate', of seeing his peer Vladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from the competition just moments before the first heat, and of the disaster that was Beijing 2022, where GB failed to win a skeleton medal for the first time since 2002.He has now added the Olympic crown to his two World Championship titles and three Crystal Globes - the overall World Cup trophies.Four years ago, it was a different story.His overwhelming disappointment at missing out on the Olympic podium almost led to him quitting the sport and he told BBC Sport earlier this year he has had to teach himself to \"love the pressure and expectation\".From speaking to friends and family to knowing when to rest and eating lots of pasta, Weston has figured out the secret to his own success - and now he's reaping the rewards.Weston walked away empty-handed from his maiden Games in Beijing, having finished 15th.Not wanting to feel that disappointment again, he worked on switching his mentality.It paid off. In 2023 he became Britain's first men's world champion in 15 years, taking silver the following year before reclaiming his title in 2025.His first World Cup title came in 2024 and he has been unrivalled since, winning five of the seven races this season and finishing second in the other two to become the first man to defend the trophy twice.Arriving at this Games as reigning world, European and World Cup champion, the pressure was on to deliver.\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston told BBC Sport after run two on Thursday.\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"He represented England at taekwondo as a teenager, winning various medals at national level, but a back injury brought that particular sporting career to an end.He was also a gifted rugby player but, like many skeleton racers, it was through a talent identification programme that Weston discovered his love and aptitude for the sport nine years ago.His rapid rise came with its own issues and, following that disappointing result four years ago, Weston had to learn to embrace the pressure and, once winning became the norm, carry the weight of being the favourite.That attitude has served him well in Italy.It has not just been on the track where Weston has blocked out the noise.The build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by discussion around the British team's desire to a wear a new helmet design in Italy.They ultimately lost an appeal against the decision to ban the new helmet at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).Weston and team-mate Marcus Wyatt, who was also tipped for success but finished ninth, were confident it would not make a difference, pointing to the triumphs they have enjoyed all season.After a week of no medals for the British team in Italy, pressure on Weston gradually increased.But he knew what he needed to do to win gold, stating he would settle for nothing less in Cortina.That does not always mean being the first to arrive and last to leave.He sat out Wednesday's final training runs in favour of a rest, opting for some light stretching and mental respite by speaking to his fiancee about anything other than sliding.He also ate a lot of pasta, abiding by his motto \"pasta makes you faster\".Ultimately, skeleton training is tricky, particularly for a British athlete.With no ice tracks in Britain - only a push-start track at the University of Bath - a lot of time is spent in the gym, working to improve that all-important start.With one run down the icy track taking less than a minute, the British sliders spend around two-and-a-half hours per year actually completing runs, with time spent visualising the track to understand the twists and turns.But Weston has got his rituals down to a tee.He is now the first British man to win winter gold since Christopher Dean topped the ice dancing podium alongside Jayne Torvill in 1984, as well as the first British man to win skeleton gold.His success may not end there as he will partners Amelia Coltman in the new mixed team event on Sunday.",

    "body": "4 days agoHelen BurchellSteve ForemanThe juvenile loggerhead turtle was found washed up on a Suffolk beachA rare loggerhead turtle - a species not native to UK waters - has been rescued after being found near-dead on a Suffolk beach after being washed ashore in stormy weather.Steve Foreman was walking on Dunwich beach when he spotted the ailing turtle, which he initially thought was \"just some debris\".He carried the creature back to his campsite and called in specialist volunteers from  British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR), who assessed the creature.BDMLR said it was then transferred to Hunstanton Sea Life in Norfolk, which has been contacted for comment. Foreman, from Cambridge, who was on a short break with his wife Sue, found the turtle on the beach on Thursday.\"It had been really stormy, and there was a lot of debris washed up, but as I got closer I realised this was a turtle - but it looked very dead,\" he said.\"I picked it up and thought I saw a movement in one flipper, so I carried it back to the campsite\".They searched online for what to do and were pointed towards BDMLR, whose volunteers arrived within about 20 minutes.\"They assessed it and weighed it, and then it was taken to the sea life centre in Hunstanton,\" he said.Getty ImagesLoggerheads are fairly common in the Meditteranean, like this one, off the coast of GreeceA BDMLR spokesperson said while loggerheads were rare in UK waters and did not belong here, the organisation was seeing more.So far this year, it has been called out to rescues in the Channel Islands, Wales, Scotland, Dorset and Kent, \"but I think we've only ever had one or two in Suffolk\", they said.\"Sea temperatures are rising, and they get washed up here in storms, usually suffering from cold shock or being 'cold-stunned', so they can't move, and some people think they are dead,\" they continued. \"The people who found this loggerhead did exactly the right thing - some people try to put them back in the water, but that is the worst thing for them - we'd encourage anyone who finds one to call us, and we can get it to the experts.\"Steve ForemanThe rescued turtle was taken back to a campsiteThe spokesperson said not all sea life centres were experienced or had the facilities to rehabilitate loggerhead turtles - but Hunstanton was one of them.It can take up to a year before they are deemed fit for release back into warmer waters.Foreman said he and his wife were keeping their fingers crossed for the \"stunning little creature\" they had found and that its turtle power would prevail and bring it out of its shell.They nicknamed it Steve, although initial examination by BDMLR suggested it may be a juvenile female.\"We might have to refer to her as Stevie, then,\" Foreman added.You may also be interested inRelated internet links",

    "body": "Following the latest release of the Epstein files, claims made by the then Prince Andrew in a 2019 BBC Newsnight interview can be put under fresh scrutiny.The BBC’s Sean Coughlan and Sarah Campbell have gone through the interview to compare Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s replies with emails which were apparently sent to and from the former prince.He is facing growing pressure from US officials and the family of his prominent accuser, the late Virginia Giuffre, to testify in the US about his links to Jeffrey Epstein.The disgraced financier was convicted in 2008 of procuring a child for prostitution and died by suicide in 2019, as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has previously denied any wrongdoing.",

    "body": "Stroke survivors trial new at-home tech: 'It's given me my freedom back'7 hours agoShiona McCallumSenior technology reporterBBCAmanda James-Hammett was just 37 when she had a stroke while doing the dishes at home.\"I heard a pop in my head, like a big bubble,\" she said. \"I tried to scream, but it wasn't a normal scream. I knew something wasn't right.\"Within hours, Amanda had lost the ability to speak and move her right arm. She would later have to relearn how to talk, read and carry out everyday tasks.Six years on, she has participated in a nationwide NHS trial testing a new \"at home\" device that it's hoped could help stroke survivors regain hand and arm movement.\"It's about freedom,\" Amanda says. \"It's given me my freedom back.\" The technology is being tested at 19 NHS sites across the UK, led by Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with the University of Sheffield.Researchers behind the £2m study - known as the Triceps trial - say it is the largest trial of brain stimulation and stroke ever conducted. It aims to recruit around 270 people.\"Stroke is an interruption to the blood supply to the brain,\" says Dr Sheharyar Baig, a neurologist at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital.\"When the blood supply is interrupted, unfortunately the brain stops functioning in a certain area. That can lead to all manner of symptoms, from weakness to visual problems and speech problems.\"Signs can include:Face weakness – it might be hard to smile, and one side of your face may droopArm weakness – you may not be able to fully lift both arms and keep them there because of weakness or numbness in one armSpeech problems – you may slur your words or sound confusedPeople displaying any of these symptoms are advised to call 999.Dr Baig says stroke is \"the leading cause of adult-onset disability in the UK\", affecting about 100,000 people a year.More than a million people living with its long term effects, he says.Around half of stroke survivors experience ongoing arm weakness, which can range from loss of dexterity to no movement at all.It can make everyday tasks such as dressing, cooking and working difficult. With a knock-on effect of adding to pressure on health and social care services, finding ways to help people shift their recovery from hospital to their own homes can be vital.How the device worksParticipants in the Triceps trial use a small electrical device that sits inside the ear and stimulates the vagus nerve - a major nerve connecting the brain and abdomen - while carrying out rehabilitation exercises.The device, resembling a wired earphone, sits in the ear. It works alongside a portable device worn on the wrist, connected to smartphone.\"The recovery process is unfortunately quite slow for many people,\" Dr Baig says, adding it can involve lots of effort and hours of rehabilitation.\"So we're interested in ways we can boost the effects of rehab and create a brain environment that's more responsive to it.\"Unlike earlier versions of vagus nerve stimulation, which required surgery to implant a device, this treatment is non-invasive and can be used at home.Dr Baig adds the pulses sent by the ear piece are set at a level to operate comfortably and without pain.'A new woman'Amanda used the device for up to an hour a day as part of her rehab over 12 weeks, combining it with exercises and everyday tasks.\"At first I didn't think it was going to work at all,\" she says. \"But after a couple of weeks, I started to see changes in my hand.\"One of the biggest milestones for her was returning to sewing – a passion she could not initially pursue after her stroke.Amanda is back in the sewing room Amanda says she feels like \"a new woman\" now that she can cut material and use her sewing machine again.\"I can put my socks on, I can do my shoes, I can do my house,\" she tells the BBC. \"I don't have to wait for anyone else.\"Early improvementsSo far, more than 200 people have taken part in the trial. While researchers do not yet know who is receiving active stimulation and who is receiving placebo, they say early signs are promising.\"We have seen some wonderful improvements in people's arm function,\" Dr Baig says.But he also stresses the treatment is not a cure, rather something they hope will help people in everyday life.\"Somebody who was unable to carry a cup of tea with one arm can now walk from room to room holding it stably,\" he says. \"Another person set their post-stroke personal best in a 5K run and noticed their arm function was better when they were running.\"The results of the Triceps trial are also being closely monitored by the Stroke Association, which is part-funding the research.\"The team are doing brain imaging and taking blood tests because we know that some stroke patients really respond well to this technology while some don't,\" said Maeva May, the charity's associate director of systems engagement.\"We want to understand what patients respond best and how.\"Dr Baig says if effective, the tech could be \"quite scalable\" because it is affordable, convenient and can be easily integrated into existing rehab services.For Amanda, the impact is already clear.\"It's about being independent again,\" she says. \"Those small things make a big difference.\"",

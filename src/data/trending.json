    "body": "8 hours agoSimon JonesSouth EastGetty ImagesThe government said the new powers will help gather intelligence on smuggling gangsNew powers allowing mobile phones to be seized from illegal migrants without arresting them have come into force. The government said it will help gather intelligence on smuggling gangs organising small boat crossings to the UK.The Home Office said seizures will begin on Monday at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent, with technology on site ready to download intelligence from devices.Officers will be able to demand that migrants remove their coats to search for phones and also check their mouths for SIM cards.The National Crime Agency said the information collected could speed up investigations into smuggling gangs.Border security minister Alex Norris said: \"We promised to restore order and control to our borders, which means taking on the people smuggling networks behind this deadly trade.\"That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.\"The Refugee Council said it was important that the new powers were used proportionately. It said phones were a lifeline for vulnerable people who needed to remain in contact with their families.Mike Tapp, minister for migration and citizenship, said seized phones could later be returned but that would \"depend on the individual circumstances... what's found on that phone. That's for the guys on the ground to make that operational decision.\"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: \"If people have devices... that could hold intelligence, then we are right to be able to seize that. But that  doesn't take away compassion.\" The new law also introduces offences that could leave perpetrators facing up to 14 years in jail for storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK.Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats or researching the best places to buy equipment for the dinghies could face five years in prison.Martin Hewitt, tasked with curbing Channel crossings, said more than 4,000 disruptions against smuggling gangs had taken place since his unit was set up, including seizing cash and convicting key players.He said Monday marked a \"key moment\" to go further with extra tools to crack down on smugglers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has also announced plans for \"significant changes\" to the asylum system to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.A total of 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - almost 5,000 more than the previous year.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Labour had confined itself to \"cosmetic tweaks\" and that there was no deterrent to those crossing the Channel.He said the Conservatives would leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), something Labour has rejected in favour of reforming the treaty.\"With more than 41,000 people arriving in 2025, the government needs to get a proper grip on the situation,\" he added.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "All 116 people injured in a bar fire at a Swiss ski resort have now been identified, officials have said.Forty people were killed when a fire tore through a busy venue in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, with victims' age ranging from 14 to 39 years old.While the dead had all previously been identified, work had been ongoing to establish who the injured are, some of whom remain in a critical condition. Swiss police confirmed on Monday that 83 people remained in hospital, with the injured including at least 12 nationalities.Most of the injured suffered severe burns, which in some cases meant they could not be identified, police have said.Investigators said 119 people had been injured but that number has been revised down in the latest update. A criminal investigation has been launched into the French couple who managed the Le Constellation bar - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling were the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Details have begun to emerge about some of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Among them was Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, who was a pupil at two UK schools. Her family wrote on social media: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.\"The mother of Arthur Brodard, 16, confirmed he had died in the fire.She said in a video message: \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light.\"Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as also being among the victims.Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".",

    "body": "59 minutes agoAmir AzimiBBC News PersianEPAThe protests have spread from Tehran to other cities across the countryIran is no stranger to street protests, but several factors surrounding the current unrest make it very serious. Monday marks the ninth day since demonstrations broke out, yet even four or five days were enough for President Trump to issue a direct warning to Iranian leaders over the treatment of protesters, saying the US was \"locked and loaded\". Then came the US special forces operation targeting Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, followed by a second warning on Sunday.Such direct and potential threats from a sitting US president, issued while protests are still ongoing, are highly unusual and could embolden demonstrators and encourage the unrest to spread further. Iranian police and security forces have already responded violently almost from the outset, and reports by human rights groups claim that more than 20 people have already been killed. Now eyes are on Trump's possible move.The protests, which began peacefully on Sunday 28 December, were initially driven by public anger over soaring inflation and the sharp devaluation of the local currency against the US dollar which now stands at about 80% higher than a year ago.Iran's economy is in deep trouble, with little prospect for growth this year or next. Official annual inflation stands at around 42%, food inflation exceeds 70%, and some basic goods have reportedly risen in price by more than 110%. Vulnerable positionInternational sanctions led by the United States have played a major role in worsening economic conditions, but they are not the full story. High-profile corruption cases in Iranian courts involving senior officials and their families have reinforced public anger and the belief that parts of the ruling elite are exploiting the crisis. Many ordinary Iranians believe that certain officials and their relatives benefit directly from sanctions through special arrangements that allow them to control imports and exports, move oil revenues abroad, and profit from money laundering networks. Even the government officials believe those who are locally called \"Sanctions Profiteers\" are to blame more than the sanctions themselves.EPAThe protests began over the economy but have also become politicalMerchants in Tehran's Grand Bazaar were among the first groups to openly protest, closing their shops in response to daily currency fluctuations and taking to the streets to demand government intervention to stabilise the markets. Demonstrations soon spread beyond the bazaar to other segments of society. Economic slogans quickly turned political, with calls for the removal of the entire Islamic Republic itself. Students joined the protests, followed by small businesses in other cities and towns and other ordinary Iranians. Within days, chants against Iran's supreme leader once again became a central feature of the demonstrations.The last time Iran experienced unrest on a comparable national scale was around four years ago, when the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman in the custody of the morality police sparked the most widespread anti-government protests since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. Those demonstrations, which later became known as the \"Mahsa Movement\" or \"Woman, Life, Freedom\", shook the foundations of the state but were eventually suppressed through force and mass arrests.Although the current protests have spread rapidly and persisted for days, they have not yet reached the scale or intensity of the 2022 demonstrations. Journalists in Iran are under immense pressure, and independent international news organisations are either not allowed to report from inside the country or, if granted permission, face severe restrictions on their movements. As a result, much of what is known comes from social media and people on the streets sharing what they witness and record. This makes verification increasingly difficult, especially as social media can also provide fertile ground for fabrications, unfounded claims, and distorted realities, a challenge further intensified by the rise of AI.Against this backdrop, many observers believe the present situation could have more serious consequences than 2022. Iran's government is widely seen as being at its weakest point in decades, facing simultaneous pressure from domestic unrest and a dramatically altered regional environment.Series of setbacksThe 12-day war in the summer of 2025 between Iran and Israel marked a turning point. The conflict culminated in direct US involvement, including air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. ReutersIran's missile and other military sites were badly damaged in the war with Israel The war severely damaged Iran's defence capacity, nuclear infrastructure, and several military and industrial sites. At the same time, Iran's broader regional position has deteriorated. The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria deprived Tehran of a key ally, while sustained Israeli attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon eliminated much of the group's senior leadership. More recently, US operations in Venezuela and snatching of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have further narrowed Iran's options abroad.These developments have reshaped the regional and international environment for Tehran. Iran now has fewer allies to rely on in regional conflicts and fewer channels to move oil revenues overseas. This is particularly significant given Iran's heavy involvement in Venezuela's oil sector alongside Russia, and its reliance on complex financial arrangements linked to markets believed to be in China.The disruption of these networks has increased Iran's economic vulnerability at a time of mounting internal pressure.Against this backdrop, Iran's aging supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, appears to be facing one of the most uncertain moments of his rule. More than three decades of careful planning to build regional proxy forces, sanction-evasion mechanisms, and nuclear infrastructure have been undermined or destroyed in a relatively short period of time. With Trump back in the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu in power in Israel, there appears to be no clear diplomatic or strategic path out of the current crisis without a hefty price.For years, Khamenei and his inner circle justified massive spending on regional allies and the nuclear program as necessary investments in Iran's long-term security and technological advancement. Today, that argument appears increasingly hollow. As pressure builds both inside and outside the country, security at home, once presented as the ultimate payoff of those policies, seems more distant than ever.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHelena Wilkinson,News correspondentandCurtis Lancaster,South of EnglandThe Duke of Marlborough arrived at court on Monday morningThe Duke of Marlborough has denied strangling his estranged wife on three occasions in an 18-month period.Charles James Spencer-Churchill, 70, is accused of striking Edla Marlborough several times before placing his hands around her neck and squeezing them together before letting go on 13 November 2022.High Wycombe Magistrates' Court heard that on 23 April 2023 the duke allegedly grabbed her hair, before hitting her with a closed fist and then grabbing her neck. On 29 January 2024 he is accused of grabbing her \"tightly around the neck\".He indicated he would plead not guilty to three counts of intentional strangulation and was released on bail to appear at Oxford Crown Court on 5 February.Getty ImagesThe duke married Edla Griffiths, his second wife, in 2002 but they separated in 2024The court was told the 2022 incident occurred following an argument in the garden of their home.The second accusation describes Edla Marlborough running into a laundry room before being attacked.Prosecutors said on the occasion in 2024, the duke, who gave his address as Blenheim Palace, grabbed her around the neck before throwing her on a bed.The twice-married aristocrat, formerly known as the Marquess of Blandford, married his second wife, Welsh ceramicist Edla Griffiths, in 2002.They are said to have met while she was living in Chelsea and working on her art, and they wed after dating for seven years.The pair are thought to have separated in 2024.He inherited his dukedom in 2014, following the death of his father, the 11th Duke of Marlborough.He is a first cousin, three times removed, of Sir Winston Churchill and a distant relative of the late Princess Diana through the Spencer family.His ancestral family home is Blenheim Palace in Woodstock – Sir Winston's birthplace - which is owned and managed by Blenheim Palace Heritage Foundation.The foundation said, in a previous statement, it was \"unable to comment on the charges, which relate to the duke's personal conduct and private life, and which are subject to live, criminal proceedings\".It added: \"The foundation is not owned or managed by the Duke of Marlborough, but by independent entities run by boards of trustees.\"Blenheim PalaceFormer Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim PalaceRelated storiesRelated link",

    "body": "4 hours agoGetty ImagesScotland's men's team qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 in November A public holiday will mark Scotland's men's national team playing in its first World Cup since 1998.Scotland will face Haiti in Boston at 02:00 BST on Sunday 14 June, before taking on Morocco and Brazil in their remaining group fixtures in the United States.First Minister John Swinney has proposed that 15 June is designated as a national bank holiday.Only public sector employees in areas controlled by the Scottish government would be assured of a day off, depending on their contract, though other employers could follow suit. The proposal will be formally confirmed once it has been rubber-stamped by the King.Scotland to come to a 'standstill' Speaking at an event in Glasgow, Swinney said: \"The whole nation will come to a standstill in June - even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages.\"This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion.\"He added: \"That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years, and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections.\"Scotland is able to set distinct bank holidays from the rest of the UK. A day can be appointed as a bank holiday in Scotland by royal proclamation. The first minister is able to advise the Privy Council - an advisory board to the monarch - on proclamations for Scotland, which are formally signed off by the King.Scotland face Morocco in Boston on 19 June, and Brazil in Miami on 24 June. Both games kick off at 23:00 BST. Swinney has previously said that the government would work with local authorities on extending pub opening hours during the World Cup.The Scottish government simply does not have the power to give people across the country - including those working in the private sector or in parts of the public sector controlled by the UK government - an extra, specified day off work.Decisions on whether or not to give staff the day off are for individual employers to take.In general, bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave by employers.An employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker's statutory annual leave.Employment contracts tend to specify that employers have a certain number of days off every year - inclusive of bank holidays.Nor is there any reason why private business would need to close. There are no restrictions on opening hours on bank holidays.Even the major Scottish high street banks do not close on Scottish bank holidays now - they observe English bank holidays, to stay in line with their sister businesses south of the border.School holidays are already set for the coming year by individual councils. Some may consider whether to look at giving the special bank holiday as a day off, but there are also rules on how many days schools need to open for to consider.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoLaura CressTechnology reporterOfcom has made \"urgent contact\" with Elon Musk's company xAI following reports its AI tool Grok can be used to make \"sexualised images of children\" and undress women.A spokesperson for the regulator said it was also investigating concerns Grok has been producing \"undressed images\" of people.The BBC has seen several examples on the social media platform X of people asking the chatbot to alter real images to make women appear in bikinis without their consent, as well as putting them in sexual situations.X has not responded to a request for comment. On Sunday, it issued a warning to users not to use Grok to generate illegal content including child sexual abuse material.Elon Musk also posted to say anyone who asks the AI to generate illegal content would \"suffer the same consequences\" as if they uploaded it themselves.XAI's own acceptable use policy prohibits \"depicting likenesses of persons in a pornographic manner\".But people have been using Grok to digitally undress people without their consent and without notifying them.It is a free virtual assistant - with some paid for premium features - which responds to X users' prompts when they tag it in a post.Samantha Smith, a journalist who discovered users had used the AI to create pictures of her in a bikini, told the BBC's PM programme on Friday it had left her feeling \"dehumanised and reduced into a sexual stereotype\".\"While it wasn't me that was in states of undress, it looked like me and it felt like me and it felt as violating as if someone had actually posted a nude or a bikini picture of me,\" she said.Under the Online Safety Act, Ofcom says it is illegal to create or share intimate or sexually explicit images - including \"deepfakes\" created with AI - of a person without their consent.Tech firms are also expected to take \"appropriate steps\" to reduce the risks of UK users encountering such content, and take it down \"quickly\" when made aware of it.A Home Office spokesperson said it was legislating to ban nudification tools, and under a new criminal offence, anyone who supplied such tech would \"face a prison sentence and substantial fines\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandKathryn ArmstrongTen people have been found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, by a Paris court. The defendants were accused of spreading false claims about her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between the couple. Most of the defendants were handed suspended prison sentences of up to eight months, but one was jailed immediately for failing to attend court. Some had their social media accounts suspended.The judge said the eight men and two women had acted with a clear desire to do harm to Brigitte Macron, making remarks online that were degrading and insulting.Two of the defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander in 2024 for claiming that France's first lady had never existed.They said her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name. They were later cleared on appeal. The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an \"attack on their honour\".  The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal.\"The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts\" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported.Tiphaine Auzière, Brigitte Macron's daughter from a previous marriage, previously told the trial that the cyber-bullying had negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.She said her mother \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... she knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories\".While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. They alleged that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on her belief that the first lady \"is in fact a man\".The presidential couple were initially advised that the best course was to ignore the online gossip, because to go to law would simply amplify it.But last year there was a radical change of course. The Macrons decided that the scale of the online attacks was now too large to ignore. So, at risk of exposing their private selves in a US court, they determined to push back against the conspiracy theorists.A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017.Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPeter Hoskins,Osmond Chia,Nick EdserandNatalie Sherman,Business reportersShares in US energy companies have jumped as investors bet that the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro will open opportunities to tap the country's oil reserves. Shares in Chevron opened more than 4% higher, after surging more than 7% in pre-market trading, while other firms, including ConocoPhillips and Exxon also gained. Precious metal prices and shares in defence stocks also rose as the intervention increased investors' concerns about geopolitical risks.Gold was about 1.9% higher at $4,412 (£3,275) an ounce, while the price of silver was up by 3.6%, as money was moved into so-called \"safe-haven\" assets.Prices of precious metals such as gold and silver often rise in times of uncertainty as they are seen as safer assets to hold. The gold price saw its best annual performance last year since 1979 after rising by more than 60%, reaching an all-time high of $4,549.71 on 26 December.Those gains were driven by several factors including expectations of more interest rate cuts, major purchases of bullion by central banks and investor concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.Oil prices fluctuated on Monday as investors weighed whether Washington's intervention in Venezuela would affect crude supplies. Brent crude rose more than 1% to nearly $61.50 a barrel, still below highs seen in recent years, as analysts said ample global supplies would offset any disruption.Shares in Chevron, the only US company currently operating in Venezuela, rose 4%, while Spanish energy firm Repsol, among the other few Western energy firms with a presence in the country, gained 2%.Oil services firms also climbed, with Haliburton up more than 7%. US President Donald Trump has vowed to tap into Venezuela's vast oil reserves after seizing Maduro and said that the US will \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".But industry analysts have said the move is unlikely to have an immediate impact on how much people and businesses pay for energy.Experts have also said it would cost billions of dollars to fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure, which has been in sharp decline since the early 2000s.Venezuela's crude production has been \"lacklustre\" for years and now only accounts for around 1% of global oil output, said investment strategist Vasu Menon from OCBC bank.The former chief executive of BP, Lord Browne, told the BBC's Today programme that for Venezuela to revive its oil production would take \"a tremendous amount of skill investment and time\". While there might be a \"quick pick up\" of some production, he added, output might actually fall while the industry is reorganising.Shares in defence stocks across Europe rose sharply as investors reacted to the US actions in Venezuela.In the UK, shares in BAE Systems rose 5% while Germany's Rheinmetall jumped more than 8%.\"Heightened geopolitical tensions like the ones we've seen over the weekend would normally spook investors, but global markets have avoided a sell-off,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\"Defence stocks often move higher when there are heightened tensions between two countries as investors believe events could spur governments to spend more on military protection.\"It was only natural to see the sector in demand after Venezuela's leader was captured,\" he added.Mining firms also rose following the gain in precious metals prices, with Endeavour Mining and Fresnillo both up more than 4%. Share markets in Asia made gains as investors focused on news unrelated to developments in Venezuela.Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 3% on the first day of trading of the year and new data showed that manufacturing activity stabilised in December.Major indexes in South Korea and China were also higher.The jumps reflect confidence that the fallout from events in Venezuela will remain distant, said Zavier Wong from investment firm eToro.",

    "body": "The Cuban government says 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.It described the dead as members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies were killed \"in combat actions\", declaring two days of national mourning. The armed forces added the Cubans \"fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombardments of installations\"Cuba, a long-standing ally of Venezuela, has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail and has personnel throughout the Venezuelan military.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the country had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife \"at the request\" of Venezuela. US spies had been monitoring Maduro's movements for months before US forces struck, according to US General Dan Caine.Gen Caine said that they had learned where the former leader moved, lived, travelled, ate, and worked.The New York Times reported that the CIA had also recruited a \"Venezuelan source\"  who it says informed the Americans of Maduro's exact location.Many of those killed are believed to have been part of Maduro's close security detail, who were with him at the time. Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed, but its armed forces  have said that a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties.An official statement from the Cuban government read: \"Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism\".The total death toll - according to an unnamed Venezuelan official cited by the New York Times - stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the seizure of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\". He continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.\"On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a \"disaster\" run by \"incompetent, senile men\". \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor, Joe Biden, easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end \"economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people\".It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since. ",

On Monday, flowers were continuing to pile up close to the spot where the victims were swept away.Dawn breaks on another sub-zero day in this quiet, seaside resort shattered by recent events as a steady trickle of people arrive, carrying flowers and heavy expressions.On Friday, two people died after being pulled from the water. They were named on Sunday as Sarah Keeling, 45, and Mark Ratcliffe, 67. Sarah's daughter, Grace, remains missing. Today, sirens and blue lights have been replaced by silence; the stillness  exemplified by a blanket of snow that caps the rocks in front of the town's promenade.Family handoutGrace Keeling and Sarah Keeling went into the sea off the East Yorkshire coast on Friday, with passer-by Mark Ratcliffe jumping in to helpIn front of the castellated entrance to a former pier destroyed by storms and ship collisions in the late 19th Century, is a growing mound of floral tributes.One card reads: \"RIP to the mummy trying to save your little girl. Thoughts and prayers to your family and friends.\"The man who tried to save them both is also honoured.\"Not all super heroes wear capes,\" states another note.   Janice Surr adds a bouquet of tulips to the collection.\"It shows that everybody really cares, which is nice,\" she says, looking at the other flowers.Many who are arriving pause to look at the sea, framed between two brick towers. Police tape prevents anyone venturing down the steps on to the beach below, as waves lash the shoreline in the distance.\"It just breaks my heart thinking about it. People are just really sad, they can't believe it,\" Janice adds.Jasmine Lowe / BBCOne of many heartfelt tributes to the victims of Friday's sea tragedyEast Riding of Yorkshire councillor Jon Dimberline says: \"It's been a very dark and grey weekend for the town. The mood is very sombre, very sad.\"Over the weekend, the Reverend Clive Hall, from the town's St Matthew's Church, walked along this same spot, offering comforting words and prayers to those who stopped.Kevin Shoesmith/BBCThe Reverend Clive Hall says Withernsea is pulling together following Friday's sea tragedyAs coastguard officials in hi-vis jackets combed the beach below for missing Grace, families - wrapped up in hats and scarves - played in the snow. The contrast not lost on the reverend. \"Withernsea is a fun place,\" he says. \"It's a place people come to enjoy themselves, even in winter. It's a lot smaller and quieter than Bridlington further up the coast.\"We are very close-knit here. But now we have tears and heartbreak. The mood is sombre.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCThe tragedy is said to have happened near to The Towers, a local landmark in WithernseaHall told how the town's five churches had come together, with clergy converging on Withernsea Methodist Church, which has become the focus for prayers.On Sunday, services reflected the town's loss.\"People are already talking about a special service. That will be something to consider at a later point,\" Hall said.Angie Smith, 51, from Hull, said: \"It's always been a happy little seaside town. What an awful start to the year this is.\"Like us, those people [who died] will have gone to the seaside for a walk and then this happened.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCCoastguard officials search the beach in a snowstorm for missing Grace Keeling on SaturdayDarrin Stevens' photographs showing the initial search and rescue efforts have been  widely published.\"The balcony of my home overlooks the sea,\" he said. \"Within minutes, all I could see was a wall of flashing blue lights.\"Mr Stevens did not see anyone in the water, with the seawall saving him from witnessing the tragedy.Like Mr Hall, he described a town that supports each other.\"So many people came down on to the promenade on Friday evening,\" he said.\"They weren't there taking pictures for social media; they were there to show support.\"My neighbours brought coffees and teas for the rescuers. People just wanted to help in any way they could. It was remarkable for all the wrong reasons.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCWithernsea-based photographer Darrin Stevens captured the initial emergency response to the tragedyJason Catlin, 45, who lives opposite the town's RNLI station, agrees with those sentiments.\"Even though something like this does not directly affect everyone, everyone feels it,\" he said.\"It feels really sombre.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCJason Catlin says the town \"feels sombre\"In a statement on Monday, Withernsea's town mayor, Alexandra Camplin, said the town council extends its \"heartfelt condolences to all those affected\".She said: \"The loss of three people to the sea is truly devastating and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mr Ratcliffe and Mrs and Miss Keeling.\"Everyone in the town and beyond has been touched by this dreadful tragedy.

    "body": "6 hours agoGetty ImagesTV doctor and former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Punam Krishan has revealed she has had treatment after being diagnosed with breast cancer.The Glasgow-born GP, 42, who is a resident doctor on the BBC's Morning Live and appeared on Strictly in 2024, said she was diagnosed five months ago.She has now completed her treatment and is \"healing\", but is \"still shaken\", she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of herself in a hospital bed.\"I've spent almost two decades as a doctor, supporting patients and families through difficult diagnoses. And yet, nothing - absolutely nothing - prepares you for being on the receiving end yourself,\" she wrote. \"The shock. The fear. The trauma. In that moment, knowledge means very little. I was diagnosed with breast cancer.\"Since then, I've taken things one day at a time because that's all I could do.\"Krishan danced with Gorka Marquez on Strictly in 2024She praised \"the most extraordinary NHS team\" who have cared for her.\"And still... it's been really hard. Much harder than I ever imagined,\" she added.\"I've kept this private while going through treatment, trying to protect my energy and most of all - my children. My husband, my family and a small circle of friends have carried me through in ways I'll never forget. \"When something like this happens, you realise very quickly what - and who - truly matters.\"Krishan is married to Dr Sandesh Gulhane, who is an MSP and the Scottish Conservative health spokesman.She continued: \"I've now completed treatment and I'm healing. \"Grateful. Relieved. Still shaken. All of those things can exist at once.\"I'm sharing this now because carrying it quietly has been heavy. Because I've always believed in honesty.\"And because life rarely looks like the highlight reel, even when it seems that way from the outside.\"Cancer doesn't discriminate. I had no family history. I was well. I'm a doctor. And yet - here I am.\"'Act early'She said her biggest lesson was that early detection saves lives. \"It saved mine. My story began with an unusual feeling - a gut instinct. Listening to it mattered. Please know your body. Trust yourself. And act early if something doesn't feel right.\"This experience has changed me. It's taken me to very dark places mentally - conversations about your own mortality will do that - but it's also stripped life back to what truly matters.\"Your health is everything. Not work. Not possessions. Not perfection.\"Krishan is an NHS GP who started appearing on BBC Radio Scotland in 2020 and BBC One's Morning Live the following year. She has also written books about health and first aid for children.She appeared on Strictly 2024 with professional dance partner Gorka Marquez, and they were the fifth celebrity pair to be voted off.Marquez was among those wishing her well on Instagram, writing: \"I know you and I know you will get through this, and we will be sat having a coffee and a croissant.\"Fellow Strictly professional dancer Amy Dowden, who has been through treatment for breast cancer, posted: \"You got this pink sister, sending so much love.\"How to spot breast cancer symptomsThe NHS website says breast cancer symptoms can include:a lump, or swelling in your breast, chest or armpita change in the skin of your breast, such as dimpling or rednessa change in size or shape of one or both breastsnipple discharge (if you are not pregnant or breastfeeding), which may have blood in ita change in the shape or look of your nipple, such as it turning inwards or a rash on itpain in your breast or armpit which does not go awayBreast lumps are very common and can be caused by other conditions, NHS advice says, and having some of the symptoms does not definitely mean you have breast cancer.",

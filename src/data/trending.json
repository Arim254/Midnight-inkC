    "body": "1 hour agoSimon JonesandRachel Muller HeyndykBBCFrom left: Mohammed Hussein Mohammedie, Mhabad Ahmad Ali, Bilind Shakir Baker, Shakar Ali Pirot, Bryar Hamad Abdulrahman, and Hasti Rizghar HusseinThe deaths of at least 30 people who drowned while attempting to cross the English Channel in 2021 could have been avoided, an inquiry has found.The dinghy they were travelling on became swamped and capsized in the early hours of 24 November 2021, in what became the deadliest Channel small-boat incident on record. Only two people survived, and were found almost 12 hours after they called for help. The inquiry chair Sir Ross Cranston pointed to a \"significant, systemic failure on the part of government\", and said that several of the casualties were preventable. Twenty-seven bodies were found after the boat sank, and another four were confirmed missing. The victims set off from a beach near Dunkirk in France and came from a number of countries, including Iraq, Somalia, Ethiopia, Egypt and Afghanistan.Sir Ross's report said HM Coastguard in Dover was placed in an \"intolerable position\", with chronic staff shortages and limited capacity leaving them unable to rescue victims. A surveillance aircraft that should have provided critical intelligence on the number of crossings never launched due to poor weather conditions - and there was no contingency plan, the inquiry found. It was also found that calls and messages from the vessel were missed or not followed up, and search assets were not briefed on the possibility that a dinghy was sinking or that there were people in the water. There was also a widely held belief that migrants calling from small boats exaggerated the distress, meaning the Coastguard underestimated the emergency. The inquiry said that the deaths could have been prevented, and pointed to three fatal errors: people smugglers overloading the boats, the slow response of French Naval vessel, Flamant, and flaws in the Coastguard's search and rescue operations. Survivors, and the victims' families gave testimonies in the inquiry having waited more than two years for the proceedings to start in March 2024. 'The human cost behind the statistics' ReutersLife jackets and other belongings seen on the shore of a beach in northern France from where crossings set off The 454-page report  identifies the 27 men, women, and children who died, describing them as \"a stark reminder of the human cost behind the statistics\".Sixteen of the named victims were born in Iraq. Others were from Ethiopia, Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Egypt. The youngest, Hasti Rizghar Hussein, was seven years old. Many victims survived for several hours in the water, with experts suggesting that more people could have been rescued if operations had continued through to the morning. Speaking at the start of the inquiry in March 2024, Issa Mohamad Omar, who survived the crossing, recalled how he hung on to the remains of the boat for hours until he had been rescued. If emergency services had responded more quickly, he said that he believed that \"half of those people would be alive today.\"Omar said he felt that they were \"treated like animals\" because they were refugees, and described the \"tremendous impact\" the incident had on his physical and mental health. Families of the dead and missing paid tribute to their loved ones throughout the proceedings. Rasul Farkha Hussein said he hoped his missing son, Pshtiwan Rasul Farkha Hussein, could still be found and that he is certain he is alive somewhere.\"If someone finds him and he contacts us, our lives would be saved and filled with joy,\" he said. Witnesses also said that during one call at around 01:30, a 16-year-old Iraqi Kurdish boy told the coastguard that everyone was in the water. He was told by the coastguard that help was coming, and to stop calling.By 07:00 on the morning of 24 November, the incident had been marked as resolved.\"The practice of small-boat crossings must end. Apart from other reasons, it is imperative to prevent further loss of life,\" Sir Ross said. \"Travelling on board a small, unseaworthy, and overcrowded boat, and crossing one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, is an inherently dangerous activity.'Solicitor Maria Thomas, from law firm Duncan Lewis, who represented families at the inquiry, said the findings that more lives could have been saved was \"consistent with the beliefs of the families and survivors\".The report recognises the dedication of the Coastguard, Border Force and Royal National Lifeboat Institute.The inquiry accepted that while the Coastguard now has more resources to draw on, \"systemic change is needed to support and strengthen their efforts\".The report recommended the Coastguard gives specific training to its staff about how to deal with small boats, as well as investing in new technology.A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of those who died and the survivors of this tragic incident. We will now carefully consider the findings and recommendations of the report. HM Coastguard remains focused on our vital role in safeguarding life at sea.\"A government spokesperson said the capsizing was \"a tragic incident\" and \"sympathies remain with the survivors and the loved ones of those who lost their lives.\"They said while \"crucial improvements\" had been made to Channel responses, \"the business model which sees criminal gangs send people out to sea to risk their lives in unsafe boats without safety equipment must be ended\". The government said it would provide a full response to the inquiry's 18 recommendations, including oversight and resources of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, in due course. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the government would also carefully consider the report.Steve Smith from the Care4Calais aid charity said that \"consecutive governments have dehumanised refugees\" for too long. He added: \"If the government heeds the findings of Cranston, they will create safe routes for refugees to claim asylum in the UK. Overnight, it will put an end to deaths in the Channel, and save lives.\"\"That's the justice that those who lost their lives, and their families, deserve.\"French Coastguards have been approached for comment.Additional reporting by Alex Forster and Lebo Diseko",

    "body": "The 'incredible story' of the British coach at Super BowlMedia caption, Seattle's defensive coordinator Aden Durde on reaching the NFL showpieceByBen CollinsBBC Sport journalist in San FranciscoAden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.Although he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL in the British amateur game with the London Warriors.Yet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.As the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.Speaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.Meanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"The volunteers that changed Durde's lifeImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Durde has been tipped to be a future NFL head coach and recently had interviews with the Atlanta Falcons and the Cleveland BrownsDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.He played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.Some 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"Durde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.They played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"Training before the day jobImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Efe Obada is now involved in several community projects, which saw him meet King Charles last FebruaryAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.He then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.Yet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"Allen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"Those included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.He prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"How internship 'gave Durde more ammunition'Durde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.A contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.The Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"Durde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"Turning Mailata into an NFL playerWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.The pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.Durde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.As with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"It was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"Allen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"How Durde gave Seahawks 'extra 2%'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Seattle are narrow favouites to beat New England in Super Bowl 60Durde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.When Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.The Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.NBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"The Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"Media caption, Super Bowl 2026: PreviewWhy veteran feels humbled by DurdeAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.The Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"Seattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"Back in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"",

    "body": "When Chelsea's David Datro Fofana completed a deadline-day loan move to Strasbourg on Monday, he became the 12th transfer between the clubs this season.The activity between the BlueCo partners has started to raise eyebrows.Rather than simple loan arrangements like that of Fofana, some players have moved back and forth for fees. Chelsea plucked head coach Liam Rosenior away as well, much to the annoyance of Strasbourg. There is no suggestion there is anything untoward, and the deals have all been carried out within the rules. But could such a high number of transfers between two teams within multi-club ownership (MCO) be a trigger for Fifa or Uefa? The game's governing bodies are keeping a close eye on the situation.So far action has been limited to clubs being removed from competitions where there might be a conflict of interest.Last year, Fifa disqualified Leon from the Club World Cup, and Uefa demoted Crystal Palace from the Europa League.Chelsea's transfer business has been the catalyst for change in Fifa's transfer regulations once before. Could it be again?Chelsea and Strasbourg came together under Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's BlueCo group in 2023.Across the first two years Strasbourg got the best of the deal. Six players left Chelsea for the French club, five on loan and one permanently. Strasbourg were able to spend money they could only have dreamed about.In the three years before BlueCo, Strasbourg's total transfer fees paid per season were £6.1m, £3.9m and £9.5m.In the following three seasons Strasbourg spent £52.6m, £53.6m and £96.5m. They were the biggest-spending club in France last summer, outgunning even Paris St-Germain (£89.2m).Those additional resources helped Strasbourg challenge for a place in the Champions League last season.But last summer the way the two clubs did business began to change. The pendulum would swing towards the dominant MCO partner in Chelsea. Take central defender Mamadou Sarr, who in June joined Chelsea from Strasbourg on a permanent deal.The 20-year-old made only one appearance for Chelsea as a substitute at the Fifa Club World Cup. In August he went back to Strasbourg on loan. On Monday he was recalled by Chelsea.BlueCo would argue this is a key part of player development - that Sarr would get regular football at Strasbourg and return to Stamford Bridge a better player. Then there is the case of Ishe Samuels-Smith. The left-back moved from Chelsea to Strasbourg in July. He was then re-signed by Chelsea in September - and immediately loaned to Swansea City.In the world of multi-club ownership there is logic to it. With Ben Chilwell not part of Enzo Maresca's plans the full-back was sent to Strasbourg on a free transfer. The Ligue 1 club had also resolved a contract dispute with another defender, Ismael Doukoure.It left Samuels-Smith as a spare part in Alsace. Rather than leave the 19-year-old struggling for first-team football, Chelsea effectively refunded the £6.5m transfer fee and sent him to the Championship club.Club captain Emmanuel Emegha is already confirmed to be the next on the conveyor belt to Stamford Bridge.The 20-year-old striker, one of BlueCo's first signings at Strasbourg, will join Chelsea at the end of the season.The club's ultras - long-time critics of the association with BlueCo - demanded he hand back the captain's armband.Outsiders see players (and indeed the head coach) jumping around from club to club at the behest of Chelsea.Take Aaron Anselmino. The centre-back spent the first half of the season on loan at Borussia Dortmund from Chelsea.Yet when Chelsea wanted Sarr in their first team, Anselmino was recalled from the Bundesliga club and sent to fill the hole in the Strasbourg squad. Anselmino was reportedly in tears when he left Dortmund. Chelsea were shifting chess pieces to suit their own strategy.Yet recalling loan players from one club to send them to another should not be seen as special to a multi-club ownership structure. For instance, last month Manchester United brought Harry Amass back from a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday and sent him to Norwich City instead.Chelsea's transfer business has attracted the attention of Fifa before, leading to a reshaping of the regulations in 2022.  Along with Juventus and Atalanta, Chelsea had become the poster boys of player hoarding - signing a high number of players and loaning them out. Former Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo had drawn up the concept of the so-called loan army. Up to 35 players were sent out on loan across Europe at any one time.Fifa stepped in to \"develop young players, promote competitive balance and prevent hoarding\", and enforced a limit of six players aged over 21 who could be loaned out. Most importantly for MCOs, Fifa said a maximum of three players could be loaned to one club. Chelsea would point out they have simply been fully utilising this option. BBC Sport understands that Fifa does not have any appetite to look again at its transfer regulations.Indeed, football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport that Fifa would be on \"a fairly sticky wicket\" if it was seen to be treating clubs unequally.Maguire added MCOs would simply find a way of getting around it, perhaps by changing the structure of shareholdings. \"They will find another loophole,\" Maguire said. \"It is a situation that is easy to manipulate.\"There would be other concerns, too, with half the clubs across the top five European leagues in some kind of MCO.\"So many clubs are in MCOs that to introduce a set of rules would impinge upon them,\" Maguire added.\"Chelsea are far from the worst offenders. Take a look at the number of transactions between Watford and Udinese. \"They would say that they're not an MCO, they just happen to be owned by different parts of the family, the Pozzo family.\"Watford and Udinese are just one example of clubs outside of an MCO engaging in multiple transfers. Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis signed four players from Botafogo in the summer. Danilo then went in the opposite direction with one of the signings, Cuiabano, immediately going back on loan. John Textor, the majority owner of Botafogo, said Marinakis \"has effectively become that partner\" when discussing transfer agreements across leagues. Uefa has been talking critically about MCOs for some time. It its European Club Footballing Landscape report in 2023 it said that the \"growth in multi-club investment has the potential to distort transfer activity\".The report added that it has led to transfers at \"prices that suit investors, rather than at fair values, to the detriment of trainer clubs\".The Premier League says it has checks and balances in place to make sure all transfer deals are completed to fair market value - either loan or permanent. The only time related-party loan deals came up at a Premier League shareholders' meeting was in 2023.Clubs were concerned Newcastle could use their Saudi Arabian links to bring in players on loan at minimal cost.A vote to outlaw such incoming loans just for the 2024 winter transfer window was narrowly defeated. MCO-style transfer deals have not been discussed since.MCOs have grown further since the Uefa report. Indeed, it was later that year that BlueCo bought Strasbourg.Yet there is little Uefa can actually do, other than introduce tougher regulations on access to its own competitions.When Manchester United and Nice, and Manchester City and Girona, were admitted to the same European competition in 2024-25, transfers between the clubs were banned for three windows.Last year Uefa was more strict by bringing forward the deadline for MCO compliance to 1 March. That caught out Palace, but has yet to be tested with one of the bigger clubs like Chelsea, Manchester United or Manchester City.Chelsea are confident that they have taken steps to ensure that both BlueCo clubs would be admitted to the same Uefa competition.Uefa is expected to try to go further, concerned that MCOs present \"a material threat to the integrity of European club competitions\".Chelsea would argue it is unfair to single them out purely because they are part of an MCO, and that they play by the rules.In any case, MCO transfer deals are commonplace. They would say they behave in a similar way to the Red Bull Group, who sold Nicolas Seiwald and Benjamin Sesko from Red Bull Salzburg to RB Leipzig in 2023.Deals are planned according to strategic needs - good for players and probably good for both clubs.A player might return to Stamford Bridge ready for first-team football, as was the case with winger Andrey Santos and now Sarr.Or performances at Strasbourg can see a player's value increase and improve their career chances. Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic was sold to Bournemouth for £25m last summer - double the fee paid to New England Revolution in 2023 and it made him a Premier League number one.Strasbourg have benefitted from Chelsea's scouting network and resources, too.Take forward Joaquin Panichelli, signed for £14m from Alaves last summer. The 23-year-old, who has scored 11 Ligue 1 goals this season, earned his first senior cap for Argentina in November. Panichelli was reportedly the subject of transfer enquiries at the end of the window, with Strasbourg quoting a price of £43m.The association with BlueCo has enabled Strasbourg to not only spend big on players, but also reject offers. Other clubs in France may argue it is too beneficial for Strasbourg with the resources they have access to. The problem for Strasbourg will always be when Chelsea come calling. Strasbourg can benefit from the loan system and finances but if Chelsea want the next Sarr, Rosenior or Emegha there is nothing anyone can do about it. That is the compromise. Football fans may not like it, but it has been going on for years in many different forms. Chelsea and BlueCo are just doing it their own way.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThirty-six infants in the UK have had suspected food poisoning from contaminated baby formula.It comes after specific batches made by Nestle and Danone were recalled because of contamination with the toxin, cereulide.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it has received clinical notifications of young children developing symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhoea, consistent with cereulide poisoning.None of the infants – all around or under one – are reported to be gravely ill, the BBC understands.Gauri Godbole, from UKHSA, said it was not unexpected, given \"the widespread availability\" of the affected products prior to the recall and \"subsequent testing\". Godbole said there did not seem to be any signs that huge numbers of children had been affected so far.\"Current surveillance indicators do not show unusual increases in reports of vomiting in children under the age of one for this time of year,\" she added.But the agency said it would continue monitoring the situation and providing updates.CrampsThe UKHSA has not been able to confirm categorically that the infants had been poisoned but it has been confirmed they consumed the specific brands of infant formula affected.The Danone batch affected is the 800g pack coded EXP 31-10-2026.Meanwhile, for Nestle it relates to a number of products, including SMA infant formula and follow-on formula. The batches  affected are listed on the company's website. Of the 36 cases, 24 were in England, seven in Scotland, three in Wales, one in Northern Ireland and the final case reported to be in one of the Crown Dependencies, which includes the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey.The UK is not the only country affected with both European nations and those from other parts of the world reporting products have been contaminated.Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed by cooking, or when making the infant milk.If it is consumed it can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps developing quickly.The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said the toxin was present in a specific ingredient identified as arachidonic acid oil. The oil is added to infant formula to give it some of the important growth properties contained in breast milk.The FSA has urged parents who had any of the affected products left, to stop using them and switch to an alternative formula.If you have fed it to your baby and are concerned, contact your GP or NHS 111 for advice, it added.The FSA is working with manufacturers to trace all products that may have used the affected ingredient and ensure all affected products are removed from sale.FSA director of policy Rebecca Sudworth said: \"Along with international partners as part of this global recall, we are investigating the supply chain. \"We need to know from manufacturers what went wrong and get assurances from the companies involved that it won't happen again. \"The FSA will not hesitate to take further action if required.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoErica WitheringtonDisability affairs reporterBBCAlton Towers will not allow some people with conditions like autism, ADHD and anxiety to use their disability queuing system this February half-term.Merlin Entertainments provides a ride access pass to help visitors to its theme parks who have a difficulty queuing because of their disability or medical needs.They say the number of people requesting the pass has been increasing, adding that disabled visitors have said the system \"simply isn't working for them\" and that \"queue times for these guests have increased\".A new restriction will also apply at Chessington World of Adventures and Windsor Legoland, as part of a trial to reduce the number of people who get access to the pass.Neurodiverse people can become overwhelmed or distressed when surrounded by large numbers of people, which can bring on sensory overload or panic attacks.Up until now, people who have a \"difficulty with crowds\" have qualified for the ride access pass, but only those with \"difficulty standing,\" \"level access\" or \"urgent toilet needs\" will do so during the half-term trial. Others will have to queue as normal.Merlin says it offers support to people with difficulty with crowds through \"a range of reasonable adjustments\".'No one likes queuing'Henry Shelford, chief executive of the ADHD UK charity, said \"a group of people will be excluded because of this lack of accommodation\".\"It's different from a child just not being happy about it, because no one likes queuing,\" he said.\"When a kid has ADHD, their energy and their focus makes [queuing] just impossible.\"As an adult with ADHD, I can tell you there's a whole lot of stuff I haven't done because I can't face the queuing.\"I have a need to move all the time, and being penned in in that way is very difficult for me as an adult. And it's near impossible for children and others.\"All visitors to Alton Towers can opt to purchase a \"Fastrack\" pass to skip the queues, but these start at an extra £35 on top of the ticket price. The change follows an update by the disability access card provider Nimbus, which is recognised by many attractions and events.Nimbus has split its former \"standing and queuing\" card section into two separate symbols: \"difficulty standing\" (a physical need) and \"difficulty with crowds\" (often linked to neurodivergence or anxiety).During half‑term, Merlin says new eligibility for the ride access pass is being trialled. Those whose Nimbus card shows only the \"difficulty with crowds\" icon will be asked to visit guest services for personalised support instead. The approach will be reviewed after February before the theme park opens fully in March.Rob Smith, chief operating officer at Merlin Entertainments, said growing demand had led to issues for people using the passes, but recognised the suggested eligibility changes had \"raised concerns for some guests\".\"Our commitment to supporting neurodiverse guests and those with mental health needs remains,\" he said. \"We are listening carefully to this feedback and are committed to keeping this approach under review ahead of our main season openings in March.\"We remain deeply committed to creating inclusive experiences and ensuring all guests feel supported when visiting our attractions.\"",

    "body": "56 minutes agoBecky Morton,political reporterandPaul Seddon,political reporterReutersLord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador in Washington in December 2024Documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US are due to be released, following pressure from MPs.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has acknowledged the vetting process included discussion of Lord Mandelson's continued relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted.However, he has accused Lord Mandelson of lying throughout the process and misrepresenting the extent of their relationship.The BBC understands Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.It was essentially a two-stage process: an initial due diligence check prior to his appointment, followed by security vetting. So how did it work? Due diligenceThe due diligence check was carried out by a team at the Cabinet Office on behalf of Downing Street, as the prime minister was responsible for the appointment.The point of this check is to identify reputational risks or potential conflicts of interests that may need to be considered during the hiring process. Sir Chris Wormald, the UK's top civil servant, has previously confirmed to MPs that this was largely based on public information, such as media reports.At the time, it was public knowledge that the peer had maintained his relationship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor in 2008.In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail.The only non-public information that featured, Sir Chris added, were records of a meeting Lord Mandelson facilitated between Epstein and Sir Tony Blair that have since been disclosed by the National Archives.Lord Mandelson's file included information about his previous roles inside and outside government, and his \"professional and financial relationships\".His prior relationship with Epstein was listed as a reputational risk, Sir Chris added, alongside his previous two resignations as a minister during the last Labour government. Follow-up questionsAfter reviewing the file, No 10 sources said Sir Keir asked Lord Mandelson to address three specific questions, which were sent to him via email by the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.These questions were: why has he continued contact with Epstein after he was convicted? Why was he reported to have stayed in one of Epstein's homes while the financier was in prison? And was he associated with a charity founded by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell that the financier had backed?At the time, his answers were considered sufficient for him to be appointed to the role, meaning he then underwent security vetting. No 10 will no doubt face pressure to release them as part of the disclosure process approved by MPs.Security vettingIn addition to providing information about his private interests, Lord Mandelson would have undergone security vetting before taking up the role.The Foreign Office, which is responsible for Britain's overseas embassies, says all ambassadors are required to go through developed vetting (DV), the most intrusive process required to access the most secret government information.Security vetting is carried out by United Kingdom Security Vetting (UKSV), a specialist agency within the Cabinet Office.The process is designed to make sure those being vetted are unlikely to abuse their access to secret material, or be subject to blackmail or bribery.According to government guidance, those undergoing DV are required to fill out various questionnaires including information about their personal finances, internet use, medical conditions, and email addresses they hold.Several checks are carried out, including on candidates' credit history and to check if they have any criminal records. Those being vetted also have to undertake an interview with a specially trained vetting officer, which can cover areas including candidates' health, friendships, family and sexual history. The UKSV decides whether or not to award security clearance, and can attach mitigations, such as being prevented from seeing certain information.The results of this vetting are kept within a tight circle and only the vetting agency and the security team can see the contents. Ministers, including the prime minister, never see the details.Ultimately, Lord Mandelson was announced as the UK's ambassador to the US in December 2024.However, after less than a year in the role, he was sacked last September following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences.The government said the depth of their relationship was not known when he was appointed.However, the PM is now facing questions over whether the information in the public domain was enough to raise alarm bells.

This contrasts with the incessant rain we have seen in parts of eastern Scotland with Aboyne in Aberdeenshire already having had 63mm - more than its average for the whole of February.This variation is also due to the wind direction, with rain being blown in by a prevailing wind coming off the North Sea, dragging in extra moisture which has enhanced both the rain and cloud.Because of the south-easterly wind direction, places like Aultbea lie in the lee of the Cairngorm mountains.  Not only has it been  wet, but pretty dull too. For Dyce in Aberdeen the sun has not made an appearance for the last 14 days, which if confirmed will make it the longest dull spell since 1957. ",

If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.There is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.Dealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.The jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.The 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.They are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.Stanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.For Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\"The fear comes in training;  when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"Zoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.It gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.Zoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"She heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"Atkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.GB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.The 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.She knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.In December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.Muir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.Muir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.The key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"In the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?Atkin thinks of nothing at all.\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"GB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.According to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"In the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.Atkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"Muir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "body": "Man guilty of murdering girl, 9, playing in street1 hour agoJessica LaneandEleanor Maslin,East Yorkshire and LincolnshireLina SavickeDeividas Skebas stabbed Lilia Valutyte outside the shop where her mother worked in 2022A man has been found guilty of murdering a nine-year-old girl as she played in the street.Deividas Skebas stabbed Lilia Valutyte in a random attack outside the shop where her mother worked in Boston, Lincolnshire, on 28 July 2022.The 26-year-old admitted killing Lilia but denied her murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by his mental state. However, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court convicted him following a trial.Skebas, formerly of Thorold Street, Boston, was remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on 25 February. The 'heinous' child killing that shook a town and the fight for justiceLilia had been playing with a hula hoop with a friend outside her mother's shop on Fountain Lane just before she was stabbed.Shortly after 18:20 BST, the pair were approached by Skebas who reached out and stabbed Lilia once in the chest.Her mother, Lina Savicke, remembers hearing Lilia call her name before she rushed into the street to see her daughter still clutching the hoop and, moments later, collapsing into her arms.The court heard that, despite the efforts of an off-duty police officer, doctors and paramedics, Lilia died within an hour of being stabbed in the chest. Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas will be sentenced at Lincoln Crown Court on 25 FebruarySkebas, who had no connection to Lilia, was arrested at his home two days after the attack, and the paring knife he had recently bought from a local shop was found behind a radiator.He was found unfit to stand trial in the months after the stabbing and was later transferred to Rampton high security hospital.In July 2023, a jury found Skebas carried out the act of killing Lilia, and, two years later, following an improvement in his mental health, it was decided he could face a murder trial.During the trial, the jury was told Skebas was assessed by three psychiatrists who wrote a joint report for his trial. All three doctors agreed Skebas had schizophrenia and was showing symptoms of psychosis on the day he killed Lilia.But the prosecution rejected Skebas's claim of diminished responsibility and alleged the killing was \"deliberate and planned\". Lina SavickeLilia was a \"beautiful soul with a strong character\", her stepfather Aurelijus Savickas saidProsecutor Christopher Donnellan KC told the court it was a \"wicked act\", adding Skebas knew he was \"killing a child\".The jury found Skebas guilty of Lilia's murder by an 11 to one majority verdict after deliberating for more than seven hours.Skebas appeared on a video link from Rampton Hospital to hear the verdict and did not appear to show any emotion.Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas was arrested in Boston on 30 July 2022, two days after the stabbingHe stared straight ahead as the statement of Lilia's mother, Lina Savicke, was read out.It began by stating Lilia would have turned 13 on Monday this week.\"Over these years of loss, both I and my entire family have lived through so much.\"Tears and pain cannot wash away everything we feel.\"The statement added: \"What parent ever thinks they will have to bury their own child?\" Speaking in court, Aurelijus Savickas, Lilia's stepdad, said: \"I came into her life when she was just three years young. \"From that moment on, we loved our journey together through the good days and the bad.\"I loved her as my own. She was a beautiful soul with a strong character and strong personality.\"While the family impact statements were read out in court, several people could be seen wiping tears from their faces.The judge Mr Justice Choudhury excused the jury from further jury service for ten years.Addressing them, he said: \"I appreciate it has been a difficult experience for you.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

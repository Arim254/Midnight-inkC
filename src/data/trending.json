This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.The corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.The BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation. \"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"The president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.A search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.In a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.The BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including as acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 3 days agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "10 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentPeople granted asylum in the UK will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, in a major change of policy to be announced by the home secretary on Monday.Shabana Mahmood is expected to declare that the era of permanent protection for refugees is over, as she seeks to reduce asylum claims and small boat crossings.Under the plans, those granted asylum will be returned to their home country when it is deemed safe and their status will be regularly reviewed.Currently, refugee status in the UK lasts for five years, after which they can apply for  indefinite leave to remain and have a route to citizenship.There are currently some temporary schemes for those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. This was initially for three years but extensions have been granted.Government insiders are describing a move to temporary status for all successful asylum seekers as a \"significant shift\".The policy has been copied from Denmark, where a government led by the centre-left Social Democrats has presided over one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.In Denmark, refugees are given temporary residence permits, typically of two years, and in effect have to re-apply for asylum when they expire.A previous presumption in the Danish system to extend permits was scrapped.  Even for those who are allowed to extend multiple times, the route to citizenship has grown longer and harder.The Danish approach is admired by UK government ministers, including Mahmood, who point out that as the Social Democrat party's immigration policies hardened their poll ratings rose - and those of a populist right-wing movement, the People's Party, fell.The home secretary believes that unless Labour takes similar decisions then \"darker forces\" could thrive in the UK.Last week, the BBC revealed that Mahmood had sent senior Home Office officials to Denmark to see what lessons could be learned from their system. And it was not just temporary status for refugees that caught the eyes of her officials.They also looked at Denmark's greater restrictions on \"family reunion\" - when refugees want to bring their spouses, partners or children to the country.Mahmood believes Denmark's policies serve as a disincentive for people to seek asylum in the first place and is impressed that successful claims are at a 40-year low.And she believes that what she sees as the current generosity of the UK system is acting as a magnet, and driving small boat crossings.In a social media video trailing her announcement, Mahmood said: \"We will always be a country that gives sanctuary to people who are fleeing danger but we must restore order and control.\"But copying Denmark too closely would be controversial.Four years ago the Danish government planned to return around 200 refugees to Syria even while a civil war raged - because it said some parts of Damascus were safe.And Mahmood's new approach will certainly face opposition from some Labour MPs. When it was revealed that Denmark was being used as a model for tougher rules in the UK, Labour's Clive Lewis told the BBC the system in that country echoed \"talking points of the far right.\"And he said \"progressive\" voters may migrate to more left-wing parties, such as the Greens, if Labour goes down this route.Another Labour left-winger, Nadia Whittome, said following in Denmark's path would be a \"dead end - morally, politically and electorally\".But the BBC understands Mahmood will issue a warning to her sceptical Labour colleagues in a speech to Parliament on Monday.She will suggest that while some of her plans may seem immoderate, the alternative could be a further rise in support for Reform UK.She is expected to say: '\"If you don't like this, you won't like what follows me.\"The home secretary believes Denmark is an example to emulate because its asylum policy - summed up as \"less in more out\" - has been achieved while remaining inside the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  But both she and her opposite number in Denmark - Rasmus Stoklund - want to see reforms and to rein in \"activist judges\" who might give too much emphasis to the ECHR's provisions on \"rights to a family life\" when deciding on deportation cases. She is expected to address this in her statement on Monday.Both Reform UK and the Conservatives argue that it would be more effective to leave the ECHR entirely.And rather than giving refugees temporary status, Reform UK say they would detain and deport cross-channel arrivals.The Conservatives argue that the only way to stop small boats is to bring back their scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, which was scrapped by Labour.The home secretary is likely to acknowledge on Monday that the UK's borders are \"out of control\".Simply adopting new policies is unlikely in itself to restore the trust of voters tempted by Nigel Farage.But if Mahmood's policies actually reduce numbers, she will hope her party will be granted permission to be heard not just on migration but on other policies too.",

    "body": "10 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorAfter weeks of wondering will she, won't she, and recent heavy hints that she would indeed raise income taxes in the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has now decided against the manifesto-breaching move.Amid the fog of Budget speculation, here is what we do know.That plan, to raise income tax rates by 2p but compensate workers with a 2p National Insurance cut was sent to the OBR as an option earlier this month to be costed, to help fill what was then a £30bn gap in the public finances, mainly caused by a downgrade to productivity.The so-called \"2 up, 2 down\" plan, pioneered by the Resolution Foundation think tank, would have raised several billion pounds, mainly from non-wage income such as landlords and savings.Newer assessments from the OBR appear to have increased the projected strength of wages and tax receipts in the coming years and offset several billion pounds of that gap, taking it closer to £20bn in total.As a consequence, the plan to raise income tax rates has not been advanced in the latest set of measures sent to the OBR to analyse. While this \"iterative\" process is part of the normal forecasting round that precedes a Budget, on Monday of this week the chancellor suggested very strongly that tax rates would go up in a BBC interview. Health Secretary Wes Streeting on Friday appeared to confirm the shift away from anything that could be seen to break election promises:\"It is really important that we keep our promises and we stand by our manifesto. The fact that there's been speculation about income tax shows how difficult the situation is with public finances and secondly that the chancellor is determined to stick to her fiscal rules,\" he said.There is some irony in the health secretary making these comments, given suggestions from Downing St about leadership bids and claims about the unique power of the prime minister and chancellor over the bond markets.By the end of the week the bond markets were more than nervous as a result of the hokey cokey over income tax.It is always questionable to assume a singular motive behind the awesome financial power of the debt markets, but let me try to divine what happened over the past 24 hours. After the Financial Times' scoop about the dropping of the tax rate plan, there was a notable spike up in the effective borrowing cost for the Government. It was up 0.12% points for a 10-year gilt. Markets had been reassured by the tough fiscal talk by the chancellor over the past month. Much of this was driven by expectations of lower Bank of England interest rates amid a weakening jobs market. The willingness by the chancellor to take political pain, in the form of breaking tax rate manifesto promises, in order to restrain borrowing in a straightforward way, is a plus for the bond vigilantes. But this week's developments, including the dropping of other kites being flown - from extra tax on partnerships, and entrepreneurs leaving the UK -  injected doubt about the appetite to trade political pain for lower bond yields.Even when it was confirmed that better - or less bad - economic forecasts had helped reduce the budget gap, and create room to avoid the tax rate hike, the markets only calmed briefly, before they crept up to even higher effective rates by the end of the day. The jitters are back.Insiders said that the chancellor's Budget strategy  \"remains the same\" to increase the buffer or \"headroom\" on meeting her borrowing rules significantly higher from the current £10bn a year,  to tackle cost of living pressures, and to make \"fair choices\" on tax. That would appear to mean an extension in the £40bn a year freeze on tax thresholds - which raises an extra £8bn a year as more worker's salaries creep into the higher tax brackets  .Ministers point to how they are planning to raise tax, as well as the amount, suggesting a squeeze on wealth, capital and income from those sources, rather than long-suffering pay packets.There are real questions about the loose lips around Whitehall, floating all sorts of significant tax reform, and the impact in markets.It's worth noting too that final decisions on the Budget have not yet been made, and the process continues. everyone will hope it is smoother from here until the big speech on November 26 .",

    "body": "3 hours agoMany of Satuday's papers lead on the upcoming Budget after Chancellor Rachel Reeves appeared to back away from hiking income tax. The Financial Times says investors have \"lost faith\" in the Budget after UK borrowing costs rose \"sharply\" on Friday. Fund manager Mike Riddell tells the paper the market has been \"led up the garden path\" after the chancellor previously indicated tax rises were possible.There is \"panic at No 10\" according to an unnamed government source quoted by The Independent, which says the \"shock tax U-turn\" has made markets nervous. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is attempting \"to quell growing party rebellion\" after leadership challenge talk in Westminster this week, the paper reports.The Daily Mail says the chancellor has \"lost control\" and calls Reeves's Budget \"shambolic\", dubbing the apparent shift on income tax as \"humiliating\". Unnamed government sources told the paper the decision came after the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast public finances were healthier than had been expected.The Times writes that the Treasury is now banking on extending the freeze to income tax thresholds - which it refers to as a \"stealth tax\" - to raise the funds it needs. The paper reports that Reeves will confirm the rates at which people begin to pay income tax will stay the same until 2030, extending a policy first introduced under the Conservative government. That raises the prospect of state pension recipients paying income tax for the first time from next year.The Guardian says the threshold freeze \"will raise £7.5bn from millions of workers\" as inflation pushes people into higher tax bands. Pictured is Radio 2 host Sara Cox, who has raised £7m for Children In Need after finishing an ultra-marathon challenge. The Daily Telegraph says property tax changes expected in the Budget will \"hit the middle classes\". The chancellor is reportedly considering an additional surcharge on some high-value properties on top of the council tax they already pay.The i Paper says No 10 has blamed its own MPs for \"market jitters\" this week. Borrowing costs shot up on Friday when reports emerged the chancellor was abandoning plans to raise income tax. Downing Street reportedly lays the blame at the feet of rebels MPS who blocked cuts to disability benefits earlier this year, saying it had \"spooked markets\".A plea from a terminally ill grandmother to \"show you care\" leads the Daily Express, as she asks for the assisted dying bill to be passed. Also on the front page, King Charles III's birthday is marked with a snap of the monarch setting off for a ramble. The Daily Mirrors leads on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here star Shona McGarty. The EastEnders actress tells the paper: \"I'm in the Jungle to show anxiety who's boss.\"Robbie Williams tells the Sun that he has been left with blurry vision after taking a weight loss drug. The singer spoke to the paper about his apparent side effects but said he still intends to keep on using the jabs.Finally, the Daily Star pictures Peter Mandelson leaving what it says is the home of ex-chancellor George Osborne. Madelson, who quit as ambassador to the US in September over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, appeared to urinate on a wall as he made his way home, the paper claims. It calls the incident a \"leak scandal\". Related Internet LinksThe Daily Telegraph says Chancellor Rachel Reeves is planning to introduce a new tax on high-value homes in the Budget. The report says 2.4m properties - across the council tax bands F, G and H - will be affected by the move. Ms Reeves has ditched plans to raise income tax which, according to The Daily Mail, shows she has \"lost control\". The paper says the chancellor has been accused of \"presiding over the most shambolic Budget in history\". \"Investors lose faith in Reeves Budget\" says The Financial Times. Its report notes a \"sharp rise\" in the government's borrowing costs on Friday, after the apparent U-turn. The Times calls it the worst day for UK debt markets since July, when the chancellor was seen looking tearful in the Commons. Reeves has previously said she will make \"fair\" choices to shore up the public finances.The US is planning for the long-term division of Gaza, according to a report in The Guardian. The paper says the Israeli military and other international forces would control a \"green zone\", where reconstruction would start, while a \"red zone\" would be left in ruins. A US official, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, says \"it's not going to be easy\".A terminally ill woman's call for the House of Lords to pass assisted dying legislation leads The Daily Express. Its headline reads \"show you care and stop delaying right to die law\". Peers recently suggested more than 900 amendments to the bill.The Times reports on Waitrose ditching frozen turkeys, with research showing that fewer than half of households are likely to eat it on Christmas Day this year. The paper says research by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Boards shows that 51% of people who celebrated Christmas ate turkey in 2023, down from 60 per cent three years earlier.The Daily Star says that the former US ambassador, Lord Mandelson, has been caught up in what it calls a \"new leak scandal\", after being photographed urinating in public. He has apologised, saying he'd been bursting while waiting for a cab on the street. The Star's headline puns: \"It's Pee-ter Mandelson\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoGetty ImagesThe two-child limit means many low-income families do not receive further benefits when they have a third or subsequent child.It has been the subject of intense political debate and speculation, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves hinting at changes in the Budget.So how does the system work and what might happen?What is the two-child cap and how many people does it affect?The policy, introduced by Conservative chancellor George Osborne, means parents can only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children.It applies to third or subsequent children born after 6 April 2017.A total of 1.6 million children are living in larger families who cannot claim these means-tested benefits as a result. If the cap had not been introduced, affected families could have received an average of £4,400 in benefit entitlements a year, roughly a tenth of their total disposable income, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The think tank estimates the policy will ultimately save the Treasury about £3.6bn a year.So it has nothing to do with child benefit?Correct. There is often a misconception that the two-child limit affects the payment of child benefit, because it is called the two-child benefit cap.So, take a breath between \"two-child\" and \"benefit\".This policy is specifically directed at universal credit and tax credits, not child benefit. How does the cap work?If you receive universal credit or tax credits then, generally, you won't be paid any additional benefit if you have or had a third or subsequent child born after 6 April 2017.If you have, for example, four children born before that date, then you will still receive the additional payments. That relates to children aged under 16, or young people aged under 20 who are in full-time education or training.There are other exceptions.If a parent, or parents, have one child, and the next are twins or triplets, then a claim can be made for all these children.Claims can also be made if children are born after rape, or from a coercive relationship. Payments can also go to children who are adopted, in your care rather than local authority care, or are a child of your child.Why have some criticised the cap?More than 100 charities have written to the chancellor to call for the two-child limit to be scrapped.A host of backbench Labour MPs want the chancellor to scrap it, arguing that it would bring hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.However, in doing so, a gap would be created in savings for the Treasury. The money would probably need to be found in cuts elsewhere, through tax rises, or from increases in government borrowing.The Conservatives support the cap, saying it makes the system fairer, and means parents on benefits face the same financial choices as parents who fund themselves solely through work.What could change in the Budget?The chancellor hinted at changes when she told the BBC it was not right that children in bigger families were \"penalised\" through \"no fault of their own\".She has options beyond simply scrapping the policy entirely.The benefit could be given to all families irrespective of the number of children, but at a lower level.The chancellor could also offer partial payments, potentially getting smaller for each additional child to reflect that these children might use the same buggy as their siblings or hand-me-down clothes.She could also cap the benefit payments at a higher number of children.",

    "body": "Hull KR & Wigan set for repeat of 2024 Grand FinalImage source, SWPixImage caption, Wigan Warriors narrowly beat Hull KR in last year's Super League Grand Final to seal a historic quadrupleByJay FreemanBBC Sport EnglandTwo familiar foes will contest the showpiece event of the Super League season, but this year it could be a very different tale.Wigan Warriors, the 2024 victors, face Hull KR in Saturday's Grand Final for the second time in as many years.Just 12 months ago, the Cherry and Whites sealed victory in a nervy final under the lights at Old Trafford, capping off a historic quadruple.In 2025 it is the Robins who stand on the precipice of sporting greatness as they target a trio of trophies of their own.With so much at stake, BBC Sport takes a look at how both are shaping up before one of the biggest fixtures the sport has seen in the modern era.Media caption, We can make a difference to so many people's lives - MinchellaSuper League Grand Final: Hull KR v WiganSaturday, 11 OctoberListen to the Super League Grand Final on BBC Radio 5 Live on Saturday, 11 October (18:00 BST), with build-up throughout from 12:00 BST, and watch highlights on BBC Two on Sunday, 12 October at 13:00 BSTHull KR 'have to get job done'It is a story that has been told time and again over the past couple of years, if for no other reason than to highlight just how much of an achievement it is for Hull KR to be tussling at the top.Just nine years ago, they lost their Super League spot in agonising fashion having initially led Salford Red Devils in the 2016 Million Pound Game before losing on golden point and dropping into the Championship as a result.Less than a decade later, they look set to complete one of the most impressive comebacks in sport, let alone rugby league, has ever seen and talismanic half-back Mikey Lewis summed it up best in his pre-match media commitments.\"We've built something at the club so we've got to believe each other and get this job done,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\"That's something that will fuel us on Saturday.\"Their record this season makes for remarkable reading having won the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield - not bad for a club which finished bottom of the pile in Super League just five years ago.What makes this all the more impressive is the fact that Hull KR have been so undeterred by Wigan's quadruple last season that they've now threatened to win a treble themselves.\"When I first came to the club we were in a relegation battle and there wasn't much in it, either,\" forward Dean Hadley, who joined in 2019, added.\"To say five or six years on you've played in back-to-back Grand Finals, you've won a Challenge Cup and League Leaders, it's a totally different place.\"It's been a process, it's taken time. It's year on year making improvements. Not just on the field but off the field as well. You can feel it when you're at the club. It's a really good club and environment to be at. Players like myself and others have thrived in that.\"Hull KR set up their place in Saturday's final off the back of beating St Helens in the semi-final and Saturday will see some departures for the east Hull club.With the youthful but formidable Lewis, accompanied by the wisdom and stewardship of senior figures like Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Micky McIlorum, Hull KR have assembled one of the most forbidding sides of the modern era.Yet the club, and sport, will wave goodbye to the veteran pair after Saturday's game as they retire.For Lewis, Saturday's Grand Final is not just an opportunity to win silverware, write themselves into the record books and tick another box - it is a chance to pay respect to two of the sport's greats in style.\"To put them into retirement having won all three trophies in the first year of being at the club would be a massive achievement for them,\" he added.\"It's something we'd be really proud of. The leadership and the accountability and the honesty they've brought to this team this year has been massive.\"To get the job done for each other, for the east side of Hull, the board, the chairman, Neil, for our families, we all sacrifice so much and to lift that trophy would be huge for everybody.\"Media caption, Highlights: Wigan complete clean sweep with Grand Final victoryWigan's chance to win three in a rowFor Wigan Warriors, they can regain some glory having missed out on silverware so far in 2025, not least because of how impressive Saturday's opponents have been.The Cherry and Whites have their own record to chase. Having reached a 14th Grand Final, they are 80 minutes away from winning three in a row for the first time in their history.In Luke Thompson, they have the perfect man to guide them to glory at Old Trafford, with the front rower never losing in a Grand Final in four appearances - twice with St Helens and twice with Wigan.\"I see a lot of similarities. I see a lot of commitment and professionalism. The hunger,\" Thompson told BBC Radio Manchester about the current Wigan set up compared to his time with Saints.\"They're slightly different teams. I think we play a bit differently but I think the quality that underpins both teams, you can definitely see some similarities.\"One man who could be in the mix for the Cherry and Whites is Brad O'Neill, who has his own motivation to take to the field on Saturday.The Wigan hooker missed out last year with a serious knee injury and had conflicting emotions having been unable to play his part in their quadruple glory.\"It was definitely a proud moment for myself watching on and seeing the team do something special that year,\" he said.\"It was a bittersweet feeling. It would have meant so much last year to play in it but the fact that we've got here now, I'm so grateful, and I definitely won't be taking it for granted come Saturday night.\"Media caption, 'We get to make a lot of people proud, and that's what drives us' - PeetWigan captain Liam Farrell is no stranger to a Super League Grand Final and knows what it takes to win on the big occasion.Whereas some players would be unnerved by the big occasion Farrell, in contrast, thrives off his nerves.\"If I played one game for Wigan, never mind the Grand Final, I'd have been very happy. But to be in the position I'm in now, leading my team out for a third year in a row, it's a very special feeling,\" Farrell told BBC Radio Manchester.\"I can't really put into words how special it is, but it's one I'm excited about and to create some more memories with the special group we've got.\"It calms me down, the fact that I do still get nervous. It makes me realise that I still care about what I do. I want us to win, I don't want to lose.\"The club wants success and the town wants success. I think that's where the nerves come from and I like the fact that I do get them.\"Farrell, a Wigan veteran, might well be in the twilight of his career at 35 but he still believes he has the fight in him to continue and will not hang up his boots regardless of the result on Saturday.\"If you're able to win one and go out like that, it'd be a nice way to go out, but I still think I've got a little bit more to give and the club wanted me to still stay on so I'm very happy about that,\" he added.\"I'd say psychologically I'm still enjoying it as well, that's probably the main thing for me, which is a big aspect and I think as long as I'm doing that and happy about what I'm doing then I'll still go around.\"",

I love you so much, I want to see two of you',\" she said, to laughter in the room.\"Dear Jilly, how we'd love to have seen just one of you here with us today.\"The Queen also revealed that the Vesper Martini, which was invented by author Ian Fleming as James Bond's drink of choice, was a favourite tipple of the \"much missed\" Dame Jilly.At the event, Queen Camilla met the festival's founders and panellists.She then officially opened the festival, delivering a speech before a panel discussion on the importance of reading and studying literature.Queen Camilla then hosted a reception in the French Dining Room, with attendees including Sir Salman Rushdie and Sir Ian Rankin.Earlier in the week, Queen Camilla led the tributes to Dame Jilly, who died after a fall.In a statement, she said she hoped her hereafter would be filled \"with impossibly handsome men and devoted dogs\".Since Dame Jilly's death, there has been an outpouring of love for her.Many of the themes that dominated her so-called bonkbusters - sex, affection and horses - have been central to those tributes.At the festival, others shared their love and affection for Dame Jilly.Speaking to reporters, Sir Ian said he had read her novel Rivals and \"loved it\".He said he had met her multiple times, and that they had kept in touch.\"I got lovely letters from her, long letters and cards and everything , I think my wife was quite worried at one point,\" he joked.He added that she was a \"terrific writer,\" while Sir Salman simply said it was \"a sad loss\".",

    "body": "19 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporter,Joe PikePolitics investigations correspondent andSam FrancisPolitical reporterGetty ImagesSir Tony Blair met with Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street while still prime minister, following lobbying by Lord Peter Mandelson, the BBC has confirmed.A memo written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft, dated 14 May 2002, briefs Sir Tony about \"super-rich\" financial adviser Epstein ahead of a meeting scheduled at 17.00 GMT that day.The meeting was six years before Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: \"As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002, and discussed US and UK politics. He never met or engaged with him subsequently.\"He added: \"This was, of course, long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction.\"Emails seen by BBC News show Lord Mandelson pushed for the meeting, telling Sir Tony's chief of staff Jonathan Powell that Epstein was \"a friend of mine\" who ex-US President Bill Clinton hoped to introduce to the PM.The release of this and several related documents had previously been blocked by government officials due to concerns about the impact on UK-US relations.The document has now been released by the National Archives under a Freedom of Information request, following the sacking of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador after fresh revelations about his friendship with the disgraced financier.In the email to Powell - the current UK government's national security adviser - Lord Mandelson refers to Epstein as \"safe\".The email on 7 May 2002 states: \"Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB?\"This was frustrated - TB said at the time - in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies.\"He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him.\"The email continues: \"I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him.\"I have ascertained from Jeffrey that he is flexible - he could be here any time from Tuesday onwards to fit round the diary - but would obviously need to know reasonably quickly so as to re-schedule accordingly. Can you let me know?\"There are three separate handwritten notes on the print-out of the email, some of which are illegible, but one appears to read \"do you want to do this... Because you wanted to see Clinton by yourself... I know very little more about him\".At the time, Lord Mandelson was a backbench MP, having twice resigned from the cabinet, but still a force in Labour. Clinton has acknowledged being a former associate of Epstein but said had no knowledge of his crimes.Epstein was convicted in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18 in 2008. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.The National Archive has also released a schedule headed Trade and Industry Meetings with Industry, which includes a memo published on 14 May 2002, briefing Sir Tony about Epstein ahead of a meeting schedule for 17.00 GMT that day. The briefing, written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft is marked R, understood to mean restricted.In the memo, Rycroft, who until March 2025 was the permanent secretary at the Home Office, wrote to Blair: \"Jeffrey Epstein is seeing you at 5pm today. \"He is a financial adviser to the super-rich and a property developer. He is a friend of Bill Clinton and Peter Mandelson.\"Rycroft states: \"The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York\".He adds: \"Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him.\"He thinks you would find worthwhile a conversation with him about a) science and b) international economic and monetary trends.\"The memo was also sent to Powell and Geoffrey Norris, one of Sir Tony's special advisers.",

    "body": "The US has finalised an agreement that will allow Qatar to build an air force facility in Idaho, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced.He said the facility - where pilots from the Gulf state would be trained to fly F-15 fighter jets - would be established at the Mountain Home Airbase in the north-western US state.\"It's just another example of our partnership,\" Hegseth said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart, Saoud bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, at the Pentagon on Friday.Hegseth also praised Qatar for playing a \"substantial role\" in efforts led by President Donald Trump to secure a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal.Qatar - along with Egypt and Turkey - has been an active mediator during months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas.On Friday, Hegseth said he was \"proud that today we're signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Airbase in Idaho\".\"The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership.\"You can count on us,\" Hegseth told al-Thani.The Pentagon chief did not say how many Qatari F-15s would be based at the Idaho facility, and when it would become operational.Last month, President Trump signed an executive order pledging to use all measures - including the US military - to defend Qatar.The order amounts to an extraordinary security pact between America and a key Arab ally, almost mirroring aspects of a Nato alliance.The move came after Israeli air strikes targeted Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital Doha on 9 September, leaving several lower-level members of the Palestinian group dead, along with a Qatari security official.Qatar hosts Washington's biggest military base in the Middle East - the al-Udeid.The base - home to the US military's headquarters for all air operations in the region - was attacked earlier this by Iran in retaliation for American strikes against its nuclear sites.",

    "body": "A tiny island with more sheep than people needs a new tenant - could you live here?3 days agoNathan BevanBBC WalesBBCDespite its remoteness, the island is described as being \"very much a living community\"A tiny island off Gwynedd's Llŷn Peninsula, with more sheep than humans, is looking for new nature-loving inhabitants to live and work there. Ynys Enlli, also known as Bardsey Island, is wind-whipped, sea-sprayed and most definitely off-grid, boasting - as it does - a current year-round population of just three people. In 2023, it also became the first International Dark Sky Sanctuary in Europe, meaning its unspoiled view of the night sky is protected for current and future generations.And now, for the first time in almost 20 years, the trust which owns and runs the island, is welcoming one adventurous family or couple to its craggy shoreline - and the \"opportunity of a lifetime\". Bardsey Island Trust is asking anyone who might be interested in moving there to come forward, with the successful applicant settling on the island in September 2026.Once comfortably installed, the newest residents will be in charge of managing its 200 sheep and 25 Welsh Black cattle, alongside current tenant famer Gareth Roberts, from Aberdaron.\"Gareth and his family have been there since 2007, and he knows the island intimately - and the challenges and benefits of living on Enlli,\" said the trust's chief officer, Sian Stacey, adding Mr Roberts will mentor the new arrivals.Measuring just 440 acres (0.69 square miles), the island is a national nature reserve and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI).International Dark Sky Sanctuary certification saw the island join 16 other sites worldwide, each of them recognised as the most remote and dark places on Earth. However, with a handful of seasonal residents living there temporarily, as wardens, for some of the year, Sian described it as being \"very much a living community\".\"I lived there for three years myself - it's an amazing place to be,\" she said.  What is Bardsey Island famous for?No wifi or electricity in the houses, and the water flows straight from a wellIt's a mile and a half at its longest and a half mile at its widestThe \"Burial Place of 20,000 Saints\" hails from the early Middle Ages, when it was believed three pilgrimages to Enlli were as spiritually significant as one to RomePilgrims, pirates, fishermen, and farmers have been visiting the island since the 2nd Century BC200 sheepThe 1821 lighthouse still stands at the southern end of the islandEurope's first Dark Sky SanctuaryHome to 30,000 breeding pairs of Manx shearwaterAmanda RuggeriThe island's sheep vastly outnumber its human residentsHailed as one of the holiest places in Britain during the Middle Ages, Ynys Enlli has been dubbed the Island of 20,000 Saints. Legend also casts it as the final resting place of pilgrims from across the world seeking salvation. An excavation in the 1990s unearthed dozens of medieval graves.More stories like this Related internet links",

    "body": "12 minutes agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent reporting from IstanbulHamas is pressing Israel to include prominent Palestinians in a prisoner-release list -  part of a ceasefire deal that will also see hostages returned from Gaza.Hamas's insistence comes after the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 prisoners to be freed, but excluded seven high-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat.The men, who are serving sentences after being convicted of involvement in separate deadly attacks in Israel, have long been seen by Palestinians as symbols of resistance.Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released before 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday as part of the deal proposed by US President Donald Trump.A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that US envoy Steve Witkoff had promised to raise the exclusion of the Palestinian prisoners with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israel has firmly refused to include them.It is not clear whether this could be a sticking point, or impact the timeline for the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.Follow live updatesWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?What we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementPalestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityThe releases are due to take place in the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal, approved this week to end the two-year war in Gaza.It is unclear how the hostages will be released this time - on previous occasions Hamas paraded them in public, infuriating Israel and many of its Western allies. The bodies of deceased hostages will also be returned. It is thought that at least 26 hostages are deceased, with the fate of two others unknown.Israel will also release about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails, and another 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza who have been detained.Hamas had submitted a list of prisoners it wanted released that included Barghouti and Saadat.Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted in 2004 of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders.Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.Saadat, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was sentenced to 30 years after being convicted in 2008 of heading an \"illegal terrorist organisation\" and involvement in attacks, including the assassination of an Israeli minister in 2001.Among the 250 prisoners set to be released is Iyad Abu al-Rub, an Islamic Jihad commander convicted of orchestrating suicide bombings in Israel that killed 13 people in the early 2000s.According to the Israeli justice ministry, he will be released either to Gaza or deported abroad.The BBC understands that Hamas is also pushing for some possible additional prisoner releases. These relate to Palestinian prisoners who were released years ago as part of an exchange for the hostage Gilad Shalit - and then were rearrested after 7 October.Hamas argues that since they were part of a previous hostage exchange, they should not be included in the 250 figure.In Israel, hospitals are preparing for the release of hostages as families await their return.The first phase of the Israel-Hamas deal saw a ceasefire take effect on Friday and Israeli forces partially withdraw from parts of Gaza. Hundreds of aid trucks a day are now expected to enter. The next phases are still being negotiated.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned from southern Gaza to Gaza City, weeks after fleeing the Israeli offensive that destroyed much of the city.Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency has said it is conducting recovery operations and pulling bodies from the rubble, with Palestinians still missing across the territory.Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Since then, 67,682 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.Additional reporting by Mallory Moench",

    "body": "8 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterDamien Dursonial handoutDamien Dursonial (C) and his family were among the arrivals at Heathrow this weekThe UK government is facing calls to support Chagos Islanders who need temporary housing after a surge of them arrived in the country to claim their right to British citizenship.Hillingdon Council said 152 Chagossians had arrived at Heathrow Airport in the borough this week so far, bringing the total to over 600 since last July.The Tory-run council says it expects to spend £2m this year on its legal duty to help homeless British-Chagossians, putting pressure on stretched housing resources and \"breaking\" its finances.Many of the Chagossians are coming from Mauritius because they say they feel unsafe there after the UK government agreed a deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to the country.The UK government said Chagossians were expected to make their own housing arrangements prior to travelling and argued the influx of arrivals was \"completely unrelated\" to the Chagos Islands deal with Mauritius.The Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, then an overseas territory of the UK, was transformed into a military base in the 1960s and the entire population was forced to move out, mainly to Mauritius or the Seychelles.But in 2002, a limited number of Chagossians were granted the right to full British citizenship. Several thousand now live in the UK, incuding an expat population of 3,000 in Crawley, West SussexThen in November 2022, the government launched a new British nationality route which was widened to all individuals of Chagossian descent, living anywhere in the world, permitting them to be recognised as British citizens free of charge.Adults have five years, from 23 November 2022, to claim British nationality. Children born within the five-year application time have until they are 23 to apply.This predated the the UK government's decision this year to sign a deal to hand ownership of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base that was built on Diego Garcia - the largest of the islands.The deal has not gone down well with many Chagossians, who see it as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland.Some fear they could be prosecuted by Mauritian authorities for supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago.Damien Dursonial, 35, landed at Heathrow with his wife and two children, aged four and six, on Wednesday this week.Born in Mauritius, where he worked as a police constable, Mr Dursonial saved up for two years and sold his motorcycle to pay for the flights to the UK.\"I came to the UK because it was the only place where we could feel safe, respected and recognised as a British citizen,\" Mr Dursonial said.\"As a Chagossian in Mauritius, we faced real threats by simply identifying as British or supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos islands.\"Mr Dursonial and his family have been placed in temporary accommodation by Hillingdon Council, in West London.But he said: \"The government should have done this because all this work is falling on a local council.\"It had to spend about £1.2m. Whereas ministers are giving away the Chagos Archipelago and taxpayer funds to Mauritius.\"Steve Tuckwell says the cost of housing arrivals is \"breaking the council\"Hillingdon Council says it is at risk of going effectively bankrupt and has put in a request for exceptional financial support from the government.It is aiming to cut spending by £38m this year, the largest savings target the council has ever undertaken.\"It's breaking the council,\" Steve Tuckwell, the cabinet member for planning, housing and growth at the Conservative-run council, told the BBC.\"It's taking away hard-earned taxpayers' money from core services.\"Tuckwell, a former Tory MP, said the council had written to ministers asking for funding to support Chagossians but had not received any responses.\"I'm calling on the government to do the right thing,\" Tuckwell said. \"Stop this burden on Hillingdon taxpayers. The bank account is running dry.\"The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814 and became formally established as an overseas territory after the UK government bought the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965.The islanders were evicted between 1967 and 1973 to create a joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia.The global population of Chagossians is estimated to be about 10,000, with many of them living in Mauritius, the Seychelles or the UK.Vanessa Mandarin Calu, who works with Biot Citizen, said many British-Chagossians were temporarily settling in the UK while they wait to return to their homeland.\"Our homeland is a British Overseas Territory - the government should create a clear pathway for British-Chagossians instead of handing our territory to another country without consulting us,\" Ms Mandarin Calu said.Hillingdon Council opened a pop-up processing centre in the borough this week to deal with the surge in Chagossian arrivals.Local authorities have a legal duty to help eligible people who are homeless and provide temporary accommodation for families with dependents.As British citizens, people of Chagossian descent are entitled to the same support as any other homeless person with a UK passport.The council says it is already struggling to support asylum seekers placed in the borough by the Home Office.A government spokesperson said: \"Chagossians travelling to the United Kingdom are expected to arrange their own accommodation prior to arrival. \"Hillingdon Council has received funding to provide support in cases where immediate local pressures arise and cannot be resolved through standard contingency measures, with support for all local authorities kept under ongoing review.\"This is completely unrelated to the Diego Garcia Military Base agreement signed with Mauritius. \"In November 2022, the last government launched a route to British citizenship for the descendants of those born on the Chagos Archipelago. The Diego Garcia agreement has no impact on this.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoAlison EarleLondonRunaway horses Trojan and Vida were filmed by a BBC cameraman who was covering the Post Office InquiryA military horse that bolted through central London after being startled by construction work has retired to the country.Quaker, 15, was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses spooked when rubble was dropped through a plastic tunnel while they were on an exercise in Belgravia on 24 April last year.Footage of the frightened animals was broadcast worldwide after being captured by a BBC cameraman covering the Post Office Inquiry.Service personnel were thrown from their horses and the animals ran loose, smashing into vehicles, including a double-decker bus, resulting in a number of injuries.PA MediaMaj Thomas Stewart said Quaker was the only horse of the five that was unable to return to the Household CavalryQuaker suffered bleeding and a small break during the incident. After receiving surgery, he stayed with the Horse Trust at its sanctuary in Buckinghamshire.Quaker's rider broke his back when he was thrown off but after a year in recovery he was able to return to his duties and is riding again.Maj Thomas Stewart, Life Guards squadron leader, said Quaker was the only horse from the five that had been unable to return to its duties.Household Cavalry horses Trojan, Tennyson, Vanquish and Vida have all returned to duty.\"It was decided that actually it was best for [Quaker's] welfare that he wasn't going to come back to us down in London,\" he said.\"It's better for him that he's here and enjoys it while he's here.\"Jeanette Allen, CEO of the Horse Trust, said Quaker's retirement involved eating, sleeping and running around \"when he feels like it\".\"We were founded nearly 140 years ago by a lady who read Black Beauty, and she was inspired to help London's cab horses,\" she said. \"Respite for London's working horses is where we started and over time we started retiring military horses.\"PA MediaQuaker will spend the rest of his days at the Buckinghamshire sanctuaryLt Col Matt Woodward, commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, said what happened in April last year was unusual, because \"the horses got lost\".\"They were at a place called Wilson Crescent,\" he explained. \"They came around the crescent the wrong way and exited on the east side. \"Had they exited on the north side they'd have gone back to Hyde Park and probably everything would have been fine. \"It's just unfortunate they went around the crescent to Victoria and a couple of them made it to Limehouse - which is a long way.\"The Horse Trust is the permanent home for 32 former military horses, 26 of which have served with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. As well as taking in horses at the end of their working life, the trust offers a respite scheme where military and police horses can take \"short breaks and summer holidays\" and return to duty refreshed.The Horse Trust spends about £2.5m a year caring for its horses, and is mostly funded by donations.More on this story",

    "body": "The UK is \"ready to progress\" to using the full value of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's war effort, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said.In a statement, the leaders of the UK, France and Germany said the joint action would \"increase pressure\" on Russian President Vladimir Putin and \"bring Russia to the negotiation table\". It added the move would be taken \"in close cooperation\" with the US.UK sanctions have frozen more than £25bn of Russian assets since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But until now, funds sent to Ukraine using Russian assets had only been taken from profits and interest accrued on them. Sir Keir told Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky that the UK, France and Germany were \"united in wanting to drive progress towards using the full value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to end the war\".He added that more sanctions \"in the coming days and weeks\" would add further pressure on Moscow. The announcement comes after European leaders met in Copenhagen last week to discuss using frozen Russian assets for a €140bn ($162bn; £121bn) loan to Ukraine.Last month, US President Donald Trump called on G7 allies to seize \"or otherwise use\" frozen Russian assets, according to the Financial Times.The value of frozen Russian assets in the EU is estimated to be almost €211bn (£181bn).Russia launched extensive missile and drone strikes across Ukraine on Friday, causing power cuts in large parts of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and eight other regions.Two people were killed and at least 20 people were injured in the attack, Ukrainian officials said.In a post on X following the attack, Zelensky wrote that the \"cynical and calculated attack\" targeted civilian and energy infrastructure.\"What's needed is not empty words but decisive action - from the United States, Europe and the G7 - in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,\" he wrote.\"Every sanction decision weakens Russia's war machine,\" Zelensky wrote, in a separate post.Also on Friday, Zelensky told the BBC he would urge Sir Keir to join the PURL programme, under which Nato countries buy weapons from the US to give to Ukraine.While praising the UK's strong support for Kyiv, he said it should send a clear signal that it would take part in the system, as well as impose more sanctions on Russia.",

    "body": "14 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia business correspondent, Tokyo andPeter HoskinsBusiness reporterReutersAsahi Super Dry is Japan's most popular beerOnly four bottles of Asahi Super Dry beer are left on the shelves of Ben Thai, a cosy restaurant in the Tokyo suburb of Sengawacho.Its owner, Sakaolath Sugizaki, expects to get a few more soon, but she says her supplier is keeping the bulk of its stock for bigger customers.That's because Asahi, the maker of Japan's best-selling beer, was forced to halt production at most of its 30 factories in the country at the end of last month after being hit by a cyber-attack.While all of its facilities in Japan - including six breweries - have now partially reopened, its computer systems are still down.That means it has to process orders and shipments manually - using pen, paper and fax machines - resulting in much fewer shipments than before the attack.Asahi accounts for about 40% of Japan's beer market, so its problems are having a major impact on bars, restaurants and retailers.The company has apologised \"for any difficulties caused by the recent attack\" but has not yet said when it expects its operations to be fully up and running again.The BBC visited convenience stores and supermarkets in Tokyo and Hokkaido - where workers said they were selling their current stock and hadn't been able to place new orders for Asahi products, which also include water and food items.Hisako Arisawa, who runs a liquor store in Tokyo, says she is worried about her customers as she can only get a few bottles of Super Dry at a time and expects the disruption to go on for at least a month.The problem isn't just affecting beer, she adds, there are also shortages of Asahi's soft drinks, such as ginger beer and soda water.Getty ImagesConvenience stores in Japan have warned of shortages of Asahi productsLast week, some of the country's biggest convenience store chains warned their customers to expect shortages.FamilyMart said its Famimaru range of bottled teas, which are made by Asahi, were expected to be in short supply or out of stock.7-Eleven halted shipments in Japan of Asahi products, while Lawsons also said it expected shortages.Mr Nakano, who didn't want to share his first name, works for an alcohol wholesaler.While some shipments from Asahi have resumed, he says he is only getting about 10-20% of the normal amount.His orders are now handwritten and taken by fax. Asahi notifies him by fax when lorries are ready to leave its factory.Asahi also owns big brands in Europe - such as Peroni, Grolsch, and the British brewer Fuller's - but the firm has said those operations have not been affected by the cyber-attack.Ransomware group Qilin - which has previously hacked other major organisations - has claimed responsibility for the attack on Asahi.It operates a platform that allows users to carry out cyber-attacks in exchange for a percentage of extortion proceeds.Asahi has not confirmed the nature of the attack on its operations but has said data suspected to have been leaked in the hack had been found on the internet.It is the latest in a series of cyber-attacks by other hacking groups that have hit major firms around the world, including carmaker Jaguar Land Rover and retail giant Marks and Spencer.Travellers were delayed at a number of European airports in September after a ransomware attack disrupted check-in and boarding software.Back in Japan, a cyber-attack paralysed operations at a container terminal in the city of Nagoya for three days in 2024.Japan Airlines was also hacked last Christmas, causing delays and cancellations to domestic flights.AFP via Getty ImagesA cyber-attack on Japan Airlines caused flight delays and cancellationsWhile Japan's image around the world may be of a technologically advanced nation, some experts have warned it does not have enough cybersecurity professionals and has low rates of digital literacy when it comes to business software.This issue was highlighted last year when officials finally stopped asking people to submit documents to the government using floppy disks, even though they fell out of fashion in much of the rest of the world in the 1990s.Japan is vulnerable to cyber-attacks \"given a reliance on legacy systems and a society with a high level of trust,\" Cartan McLaughlin from Nihon Cyber Defence Group told the BBC.Many organisations in the country are not prepared for attacks and are willing to pay ransoms, which makes them attractive to hackers, he added.Speaking at a news conference this week, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the Asahi cyber-attack was being investigated.\"We will continue to improve our cyber capabilities,\" he added.Earlier this year, the Japanese government passed a landmark law giving it more powers in the event of cyber-attacks.Experts have praised the Active Cyber Defense Law (ACD), because it allows the government to share more information with companies, and also empowers the police and Japan's Self-Defense Forces to mount their own attacks to neutralise attackers' servers.But that is little consolation to small businesses like Ben Thai restaurant and its customers.Owner Sakaolath says she's not sure what will happen the next time she puts in an order for Super Dry, and nor do many others across Japan.Additional reporting by Chie Kobayashi in Tokyo",

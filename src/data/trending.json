    "body": "16 hours agoLyse DoucetChief international correspondentWatch: BBC asks Trump if breakup of Nato is price he is willing to pay for GreenlandOn day one, he put the world on notice. \"Nothing will stand in our way,\" President Donald Trump declared, to thunderous applause, as he ended his inauguration speech in a cold Washington winter on this day last year, at the start of his second term. Did the world fail to take enough notice?Tucked into his speech was a mention of the 19th Century doctrine of \"manifest destiny\" – the idea that the US was divinely ordained to expand its territory across the continent, spreading American ideals.At that moment, the Panama Canal was in his sights. \"We're taking it back,\" Trump announced.Now that same declaration, expressed with absolute resolve, is directed at Greenland. \"We have to have it,\" is the new mantra. It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk.US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name.EPA/ShutterstockFrench President Emmanuel Macron spoke at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday but avoided any direct mention of TrumpThere is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\"Fine introduced a bill called \"Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act\" in Congress last week.How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way?Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table.He doesn't talk like a traditional politician,\" explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. \"He says and then he does,\" is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right.\"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine.\"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that.\"And he doesn't hide it.\"Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit,\" Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \"We're tremendously feared.\"If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases.\"I need to own it,\" is how Trump flatly puts it.And he often makes it clear, \"I like to win.\" There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about.His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling.ReutersMerchandise opposing a US takeover of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, have appeared in shops in CopenhagenIn the Saudi capital Riyadh in May, we watched how his major speech on his first foreign trip of his second term met a rapturous reception.Trump took aim at the American \"interventionists\" whom he excoriated for having \"wrecked far more nations than they built... in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\"In June when Israel attacked Iran, Trump reportedly warned Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to put his diplomacy at risk with his military threats against Tehran. By the end of the week, when he saw Israel's success in assassinating top nuclear scientists and security chiefs, Trump exclaimed: \"I think it's been excellent.\"\"Sane-washing\" was the phrase coined months ago by Edward Luce of the Financial Times to describe the world's polite portrayals of Trump, the succession of leaders landing at his door with glittering gifts and gilded praise to try to win him over to their side.\"Trump's apologists – a more numerous crowd than true believers - work round the clock to sane-wash his policies into something coherent,\" Luce wrote in his latest column.ReutersTrump met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh in May 2025It was on full display last October when leaders the world over were summoned to join him at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh to celebrate his ringing declaration that \"at long last we have peace in the Middle East\" for the first time in \"3,000 years.\"The first significant phase of his peace plan had brought about a desperately needed ceasefire in Gaza and the urgent release of Israeli hostages. It was Trump's muscular diplomacy that forced Netanyahu, as well as Hamas, to agree to it. It was a major breakthrough only Trump could achieve. But it wasn't – sadly - the dawn of peace. No-one there said the quiet part out loud.Last year Trump's approach was framed as manifest destiny. This year it's the early 19th Century Monroe Doctrine now updated, since the Venezuela invasion, as the \"Donroe Doctrine.\" President Trump now owns it, bolstered by his fervent backers on his team, with his belief that America can act at will in its backyard, and beyond, to protect American interests.ReutersIn October, Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White HouseSometimes he is called an isolationist, sometimes an interventionist. But there's always that slogan which returned him to power - Make America Great Again.And his letter to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre highlighted his obsessive pique over not winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Trump informed Støre: \"I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"\"It's a good day to have a Nordic temperament,\" Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide diplomatically remarked to me when I asked about this moment. Norway has been calm, with ice-hard firmness, in its defence of Greenland and Denmark and collective security in the Arctic.European responses still stretch across this slippery political ice.Macron has vowed to launch the EU's \"trade bazooka\" of counter-tariffs and restricting access to the EU's lucrative market.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, one of the American president's closest European allies, has vaguely spoken of a \"problem of understanding and miscommunication.\"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has strongly and publicly defended Greenland's territorial integrity but wants to protect the strong personal bond he's built over the past year by avoiding retaliatory tariffs.ReutersSir Keir Starmer has maintained a largely cordial relationship with Trump since he started his second term as presidentThe gloves are off for Trump as he posts the private messages he's receiving from leaders using the old tools of statecraft to try to keep him on side.\"Let us have a dinner in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US,\" suggested the French president who also queried, in the midst of praise for other foreign policy successes, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland\".\"Can't wait to see you\", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump \"daddy\" for his forceful handling of the Iran-Israel 12-day war last year.Nato boss commends 'daddy' Trump's handling of Israel-Iran conflictRutte, and others, have credited Trump's blunt threats for forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats.On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own.\"We have to take the world as it is, not the way we want it to be,\" was the candid reflection of Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on his trip to China last week.It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear signal of this fast changing world.Watch: Canada-China trade relationship \"more predictable\" than with US, says CarneyTrump's astonishing threat to annex his neighbour to the north surfaced again this week in a post on social media which showed the western hemisphere, including Canada and Greenland, covered in stars and stripes. Canadians know there's still a risk they could be next.Carney, the former central banker, rose to Canada's highest office last year buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. He responded \"dollar for dollar\" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border.When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture.\"American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes,\" he said, adding bluntly: \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.\"On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world watching.Asked by the New York Times this month what could stop him, Trump replied: \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.\"That's what lies behind an armada of allies now seeking to persuade, flatter, force him – to change his mind.This time, it's not certain they will succeed.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "41 minutes agoTabby WilsonBBC/Getty ImagesBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni have been at loggerheads since starring together in It Ends With UsBlake Lively referred to Justin Baldoni as a \"doofus director\" and a \"clown\", according to newly unsealed court documents from the actress's legal case.The pair starred together in It Ends With Us, but Lively sued Baldoni in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and waging a smear campaign against her. Baldoni strongly denies the claims and is defending the lawsuit.Text messages from 2023 between Lively and people close to her appear to show that Lively called Baldoni a \"rabid pig\", while her friend Taylor Swift suggested Baldoni knew the lawsuit was coming \"because he's gotten out his tiny violin\".Baldoni's $400m (£295m) counter-suit was dismissed by a judge last June. Neither has yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.Lively's case is set to go to trial in May.  The newly unsealed documents show both Lively and Baldoni venting to friends and colleagues about filming It Ends With Us, and the subsequent press tour, ahead of the film's release in August 2024.In the messages, Lively referred to Baldoni as \"this doofus director of my movie\" and described him as \"a clown\" who \"thinks he's a writer now\".In their filing earlier this week, Lively's team did not deny the language she had used but said the text messages were missing context.They referred the court to the \"complete\" text exchange, including subsequent messages from Lively to Baldoni which said \"we all benefit\" from her relationship with Swift and her husband Ryan Reynolds, and \"you will too, I can promise you\".Text messages between Lively and singer Taylor Swift (pictured) appear to be among the unsealed documentsThe messages also show Lively saying of Baldoni: \"Despite his repeated disturbing behaviour and acts, I still feel bad for him.\"To be reminded multiple times daily that he's smearing me for... asking him not to sexually or emotionally harass me? For making his movie better? For calling in all the favours to turn out all the biggest musicians and entertainers to contribute to making his movie better? For leading a marketing campaign for free?\"She continued: \"I literally don't know a single thing I've done that he can smear me about. Ryan [Reynolds] says [Baldoni] should be writing me apology and thank you letters every day. And instead he chooses to make a monster outta me.\"But what's my crime. I've only ever stayed focused on the work and given him every opportunity to make it better. And he just keeps behaving like a rabid pig.\"The messages also appear to show Lively texted Baldoni's former The Man Enough Podcast co-host, Liz Plank in May 2023, and told her that \"today I came home and cried\" following an \"SOS set visit\". Plank responded by saying that she \"thought maybe things had gotten better\", and that it was \"astounding they have gotten away with so much\". It is unclear who \"they\" refers to.The documents note that Plank recalled working on Baldoni's set as \"truly one of the worst days of [her] life\". Later that year, Lively also sent texts to actress and co-star Jenny Slate, and said she was \"dreading\" going back to set and \"getting hits of the experience in really upsetting ways\".In her deposition, Slate also alleged misconduct on the set of the film, with court documents revealing that she had made complaints against Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath during the course of filming It Ends With Us.Similarly, texts sent by Baldoni also suggest friction between him and Lively. In February 2024, Baldoni told Heath that he was concerned that Lively would use the allegations she had made against him as leverage. He wrote: \"She had the nuclear bomb. If she doesn't promote the movie she can leak that I'm a bad person or that she felt unsafe with me and 'all the stuff' she has on me. Then she's the victim.\"Heath is the CEO of Wayfarer Studios, the independent production company behind It Ends With Us, which is named in Lively's lawsuit.Her legal filing accuses Baldoni and Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\", in addition to a hostile working environment.The text messages were unsealed on Tuesday before a summary judgement hearing in Lively's ongoing lawsuit that is scheduled for 22 January.The BBC has contacted Lively and Baldoni's respective legal teams for comment.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPeers in the House of Lords have been urged to vote in support of a ban on social media for under-16s in the UK.Lord Nash, a former schools minister, has proposed a change to a bill, which would raise the age limit for users of social media. The legislation will be debated later on Wednesday.It comes amid calls for the UK government to follow Australia in imposing a social media ban for young people - the world's first - last year.But some campaigners and children's charities have opposed the move, which Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out.Earlier this week, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall announced a \"swift\" consultation on measures to \"keep children safe online\" and seek views on the effectiveness of a ban.It will assess the merits of a ban for under-16s, as well as overnight curfews and actions to prevent \"doom-scrolling\".It would also look at whether more robust age checks could be implemented by social media firms, which could be forced to remove or limit features \"which drive compulsive use of social media\".And England's education inspectorate, Ofsted, will give tougher guidance to schools to reduce phone use - including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.Conservative peer Lord Nash argued there was no need for a consultation, partly because polling showed \"the vast majority of parents want it\".\"There is a huge volume of evidence in academic studies around the world that show quite clearly that excessive use of social media is damaging to children's health,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.He said his amendment proposed \"highly effective age verification\".\"The social media companies are perfectly capable, and have told me this, of putting in place highly effective age verification.\"He added: \"We're just asking for a few more years for children to mature so that they do have to deal with social media at 16, they're more likely to distinguish fact from fiction and they can make better judgements.\"Lord Nash's amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill has been co-sponsored by Labour peer Baroness Berger, Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Benjamin and independent crossbench peer Baroness Cass.However, if the amendment passed in the Lords, it could be overturned in the House of Commons by MPs at a later stage.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it was in power.\"The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,\" she said.The Liberal Democrats have called for film-style age ratings to protect children.Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said there was \"no time to waste in protecting our children from social media giants\" and \"this consultation risks kicking the can down the road yet again\".",

    "body": "Photos leaked to BBC show faces of hundreds killed in Iran's brutal protest crackdown7 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,correspondent, BBC Verify,Shayan Sardarizadeh,senior journalist, BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,senior journalistBBCWarning: this story contains graphic content which some readers might find distressingHundreds of photos revealing the faces of those killed during Iran's violent crackdown on anti-government protests have been leaked to BBC Verify.The pictures, which are too graphic to show without blurring, reveal the bloodied, swollen and bruised faces of at least 326 victims - including 18 women. The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.Getty ImagesProtesters on a street in Tehran on 9 January BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as \"seditionists\".Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out.Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify.We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said.Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. Crowds of anti-government protesters in TehranThe slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.",

    "body": "54 minutes agoEmer Moreau,Business reporterandSimon Browning,Transport producerRyanair boss Michael O'Leary has thanked Elon Musk for all the additional publicity that their online spat has brought his airline, saying sales have risen two to three percent in the last five days.Musk has suggested he could buy the budget airline and called O'Leary \"insufferable\" and \"an idiot\", after O'Leary rejected the idea of using Musk's Starlink technology to provide wifi on flights.At a press conference on Wednesday, O'Leary said he takes \"no insult\" at Musk's jibes, and that he is regularly insulted at home by his four teenage children and many others.He also said Musk is \"free\" to invest in Ryanair shares, but under EU laws, Musk could not own a majority of a European airline.Musk is the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $769bn (£573bn), and O'Leary runs Europe's busiest airline. Both are known to court media attention with strong language and provocative statements.O'Leary said at the press conference that his team is going to X's office in Dublin to give Musk a free Ryanair ticket to thank him for the \"wonderful boost\" in publicity he's had.\"If he wants to call me an idiot, he wouldn't be the first, and he certainly won't be the last ... But if it helps to boost Ryanair sales, you could insult me all day, every day.\"The squabble between the two intensified after O'Leary called Musk an \"idiot\" and said using Starlink to provide Ryanair passengers with free wifi would not be cost-effective.O'Leary added that the cost of installing Starlink would be €250, (£218m) to fit all necessary equipment — and would increase fuel costs by €100m (£87m) per year.He said he thinks only 5% of Ryanair passengers would pay for wifi, so there would be poor return on investment. On the prospect of Musk buying the Irish airline, O'Leary said: \"We're a publicly owned company. He's free to [buy shares] at any time, but non-European citizens cannot own a majority of European airlines.\"\"If he wants to invest in Ryanair, we would think it's a very good investment.\"O'Leary called all social media \"a cesspit\", but conceded it was important for Ryanair's marketing.The company is known to take an irreverent approach to social media, often mocking customers for complaining about the airline's cost-cutting measures.O'Leary said he'd had no direct contact with Elon Musk.Musk has floated the idea of buying Ryanair several times on X in the past week, but EU-based airlines must be majority owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.Last week, after German airline Lufthansa announced it would install Starlink on its planes to provide all passengers with free wi-fi, O'Leary said Musk knew \"zero\" about flight aerodynamics.",

    "body": "18 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the \"old order is not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers to come together in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said on Tuesday, adding that he believed powerful nations were using economic coercion to get what they want.He also affirmed Canada's support for Greenland, Denmark and the Nato alliance, drawing applause. Carney did not mention Donald Trump by name, but some of his remarks seemed aimed at the US president, who is threatening to tariff European allies and the UK unless Greenland is surrendered to the US. \"Great powers\" are often defined as countries with permanent seats on United Nations Security Council - China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States - which shows their economic and military dominance in the world. Middle powers, such as Canada, Australia, Argentina, South Korea and Brazil, are nations that still exert large influence in global politics, even though their economies are smaller.In his speech, Carney said the world is \"in the midst of a rupture, not a transition\".\"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" he said.He also said \"Canada was amongst the first to hear the wake-up call\" that geography and historic alliances no longer guaranteed security or prosperity.When Trump returned to office, he frequently referred to Canada as the \"51st state\" and threatened to join Canada and the US through \"economic force.\" The US then hit its northern neighbour and major trading partner with steep tariffs.Canada's deal with China signals it is serious about shift from USFrom surge in patriotism to fewer US trips - Trump's impact on CanadaWhy does Trump want Greenland and what could it mean for Nato and the EU?What tariffs has Trump announced and why?Recently, Trump added Canada to his push to take control of the partly sovereign territory of Greenland, which has grown stronger and more overt in recent days, by posting on social media a map of the US, Canada and Greenland with an image of the American flag laid over it. As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), Canada stands firmly with Greenland and Denmark and supports \"their unique right to determine Greenland's future\", Carney said in his speech.\"Our commitment to Article Five is unwavering,\" the prime minister added, referring to a clause in the Nato agreement that states an attack against one member state is considered an attack on all.Canadian media outlets reported earlier this week that Canada was considering sending a small contingent of troops to Greenland to join Danish and other European troops for military exercises in the region. Asked about it in Davos, Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said \"we regularly participate in Nato exercises, and we participate in exercises that the Canadian Armed Forces itself leads\". She added that the Minister of National Defence and the chief of defence staff make decisions on future deployments.The BBC has reached out to the Canada's Department of National Defence for comment.Carney said in his speech that to adapt to shifting geopolitics, Canada is now focused on engaging with other countries and building \"different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests\".The prime minister pitched Canada as a \"stable and reliable\" partner, and noted recent trade and investment deals that were struck with China and Qatar, as well as a defence procurement pact Canada signed with the EU earlier last year.Carney is among several world leaders at the World Economic Forum this week. Trump is scheduled to deliver his own speech on Wednesday. ",

    "body": "Driving test cheating soars as candidates turn to Bluetooth headsets and impersonators13 hours agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondentandSimon Browning, Transport reporterGetty ImagesCheating cases during practical and theory driving tests rose by nearly 50 per cent last year in England, Scotland and Wales, new figures show.The cheating methods varied, according to freedom of information data from the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), with more than 1,100 cases involving the use of Bluetooth headsets. Overall, nearly 100 offenders were prosecuted for trying to cheat themselves or for impersonating driving test candidates.Industry leaders blamed the increase on the nationwide shortage of tests and drivers' desperation to pass, while the DVSA blamed a general rise in cheating and improved detection. A Press Association News Agency freedom information request revealed 2,844 attempts to cheat during driving tests in the year to September 2025, 47% higher than the previous year. Of those, more than a third (1,113) involved the use of technology, such as an earpiece connected via Bluetooth to a concealed phone, to try to cheat at a theory test.Meanwhile people attempted 1,084 times to try to take theory tests while impersonating the registered candidate.  And in 647 incidents, people pretended to be the registered candidate for a practical test.Dr Rasha Kassem, leader of the Fraud Research Group at Aston University, warned of the dangers of people passing tests illegally without actually knowing how to drive.\"It means that there will be more accidents, collisions, insurance issues as well, damage to the car, and damage to human beings, injuries, and in some cases, death,\" she said.\"There has to be public awareness, because this is a serious crime, from my perspective, and also in the eyes of the law. It is fraud.\"Impersonators, and those who use them, face punishments ranging from driving bans to prison sentences. They can also be ordered to carry out unpaid work or made to pay court costs. Ninety-six people were prosecuted for attempting to cheat on driving tests or impersonate candidates in the 12 months to September last year.Steps taken to try and prevent fraud including matching a practical test candidate's face with their photo ID, as well as asking theory candidates to roll up their sleeves and show their pockets are empty. Examples of people prosecuted last year, reported by the Press Association News Agency, include 23-year-old Qounain Khan, who was handed an eight-month prison sentence in June 2025 after pleading guilty to impersonating learners at theory test centres 12 times.The court heard impersonators could be paid up to £2,000 for passing a test.Sorina-Ana Turcitu, 42, admitted attempting to take a practical driving test on behalf of someone else. She was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 18 months in September 2025.And Ali Rasul, 22, was handed a two-year prison sentence  in November 2025 after being caught repeatedly trying to cheat the theory test over an eight-month period either by using a hidden earpiece or an impersonator.The rise in reported cheating comes as learner drivers face persistently long waits for practical tests slots. The DVSA said it had no evidence cheating was linked to waiting times.However, Carly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association, told the BBC she was not surprised that fraud was on the rise in this context.\"It almost seems inevitable in an era of lots of demand, but very little consistent supply, that you are going to get people engaging in risky behaviours, like using a cheat service to try and pass.\"She said people who \"don't want to risk going on the torturous merry-go-round and trying to get another slot...might take the risk, unfortunately, of cheating.\" Dr Kassem also believed long wait times to book a slot was likely to be a factor, with some people resorting to fraud for reasons such as needing to get a licence quickly for a job.In December, the National Audit Office warned that the driving test backlog would not be cleared until November 2027.Causes include poor recruitment and retention of examiners and third-party websites booking up slots using automated programs known as bots.The Department for Transport (DfT) previously announced more action to try to get the backlog down, including employing military driving examiners and only allowing learner drivers to book and manage their practical driving tests from the coming Spring.Marian Kitson, the DVSA's director of enforcement services, said the organisation was committed to tackling practical and theory test fraud, and had increased its detection capabilities.\"It is essential that all drivers demonstrate they have the right skills, knowledge, and attitude to drive safely. People who attempt to cheat driving tests put all road users at risk by trying to obtain a driving licence fraudulently,\" she said.\"Our counter-fraud team carries out robust investigations into suspected fraud, working with the police to bring fraudsters to justice and keep Britain's roads safe.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "32 minutes agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterGetty ImagesThe BBC has announced a landmark deal with YouTube, which will see the corporation make content that is tailor-made for the video streaming service.The broadcaster has previously used YouTube, which is owned by Google, to promote clips and trailers for its own shows in the UK.But the new move will see the BBC make content primarily aimed at YouTube's  digital-native younger audience, although it may also be made available on the BBC's iPlayer and Sounds platforms.The new programmes will feature adverts when viewed from outside of the UK, generating extra funds for the corporation at a time when its future funding model is being debated.The content will include a mixture of entertainment, news and sport - starting with the Winter Olympics in February.In a statement released on Wednesday, YouTube and the BBC said the deal will showcase \"the best homegrown storytelling and news from across the BBC\".Director general Tim Davie said it would help the BBC help \"connect with audiences in new ways\".\"We're building from a strong start and this takes us to the next level, with bold homegrown content in formats audiences want on YouTube and an unprecedented training programme to upskill the next generation of YouTube creators from across the UK,\" he added.\"Importantly, this partnership also allows new audiences different routes into BBC services like BBC iPlayer and Sounds.\"The new partnership will also see the BBC and YouTube support the government's Creative Industries Sector Plan by investing in \"the next generation of creators\" across the country.Led by the National Film and Television School, 150 media professionals will be invited to develop their YouTube skills at workshops and events.'Digital storytelling'Pedro Pina, vice president of EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) YouTube said they were \"delighted\" to partner with the BBC \"to redefine the boundaries of digital storytelling\".\"This partnership translates the BBC's world-class content for a digital-first audience, ensuring its cultural impact reaches a younger, more global audience,\" he said.\"Beyond the content, our first-of-its-kind training programme represents a deep investment in the UK's creative pipeline designed to empower the next generation of British talent to lead the global creator economy.\"In doing so, we are not just telling the stories of today; we are building the stage for the storytellers of tomorrow.\"In December, the number of people watching YouTube in the UK (52 million) overtook the BBC's combined offerings (51 million) on certain metrics for the first time, according to data reported by rating agency Barb. And last summer, research suggested that social media and video networks had become the main source of news in the US, overtaking traditional TV channels and news websites.The new agreement between YouTube and the BBC covers the latter's UK-based public service broadcasting wing, as well as international content from BBC Studios. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said last year that the BBC's licence fee is \"unenforceable\" and said \"no options are off the table\" as the government reviews the corporation's current funding model.",

    "body": "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted an invitation to join US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace.A statement from his office said Netanyahu would become a member of the board \"which is to be comprised of world leaders\".The board was originally thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. But its proposed charter does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to supplant functions of the UN.The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have also agreed to join, as have Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Morocco and Vietnam. Many others have expressed reservations.It is not clear how many countries have been invited to join Trump's new body -Canada, Russia, Turkey and the UK are among them, but have not yet publicly responded. Norway has said it will not join because the current proposal \"raises a number of questions\", while France and Sweden have indicated they will do the same.According to a copy of the charter leaked to the media, member states will be given a renewable three-year term, but they can secure a permanent place if they contribute $1bn (£740m) of funding to the board. The document says the Board of Peace will be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\". It will \"undertake such peace-building functions in accordance with international law\", it adds.Trump will be the chairman but also \"separately serve\" as representative of the US. A US official has said the chairmanship can be held by Trump \"until he resigns it\", but that a future US president may choose a new representative.As chairman, he will have \"exclusive authority to create, modify or dissolve subsidiary entities as necessary or appropriate to fulfil the Board of Peace's mission\", according to the document. He will also select \"leaders of global stature\" to serve two-year terms on an Executive Board that will help deliver the mission of the Board of Peace, US officials say.Last Friday, the White House named the seven members of the founding Executive Board. They included US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as former British prime minister Tony Blair.Trump also named Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, as the Board of Peace's representative on the ground in Gaza during phase two of Trump's peace plan, which should see the reconstruction and demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas, as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces.Mladenov will act as a link with a Palestinian technocratic government which will \"oversee the restoration of core public services, the rebuilding of civil institutions, and the stabilisation of daily life\".A separate Gaza Executive Board will help support the technocratic government, according to the White House.Witkoff, Kushner, Blair, Rowan, Mladenov will serve on it with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad, Qatari strategic affairs minister Ali al-Thawadi, UAE minister of state for international co-operation Reem al-Hashimy, billionaire Israeli real estate developer Yakir Gabay, and Sigrid Kaag, a Dutch politician and UN special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process.On Saturday, Netanyahu's office said the Gaza Executive Board's composition \"was not co-ordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy\". Israeli media said the decision to include representatives of Turkey and Qatar - which both helped broker the ceasefire that took effect in October, along with Egypt and the US - had happened \"over Israel's head\".Under phase one of the peace plan, Hamas and Israel agreed to the ceasefire, an exchange of living and dead Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and a surge in deliveries of humanitarian aid.Phase two faces major challenges, with Hamas having previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and Israel having not committed to fully withdrawing from Gaza.The ceasefire is also fragile. More than 460 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, while the Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,550 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "While speaking at the Davos summit on Tuesday, French president Emmanuel Macron drew attention for his stern rebuke of US leader Donald Trump's threat to tariff eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland. But another aspect of Macron's speech also made an impression: his choice of eyewear. The French leader wore a striking pair of blue reflective aviator sunglasses indoors while addressing world leaders at the World Economic Forum.While Macron did not explain the reason for the accessory during his speech, French reports have attributed it to an ongoing medical condition.Last week, he appeared at a military event in southern France with a red eye and at one point donned a similar pair of sunglasses.While addressing troops, he downplayed his condition and said it was \"totally benign\" and \"completely insignificant\", adding: \"Please pardon the unsightly appearance of my eye.\"Macron even joked about it, calling it \"l'oeil du tigre\" or the \"eye of the tiger\", in a reference to rock band Survivor's song used in the 1982 boxing movie Rocky III.\"For those who get the reference, it's a sign of determination,\" he said.French reports said that Macron appeared to have a sub-conjunctival haemorrhage, which is a broken blood vessel in his eye.It is harmless, painless and does not affect vision. It also does not cause permanent injury to the eye as it usually clears within a fortnight.It sometimes occurs when a person sneezes or coughs vigorously, or pokes or rubs their eye. Those with diabetes and high blood pressure are more at risk of suffering from the condition.While sunglasses are not necessary to protect vision, those who have the condition may choose to wear glasses to avoid attracting attention.Macron \"opted for this style for aesthetic reasons, because he's a public figure,\" medical doctor and media commentator Jimmy Mohamed told French broadcaster RTL.\"Some people might think he's ill, so to avoid being photographed in that state, he decided to wear sunglasses. The glasses protect his image, but not really his eye.\"His decision has stirred discussion on social media, where some have called Macron \"kéké\", which is French slang for a show-off. Others joked that he was a \"cyborg\" or emulating Hollywood actor Top Cruise in Top Gun, the 1986 movie that made wearing aviators a fashion statement.In the speech he made while wearing the shades, Macron warned against a shift towards autocracy and \"a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot\" and \"imperial ambitions are resurfacing\".This was even more so the case when these tariffs are \"used as leverage against territorial sovereignty\", he said. Trump has also threatened to impose 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne imports over France's refusal to join his \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.",

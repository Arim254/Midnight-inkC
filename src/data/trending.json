The three, aged 48, 45, and 44, were arrested at addresses in west and central London. Searches are ongoing at these and another address in west London.They were arrested on suspicion of assisting a foreign intelligence service, namely Russia, under section 3 of the National Security Act (NSA) 2023, as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged offences under the act led by counter-terrorism police.\"We're seeing an increasing number of who we would describe as 'proxies' being recruited by foreign intelligence services and these arrests,\" Cdr Dominic Murphy, head of Counter Terrorism Policing London, said.\"Anyone who might be contacted by and tempted into carrying out criminal activity on behalf of a foreign state here in the UK should think again. This kind of activity will be investigated and anyone found to be involved can expect to be prosecuted and there are potentially very serious consequences for those who are convicted.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoSimon King,Lead Weather Presenter and Harry SekulichAFP via Getty ImagesGale-force winds batter Plobannalec-Lesconil port, western France, on WednesdayRain and wind warnings have been reduced for the UK as Storm Benjamin has cleared away to the east.The storm, named by the French weather service Météo France, moved through the English Channel earlier on Thursday morning, bringing the most violent winds to the northern coast of France with gusts up to 100mph.But, as it continues to clear away to the east, the impact of the storm for the UK is reducing.While there were initially four Met Office yellow weather warnings covering large swathes of England and Wales, these have been whittled down to two - for rain in Norfolk and Suffolk valid to 18:00 BST and wind across eastern England until 15:00 BST.However, as the rain continues across Norfolk and Suffolk, there is still a low chance of some localised flooding.And while the strongest winds remain offshore in the North Sea and toward Belgium and the Netherlands, it will remain quite gusty across eastern England.Gusts of 40-50mph will still be felt, potentially up to 55mph on coastal regions so a yellow wind warning remains here until 15:00 BST.These wind speeds still have the potential to bring some travel disruption, especially to ferry routes.The weather caused some earlier disruption. More than 2,000 homes were left without power in Suffolk, according to UK Power Networks.Further south, National Rail said a tree on the railway at Carpenders Park, Hertfordshire, was blocking the line for London overground services between Watford Junction and London Euston.South-east England has seen the wettest weather with almost 50mm (2in) of rain falling in parts of Kent.More severe rain and winds are set to batter western Europe, including France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.The Europa League has confirmed two matches scheduled for Thursday have had their kick-off times brought forward.Dutch side Feyenoord will play Greece's Panathinaikos in Rotterdam two hours and 15 minutes earlier than scheduled at 16:30 local time (15:30 BST), it said. Uefa also announced Thursday's Conference League match between Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and ŠK Slovan Bratislava had been brought forward from 21:00 to 18:45 local time.Why is this a named storm?The storm was not expected to be severe enough for the Met Office to name this weather system.However, large parts of northern and western France were forecast to bear the brunt of the severe weather, prompting Météo France - the equivalent of the Met Office - to name this Storm Benjamin, warning of some damage and travel disruption.Orange warnings - the next stage up from a yellow - were issued for seven areas along the Atlantic coast and English Channel.Once a meteorological agency takes the decision to name a storm, there is agreement that all nations use the same name to allow consistency and clearer communication of the impacts.Benjamin will not replace Bram in the list of UK's named storms.

    "body": "3 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East Correspondent and Chris GrahamThe US Secretary of State has said that a move by Israel's parliament towards annexation of the occupied West Bank would threaten Washington's plan to end the conflict in Gaza.\"That's not something we can be supportive of right now,\" Marco Rubio said before leaving for Israel as part of US efforts to shore up a fragile ceasefire deal.In an apparent attempt to embarrass Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, far-right politicians took the symbolic step of giving preliminary approval to a bill granting Israel authority to annex the West Bank.The Palestinians claim the West Bank - occupied by Israel since 1967 - as part of a hoped-for independent state.Last year, the International Court of Justice - the UN's top court - said Israel's occupation was illegal.Netanyahu has previously spoken in support of annexing West Bank land but has not advanced this due to the risk of alienating the US - Israel's most important ally - and Arab countries which have built relations with Israel after decades of enmity. Ultra-nationalists in Netanyahu's governing coalition have repeatedly called for Israel to annex the West Bank outright, though the bill was put forward by MPs outside the government.The bill passed in a 25-24 vote. It is unclear whether it has support to win a majority in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament), and there are ways the prime minister can delay or defeat it.The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Knesset's move, saying Israel would have no sovereignty over Palestinian land.Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews during its occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice last year.As he boarded the plane to Israel, Rubio said annexation would be \"counterproductive\" and \"threatening\" for the peace deal - reiterating US opposition to annexation.His visit on Thursday comes hot on the heels of trips by US Vice-President JD Vance and two special envoys, as the Trump administration attempts to push for the start of talks on the second critical phase of his 20-point Gaza peace plan.The first phase - which includes a ceasefire, the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces and an influx of aid - came into effect earlier this month.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching the agreement over deadly incidents, but it has so far held.Rubio voiced similar optimism to that of Vance for preserving the ceasefire.\"Every day there'll be threats to it, but I actually think we're ahead of schedule in terms of bringing it together, and the fact that we made it through this weekend is a good sign,\" he said.The second phase of the peace plan would involve setting up an interim government in Gaza, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.The war in Gaza began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.In the ensuing conflict, more than 68,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "14 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorIt might be the peak, or perhaps the mini-summit for the current bump in inflation.Economists across the city suggest it's downhill from here, after the inflation rate for September remained static at 3.8%, failing to breach the expected 4% mark.In absolute terms inflation remains too high, higher than other similar countries, and too visible in the everyday items seen in the shops. Just under double the official target of 2% set for the Bank of England.But the direction of travel matters significantly. Even if it should stay around this level for the rest of the year, some significant falls are on the way in the spring, as various regulated price rises last year drop out of the calculation. It would be a much happier place if it were 2.5% in April. However, it is worth remembering that even as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed to the highest inflation in the G7 this year and next, it also said inflation would fall back to the 2% target by the end of next year.Crucially retail industry experts now assert food price inflation has also peaked, though prices remain at painful levels for many.This lowers - though does not eliminate - the chances of self-fulfilling expectations of inflation in the way wages and prices are set. This is the critical factor for the setting of interest rates.My immediate thought was the \"Santa\" rate cut from Andrew Bailey may be back on the table for December. But then I looked again at the information underlying some of last week's numbers from the IMF. Buried in the forecast is the suggestion of four rate cuts over the next year to take interest rates down to 3%. The only reason a cut is not expected next month, according to the IMF, is because it is too close to the Budget.A more benign inflation outlook suddenly makes that look less fanciful. The US Federal Reserve rate cuts are also in the background.The markets seem to be reassessing their view here and around the world. The effective interest rates on UK government debt fell sharply, regardless of whether those loans were for two or for 30 years. Ten-year rates fell to the lowest level this year, while two-year rates dropped to the lowest since last August.This could save a few billion from the gap in the Budget calculations, at just the right time for the chancellor.Even more important, it shows the UK is not being treated as an outlier by the markets. The chancellor went to some effort in her off-the-cuff UK sales pitch to worldwide investors in the US last week. Britain was, she said, the best place to invest and trade globally, that she was going to sort out Brexit-related economic problems and the UK had the fastest declining deficit in the G20.The Budget is going to be a challenge, but catastrophic suggestions about British bankruptcy and bailouts seem quite spectacularly off the mark, assuming that is, that the government does have nearly 400 MPs for its agenda. No one wants to be caught on the wrong side of the very real chance of a tech market crash, or unpredictable spike in the US-China trade war, or perhaps any unexpected innovations in the appointment of the new chair of the Federal Reserve in the US.The inflation number and gilt rate falls offer the chance of some respite, for a break in the circle of doom. The question is whether the tax measures Reeves needs to close even a smaller Budget gap, risk bringing it back through another door.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichael Buchanan,Social affairs correspondent and Divya Talwar,Investigations reporterSir Julian Hartley, Chief Executive the Care Quality Commission which is the independent regulator of all health and adult social care services in England, has resigned. The announcement comes just days after an independent inquiry into maternity care at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust was announced.Mr Hartley had previously spent a decade leading the trust and said that in light of that inquiry, his role at the CQC, \"has become incompatible with the important conversations happening about care at Leeds.\"Some of the families who received poor maternity care had demanded his resignation.On Monday, the Health Secretary Wes Streeting announced an independent inquiry into \"repeated failures\" at the Leeds trust.  Mr Streeting said the investigation would examine what had \"gone so catastrophically wrong\" at the trust's maternity services at both Leeds General Infirmary and St James' University Hospital.  He said he was grateful for Sir Julian Hartley's efforts to improve the work of the Care Quality Commission.\"It is vital that trust in the regulator and its ratings is rebuilt for patients and staff, and I am determined the CQC becomes the robust and effective regulator patients deserve.\"Earlier this year, a BBC investigation revealed the deaths of at least 56 babies and two mothers over the past five years may have been prevented.  In a statement reacting to the inquiry's announcement, the trust said it was \"taking significant steps to address improvements.\"Several of the families who had campaigned for the inquiry had questioned Mr Hartley's role at the CQC given he had led the trust for 10 years, until 2023.  He was appointed chief executive of the hospital regulator last December having spent 21 months leading NHS Providers, a health service trade body.Amarjit Kaur and Mandip Singh Matharoo's daughter Asees was stillborn in January 2024 - a trust investigation found care issues which may have prevented her death. They welcomed Mr Hartley's resignation and questioned his original appointment.  \"The fact that he was head of Leeds teaching hospitals over such a large period of time, where maternity care was substandard should have raised alarm bells within the system to prevent him becoming Chief Executive of such a large regulator in the first instance,\" they said.A whistleblower at the trust, who has raised concerns about maternity, also said they were pleased he'd gone.  \"Its been dire for many years, including under his watch. Him being the head of CQC was a scandal when staff like us have been complaining to the regulator about unsafe care. Things need to change,\" she said.A statement from a broader group of bereaved and harmed Leeds families said that while they welcomed his resignation, \"we do not accept his apology.\"  Mr Hartley's CQC role, they added, \"has always been a scandal hiding in plain sight. Just as it has been down to bereaved families to prove the total failings of the CQC in their inspection processes and lack of regulatory action in Leeds, this now, again, has fallen onto families to highlight.\"In his statement, Sir Julian said he was \"sorry for the fact that some families suffered harm and loss during this time\" and vowed to cooperate with the inquiry \"so families can get the transparency and answers that they need and deserve.\"The chair of the CQC Professor Sir Mike Richards said that while Mr Hartley's resignation was \"a huge loss\" he understood that his previous job at Leeds \"may undermine trust and confidence in the CQC's regulation.\" On Monday, when the inquiry was announced, both Mr Richards and Wes Streeting said they had confidence in Sir Julian.A rapid review into maternity services in England is currently underway while the largest inquiry into maternity care in the history of the NHS, centred on services at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, is due to report next summer.  The inquiry into care at Leeds is the fifth investigation into maternity services at a single NHS trust since 2013. ",

    "body": "53 minutes agoBruce Thain and Kathryn ArmstrongBBCPC Philip Neilson said he'd been a police officer for four years, and denied being a racist despite making offensive remarksA Metropolitan Police officer has been sacked for gross misconduct after appearing in an undercover report by BBC Panorama.Three allegations were upheld against PC Philip Neilson, including making \"highly racist and discriminatory remarks\" about different ethnic groups. He was dismissed with immediate effect.Mr Neilson was recorded by the BBC referring to an \"invasion\" of \"scum\" from the Middle East, and made offensive comments about people from Algeria and Somalia. He is the first of 10 current or former officers to face a hearing as part of the Met's accelerated misconduct proceedings over footage recorded during the Panorama investigation. In it, he was also observed saying a detainee who had overstayed his visa should have a \"bullet through his head\".The other allegations against Mr Neilson related to \"glorifying what he was describing as inappropriate use of force on a restrained detainee\" and for suggesting unlawful violence against migrants who broke the law. Chair of the panel, Cmdr Jason Prins, found all the allegations proven.The hearing, in south-west London on Thursday, was told that he did not dispute the words he said but argued they only amounted to just misconduct.Giving evidence, Mr Neilson said he had been a police officer for four years and denied he was a racist.He said he believed the undercover reporter \"breached his humans rights\" and it was the reporter who \"kept bringing up these conversations\" and \"egging me on\".Mr Neilson said he had eight or nine pints of Guinness while at the pub when he made some of the comments and said he was not a \"drinker\".He said he did not discriminate against anyone and footage from his body worn camera would show \"no matter the ethnicity I did everything with the utmost respect\".Off-duty officer calls immigrants 'scum'Cmdr Prins ruled that Mr Neilson's comments caused \"significant harm\" to the reputation of Metropolitan Police and wider public confidence in the police and amounted to gross misconduct, describing the conduct of the officer as an \"utter disgrace\".\"He alone was responsible for the comments and it was or must have been obvious to him his comments were abhorrent,\" Cmdr Prins added. The Met had previously said he had \"displayed extreme racial, violent and discriminatory views\", as well as a lack of \"respect, courtesy and professionalism\".Eight serving police officers, a former Met constable, and a police constable who moved from London to serve with Gloucestershire Police will undergo accelerated hearings, the Met previously confirmed.Mr Neilson was the first of three hearings in that process that are due to take place on Thursday.  PC Martin Borg and PS Joe McIlvenny will be heard later.The Met is seeking the dismissal of all three on the grounds their conduct allegedly amounted to gross misconduct and breached the force's professional standards.",

    "body": "9 minutes agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporter and Chris Graham & Harry Farley,Political correspondentA fifth survivor has called for Jess Phillips to stand down as safeguarding minister to restore trust in the national inquiry into grooming gangs.Carly, not her real name, joins a group of four abuse survivors who have accused Phillips of \"betrayal\" over a letter where she described reports the scope of the inquiry could be expanded as \"untrue\".Carly told the BBC she wanted to remain part of the inquiry, in contrast to the four survivors who said they would only re-join it if Phillips stood down as a minister - but she said she agreed with their criticisms of the process. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he still had faith in Phillips to be in charge of setting up the inquiry.The national inquiry into the sexual exploitation of children by grooming gangs in England and Wales was announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in June.The PM said the inquiry would have the power to compel witnesses to be questioned and would be guided by a panel of survivors, which the BBC understands had at least 20 members at the start.There has been turmoil over the past week, with Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds quitting the survivors panel in the inquiry on Monday, and two more known as \"Elizabeth\" and \"Jess\" following them on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.They all wrote open letters citing similar concerns, around the inquiry being widened beyond grooming gangs, tight controls on what they could say and who they could speak to, and potential inquiry chairs having links to policing and social care, alongside expertise in tackling child abuse.An email was sent to members of the survivors pane by NWG, the charity tasked with organising it on behalf of the government, asking if they wanted to keep the the inquiry focused on grooming gangs or if they would like it to be widened out and there is disagreement among survivors on this.   Phillips published a letter on Tuesday warning there was \"misinformation\" swirling around the inquiry and seeking to \"set the record straight\", saying that taking four months to appoint a chair was not unusual for large public inquiries and was not evidence of a \"cover up\".However, she also wrote that reports the government is \"seeking to dilute the focus of the inquiry were \"untrue\" and she insisted that it would be \"laser-focused\" on grooming gangs.This appears have sparked anger among the four survivors, who write in their letter to the home secretary that they had \"raised legitimate concerns around the inquiry's direction\" but \"in response, your safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips called our accounts untrue\".They wrote: \"Being publicly contradicted and dismissed by a government minister when you are a survivor telling the truth takes you right back to that feeling of not being believed all over again.\"It is a betrayal that destroyed what little trust remained.\"Now Carly, from Huddersfield, has told the BBC the latest letter is \"bang on\" and she also believes Phillips should go, because \"she can't lie about what we all know\" around the question of whether to widen the inquiry's scope.\"I think maybe the best thing for Jess to do is resign,\" she said, adding: \"Maybe the prime minister needs to come and meet us survivors ourselves, because you can't really sit there and preach when you have not actually come and met us.\"I think the decent thing to do would be to stop arguing in Parliament and come and meet us and let's all work together.\"Carly also said survivors have been forced to sign a confidentiality agreement, which feels like a gagging process to silence them.Asked earlier by BBC South East if Phillips can continue in her position, Sir Keir said: \"The most important thing in relation to the grooming gangs is that we have the national inquiry and that absolutely gets to the truth and to justice.\"Asked if he has faith in the minister, the PM added: \"Yes, of course, I do. Jess has been working on issues involving violence against women and girls for many, many years.\"Before becoming an MP, Phillips worked for Women's Aid, developing services for victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, human trafficking and exploitation.MacAlister said this showed she was a  \"lifelong advocate and champion for young girls who've been abused,\" adding that she has \"already shown that she's properly engaging with the survivor community\".There has also been support for the way the inquiry has been proceeding from survivors who are staying on the panel.Samantha Walker-Roberts, from Oldham, wants the scope of the inquiry to include victims of other types of sexual abuse, so they are not \"silenced\".She was the victim of a grooming gang when she was 12 - but she was also raped and abused by a man who groomed her online, and as a younger child she was raped and abused by older men who she met through friends.Carly, from Huddersfield, who said she believes \"the most effective way to drive meaningful change is from within\" and remains \"hopeful\" the concerns raised by others \"will lead to constructive improvements\".On Wednesday, former Northern Irish police chief Jim Gamble ruled himself out of chairing the inquiry, saying victims and survivors needed a chair they could all trust and, while the \"majority\" of those on the panel supported him, it was \"clear that a lack of confidence due to my previous occupation exists among some\".Mr Gamble, a child abuse expert who headed up the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) police command, said he had \"hoped that my track record of fierce independence\" would have \"enabled me to proceed and hold the organisations and individuals who failed these young people to account\".But he said a focus on political \"point-scoring\" had created a \"highly charged and toxic environment\" within the inquiry. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Thursday, Mr Gamble said the source of some of this toxicity was social media, where people were \"stirring the pot\" from a distance.He told the programme that he had confidence in Phillips, saying: \"Has she got everything right? I don't think so, but none of us have.\"He also said he had seen no evidence of efforts to dilute the terms of reference for the inquiry or widen its scope.\"At no time did I get the impression that they wanted to shy away from the necessary focus to understand why race, ethnicity and culture is part of the problem with particular gangs.\"Mr Gamble was one of two candidates to chair the inquiry who had been identified. The other, Annie Hudson - who has a background in social work - also withdrew this week.  ",

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura GozziReutersThe price tag of Ukraine's reconstruction and recovery has been put at well above  $486bnEuropean leaders aim to endorse controversial plans to use Russian frozen assets to support Ukraine at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday.The unprecedented proposal for what the EU has dubbed a \"reparations loan\" - would see Kyiv receive €140bn (£121bn) worth of frozen Russian state assets currently held by Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial institution.The plan has been months in the making, partly due to the legal complexities surrounding it, as well as concerns from member states about upsetting global financial stability.Belgium in particular has been reluctant to back using the frozen assets, as it is nervous about having to shoulder any potential consequences should Russia legally challenge Euroclear.Russia has reacted angrily to any suggestions that the EU could use its money. \"Any confiscatory initiatives from Brussels will inevitably result in a painful response,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.How would a reparations loan work?For the EU, the problem of how to continue to support Kyiv's struggle against Russian aggression has become more urgent since US support for Ukraine has dwindled. As of July, EU member states have provided about €177.5bn (£154bn) in financial support for Ukraine. But in the absence of any progress towards a ceasefire deal, Ukraine will need more money as Russia's full-scale war approaches its fifth year. The price tag of Ukraine's reconstruction and recovery is also estimated by the UN and World Bank to be well above $486bn (£365bn; €420bn).About €210bn (£182bn) in Russian investments was frozen by the EU when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The biggest share – some €185bn – is sitting in Euroclear, a clearing house for financial transactions in Brussels which operates under EU jurisdiction.When they were first frozen, the majority of these Russian investments were in the form of sovereign bonds – a type of loan made to a government which is paid back over a period of time.These bonds have now matured; in other words, Russia is due to get both its initial loan back as well as interest. But because of the sanctions imposed against it in 2022, Moscow cannot access this money.The EU has been using the interest from Russian frozen assets for Ukraine's defence since spring 2024, and that amounts to up to €3bn per year.The EU is now considering redirecting the frozen funds themselves to Ukraine as a zero-interest \"reparations loan\". The much-needed liquidity would be available immediately – on the understanding that Kyiv would repay it through reparations from Moscow once the war ends.Can EU get around legal issues over Russia's cash?International law stipulates that sovereign assets cannot be confiscated outright. Although frozen, these assets remain Moscow's property and seizing them is legally challenging.To get around this issue the EU could \"borrow\" Russia's frozen money held by Euroclear and replace it with an IOU backed by all member states underwriting the debt.This could also offset Euroclear's concerns on how to pay Russia back, should the war end suddenly and Moscow demand its assets back.On Thursday morning Belgium was still expressing criticism of the proposal but leaving the door open to it, if it received guarantees that the risk would be shared by all member states.EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas told the BBC's Today programme that Belgium's concerns were \"understandable\" and that the Belgians \"should not bear the risk alone\".Russia is furious with the idea of its investments being used.The move would be the \"theft of the century\" and trigger retaliation and damage Western financial stability, Russia's ambassador to Italy Alexey Paramonov said.If EU leaders green-light the reparations at Thursday's summit, the European Commission will begin drawing up the formal legal proposal for the loan. What are the issues?The most glaring issue with the \"reparations loan\" scenario is that it hinges on Ukraine winning the war and Russia accepting to pay damages.There is no guarantee Russia will agree to this. If it doesn't, the EU could forgive Kyiv's debt – but it would still have to repay the money it borrowed to fund the IOU to Euroclear.That burden would effectively fall to European taxpayers – an uncomfortable option for most European governments.There is also concern among Europe's central bankers about potentially setting a difficult legal precedent that could undermine global financial stability - as well as putting off other countries from placing their safe haven assets in the West.Neither Euroclear nor EU countries want to be seen as unreliable depositories of foreign wealth. Even in the context of Russia's war, they need to respect the international monetary order.Who backs the plan, and who doesn't?Poland, as well as Scandinavian and Baltic countries, have enthusiastically endorsed the plan, which Finland's President Alexander Stubb called \"ingenious\".\"I think it's going to work and will help Ukraine to fund itself,\" he said.Other European leaders more sympathetic to Moscow, like Hungary's Viktor Orban and Slovakia's Robert Fico, may well oppose it. If the plan led Moscow to retaliate against Hungarian companies, Orban said, it would be difficult to explain to Hungarians \"why they should support the confiscation of frozen Russian assets\".However, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said that while the decision should \"ideally\" be unanimous, it could also just be adopted by a large majority - which would circumvent Budapest's veto.Another sticking point revolves around how Ukraine would be allowed to spend the money.Ukraine is facing a €42bn deficit in its 2026 \"survival budget\", according to the Ukrainian Centre for Economic Strategy. Brussels and Paris would like to use the financing to provide budgetary support to Kyiv, said Mujtaba Rahman, Managing Director for Europe at Eurasia Group. Others, like Germany, want Ukraine to commit to spending the funds on buying European weapons.It is \"important that these additional funds are solely used to finance Ukraine's military equipment\", Merz wrote in the Financial Times, adding that EU member states and Ukraine would \"jointly determine\" which weapons to procure.For its part Kyiv is pushing back against any limit on its use of the frozen Russian assets. Iryna Mudra, a top legal adviser in the Ukrainian administration, told Reuters that \"the victim, not the donors or partners, must determine how to address its most urgent defence, recovery and compensation needs\".Ukraine reserved the right to decide how to allocate resources, Ms Mudra said, adding that some would have to go towards other sectors like reconstruction and victim compensation.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMark PoyntingClimate and science reporter, BBC NewsEngland's water companies got their worst ever combined score for environmental performance in 2024, the Environment Agency has said.All but one of the nine English water and sewerage companies were rated as \"requiring improvement\" - or worse - by the EA, in a year where serious pollution incidents rose by 60% versus 2023.Thames Water - the UK's largest water company - was given the lowest one-star rating. Industry body Water UK acknowledged that \"the performance of some companies is not good enough\" but pointed to investment since last year.A Thames Water spokesperson said: \"Transforming Thames is a major programme of work that will take time; it will take at least a decade to achieve the scale of change required.\"And Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds acknowledged: \"We are facing a water system failure that has left our infrastructure crumbling and sewage spilling into our rivers.\"We are taking decisive action to fix it, including new powers to ban unfair bonuses, and swift financial penalties for environmental offences,\" she added.In a foreword to the report, the EA's chair, Alan Lovell, wrote: \"Many companies tell us how focussed they are on environmental improvement. But the results are not visible in the data.\"The EA's collective rating of the nine companies for 2024 was 19 stars - down from 25 stars in 2023. No year had previously got fewer than 22 stars.Only Severn Trent got the top rating of four stars. All others got two stars - \"requiring improvement\" - except Thames which got one star for \"poor\" performance.Thames Water - the UK's largest water company - has become mired in financial trouble. It reported a loss of £1.65bn for the year to March, while its debt pile climbed to £16.8bn.\"We know we need to further improve for our customers, communities and the environment, and that is why we have embarked on the largest ever investment programme, delivering the biggest upgrade to our network in 150 years,\" the Thames spokesperson added.Every year since 2011 each of England's nine water companies have been given a rating for their environmental performance. Only seven one-star ratings have ever been previously given.The EA says its assessment criteria has been tightened over time, so its ratings do \"not mean performance has declined since 2011\" and it had seen \"some improvement\" up to 2023.\"This year's results are poor and must serve as a clear and urgent signal for change,\" said Mr Lovell.In a separate report on companies in England and Wales, the economic regulator Ofwat described performance across different measures as \"mixed\".It acknowledged progress in some areas like internal sewer flooding, but said \"there remain areas where companies and the sector must do more\", including pollution and supply interruptions for some.In response, James Wallace, chief executive of campaign group River Action UK, said: \"Today's report shows that water companies in England and Wales are still underperforming, especially on serious pollution incidents, exposing the bankruptcy of the privatised water model.\"We urgently need a complete overhaul of this failed system to ensure that bill payers receive a fair service and that our rivers are properly protected from pollution.\"The EA attributed last year's environmental performance to three factors – wet and stormy weather, long-standing underinvestment in infrastructure, and increased monitoring and inspection \"bringing more failings to light\".From 2027, the EA will replace its current star ratings with a new system – a scale from one to five, from \"failing\" to \"excellent\".The government argues this will give a more accurate reflection of performance, with companies not able to achieve the top rating unless they \"achieve the highest standards across the board\".The water industry has faced mounting anger from customers and campaigners for rising bills and repeated sewage spills.The Environment Agency reported in July that \"serious\" pollution incidents had increased by 60% in 2024 versus 2023.And in April, bills rose by an average of 26% in England and Wales, after the economic regulator Ofwat approved water company plans for billions of pounds of investment.Bills will continue to rise to 2030 to help upgrade water supplies and reducing the amount of sewage being spilled.Earlier this year the government said that Ofwat would be scrapped and replaced by a single regulator.That followed a landmark review of the \"failing\" water sector in England and Wales, which recommended stronger regulation to hold water companies to account. It warned that there would be no quick fixes to improve the state of our rivers or bring down bills.In response to today's EA's report, Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: \"Customers are now paying more than ever before through water bills and they will expect to see companies delivering on their promises to cut pollution and help bring rivers, lakes and wildlife habitats back to life. \"If the industry fails to deliver, the damage to public trust - which is already at an all-time low - may be unrecoverable,\" he added.Additional reporting by Jonah Fisher",

    "body": "3 hours agoThe home secretary's \"sweeping changes\" to asylum laws dominate the papers again, with the Metro declaring it the beginning of \"another rebellion\" within the Labour party. The paper reports that Shabana Mahmood was \"instantly accused of cruelty\" by members of her own party, even before revealing further details of the plans.The \"Labour revolt\" also leads the Guardian, which says that there are around 20 Labour politicians who are publicly \"expressing concern\". It notes that the \"radical measures\" could include the possibility of confiscating assets from refugees to contribute to asylum costs. The government's \"long-awaited crackdown\" on reselling event tickets for profit also makes the paper's front page. The Independent quotes Labour MP Nadia Whittome in their headline, who calls the crackdown on migrants \"dystopian\". The paper says that among Mahmood's critics is former immigration lawyer and MP for Folkestone and Hythe Tony Vaughan, who calls the move a \"wrong turning\" for his party. Both the Tories and Reform UK have openly welcomed Mahmood's proposal, according to the i Paper, which says both parties will support the policy in parliament. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the home secretary brings a \"fresh energy\" to the Commons, in a rare compliment to her \"political rival\", the paper reports. The Express reports that Badenoch is urging Mahmood to work alongside her \"in the national interest\" to get her asylum proposals over the line. The Conservative leader has warned that without her support, the plans to overhaul human rights laws are \"doomed to fail\" because they will be blocked by judges.The Times details some of the specifics of the \"33-page policy document\" in their lead. It reports that some of the reforms will be implemented through \"tweaks\" to immigration rules, while others will require primary legislation. Actresses Dakota Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone are also pictured on the front page of the paper, following their attendance at the prestigious Governors Awards in Los Angeles on Monday evening.\"Mahmood turns air blue in blast at liberals\" is the headline for the Telegraph, after the home secretary was accused of \"stoking divison\" by a Liberal Democrat spokesperson in the Commons on Monday. Mahmood responded with a \"passionate defence\" of her proposed asylum reforms, and pointed to the racial abuse that she says is \"regularly\" levelled at her, according to the paper. The Daily Mail also hones in on Mahmood's revelation on their front page, and writes that the home secretary \"shocked the House of Commons\" with the use of a racial slur she says is used against her. Mahmood said the abuse and demands for her to \"go back home\" are evidence of how the asylum crisis has divided the UK.\"It just doesn't add up\" declares the Sun's front page, in a nod to its earlier investigation into \"removal centre perks\" for illegal migrants awaiting deportation.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has told the Daily Mirror that he will lead the Labour party into the next election, amid what the paper has called \"torrid speculation and threats to his position\". It reports that Sir Keir has pledged to \"remain focused on what matters, which is bearing down on the cost of living\", and notes breakfast clubs and a prescription freeze among his promises ahead of the upcoming Budget. The \"crackdown on industrial-scale touts\" leads the Financial Times, which reports that scalping costs concertgoers £145m a year in elevated prices. According to the paper, consultation over ticket resales began last January following an outcry over inflated ticket prices for the Oasis reunion tour.The hike of a controversial horse racing betting tax that many expected to be included in the Budget later this month has been scrapped, the Daily Star reports.

    "body": "4 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterThe UK tax office took a \"cavalier\" approach to child benefit checks when it decided to strip payments from thousands of claimants after wrongly assuming they had permanently relocated out of the UK, a group of MPs have said.Payments stopped when HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) ceased cross-checking travel records with claimants' tax data to prove they were in the UK. Treasury Select Committee chair Dame Meg Hillier said it had made a \"costly error\" by dropping key assessments.HMRC boss John-Paul Marks apologised and said several changes had been made to improve the process including reinstating employment checks.Writing to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Marks said by the end of October,  about 15% or more than 3,600 of the 23,794 claimants who were flagged as potentially ineligible due to their travel history, were confirmed to still qualify for child benefit.In September, HMRC began a crackdown on child benefit fraud which it believes could save £350m over the next five years.Child benefit is paid to 6.9m families but runs out after eight weeks living outside the UK. Many people affected complained HMRC had stopped their money after they went on holiday for just a short time. In some cases benefits were stopped because the tax office had evidence of a claimant leaving the UK, but not returning.The HMRC's pilot programme used Home Office data on passengers departing the UK, as well as other tax payments such as PAYE to identify whether a claimant had arrived back in the UK.Mr Marks said the additional cross-checks against UK tax and payroll data were dropped after the pilot was extended, in order to \"streamline the process\".Dame Meg said: \"HMRC is absolutely right to look at innovative ways to fight fraud and error in our system.\"I'm afraid, though, that it appears they have been cavalier with people's finances, making the arbitrary decision to remove necessary checks and causing a mess they are now forced to clean up.\"Mr Marks said he apologised to thousands of claimants who stopped receiving funds because of this \"streamlining\".The HMRC chief executive also outlined plans to give claimants at least one month to provide proof they are eligible for the benefit if travel data suggests they are no longer in the UK, and payments will not be paused at the start of an investigation.Welcoming the apology, Dame Meg warned MPs would question HMRC in the new year about \"the lessons they have learned from this mistake\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesThe new statue was unveiled in Leicester Square on MondayRenée Zellweger has called a new statue of Bridget Jones \"adorable,\" adding: \"I think she's much cuter than me.\"The actress was speaking to BBC News as a new statue celebrating the character she played for more than 20 years was unveiled in London's Leicester Square on Monday.Bridget Jones was created in 1996 by the author Helen Fielding, and first adapted for the big screen in 2001. The fourth film came out earlier this year.Speaking at the unveiling, Fielding refused to rule out taking her story further, saying you should \"never say never\".Zellweger added that everyone can relate to Bridget, which explains her huge appeal.\"[It's her] vulnerability, her humanness,\" she said. \"We recognise ourselves in her, we recognise ourselves in her struggles.\"It makes it OK for the rest of us to be authentically who we are. Imperfect.\"AlamyThe character of Bridget Jones went straight to many women's hearts, who took comfort in her trials and tribulations.From her embarrassing work mishaps, to her infamous granny pants, Bridget spoke to a generation who saw themselves in her - and has recently won over a whole new set of younger fans too.The fourth film in the franchise, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, was released in February, and sees Bridget living as a single mother and tackling modern dating.It received mixed reviews, but earned the best box office opening ever for a romantic comedy in the UK and Ireland, according to Universal.The film was billed as the final one in the series - but speaking to BBC News at the statue unveiling, two superfans, Faye and Wayne, said they were sure there would be a sequel.\"There were so many things that were left unresolved at the end of the last film,\" said Faye.\"Her character keeps evolving. I want to be with Bridget Jones all the way to the nursing home,\" added Wayne.Watch: Moment Bridget Jones statue is unveiled in LondonWhen asked about the possibility of a new chapter in Bridget Jones' story, Fielding said: \"Never say never. Stories come to you as a writer. So if a story came to me that I thought was true and interesting and new then I would write it.\"Some think the floundering and flawed heroine, who's fixated with her weight and relationship status, is not the best role model.And Fielding herself has previously admitted some parts of the story have not aged well.\"Bridget Jones's Diary couldn't be written now, set now, because all those men in the office would be sacked,\" she said last year. \"It was a really different time.\"But speaking on Monday, she said she hoped the wider message of the book would continue to chime for readers.\"I think to have the comfort of seeing a character that you can relate to, because they are real and human and emotionally honest, it's like having the friend you can be honest with,\" she said.The statue is the first to celebrate a rom com on Leicester Square's Scenes in the Square trail.The Scenes in the Square trail originally launched in 2020 with the introduction of eight sculptures featuring Laurel and Hardy, Mary Poppins, Batman, Bugs Bunny, Don Lockwood, Paddington Bear, Mr Bean and Wonder Woman.Since then, statues of Harry Potter, the Iron Throne from Game of Thrones, Clifford the Big Red Dog and Indiana Jones have been added.",

    "body": "We all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day.That's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone -creeps into everyday moments.This can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones.Rather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else.Every time you reach for your phone, tell the other person why you're doing it, and when you're done, put it down and re-engage.It sounds almost too easy, but Dr Regehr says this small shift can help change our behaviour as we often check messages, swipe notifications or \"Just quickly look something up\" without thinking.What matters is being transparent, so if a message pops up that you need to check, you should tell the person or people you are with: \"I just need to reply to this, then you'll have my attention again.\"By naming it - \"I need to check my train times\" or \"I'm replying to my mum\" - you interrupt the automatic habit of checking your phone and it also signals to the person beside you that they still matter.\"It stops the other person feeling ignored,\" Dr Regehr says.\"And it keeps you accountable, because you're less likely to drift into other apps or endless scrolling.\"Doing this could help improve your relationships too.Dr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton, led a study which involved speaking to 196 people about their relationships and phone use. Overall the results showed that the more you feel you're being phubbed, the worse your relationship tends to be.\"Not everyone reacts in the same way,\" Dr Hart says. \"It depends on personality, but once one person feels ignored, it can trigger retaliation.\"They pick up their own phone, and that's when it becomes a dangerous spiral as each partner feels rejected or less valued than whatever's on the screen.\"Every time you are phubbed you lose connection and once you've left a shared moment to look at a screen, it can take a while to get back to what was going on before.",

    "body": "7 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesReselling tickets to live events for a profit is set to be banned by the government.Ministers are expected to announce the plan in a bid to tackle touts and resale sites which offer tickets at several times' face value.Restricting ticket touts was one of the Labour government's election pledges, as fans complained of massively inflated prices for resale tickets for music and sporting events.The decision comes a week after dozens of artists including Sam Fender, Dua Lipa and Coldplay urged Sir Keir Starmer to protect fans from exploitation.The move, which could be announced on Wednesday, comes after the open letter by some of the biggest names in music.The music stars urged the prime minister to stop the \"extortionate and pernicious\" websites that exploit fans.Other signatories included consumer watchdog Which? the Football Supporters' Association and groups representing the music and theatre industries, venues, and ticket retailers.According to analysis by the Competition and Markets Authority, tickets currently sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.Investigations by Trading Standards have previously uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost.Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said it was \"great news for music and sports fans\", adding the plan would \"rein in professional touts and put tickets back in the hands of real fans\".She urged the government to \"show that the price cap is a priority by including the necessary legislation in the King's Speech\".Ticketmaster's parent company Live Nation Entertainment said it already limits resale in the UK to face value prices and described the reported plan as \"another major step forward for fans\".Resale sites like Viagogo and Stubhub have previously claimed that a price cap could push customers towards unregulated sites and social media, putting them at increased risk of fraud.",

    "body": "8 hours agoHelen BriggsBBC environment correspondentGetty ImagesA seal pup entangled in plastic on a beachScientists have analysed 10,000 marine animal autopsies to understand how plastic ingestion leads to death.The study found seabirds face extreme risk after swallowing just 23 pieces of plastic, giving them a 90% chance of dying. Marine mammals reach similar danger at 29 pieces, while sea turtles need to ingest around 405 pieces to hit the same threshold.The researchers were surprised by how little plastic can be dangerous - less than a soccer ball's worth of soft plastic by volume can be fatal to a dolphin, while a seabird might die from ingesting a few pieces of rubber smaller than the size of a pea.They say the findings could help shape global efforts to protect wildlife.Getty ImagesPlastic pollution poses a serious risk to sea birds from injury and poisoning\"It's a really important reminder that plastic pollution does pose an existential threat to ocean wildlife,\" said lead researcher, Dr Erin Murphy of the US-based environment group, Ocean Conservancy.The analysis used autopsy data from seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and dolphins, collected worldwide. Nearly half of the sea turtles studied, a third of the seabirds, and one in ten of the marine mammals had eaten plastic.The researchers estimated the death risks from swallowing different sorts of plastic in each group of marine animals.They found the type of plastic matters: rubber is most dangerous for seabirds; soft plastics and fishing debris pose the greatest risk to marine mammals; and both hard and soft plastics threaten turtles.Getty ImagesA newborn green sea turtle struggles to escape a plastic netThe study examined only plastics found inside the stomachs of animals. It did not assess chemical impacts or entanglement, meaning the true scale of harm is likely to be higher.Hundreds of marine species have been found with plastic in their bodies. Birds often swallow plastic fragments, and turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. Until now, however, scientists lacked precise data on how much plastic is lethal for animals of different sizes.Dr Murphy added: \"To effectively address plastic pollution, the science is clear. We need to reduce the amount of plastic we produce, improve collection and recycling, and clean up what's already out there.\"The research is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

The man says that at the time he believed he was communicating with a woman called Maria Joseph, and did not know that he was, in fact, communicating with Wootton, according to the claim.The man says that the messages soon became \"sexualised and flirtatious\", and that Wootton sent him photographs of a female which, he claims, Wootton falsely pretended were of the woman the claimant thought he had been communicating with.He says that some of the photographs showed the female partially or fully naked.The man also said Wootton sent him a video of a man and a woman having sex, again pretending that the female in the video was the woman whom the anonymous claimant thought he was communicating with.Wootton denies the claimsIn documents filed recently at the High Court, Wootton said it was denied that he \"communicated with the claimant via any medium - including email, SMS or Facebook; and denied that he sent the claimant any images or videos\".The anonymous man also previously said in his claim that believing that he was communicating with a woman, he responded to the messages in a flirtatious and sexualised manner.He said Wootton (pretending to be Maria Joseph) encouraged him to send explicit photographs of himself. The man added that \"in the induced belief that he was communicating with Maria Joseph, an unknown female who was interested in a sexual relationship\", and who had already sent explicit images of herself, he was \"persuaded to and did send\" explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video.Wootton says in court documents it is denied that he \"was or ever has been in possession of any flirtatious or sexualised messages from the claimant, or explicit photographs or video portraying the claimant\".He also said in the documents that the anonymous claimant did not believe that the recipient of his messages was called Maria Joseph. Wootton added that the claimant stated to Maria Joseph: \"Maria (if that is really your name)... we are in a catch 22. i can't play without finding this out. won't tell them as i'm not gonna advertise the fact i have apparently started to chatting to hot strangers on the internet. or tell me your real name then? [sic]\".Pain, injury and humiliationThe anonymous claimant is suing Wootton, saying that he has suffered pain, injury, humiliation and hurt to his feelings. And that he has sustained loss and damage because of Wootton's actions.He says that he has suffered from major depressive order and use of alcohol.Wootton has said that he does not accept that the anonymous claimant has suffered \"any injury as a result of any communication of messages, images, and/or videos between him and 'Maria Joseph'.\"He has denied that he and the man were former colleagues, and said the man's claim should not be allowed, because any case should have been brought years before.",

    "body": "5 hours agoGetty ImagesPrincess Elizabeth was the first of many royal children to enjoy playing in Y Bwthyn BachOnce described as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\", Y Bwthyn Bach became a memorable childhood feature for generations of the Royal Family.The miniature two-storey thatched cottage was gifted to a young Princess Elizabeth in 1932 by the people of Wales.It was installed in the grounds of her family's then home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, and has remained there ever since, most recently in the care of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has lived in the mansion since 2004.But with the late Queen's third child stripped of his titles and evicted from the royal residence, what does the future hold for the cottage - and could it even be returned to Wales?Y Bwthyn Bach – Welsh for The Little Cottage – was built in Cardiff and presented to Princess Elizabeth's parents, the then Duke and Duchess of York, for their daughter's sixth birthday.Designed by architect Edmund Willmott, the cottage was built by Welsh craftsmen from materials left over from the construction of Llandough Hospital in Vale of Glamorgan, which opened in 1933.It was a carefully planned miniature version of a real-life house, with four 5ft-high rooms – two upstairs and two downstairs.It even included its own working telephone, electric cooker, fridge and running water in the kitchen, luxuries even for real homes in the 1930s.\"It's called a cottage but it was more like a replica of a very comfortable house,\" said historian Dr Elin Jones.Museum WalesThe cottage was assembled in Wales before being transported in its entirety to Royal Lodge in Windsor\"It's an enchanting place and I remember seeing pictures of it when I was a child, and seeing, at the time, Prince Charles and Princess Anne playing in what looked like a fantastic Wendy House,\" said Dr Jones.At the time of the gift, Elizabeth's parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, before her father ascended to the throne as George VI, following his brother Edward VIII's abdication.Custody of the cottage later passed to Andrew when he was Duke of York and he reportedly paid for its upkeep, while his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie were among the next generation of royals to enjoy it.Princess Beatrice oversaw a refurbishment of the cottage and later described it as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\" in a BBC documentary celebrating Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.\"Granny and her sister [Princess Margaret] played here growing up,\" she said at the time. \"We have been lucky enough to play here, and cousins and second cousins.\"Princess Beatrice showed Andrew Marr around Y Bwthyn Bach for a BBC seriesBut with the removal of Andrew's titles, the future of the cottage is unclear.Buckingham Palace confirmed to the BBC that ownership of Y Bwthyn Bach currently sits with King Charles III.\"Both the Royal Family and the governments of England and Wales have other things to think about, which are rather more pressing and important than a child's plaything,\" said Dr Jones.\"But it could be argued that the best place for this little cottage… might be for it to come back to Wales and go to St Fagans as part of the history of our country.\"The house is an interesting expression of the loyalty felt by Welsh people towards the Royal family for centuries.\"But those ties are \"weakening, loosening, because of devolution and the current changes in society\", the historian said.Museum WalesA replica of Y Bwthyn Bach has been kept by the Museum WalesDr Jones added: \"I think Y Bwthyn Bach is a fossil, really. It's historically interesting, you could argue that it is a part of Welsh history which might be better placed in a museum in Wales, like so many other relics of our past.\"Royal enthusiast Anne Daley, from Cardiff, hopes the cottage will continue to be used by younger members of the family rather than risk falling into disuse.\"It's just another cottage that's now empty – how many other are empty on that estate now?\" she said.\"What about the Prince of Wales and Catherine? I wonder if their children would play in it. It's only going to be forgotten about, dilapidated, unless Prince William lets his kids play there.\"If that were not the case, she too would like to see it return to Wales.\"It was a gift so it belongs to them,\" she said. \"I'm not sure really if you can ask for a gift back.\"But, historically, I'd love to see it, the public have never seen the inside.\"I would suggest bring it back to St Fagans museum and we can all have a look at it, even if you need to demolish it brick by brick and put it back together.\"More on this story",

    "body": "11 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondentPoland's prime minister has said an explosion on a railway line leading to the Ukraine border this weekend was caused by \"an unprecedented act of sabotage\", and vowed to catch those responsible \"regardless of who their backers are\".Visiting the scene this morning, Donald Tusk said the damage done to the railway tracks on Sunday was deliberate and likely aimed at blowing up the train. He expressed relief there were no casualties.Speaking later in Warsaw, after an emergency meeting of security officials, Poland's special services minister said there was a \"very high chance\" that the blast was carried out on the orders of \"foreign services\".He didn't name Russia directly but Poland has experienced a series of major arson and sabotage attacks in recent years, including parcel bombings, that it sees as part of Moscow's hybrid war on the West.The incident happened on the track between Warsaw and Lublin to the south-east, and Tusk noted that the route was \"crucially important for delivering aid to Ukraine\".Poland's railway network is a critical part of the military supply lines for its neighbour as well as a route for civilians moving in and out of the country.Investigators are looking into a second incident that occurred further down the same line on Sunday, where a packed train was forced to stop suddenly. It's thought \"very likely\" to be another case of sabotage – though not an explosion.\"These events show that the people behind it have decided to begin a new phase of threatening the railway infrastructure,\" Special Services Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said.Russia always denies any role in such attacks.The damage near Mika, about 100km (60 miles) south-east of Warsaw, was detected at around 07:30 local time (06:30 GMT) on Sunday morning by a train driver who was forced to make an emergency stop.Photographs from the scene appear to show a section of track missing. There were only two passengers and several staff on board the train and no one was hurt.On Monday the interior minister confirmed that the use of explosives was \"beyond any doubt\", though he didn't go into detail, citing the ongoing investigation.A local resident told Polish TV he had heard a blast the previous evening.\"It shook the whole building, the windows... it all trembled so much,\" the man said, adding that people several kilometres away had felt the impact.He thought at first it was a gas explosion, or a falling drone. A police patrol investigated but found nothing untoward.The following morning, several trains passed over the damaged section of track and one reported the problem back to base but the line was not closed.No suspects have yet been detained but officials say police have collected a significant amount of evidence, including footage from nearby security cameras, to help identify who carried out this \"shameful act of sabotage\".The strong language and close focus on the incident come as Poland investigates another suspected hybrid attack involving parcel bombs sent from Lithuania last year using a courier service.One exploded just outside Warsaw and a second was intercepted. Another reached the UK on a cargo plane and went off in a DHL warehouse.A number of suspects are in custody in Poland awaiting trial, including a Russian man, said to be one of the organisers, who was extradited from Bosnia.There have been multiple other cases using people recruited via the Telegram messenger app, using accounts that Poland believes are run by Russian intelligence.Two years ago, more than a dozen people were found guilty of installing secret cameras close to the railway lines in Poland that are used to send weapons and equipment to Ukraine.But this is the first direct attack on the network.Some experts quoted by Polish media suggest the aim was mainly psychological: that the explosives were meant to derail the train, not destroy it, to scare Poland off continuing its support for Ukraine.But the Justice Minister said anyone involved would be found and prosecuted \"ruthlessly\" and there was \"no place on earth they can hide\".Despite the symbolic show of strength – with several security officials and a prosecutor lined up on stage in suits - government ministers faced a barrage of questions about how such sabotage was possible and why the damage to the track wasn't located sooner.In a tetchy exchange, the officials insisted that the response had been swift and effective and that it was \"untrue and insulting\" to criticise.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNada Tawfik,North America correspondent and Dearbail JordanThe UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained.  Adopting it was an \"important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire,\" a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. Writing on Telegram after the resolution passed, Hamas said the plan, \"imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject\".\"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,\" it added.Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the Council that the ISF would be \"tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarization of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians\".The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid.Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force.Trump called the Security Council vote \"historic\" and said it was a way of \"acknowledging and endorsing\" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair it. \"This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for.Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text.The UN Secretary-General's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to \"translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground\" and lead to \"a political process for the achievement of the two-State solution\". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution.The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented \"urgently and immediately\".Russia and China did not exercise their vetoes, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it.Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution.The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a \"fragile, fragile first step\".Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas which had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "4 hours agoEd Thomas,UK editor, Patrick Clahane and Rebecca WearnA paralegal who was secretly filmed telling a BBC undercover reporter how he can help businesses avoid fines of up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers, has been sacked.At a solicitor's office in Huddersfield, Zohaib Hussain said he could \"make documents\" including \"business agreements\" for a fee of £3,500 to help dodge immigration fines.His employer, RKS Solicitors, confirmed he had been \"permanently dismissed\" a day after the investigation was broadcast and a \"police report\" had been made.Mr Hussain previously said he categorically denied \"all allegations, insinuations, and claims\".The Home Office announced an \"urgent investigation\" involving the National Crime Agency and multiple police forces following a series of BBC reports into organised criminal networks operating on High Streets the length of Britain.They exposed how a Kurdish crime network is enabling migrants to work illegally in mini-marts across the UK.Our investigation also uncovered a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had \"customers in every city\" and could enable illegal working.Following the reports, senior politicians warned that the crime networks were  acting as a pull factor for illegal migration to the UK.In one of the investigations, an undercover reporter posed as a mini mart owner who had received a fine from immigration enforcement worth up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers, and met with Zohaib Hussain.During the meeting at a solicitor's in Huddersfield, Mr Hussain fired questions at our reporter about his cover story.\"How many illegal workers? So how much is the fine? How many times did they catch you?\"Then, with a chuckle, he asked what was sold in the mini-mart: \"Do you sell vapes? Legal or illegal? Bit of both as well?\"Mr Hussain went on to explain how to avoid the fine.  He said: \"Sometimes we might have to make documents,\" said Mr Hussain, such as \"business agreements\".Our undercover reporter then asked if the fine would be transferred to someone else's name. Mr Hussain said that would be \"the last resort.\"Before the meeting ended, Mr Hussain warned that the immigration authorities would want to jump on the fine straight away - making a cutting-motion across his throat.He said his charges would be £3,500 and he \"would look after us\".During the whole meeting with Mr Hussain, a man known as Shaxawan was present in the room.Shaxawan was revealed by the BBC as a man at the centre of an organised crime network involved in the facilitation of illegal working.He told undercover journalists that he and his associates could help migrants - including asylum seekers - to set up businesses illegally and \"confuse\" immigration enforcement.In Companies House listings, Shaxawan is named as Kardos Mateen, a British resident in his 30s, and has been the director of 18 businesses across the north of England, including many High Street mini marts.Mr Hussain asked our undercover reporter to share any future Immigration Enforcement letters with Shaxawan.In a previous statement to the BBC, Mr Hussain said: \"For clarity, the individual named in your correspondence, Mr Shaxawan Jawad, is not associated with me in any capacity; professional, personal, or otherwise.\"He added: \"I have never been involved in, nor have I facilitated, encouraged, or condoned, any form of illegal or improper activity.\"Shaxawan, otherwise known as Kardos Mateen, told us by email that he categorically denied \"every allegation, insinuation and claim made\" in our reporting, and said that he was \"not employed by, associated with, or acting on behalf of RKS Solicitors in any capacity\".In a earlier statement, RKS Solicitors said it had informed the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).\"Mr Hussain is employed as a paralegal under strict supervision… The individual is not authorised or instructed to provide immigration and tax advice.\"The firm did not comment on Shaxawan Jawad. It said it did not condone unlawful conduct and was committed to the \"highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and public service\".West Yorkshire Police said it \"is working in close partnership with the Home Office, which has assumed primacy for the investigation into the matters highlighted in recent BBC reporting\".",

The UKHSA also warns there maybe impacts to some younger age groups too.Image caption, Snow and ice yellow Met Office warnings for Monday night into TuesdayRain was forecast to spread south and east across the UK on Monday night and Tuesday, with the air is cold enough for this to turn to snow for some.A yellow weather warning for snow was issued for northern and eastern Scotland starting at 03:00 GMT on Tuesday and valid until 18:00.There could be as much as 5-10cm of snow accumulating over the highest ground (above 400m) but even down to lower levels 2-5cm is forecast.The snow could make some higher routes impassable and there could be some disruption to rail journeys.Tuesday could also see hill snow in the North Pennines and the North York Moors.Ice will also be a hazard with additional Met Office yellow warnings issued for northern and eastern Scotland - valid from 19:00 Monday to 10:00 GMT Tuesday.An ice warning has been issued for central Scotland and down to northern England from 05:00 to 12:00 GMT Tuesday.Further frequent and heavy snow showers will spread into northern Scotland overnight Tuesday, even to sea level.

    "body": "5 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterWatch: Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood says UK must restore \"order and control\" over bordersHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood has defended sweeping changes to the UK's asylum system, telling MPs the current situation is \"out of control and unfair\". Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"Under the plans, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped \"safe and legal routes\" into the UK will be created.Some Labour MPs expressed concerns, with Nadia Whittome calling the plans \"dystopian\" and \"shameful\", but the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the proposals were \"positive baby steps\". However, she warned that unless the UK left the European Convention on Human Rights, Mahmood's efforts would be \"doomed to fail\".Badenoch urged the home secretary to work with the Conservatives, saying she may find their votes would \"come in handy\" if Labour backbenchers did not support the changes.Over the past year, the government has been forced to backtrack on some of its policies - including cuts to welfare and the winter fuel payment - after objections from its own MPs. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson welcomed the introduction of new safe and legal routes - but accused the home secretary of \"stoking division by using immoderate language\". Mahmood hit back angrily, telling the MP: \"I wish I had the privilege of walking around this country and not seeing the division that the issue of migration and the asylum system is creating across this country.\"She said she regularly faced racist abuse - using a racial slur she said is used against her - as well as being told to \"go back home\". So far, around 20 Labour MPs have criticised the plans. Whittome, the MP for Nottingham East, accused the government of \"ripping up the rights and protections of people who've endured imaginable trauma\".Folkestone and Hythe MP, and immigration lawyer, Tony Vaughan said making refugee status temporary would create a \"situation of perpetual limbo and alienation\".Richard Burgon said the measures were \"morally wrong\" and would \"push away Labour voters\".\"Why not recognise that now rather than in another few months and have to make a U-turn,\" the MP for Leeds East said.Other Labour MPs expressed support for Mahmood. Chris Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live the system had to be fair \"otherwise it'll collapse, and there's nothing progressive about letting that happen\".MP for Blackley and Middleton South, Graham Stringer, said the home secretary was \"going down the right track\".He said she would reach a \"compromise\" with Labour MPs but added: \"It might all be for naught if we don't get out of the European Convention on Human Rights.\"Speaking to the BBC later, Mahmood said changing the system was a \"moral mission\" for her.\"If we don't win this argument… we will lose public support for having an asylum system at all and therefore we'll lose something brilliant about this country.\"I'm not willing to put public support for having an asylum system at risk.\"She acknowledged that some Labour MPs had concerns but insisted \"the vast majority of my colleagues agree with me\". Home secretary says she been called racial slursSo far this year 111,800 people have claimed asylum in the UK - 39% arrived in a small boat, while 37% arrived by legal means before claiming asylum. The government says its plans are aimed at reducing the number of people coming to the UK and increasing removals of people who do not have a legal right to be in the country. The Home Office published the changes in a 30-page document and a few hours later Mahmood presented them to the House of Commons. Under the proposals, people granted refugee status will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their status reviewed every 30 months - half the current time period.People could be returned to their home country, when it is deemed safe to do so. The amount of time refugees will have to be in the UK before being allowed to apply for permanent residence will be quadrupled from five years to 20. Families with children who have been refused asylum will be offered incentives to leave but could be forcibly removed if they refuse to go voluntarily.Asylum seekers with income or assets would have to contribute to the cost of their stay in the UK. Mahmood told MPs this would \"end the absurdity where an asylum seeker receiving £800 a month from his family and an Audi was receiving free housing at the taxpayer's expense and the courts judged we could do nothing about it\". Home Office sources have pushed back against suggestions asylum seekers could have items of sentimental value, such as wedding rings, confiscated to pay for their accommodation.In order to make it easier to remove failed asylum seekers, the government intends to change the way the European Convention of Human Rights and Modern Slavery Act is applied.Mahmood also threatened to stop granting visas to people from three African countries - Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia - unless those governments improved co-operation on deportations. Setting out her plans for capped safe and legal routes, Mahmood said voluntary and community organisations would be given \"greater involvement\" in receiving and supporting new arrivals. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage praised Mahmood's \"strong language\" and suggested she was auditioning to join his party. However, he said he had \"serious doubts\" her plans would survive objections from Labour backbenchers or the European Court of Human Rights. Zack Polanski, the Green Party leader of England and Wales, told BBC Newsnight: \"Every single Labour MP needs to look to their conscience. \"This is extreme, this is inhumane and this is a government of cowards. \"They went for pensioners, they went for the disabled and now they are going for people fleeing war and conflict.\"Enver Solomon of the Refugee Council charity said tightening the system would not deter people \"fleeing for their lives\". He said people were not coming to the UK because of the asylum rules but because they spoke English or had familial ties or community connections in the country.\"We have those communities because of our historical links and our past history as a big colonial nation,\" he added.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentReutersFor 20 years the Home Office has been blighted with regular and well-documented failures to manage asylum seekers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's massive plan is unprecedented. And the legal and policy strategy marks an enormous change in thinking.In short, the government wants to move from thinking about \"duties\" the Home Office must fulfil to what \"powers\" it really needs to take and use to get a grip on the situation. Given ministers want to do this without demolishing constitutional safeguards such as the Human Rights Act, it is a tightrope.At the heart of this plan - which sits alongside the slowly evolving \"smash the gangs\" project - is a massive reform of what refugee status leads to.At the moment, anyone accepted for protection is basically here for life, if they choose.Future applicants will enter a temporary system of safety called \"Core Protection\".A refugee would get a minimum 30 months of permission to live in the UK before it is reviewed. Putting aside the logistical question of how the Home Office will find the resources to constantly check up on people, the aim is to encourage people to go home if conditions improve. How that works in practice as people get jobs and their children grow up with the UK their only secure home, is not clear.But even if their homeland remains unstable, a refugee will not be allowed to permanently settle for 20 years - unless they \"earn\" a short cut through work or study.On top of that, the government wants to cut financial support to asylum seekers (currently £49 per week) if they hold eligibility to work. That's about 20,000 people. Others will be told to sell assets to pay for their upkeep - although officials are trying to avoid the PR optics of the controversial Danish policy of taking jewellery off people.Families who have been rejected for asylum may ultimately lose their financial support to encourage them to leave.But laws applying in all parts of the UK are absolutely explicit that a child cannot be left \"in need\". It's just a no-go zone for the government. So how removing support from an asylum family squares with that cornerstone safeguard remains to be seen.At the moment there are about 700 Albanian families in the UK with no right to be here but the Home Office has chosen not to prioritise sending them home. Past plans to remove asylum families have been really knotty - and it was a huge point of tension within the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition of 15 years ago.Home secretary says she is regularly targeted with racial abuse and 'told to go back home'The next stage of the plan - and this will not happen overnight - is to change how asylum decisions are taken.Officials who have studied the Danish system say they are planning a similar single appeal system that can speed up the whole process and be fairer.But past attempts at asylum \"fast track\" decision-making have been torn apart in the courts because they were rushed and found to be grossly unfair.If the Home Office is going to get it right this time, it will require an astonishing amount of focus that has eluded it before.The plan to impose on British courts a tight interpretation of the right to family life, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, is a key ingredient of the package. The aim is to show that the UK can maintain human rights safeguards that are baked into our messy constitution while also ending immigration abuse.Evidence of abuse of human rights laws in the courts is not immediately apparent. We are still waiting for the Home Office to come up with some detailed statistics on how rights like family life are used in legal challenges.AFP via Getty ImagesHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood says more families with failed asylum claims will be removed from the UK, under sweeping changes to the asylum systemBut, nevertheless, Parliament will be asked to approve wording for how judges should balance the right to a private and family life and the public interest in removing someone from the UK.What makes a family? Well the government plans to legally restrict the definition to \"immediate\" family.All of this will need to be watertight to prevent a clash with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg where complaints might be lodged that the UK has gone too far.Such a clash is not a given. The court must take into account local circumstances and the UK rarely loses at the court, and almost never on immigration related issues.All of this is going to take time to get right and there are two massive warnings from history if ministers get it wrong.The first is the Windrush scandal. So far, the Home Office has coughed up more than £116m in compensation to people whose lives were turned upside down by being wrongly labelled as illegal immigrants under the former government's \"hostile environment\" policies.The second warning? There have been times in European history when the public has lost confidence in how society works - and turned to strong men with easy and angry answers.The risk today, believe ministers, is the illegal immigration problem has been so poorly managed, for so long, that British traditions and values of offering protection to the truly vulnerable are in danger.One government insider said this may be the last chance for mainstream politicians to grip this problem and solve it.",

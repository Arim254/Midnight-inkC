    "body": "8 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "8 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondentDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe UK's asylum system is affected by inefficiencies, \"wasted public funds\" and a succession of \"short-term, reactive\" government policies that have moved problems elsewhere, the National Audit Office (NAO) has said.As part of its analysis, the spending watchdog looked at a sample of 5,000 asylum claims lodged almost three years ago, in January 2023.Since then, 35% (1,619) of those asylum seekers had been given some sort of protection such as refugee status, and 9% (452) had been removed from the country. But 56% (2,812) still did not have a final outcome in their case.The Home Office welcomed the analysis, which it said supported \"the case for fundamental reform of the asylum system\".Most of the cases in the remaining group (2,021 out of the 2,812) remained in a sort of \"limbo\", with no appeal lodged.The NAO's chief analyst, Ruth Kelly, told reporters: \"They've had their claim refused, but they're staying in the system with their case unresolved, and that's because of the difficulties in removal.\"A shortage of other types of accommodation means that large numbers of asylum seekers whose cases are not closed are being housed in hotels. The cost of accommodation in 2024-25 was £2.7bn.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of Refugee Council, said of the January 2023 analysis: \"The NAO's finding that more than half of people who applied for asylum almost three years ago still don't have an outcome is shocking.\"He said the report mirrors what the Refugee Council's front-line services see every day, \"an asylum system that is simply not functioning, where people wait months or even years for a decision… and costs keep rising\".The NAO's report criticises how successive governments have dealt with the current surge in small boats crossings that began in 2018. \"Interventions have tended to be reactive and focused on fixing an urgent problem in one part of the system only, such as intake or initial decisions, without a clear view of the effects on other parts,\" the report says.\"Increases in speed of processing have sometimes come at the expense of the quality of decisions, and improvements in one area have shunted problems elsewhere.\"The NAO gave the example of former prime minister Rishi Sunak's drive to clear the legacy asylum backlog in 2023, which then shifted pressure onto the appeals stage, simply creating another backlog in the courts.Shortage of judgesRuth Kelly said one of the most critical factors now was a shortage of specialist immigration judges to hear appeals. \"There's a severe capacity shortage with judges,\" she said. \"And judges told us there are poor incentives for working in the immigration and asylum tribunals… because of the taxing and the complex nature of the work, and also because of negative media attention, which makes it harder to recruit judges.\"The NAO said it would be looking for evidence that the government was now moving away from \"short-term, reactive fixes\" towards a \"sustainable whole-system approach\".The NAO found 56% (2,812) of asylum cases raised in January 2023 still did not have a final outcome in their caseIt said the current lengthy delays in the system \"erode public confidence in the system's fairness and effectiveness\".The NAO also found that it was impossible to track individual cases through the whole asylum process because there is no \"unique asylum case identifier\" shared by Home Office, court service and local authority computer systems.The report says that because the asylum applications are subject to fluctuating demand with significant peaks, it was important to build a flexible and resilient system that can respond to increases and decreases in demand.Ruth Kelly, the NAO analyst, said the government needed to avoid reverting to \"that pattern of counter-productive quick fixes that we have seen in the past\".A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The home secretary recently announced the most sweeping changes to the asylum system in a generation to deal with the problems outlined in this report.\"We are already making progress – with nearly 50,000 people with no right to be here removed, a 63% rise in illegal working arrests and over 21,000 small boat crossing attempts prevented so far this year.\"Our new reforms will restore order and control, remove the incentives which draw people to come to the UK illegally and increase removals of those with no right to be here.\"",

    "body": "An Australian man who was jailed in Singapore and deported for charging at pop star Ariana Grande has been ejected from a Lady Gaga concert in his home country.Johnson Wen said on Instagram that he was \"kicked out\" of the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on Tuesday night before the Lady Gaga show had started.The 26-year-old, who has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, was sentenced to nine days in jail by a Singapore court last month for grabbing Grande during the Asian premiere of Wicked: For Good.Wen, who told the Singaporean judge in mitigation that he would \"not do it again\", had not disrupted the performance in Brisbane, but was removed because of his history of public nuisance.Videos on social media showed security guards holding Wen by the arm and leading him out of the venue as the crowd both cheered and booed. The BBC has contacted Suncorp Stadium for comment.In a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald, the venue said it was made aware that \"a known serial offender may attempt to attend and disrupt\" the concert by Lady Gaga, who is around halfway through her Mayhem World Tour.\"In the interest of the artist's safety, this individual was deemed a person of interest and not to be allowed to attend,\" it said.Wen has gained notoriety since grabbing Grande at the Wicked: For Good premiere in the South East Asian city state, which is known for its strict laws, including on public behaviour.\"You seem to be attention-seeking, thinking only of yourself and not the safety of others when committing these acts,\" Singaporean judge Christopher Goh reportedly told Wen.Wen was also banned from Singapore following the incident.Other videos on Wen's social media accounts show him jumping on stage and disrupting performances by global stars like Katy Perry and The Weeknd.The incident with Grande sparked outrage in Singapore. Fans accused Wen of \"re-traumatising\" the pop star and actress.Grande has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.",

    "body": "Ukraine is \"ready for elections\", President Volodymyr Zelensky has said, after US President Donald Trump repeated claims Kyiv was \"using war\" to avoid holding them. Zelensky's five-year term as president was due to end in May 2024, but elections have been suspended in Ukraine since martial law was declared after Russia's invasion.Speaking to reporters following Trump's comments in a wide-raging Politico interview, Zelensky said he would ask for proposals to be drawn up which could change the law.Elections could be held in the next 60 to 90 days if security for the vote was guaranteed with the help of the US and other allies, he said.\"I'm asking now, and I'm stating this openly, for the US to help me, perhaps together with our European colleagues, to ensure security for the elections,\" he told reporters. \"The issue of elections in Ukraine, I believe, depends first and foremost on our people, and this is a question for the people of Ukraine, not the people of other countries. With all due respect to our partners,\" he said.\"I've heard hints that we're clinging to power, or that I personally am clinging to the presidency\" and \"that's why the war isn't ending\", which he called \"frankly, a completely unreasonable narrative\".Russia has consistently claimed Zelensky is an illegitimate leader and demanded new elections as a condition of a ceasefire deal – a talking point which has been repeated by Trump.\"They talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it's not a democracy anymore,\" the US president told Politico. He has suggested without evidence that Zelensky is the main obstacle to peace as US-led efforts to broker a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine continue.  Such a vote would only be fair if all Ukrainians could participate, including soldiers fighting on the front line, a Ukrainian opposition MP told the BBC.\"In order for these elections to be fair all of the People of Ukraine would need to be allowed to vote,\" Lesia Vasylenko told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme.She said that \"elections are never possible in wartime\", alluding to the suspension of elections in the UK during World War Two.Discussions around holding elections have made headlines since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. They have been routinely dismissed by Ukraine's government, opposition and public alike, arguing unity in the war effort must come first.A poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in March found about 78% of people opposed holding elections even after a complete settlement of the war.\"Even a year ago, Zelensky said that he was ready for elections as soon as the conditions allow\" in the face of previous pressure, Hanna Shelest, a foreign policy analyst with the think tank Ukrainian Prism, told the BBC. The question was, however, how to create the conditions Zelensky outlined, Shelest told the Newsroom programme on the BBC World Service, given there were around one million soldiers and four million refugees who would be voting - as well as unsecured areas in the country and ongoing strikes.\"You cannot guarantee the security of the polling stations,\" she said.

The MoD said it would not comment further. The UK government has never confirmed the number of service people in Ukraine, but has previously acknowledged a small number in the country to support Ukraine's armed forces and provide security to diplomatic personnel.It is the first time a UK military death has been publicly announced since February 2022.The chairman of the Defence Committee, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, said: \"This tragic incident is a stark reminder of the risks faced by those who serve our country, even when operating away from the front lines. I pay tribute to their professionalism and commitment.\"Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge said he was \"deeply saddened to hear the tragic news that a member of the UK armed forces died this morning in Ukraine\".\"My sincere condolences to his family and friends at this difficult time.\"Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion more than three years ago in February 2022.Efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified in recent weeks, including a visit by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to Downing Street on Monday where Sir Keir pledged the UK's support for Kyiv in achieving \"a just and lasting ceasefire\".The meeting was part of a push by Zelensky to deter the US from backing a peace deal which includes major concessions from Kyiv, and which allies fear would leave it vulnerable to future invasion, with Ukraine set to present alternative proposals to the White House.",

    "body": "The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to pioneering elephant conservationist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who died aged 83 at his home in Nairobi on Monday.Douglas-Hamilton spent his life studying and campaigning to protect African elephants, becoming a world-leading expert on their behaviour in the wild. His groundbreaking research exposed the devastating effects of poaching - often at great risk to his own safety - and was instrumental in the banning of the international ivory trade.Prince William praised the zoologist as \"a man who dedicated his life to conservation and whose life's work leaves lasting impact on our appreciation for, and understanding of, elephants\".\"The memories of spending time in Africa with him will remain with me forever,\" added Prince William, who is a royal patron for the African wildlife conservation charity, Tusk, of which Douglas-Hamilton was an ambassador. \"The world has lost a true conservation legend today, but his extraordinary legacy will continue,\" the charity's founder Charles Mayhew said in a statement.Born in 1942 to an aristocratic British family in Dorset, England, Douglas-Hamilton studied biology and zoology in Scotland and Oxford before moving to Tanzania to research elephant social behaviour.It was there at Lake Manyara National Park that he began documenting every elephant he encountered, eventually becoming so familiar with the herds he could recognise them by the unique shapes of their ears and wrinkles on their skin.\"The thing about elephants is that they have a lot in common with human beings,\" he said in a 2024 documentary about his work, A Life Among Elephants.Friend and fellow conservationist Jane Goodall, who died in October, was featured in the documentary, and said he had shown the world that elephants are capable of feeling just like humans.\"I think his legacy will be one of a man who did so much to help people understand how majestic, how wonderful elephants are, and to learn more about their way of life,\" Goodall said.But that work did not always come easy: he was charged at by elephants, almost killed by a swarm of bees and shot at by poachers. In 2010, a flood destroyed his research facility in Kenya and years of work was lost.Despite the hardships, Douglas-Hamilton remained steadfast in his mission to raise awareness of the plight of African elephants, becoming one of the leading voices to alert the world of the ivory poaching crisis, which he described as \"an elephant holocaust\".He later campaigned for an international ban on the commercial trade in ivory, and in 1989 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species was signed, an international agreement between governments.After the agreement failed to wipe out the trade completely, Douglas-Hamilton turned his attention to China and the US, the two main markets for ivory. Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-US President Barack Obama agreed to a near-total ban on its import and export in 2015.Douglas-Hamilton established Save the Elephants in 1993, a charity dedicated to safeguarding the animals and deepening human understanding of their behaviour.The organisation's CEO Frank Pope, who is also his son-in-law, said: \"Iain changed the future not just for elephants, but for huge numbers of people across the globe. His courage, determination and rigour inspired everyone he met.\"In his own words, Douglas-Hamilton expressed optimism for the future of his life's work.\"I think my greatest hope for the future is that there will be an ethic developed of human-elephant coexistence,\" he once said.Iain Douglas-Hamilton is survived by his wife Oria, children Saba and Dudu, and six grandchildren.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGettyMeerkats are incredibly social animals and live in large groups known as 'mobs' or 'clans'Humans are a bit like meerkats when it comes to pairing up, according to a study that examined the monogamous lifestyles of different species.In our romantic life, we more closely resemble these social, close-knit mongooses than we do our primate cousins, a \"league table\" of monogamy compiled by scientists suggests.At 66% monogamous, humans score surprisingly highly, far above chimps and gorillas – and on a par with meerkats.However, we are by no means the most monogamous creature. Top spot goes to the Californian mouse - rodents that form inseparable, lifelong bonds.GettyChimpanzees are highly social and form strong bonds but have very different social structures from humans\"There is a premier league of monogamy, in which humans sit comfortably, while the vast majority of other mammals take a far more promiscuous approach to mating,\" said Dr Mark Dyble at the University of Cambridge.In the animal world, pairing up has its perks, which may be why it has evolved independently in multiple species, including us. Experts have proposed various benefits to so-called social monogamy, where mates match up for at least a breeding season to care for their young and see off rivals. Dr Dyble examined several human populations throughout history, calculating the proportions of full siblings – where individuals share the same mother and father – compared with half-siblings, individuals who share either a mother or a father, but not both. Similar data was compiled for more than 30 social monogamous and other mammals.Humans have a monogamy rating of 66% full siblings, ahead of meerkats (60%) but behind beavers (73%).Meanwhile, our evolutionary cousins fall at the bottom of the table - with mountain gorillas at 6% rating, while chimpanzees come in at just 4% (alongside the dolphin).In last place is Scotland's Soay sheep, where females mate with multiple males, with 0.6% full siblings. The Californian mouse came top, at 100%.GettyMonogamy is prevalent in birds; such as swans, which form strong pairsHowever, being ranked alongside meerkats and beavers doesn't mean our societies are the same - human society is poles apart.\"Although the rates of full siblings we see in humans are most similar to species like meerkats or beavers, the social system that we see in humans is very different,\" Dr Dyble told BBC News.\"Most of these species live in colony-like social groups or perhaps live in solitary pairs that go around together. Humans are very different from that. We live in what we call multi-male, multi-female groups, within which we have these monogamous, or pair-bonded, units.\"GettySoay sheep are the most promiscuous of all the animals studiedDr Kit Opie at the University of Bristol, who is not connected with the study, said this is another piece in the puzzle over how human monogamy arose.\"I think this paper gives us a very clear understanding that across time and across space humans are monogamous,\" he said.\"Our society is much closer to chimps and bonobos – it just happens that we've taken a different route when it comes to mating.\"The new study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences.",

    "body": "7 hours agoUS President Donald Trump has declared European leaders \"weak\", with his comments splashed on a number of Wednesday's front pages. According to the Metro, the president \"lambasted 'decaying' European nations\" for their failure to take action to end the Ukraine war, in a rant that the paper says \"puts peace in peril\".Claudia Winkleman beams on the front page of the Telegraph, after she was made an MBE by King Charles III for her services to broadcasting. The paper leads with quotes from its interview with the leader of France's National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, who said he would rewrite border policy to help the UK push small boats carrying migrants back into French waters.The i Paper says the UK and Europe are facing a \"huge reality check\" over their security, following Trump's condemnation of \"weak\" European leaders. The paper reports that No 10 has rejected the president's claims, but notes that the prime minister is meeting with the US ambassador at Downing Street.Trump's \"blistering attack\" on Europe leads the Independent's front page. Also featured on the front is Storm Bram, which led to \"travel misery\" and \"flood alerts\" across Britain. There are hopes that Kyiv will agree to the US-brokered peace deal \"by Christmas\", according to the Financial Times. It reports that the US has given Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky \"days\" to respond to their proposition, which will require Ukraine to accept territorial losses in exchange for \"unspecified US security guarantees\". \"Number of police forces cut to dozen under plan\", reads the headline on the front page of the Times, which reports that Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is considering reducing police forces in England and Wales to just 12. Sources have told the paper that the home secretary has delayed the publication of a \"long-awaited\" blueprint for police reform until 2026, as she wants to make \"bolder changes than previously planned\". The Guardian reports that Sir Keir Starmer has called on European leaders to \"urgently curb\" joint human rights laws, in order to allow states to take \"tougher action to protect borders\". The paper says Labour has been \"condemned\" for calling for changes, with critics arguing that the alterations could allow countries to abandon some of the world's most vulnerable people.The front page of the Mail doesn't feature a single image, leading with the headline \"Asylum fiasco without end\". It says that a \"damning report\" from the National Audit Office has revealed \"huge gaps in systems\" and missing data, including on how many asylum seekers have gone missing since arriving in the UK.Photographs of teen Afghan nationals Israr Niazal and Jan Jahanzeb lead the Express, after they were sentenced on Tuesday for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in Leamington Spa. In her comment piece for the paper, Carole Malone asks \"How many more sexual assaults will it take?\"\"The lost Covid billions\" is the main story for the Mirror, after a report found that aid schemes were left open to risk during the pandemic. The paper says that fraud and error under the Tories cost £10.9bn, with much of the shortfall \"beyond recovery\".A photograph of the late Ozzy Osbourne alongside his wife Sharon is splashed across the front page of the Sun, after she revealed his final words to her before his death in July this year.\"Vlad's pussy galore\", reads the Daily Star's main headline, alleging that Larry the Cat \"snubbed\" the Ukrainian president during his visit to No 10 earlier this week.Many of the papers carry reaction to US President Donald Trump's description of Europe as \"weak\" and \"decaying\". \"Trump lashes out,\" says the Metro. \"Eurotrashed\" is the Sun's headline. For the i Paper, the UK and its allies are facing a \"huge reality check\". The Guardian says that, as Trump was \"doubling down\" on his administration's recent criticism of Europe, he also \"hinted\" he could walk away from supporting Kyiv.The Financial Times focuses on the latest developments to try to bring Russia's war in Ukraine to an end. The paper says Trump's envoys have given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"days\" to respond to a proposed deal which would require Ukraine to accept territorial losses in exchange for unspecified US security guarantees.According to the Times, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is considering plans to cut the number of police forces in England and Wales from the present 43 to as few as 12. It's said to be one of a range of options being looked at to try to make the police more efficient and cost-effective. The Home Office hasn't commented on the report.The Daily Telegraph says research has revealed that the busiest time in accident and emergency departments in the UK is 19:00 on a Monday. The study, carried out by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, also suggests that on an average day almost a fifth of patients in UK emergency departments are being cared for in corridors and waiting rooms. A spokesman for the Department of Health said corridor care was \"undignified and had no place in the NHS\".The Guardian and the i have both picked up on a study which says the average cost of a Christmas dinner for four is a few pence less than last year - at £32.46. But according to the market research firm Worldpanel the price of another festive staple, chocolate, has increased by 18% on this time last year after poor cocoa harvests.And photographs of the presenter Claudia Winkleman receiving her MBE at Windsor Castle feature on many of the front pages. In a nod to one of the programmes she hosts - \"The Traitors\" - the Telegraph's headline calls her a \"faithful servant\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Image source, BBC SportByDaniel AustinBBC Sport senior journalistDuring the eight-and-a-half years he has spent at Liverpool, Mohamed Salah has been beloved by supporters, who rank the 'Egyptian King' among the club's greatest ever players.But since his unexpected declaration he feels scapegoated by Liverpool for the club's poor run, having been picked as a substitute for three consecutive matches by manager Arne Slot, Salah's character has been called into question by fans, former players and beyond.So who is Salah the man - away from the latest headlines?Over the past few months, BBC Sport has spoken to some of those who know him best to find out more about the personality and resilience of the man behind the goals, the glory, and the gossip.Mo Salah: Never Give UpAvailable now'You only have problems with Mo if he is not playing'Salah's relentless intensity and refusal to accept lower standards from himself or those around him have underpinned Liverpool's success, and perhaps also explain why he has found criticism of his diminished role tough to handle.\"We are all massively influenced by our past - how we were raised, where we grew up,\" says Jurgen Klopp, who won every major trophy in English and European football while managing Salah at Anfield.  \"Mo knew early on [in his life] that he had to do more than others.\"He always developed. He never stops. That is his mindset.\"After each summer break he came back and had a new skill. It was like he had spent the whole time just practising one particular type of pass.\"We pushed each other, just to make sure that we would never stop. And we never did stop. That moment lifting the Premier League bonded us for life. He will be remembered as one of the greatest of all time.\"I wouldn't say he is easy to manage, but he is also not difficult to manage. You [only] have problems with Mo Salah if he is not playing or you take him off.\"Salah has been criticised by some for not giving more frequent media interviews before his intervention in the mixed zone at Leeds' Elland Road, particularly after defeats and poor performances. He has been accused of demonstrating a lack of leadership. But he has often delivered calls to arms to fans on social media, external in difficult moments, and those who have played alongside him describe Salah as a man who refuses to give up and is capable of inspiring others.\"He will always be trying to prove someone wrong,\" says former Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana. \"He is not macho. I would often tell my children about how he behaves, how he doesn't get too high in good moments, doesn't beat himself up too much in low moments. He would always remain completely focused on the job in hand.\"I would look at him and it would make me feel calm because of how in control he would be all the time.\"Knowing Mo, he will always be fighting, being resilient, and trying to find ways to better himself.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, \"Never give up - did it ever fit to a situation better than this one?\" says Klopp about the T-shirt an injured Salah wore during Liverpool's 4-0 Champions League win over Barcelona in 2019. Lallana says the shirt \"inspired\" the team. James Milner keeps one at home.'He wants to be the best at everything'Salah defended his record when speaking at Elland Road, and compared himself to England captain Harry Kane - delivering what he felt was a reminder to those inside and outside of Liverpool who have forgotten what he is capable of.A level of arrogance is perhaps to be expected in all elite athletes, and some believe it has powered Salah to the heights he and Liverpool have reached.\"He is a really nice guy, considering the success he has had - being a superstar around the globe,\" says James Milner - Liverpool's vice-captain during most of Salah's time at the club. \"He plays as if he has a chip on his shoulder. He wants to be the best at everything - he even got a chess teacher to improve his game, and gave me a thumping a good few times.\"You need different types of leaders, and Mo is a big leader in that group, in terms of the standards he set every day. When you have young players come and sign, they see him and it's 'this is what is takes to be a top player, this is what it is to be a Liverpool player'.\"That desire to always be the best became competition - fraught at times - with team-mate Sadio Mane, Liverpool's other flying forward who played on the opposite wing to Salah for five seasons.\"Were they best friends? No,\" Klopp says. \"Could Mo have passed the ball a few times when he tried to finish it off himself? Yes. But on the pitch they supported each other, they fought for each other.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Throughout his time with Liverpool, Salah has demonstrated his competitiveness on and off the pitch'Mo has lifted the heads of all of us'Salah is more than just a footballer - he is a global sociocultural icon, being named one of the world's most influential people, steering conversations on human rights, and changing attitudes towards Muslims through demonstrations of faith.He was born in a rural village - Nagrig - about 100 miles from Cairo, where most of the roughly 15,000 inhabitants work as farmers and more than half live in poverty.That such a region could produce one of the world's greatest athletes borders on impossible.\"What already set him apart as a kid was his discipline,\" says Maher Anwar Shtiyeh - mayor of Nagrig. \"He remains deeply tied to his roots, despite fame and global recognition.\"He only finds real happiness in his village spending time with his family and friends. He is a role model for the youth of Egypt, the Arab youth, and the youth of the whole Islamic world. He has lifted the heads of all of us.\"As a child, Salah would travel up to five hours by minibus from his village to the capital, where he played youth football for top-flight club Arab Contractors.That helped instil a resilience that has guided him throughout his professional career, alongside support from loved ones.\"You have to be mentally so strong as a young kid following your dream like that,\" says former international team-mate Ahmed Elmohamady. \"His wife is from the same village. They grew up together, which is great because she knows everything about him and has supported him all the way.\"Now anyone in the village who asks him for support, he supports them. It shows what a great human being he is.\"Since leaving Egypt, Salah has maintained close ties with Nagrig and financed an ambulance station, a charitable foundation and a religious institute in the area.Salah has proudly made his faith visible throughout his career - he prays both when walking onto the pitch and after scoring goals.\"When I first met Mo, he was coming here quite regularly,\" says Shafique Rahman - Imam at Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute. \"He would arrive a little bit late after finishing training. We had people waiting outside who wanted to see him, but nobody would bother him during prayer.\"The nature of the religion is that everybody is the same in the eyes of God. When people come to prayers they stand extremely close, touching each other's shoulders. Mo felt very safe here.\"Media caption, 'To get up and want to be the best every day – that's a different mindset'When Salah first moved to England - signed by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea after impressing for Basel in Switzerland - he struggled to impose his personality in a squad full of established stars, and lacked self-belief.\"When I first met him, he was 21 - very innocent,\" says former team-mate Mark Schwarzer. \"He was coming to London - a big city, different culture - and I think he was a bit timid.\"When he signed, he was coming into a changing room packed full of international stars - players that were used to winning, and a manager that was a legend of the club. For new players, it was sink or swim.\"The more he didn't score, the more frustrated he became. There was a moment in the changing room when Jose actually kicked a table, and was directing a lot of his frustration towards Mo, and he took him off. Mo was visibly upset.\"It's credit to him, his determination, his dedication, everything, to go on and deliver what he has done.\"Salah rebuilt his career in Italy's Serie A - first in a loan spell with Fiorentina then at Roma, developing a reputation as an on-field leader and ultimate professional.\"He was just different,\" explains BBC pundit and former England and Manchester City defender Micah Richards, who played alongside Salah at Fiorentina. \"You get those characters that just do everything by the book - he was that guy. \"He would always be in bed early, always be eating healthily. He clearly thought, 'I'm going to show everyone exactly what I can do. All those who have doubted me are going to eat their words.' That's exactly what he did.\"For a young African man to set standards for European colleagues to follow was a challenge in itself.\"To succeed in Europe you have to understand the culture of where you are playing, where you are living, without losing any of your principles,\" says former Egypt striker Mido, who played for Tottenham, Roma and Ajax among others. \"This is the balance that he has achieved.\"He has made young boys in Africa dream - 'If someone who comes from the background as I do made it to the top, why couldn't I make it?'\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Football fans in Nagrig were overjoyed when Salah, one of their own, scored the opening goal in the 2019 Champions League final'Mo has left a profound mark on me'Even before Salah's comments following the 3-3 draw with Leeds, doubts about his future were arising.Inside Liverpool, concerns had already been raised about his performances, before transfer rumours were given further encouragement this week, with sources telling the BBC the Reds are open-minded about selling the 33-year-old.Salah is not the only Liverpool hero whose time at the club - which he and Slot have said could be up in the January transfer window - has (potentially) ended with public denigration.In different contexts, Javier Mascherano, Fernando Torres and Trent Alexander-Arnold have met similar fates, while shirts bearing the legendary Steven Gerrard's name were set alight in the street when he was on the verge of joining Chelsea in 2005.If this is the end of Salah and Liverpool's love affair, the human impact he has had on those around him will not be forgotten any time soon.\"He was one of the first people to welcome me, and did so in such an incredible way,\" says Luis Diaz, who played alongside Salah in Liverpool's forward line for three-and-a-half years before joining Bayern Munich earlier this year.\"He came over to me and said: 'if you ever need my help, I'm here for you.' I remember him telling me on the pitch: 'Let's try this... let's make this move so that it works.' And then it would work in the match.\"To share the moment lifting the Premier League with him, to see how happy he was, how much he was enjoying it, was an incredible feeling.\"He is always wanting to be a better player, to be a better person, and he has left a profound mark on me.\"EgyptLiverpoolPremier LeagueUEFA Champions LeagueFootball",

    "body": "13 hours agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent Pacemaker PressIRA spy Stakeknife was revealed to be west Belfast man Freddie Scappaticci, who died in 2023.The major investigation into the state agent in the IRA known as Stakeknife has revealed MI5 had a bigger role in his handling than previously claimed.The final report of Operation Kenova also said the belated discovery and disclosure of documents by MI5 to the investigation last year was \"a serious organisational failure\".Stakeknife was Freddie Scappaticci, who died in 2023, but the Kenova remains gagged by the government from officially naming him.He worked as a British agent from the late 1970s until the 1990s, and has been linked to 14 murders and 15 abductions. MI5 and the Army knew about his role in the IRA's feared internal security unit, and his involvement in torturing and killing people accused of being informers.Operation Kenova's stark conclusions on MI5's candour is just the latest severe criticism of the security service by the courts and official inquiries in the past two years.In 2023, the public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing – which killed 22 people – found that MI5's senior corporate witness had given inaccurate evidence about the key intelligence it held on the bomber before the attack.Earlier this year, MI5 was forced to apologise after the BBC proved it gave false evidence to three courts in a case concerning a neo-Nazi state informant known as Agent X. MI5 then tried to withhold further damning material from the High Court, and its third-in-command gave an inaccurate account of what had happened to senior judges, leading to the prime minister ordering a new investigation. Jon Boutcher, Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable, says he thinks that MI5 has an issue with its approach to legacy cases in Northern Ireland and that things must change.But there is also wider question about whether MI5 can be trusted to provide truthful and full evidence to courts and investigations.This poses a profound challenge to the government, which acts on behalf of MI5 in the courts and relies on its intelligence assessments to make big decisions.MI5's evidence really matters. As with Operation Kenova, that evidence frequently relates to matters of life and death, but also cases concerning people whose British citizenship has been stripped or people whose liberties have been removed.There are calls for MI5 to be subjected to increased scrutiny and be held more accountable under the law.Campaigners behind the imminent Hillsborough Law are demanding that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ should be subjected to the same duty of candour as other public bodies and government agencies.The law will create a new legal duty on public bodies and servants to act truthfully and fully support investigations into the state, ensuring wrongdoing is not concealed.However, as things stand, the duty will not apply in the same way to MI5 and intelligence agencies, with individual MI5 officers not subjected to the duty, unlike people who work for organisations like the police.Given Kenova's conclusions, how will ministers and lawmakers now react?Another big issue for the government and MI5 is the refusal to allow Kenova to name the agent Stakeknife, despite repeated requests to do so, with the consequence that much of what was uncovered cannot be publicly described in case it identifies the agent.As everyone knows, Stakeknife was Freddie Scappaticci, and Jon Boutcher on Tuesday said the ban on identifying Stakeknife was a \"pantomime\".MI5 justifies the ban with reference to its core 'neither confirm nor deny' (NCND) secrecy policy, which has long been presented in a public as a monolithic principle that cannot be deviated from.But in the neo-Nazi Agent X case, MI5 was forced to abandon NCND and confirm the man at the centre of the case was a state informant, after the BBC proved it had told me the man was an agent when it was trying to cover for him. MI5 was also forced to accept it had misled a court by not revealing the existence of policies relating to departures from NCND – policies it had kept secret.Last year, Kenova recommended that the government should review, codify and define the proper limits of the NCND policy as it relates to the identification of agents and its application in the context of Northern Ireland legacy cases.On Tuesday, Kenova said no substantive progress has yet been made on the recommendation, and it is unclear whether and when this may change.But the Stakeknife \"pantomime\", and MI5's lack of candour in other major cases, is now placing pressure on the government to act.Email: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @danields39.63Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.More on this story",

    "body": "The leader of France's far-right National Rally (RN) Jordan Bardella has welcomed \"for the most part\" concerns raised about Europe in US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy.Last week, the White House published a document which outlined Trump's vision of the world and the state of the European continent, which many have characterised as harshly critical of Europe.Speaking to the BBC's Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, Bardella praised what he said was Trump's \"appeal to American pride\" - but he made clear he did not want Europe to be \"subservient to any major power\".He said there was a \"wind of freedom, of national pride blowing all over Western democracies\".In a wide-ranging interview, the 30-year-old, who opinion polls suggest leads in the race to be France's next president, was also challenged on the RN's political history and his stance on immigration.Bardella said he shared the majority of the concerns outlined by the Trump administration about Europe facing \"civilisational erasure\", which the White House said is being fuelled by a range of policies, including on migration.\"Mass immigration and the laxity of our governments in the last 30 years with regard to migration policy are shaking the balance of European countries, of Western societies, and namely French society,\" Bardella said.Snap parliamentary elections in June 2024 made the RN the largest single force in parliament, although an alliance of left-wing parties clinched victory.The next French presidential election is due to be held in 2027. A recent poll for Le Figaro suggests Bardella would win with 44% of the vote - just ahead of Marine Le Pen, the RN figurehead whose candidacy is in doubt after she was found guilty of embezzling EU funds and barred from standing in an election for five years.An appeal due early next year will determine whether Le Pen can run - otherwise, the expectation is that Bardella will step in.Bardella batted away suggestions this was sparking tensions between them, stating they were united by \"trust and friendship\".\"I will fight by her side so she can win the appeal. Until the appeal we will campaign together, as we will after, hand-in-hand,\" he said in his interview.The RN was founded by Le Pen's father Jean-Marie in 1972. Known then as the National Front (FN), it has since become a decisive force in French politics. Jean-Marie Le Pen was convicted several times for Holocaust denial and was an unrepentant extremist on race.In his interview with Nick Robinson, Bardella distanced himself from Jean-Marie Le Pen's comments, as have many other RN politicians in recent years.\"I am fighting against the caricature of my political movement, of my ideas,\" he said, adding his responsibility was to bring together the French people and present the country with \"a project of national recovery\". \"My people's expectations for a break with the past are numerous,\" Bardella added.Challenged on the racist and antisemitic history of the RN's precursor, Bardella rejected accusations that the National Front had ever put forward arguments that could \"offend\" some sections of the population\"A lot of Jewish people vote for us and consider us a bulwark against extremism,\" he said.The RN is primarily known as an anti-immigration party and has long pushed for France to have stricter immigration rules, including limiting social spending to French citizens.\"If tomorrow I am the head of government, France will no longer be the target of mass immigration,\" he said, adding that if elected his first provision would be to trigger a referendum on immigration. \"It will allow us to take back control of our borders.\"However, according to the French constitution, a referendum can only be held on certain subjects which do not include immigration, so the constitution would have to be amended first. In order to do so, the RN would have to clinch the presidency and have either an absolute majority in Parliament or enough allies.Bardella - who grew up in the Paris region but himself has parents of immigrant origin - drew a clear distinction between people who he said were born in France but \"reject republican institutions like the police or values like secularism\", and others who \"do everything to become French - espouse the language, culture and national patrimony\".When pressed on what it means to be French if being born in the country is not sufficient, Bardella said he felt being French was an \"honour\" that transcended bureaucracy. \"Being French is adhering to some values and lifestyles, believing in equality between men and women,\" he argued.\"I defend secularism and I feel that Islamism has today become a separate political project... which wants to impose its rules on French society,\" Bardella added, before promising to close down radical mosques and banning \"hate preachers\" from the country if elected.Although he did not expand on France's frequent and longstanding financial woes - the country's debt is more than €3 trillion, or around 114% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - Bardella said the French economy was \"sick\".\"We face two ailments – excessive taxation and excessive regulation,\" he said, promising to free the country from the \"shackles\" that limit growth. The RN has repeatedly voted down the yearly budgets put forward by governments since last year, and has promised to similarly vote down this year's.Bardella's position on Ukraine also bears some differences with that of the current centrist government. While he stated Russia represented a \"multidimensional threat to French and European interests\", and that Kyiv will need security guarantees even in the event of a peace deal, he also said that he was \"firmly opposed\" to sending soldiers to Ukraine. Emmanuel Macron's government, on the other hand, has proposed deploying a steady military presence, albeit far from the front line. But such a decision \"would contribute to an escalation,\" Bardella said, \"especially given that we have nuclear weapons and that President Putin has intentions whose limits are unclear\".If Bardella does stand at the next presidential election and wins, he will be 31. Macron was 39 when he became France's youngest ever president in 2017. While Macron was finance minister for two years under François Hollande, Bardella, in comparison, has never been in government.\"It's true I am 30 years old. Unfortunately I can't do anything about that,\" he argued. \"I recognise the existential questions facing our country... And I'd rather be told that today is 'too soon' rather than tomorrow is 'too late'.\"",

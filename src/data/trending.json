    "body": "'The answer cannot be nothing': The battle over Canada's mystery brain disease12 hours agoJoel Gunter,senior international reporter, New BrunswickandNadine Yousif,senior Canada reporter, New BrunswickBBCFive hundred people in a small Canadian province were diagnosed with a mystery brain disease. What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\".To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\".Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.\"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\"Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.\"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.\"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\"In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.\"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.\"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\".\"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote.But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\".Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.\"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.\"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.)According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said.None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.\"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.A protest sign in New Brunswick. Some residents are angry about pesticide use in the province. (Chris Donovan/BBC)But the government had decided against examining any of the patients in person, an omission that outraged those who believed they were part of the cluster. The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\"Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.\"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\"Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\"In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\"Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.\"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.\"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\"Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said.Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\"But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\"Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. \"The stigma is difficult,\" she said, \"but I've accepted it.\"Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.\"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\"There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.\"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.Global NewsGabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport. Jillian Lucas is far left. (Global News)The call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\"\"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\"Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.\"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said.\"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.\"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\"Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"Dr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\"The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said.Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.\"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said.\"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\"Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.\"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\"Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.Jillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became \"choked up\", she said. \"It eats him up, he's fighting back tears.\"And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he \"took the utmost care to abide by\" the laws around Maid and had \"never proposed it\" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. \"I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go,\" she said.Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. \"I keep going because I know,\" he said, confidently. He had been able to meet \"with some of the best scientists in the country,\" he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.",

    "body": "I never saw young women on Epstein visits, Mandelson tells BBC37 minutes agoLaura KuenssbergWatch: Lord Mandelson tells the BBC he was \"not knowledgeable\" of what Epstein was doingLord Mandelson has said he never saw girls at Jeffrey Epstein's properties, and declined to apologise to the late paedophile's victims for maintaining his friendship with the American because he was not \"knowledgeable of what he was doing\".In his first interview since being sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US over his links to Epstein, he told the BBC he thought he had been \"kept separate\" from the sexual side of the late financier's life because he was gay.He was fired after emails emerged showing supportive messages he had sent to Epstein after the American was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor.The former ambassador said the only people he had seen at Epstein's properties were \"middle-aged housekeepers\".He said he would have apologised were he \"in any way complicit or culpable\" but stressed that was never the case.Epstein, a well-connected financier, died in a New York prison cell in 2019 awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He had previously been convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender.Asked on BBC's One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg whether he would like to apologise to Epstein's victims for continuing the friendship after that first conviction, he said:  \"I want to apologise to those women for a system that refused to hear their voices and did not give them the protection they were entitled to expect\".\"That system gave him protection and not them.\"If I had known, if I was in any way complicit or culpable, of course I would apologise for it. But I was not culpable, I was not knowledgeable of what he was doing.\"He continued: \"I regret and will regret to my dying day the fact that powerless women, women who were denied a voice, were not given the protection they were entitled to expect.\"Lord Mandelson, whose tenure as ambassador lasted just a few months, was also asked in the interview about his views on US President Donald Trump's ongoing comments about his country needing to \"own\" Greenland.While saying that he admired Trump's \"directness\" in his political dealings, he said he did not believe the US president would \"land on Greenland and take it by force\".He added: \"He's not going to do that. I don't know, but I'm offering my best judgement as somebody who's observed him at fairly close quarters. He's not a fool.\"He said the president had a close circle of advisers around him \"reminding him that if he were to intervene, take Greenland, that would be completely counterproductive - and would spell real danger for America's national interest\".\"We are all going to have to wake up to the reality that the Arctic needs securing against China and Russia. And if you ask me who is going to lead in that effort to secure, we all know, don't we, that it's going to be the United States.\"Asked about his long friendship with Epstein over the decades, Lord Mandelson said he believed he was \"kept separate\" from Epstein's sex life because of his own sexuality.\"Possibly some people will think because I am a gay man... I wasn't attuned to what was going on. I don't really accept that.\"I think the issue is that because I was a gay man in his circle I was kept separate from what he was doing in the sexual side of his life.\"He referred to one occasion he had spent one or two nights on Epstein's infamous private island, as well as visits to Epstein's New York and New Mexico properties.\"The only people that were there were the housekeepers, never were there any young women or girls, or people that he was preying on or engaging with in that sort of ghastly predatory way that we subsequently found out he was doing.\"\"Epstein was never there,\" he noted of his visits to the island.The government sacked Lord Mandelson as its ambassador to the US after emails showed he had been in contact with Epstein after his first conviction, offering him support.In the messages, which were published by Bloomberg and the Sun, Lord Mandelson was reported to have told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" and, the day before he began his prison sentence: \"I think the world of you.\"No 10 sources said he had been \"economical with the truth\" before he was appointed and they were not aware of the \"depth\" of their relationship.On Sunday, Lord Mandelson said the government \"knew everything\" when giving him the job, \"but not the emails because they came as a surprise to me\".\"I didn't remember sending them... they no longer existed on my server,\" he said.He said he understood why he had been sacked.\"The prime minister found himself in the middle of what must've seemed to him to have been some kind of thermonuclear explosion - I've been there, I know what goes on.\"I wish I'd had the opportunity to remind him of the circumstances of my relationship, my friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and how I came to write the emails in the first place.\"I didn't, so I understand why he took the decision he did, but one thing I'm very clear about is that I'm not going to seek to reopen or relitigate this issue. I'm moving on.\"Labour's Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, who was interviewed on the same programme, said Lord Mandelson had shown \"at best, deep naivety\" in his remarks.\"It would have gone a long way for the women who were subjected to the most appalling treatment at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein for Peter to have apologised and taken that opportunity,\" she said.There would \"clearly be a discussion about due diligence before you appoint someone to such a role\", she said, but she understood the \"detailed information\" about their relationship was not available when he was given the job.She said of his continued relationship with Epstein: \"If somebody that I was associated with was in that situation, I wouldn't touch them with a barge pole.\"Downing Street said the emails showed the \"depth and extent\" of the relationship was \"materially different\" to what they had known when appointing Lord Mandelson, particularly his \"suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein's first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged was new information\".\"In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein's crimes, he was withdrawn as ambassador with immediate effect,\" it said.A key architect of New Labour, Lord Mandelson has been in and out of British politics for four decades.He held a number of ministerial roles from the election of Tony Blair - and had to resign from post twice - until Labour lost power in 2010.",

    "body": "Warnings for snow, ice, rain and wind are in place across parts of the UK for the rest of the weekend following Storm Goretti. The Met Office warnings for Northern Ireland, Scotland, the north and Midlands of England come as forecasters say the challenging conditions are expected to ease by the start of next week with milder weather.A yellow warning for snow and ice in Scotland has been upgraded to amber. It starts at 03:00 on Sunday and lasts until 14:00 on Monday, affecting those in central and north-eastern parts of the country. Meanwhile, the National Grid said it was working to resolve power outages continuing to affect more than 20,000 properties in parts of England and Wales. The new amber warning in Scotland warns of the potential impact on both road and rail networks.The Met Office said power cuts were likely and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, could also be affected.Scottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop told people in affected areas to consider delaying journeys and working from home where possible.She added: \"The conditions will inevitably impact the transport network, so it is vital that people and communities continue to plan ahead to ensure they stay safe\". Storm Goretti brought heavy snow, ice and strong winds to most parts of the UK this past week.On Thursday, the day the storm arrived, the Met Office issued a rare red warning for wind in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.Wind speeds of up to 99mph (159km/h) were later recorded in the region.Police have since said a man was killed in the Mawgan area of Helston after a tree fell onto his caravan. Cornwall Council said the storm had been \"one of the most severe\" the county had experienced \"in living memory\", with crews working around the clock to clear fallen trees and carry out emergency repairs.Meanwhile, areas across the country have struggled with power outages.On Saturday, the National Grid said more than 20,000 properties were still without electricity - with the south-west of England continuing to face the most outages.Approximately 19,000 premises were still without electricity in the South West, with hundreds more affected in the East Midlands, the West Midlands and Wales. The National Grid said it was working \"tirelessly\" and had restored power to almost 170,000 properties.Hundreds of schools across the UK were also forced to close ahead of the weekend as heavy snow caused travel disruption. The Met Office said the UK \"will be saying goodbye to the really cold weather\" next week, with temperatures of between 9C and 11C expected in the south and about 6-8C elsewhere.",

    "body": "13 minutes agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterKemi Badenoch says she wants to channel public \"anger\" towards Labour, as she seeks to position the Conservatives as the only party willing to make the \"tough decisions\" facing the UK.Speaking to BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg , the Tory leader accused Sir Keir Starmer of failing to properly fund the armed forces, despite \"spending too much\" overall in other areas.And she accused Reform UK of an \"authoritarian\" desire to \"control\" industry, citing its policies on the oil sector and carmaker Rolls-Royce.She added that the Tories were now better positioned to oppose the Starmer government, now that the public has seen Labour's \"draconian\" first 18 months in office.\"It's clearer what they are doing, so it is clearer what we are opposing,\" she told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, adding that the Conservatives had started to go beyond offering \"reflexive opposition\".\"I'm trying to channel the anger that a lot of people out there feel about the way the country is being run,\" she added.She added that the Conservatives had \"learned a lot of lessons\" since their ejection from power in the 2024 general election. \"We think we're the only party that's both competent enough and brave enough to take the tough decisions that will get the country in the right place,\" she said.Badenoch, who has led the Conservatives since November 2024, faces a steep task in turning her party's fortunes around as she begins the new year.Tory poll ratings have improved only marginally in recent months, despite her increasingly winning plaudits for her performances holding the government to account in Parliament.But her party is having to compete with Nigel Farage's Reform UK to capitalise on Labour's unpopularity.In her interview with Kuenssberg, Badenoch continued recent attacks on both Labour and Reform's economic policies, accusing them of offering \"two different types of authoritarianism\" and \"two different types of grievance\".She dismissed the prospect of doing a deal with Farage's party to avoid splitting support among voters whose views are traditionally to the right of Labour, adding that Reform \"wants to do the same things that Labour wants to do\".She highlighted the party's welfare stance, after Reform said last year it favoured lifting the two-child benefits cap for working British couples.She also criticised Reform's policies of offering government investment in oil and gas drilling in return for a taxpayer stake in projects, and its recent suggestion it would seek to own part of Rolls-Royce in return for offering the company contracts to build small nuclear reactors.\"They want to increase welfare spending, they want to nationalise Rolls-Royce, oil and gas,\" she said, whilst the Tories were focused on \"unleashing the animal spirits of the country\".

    "body": "The US and its partner forces have carried out large-scale strikes against Islamic State (IS) group targets in Syria, the US Central Command (Centcom) has announced. US President Donald Trump directed the strikes on Saturday, which are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, in retaliation to the IS's deadly attack on US forces in Syria on 13 December, Centcom wrote on X.The strikes were conducted in an effort to combat terrorism and protect US and partner forces in the region, according to Centcom. \"Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,\" Centcom said. The US and its partner forces fired more than 90 precision munitions at more than 35 targets in an operation that involved more than 20 aircraft, an official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.The official added that aircraft including F-15Es, A-10s, AC-130Js, MQ-9s and Jordanian F-16s had taken part in the strikes. The location of the strikes and the extent of any casualties is not yet clear.\"We will never forget, and never relent,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X on Saturday in reference to the military action.  The Trump administration first announced the Operation Hawkeye Strike in December after an IS gunman killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter in an ambush in Palmyra, located in the centre of Syria.\"This is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance,\" Hegseth said when announcing the operation in December. \"The United States of America, under President Trump's leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people.\"Prior to the latest strikes on Saturday, US forces killed or captured nearly 25 IS group members in 11 missions between 20 December and 29 December as part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, Centcom said. In the operation's first mission on 19 December, US and Jordanian forces carried out a \"massive strike\" against the IS group, deploying fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery to strike \"more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\", according to Centcom. That operation, it said, \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.Syria has been in a fragile state since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime in December 2024, which effectively ended a civil war that had ravaged the country for 13 years. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known by his nom-de-guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has been serving as the country's president since his rebel group ousted Assad and solidified control.  The IS has been weakened in Syria, but still remains active, predominantly carrying out attacks against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east in 2025.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKaya BlackNorth WestWolves of WiltshireThe three wolfdogs have been named Little Timmy, Boo and BrookeThree large dogs found roaming the streets of a Lancashire town the day before Halloween have been confirmed to be wolf-dogs after a rescue centre tested their DNA.The dogs were found abandoned in Preston on 30 October 2025, and their wolf-like features sent them viral, despite Preston City Council identifying them as a German Shepherd-type breed.Siblings Little Timmy, Boo and Brooke were taken in by a rescue centre and then transferred to specialists at Wolves of Wiltshire, who confirmed they were, in fact, of the wolf-dog variety. Oli Barrington, a trustee at the exotic animal charity, said the dogs, who were found emaciated, were now \"comfortable, safe and recovering from the ordeal\".Lancashire PoliceThe animals appeared emaciated when they were collected by Lancashire PoliceThe council said they had been told by their kennelling contractor that the dogs were \"a German Shepherd type\".A council spokesman said the dogs were only in the authority's care for a \"short statutory period\".\"We do not carry out DNA testing, so we relied on the description provided at that time,\" he added.Millions of people have watched videos about the dogs and their subsequent DNA test results on Tik Tok and other social media platforms.Mr Barrington said at Wolves of Wiltshire, the focus was \"on the animals themselves, their welfare, and their happiness\".He said the rescue centre was not planning to rehabilitate the animals or make them into pets.\"They will be whatever they want to be here,\" he said. \"If they want a life with minimal human contact, then that's what they'll have.\"What is a wolf-dog? A wolf-dog is a domestic breed of dog that has been bred with a wolf.In the UK, they are legal to own as long as they are three generations away from the original parent wolf, according to the PDSA.First and second generation wolf-dogs that have one direct wolf parent require a license to own and are classed as exotic animals. Mr Barrington said Wolves of Wiltshire have specific licenses that allow them to care for the animals, because they were an \"unknown quantity, and they could have potentially required a dangerous animals license\".Little Timmy, Brooke and Boo's DNA tests, provided by company Embark, came back as 49.1% Gray Wolf and 50.9% Czechoslovakian Vlcak.The tests were ordered by 8 Below Husky Rescue, a rescue centre that first took the animals from the council. The wolf-dogs are learning from an adult female of the same breed at the rescue centreMr Barrington said he thought the law was \"a bit of a problem\", because it was about the number of generations away from a wolf, rather than the percentage of wolf DNA.He said the problem was irresponsible breeders were breeding high DNA content animals that were \"perfectly legal on paper\".\"There's very few people out there who could actually provide a decent home for a high content wolf-dog,\" he said. \"You really have to give up your life.\"An RSPCA spokesperson said: \"They are large, much more challenging animals who need highly experienced handlers who have not only worked with dogs, but also wolves, and fully understand their needs.\"They also said they did not make suitable family pets and people should be aware of the potential legal restrictions on keeping wolf-dog hybrids.However, many in the wolf-dog community are confident they can provide these animals with the care they need.HandoutLaura Mackenzie-Hawkins owns four wolf-dogs and one rescued Belgian MalinoisLaura Mackenzie-Hawkins, from Greater Manchester, has four wolf-dogs and one Belgian Malinois, who she said she had rescued from a young couple living in a second-floor flat.She took early retirement and said she was with the dogs \"24/7\" in her home, which has a large garden and 6ft-high (1.82m) fences added as adaptations for the animals.\"Just like with any dog, your responsibility is to keep that dog safe,\" she said.\"With the look of the wolf - as we've seen with the Preston three - if you get one wandering, you get mass hysteria.\"She said the wolf-dog community spent a lot of time educating people on the needs of the animals to try to ensure they ended up in safe homes.\"They're not easy,\" she added.More on this story",

    "body": "6 hours agoLeila Nathoo,Political correspondentandTabby WilsonGetty ImagesThe Conservatives say they would ban under-16s from accessing social media platforms if they were in power, promising to follow the example of Australia, which was the first country to introduce the policy. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said if her party was in government, smartphones would also be banned in schools. It has been a month since Australia's ban on under-16s using major social media platforms came into force. The Conservatives say that if elected, they would follow suit to try to protect children's mental health and education, and to stop them from viewing harmful content online. The party wants social media companies including TikTok and Snapchat to use age verification tools to prevent under-16s from accessing their platforms.  The Tories say the scope of the policy would be kept under review. Badenoch said the age restriction would protect children while still giving adults choice. Separately the NASUWT teachers' union also called for a similar ban (after taking evidence from its members). The government does not currently support the idea but insists it is taking action to ensure children are able to access only age-appropriate content online.Since July last year, platforms have been required to prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography under the Online Safety Act. Enforced by Ofcom, the media regulator, platforms that do not comply with the legislation risk fines, jail time or, in very serious cases, a ban in the UK.'I feel free': Australia's social media ban, one month onAustralia has banned social media for kids under 16. How will it work?This spring, the government is expected to issue guidance to parents around how long children under the age of five should spend watching TV or looking at computer screens.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said around 98% of children were watching screens on a daily basis by the age of two, with research suggesting that higher screen use in this age group was linked to poorer language development.The terms of reference for the national working group, which will be led by children's commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza and Department for Education scientific adviser Professor Russell Viner, will be published on Monday.Parents, children and early years practitioners will all be involved in developing the guidance, which will be published in its first iteration in April.The education secretary has insisted it will be \"shaped by parents, not dictated to them\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoChristal HayesBBC News, Los AngelesBob Weir, the guitarist who co-founded the Grateful Dead, has died aged 78.Weir, a cornerstone of the California psychedelic rock group and many of its offshoots, passed away after a battle with cancer and lung issues, according to a post on his Instagram.\"There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again,\" the post says, noting his hopes that his legacy and lengthy catalogue will live on.The post says he \"transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones\".\"He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him,\" the post continues. \"May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.\"With a career spanning more than 60 years, Weir's big break was in 1965 with the founding of the Grateful Dead. Within a few years, they became a force within San Francisco's characteristic counterculture.Quickly their style began shaping rock music - blending psychedelia and 1960s drug culture with musical tones that fused folk and Americana. They are considered one of the pioneers of jam bands.The group was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Grammy's in 2007.'A large amount of weirdness': The long, strange success of the Grateful DeadThe group officially halted in 1995 with the death of fellow co-founder Jerry Garcia.But Weir was involved in various spin-offs, including Dead & Company, which had a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere in 2024 and 2025.Weir was diagnosed with cancer in July and even while being treated, he continued to perform, according to the post on his page.\"Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,\" the post says. \"Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.\"He beat cancer before his death, the posts adds. It's unclear what type of cancer he had been diagnosed with.His family, including wife Natascha and children Shala and Chloe, asked for privacy but said they appreciated the \"outpouring of love, support, and remembrance\".Tributes started to pour in late on Saturday from fellow musicians. Even the Empire State Building in New York City honoured the rock legend by shining with tie-dye colours to memorise him.Slash, guitarist of Guns N' Roses, posted a photo of Weir playing on stage. He wrote \"RIP\" with a broken-heart emoji.Former Eagles guitarist Don Felder posted a lengthy tribute.\"I first saw Bob at Woodstock with the Grateful Dead and was blown away by that whole band, and the musicianship,\" Felder posted on Instagram with a photo of himself with Weir.\"I feel so blessed to have been able to have him sing on 'Rock You' from American Rock and Roll. Until we meet again, amigo.\"His former publicist, Dennis McNally, spoke with BBC News about his music and the fun memories they shared.\"He had a very off-kilter, unusual sense of humour that was dry and funny,\" he said. \"The road was his life, and music was his life.\"He said playing and serving the music was what \"he was put on Earth for and he did it to the end\".",

    "body": "Drivers in England will be able to see how local authorities are tackling roads  riddled with potholes via a new mapping tool and traffic light rating system.Thirteen local authorities - including Cumberland, Bolton, Kensington and Chelsea, Bedford, West Northamptonshire, North Lincolnshire and Derbyshire - have received a \"red\" rating based on the condition of their roads and how effectively they are spending government funding to carry out repairs.Essex, Wiltshire, Coventry, Leeds and Darlington are among the councils to be given a green rating on the Department for Transport (DfT) map.Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said drivers had been left to pay the price \"for too long\".She told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that people were \"fed up of driving to work and hitting the same pothole day after day\", with drivers paying hundreds of pounds for \"needless trips to the garage\".She said the government was giving councils more funding to maintain roads and that it was \"absolutely vital that the public has a mechanism to then see what is happening with that money\".The government committed £7.3bn in November's Budget to fix roads over the next four years.The DFT rated 154 local highway authorities as red, amber or green based on road conditions and how well they were using government funds.The vast majority were rated as amber, meaning they were patching up roads and had preventative measures in place but there was still room for improvement.Derbyshire - once rated the \"pothole capital of the UK\" -  scored the lowest for road maintenance.In December, the RAC found that Derbyshire had received the biggest increase in claims for compensation for potholes between 2021 and 2024. The council's cabinet member for potholes, highways and transport, Charlotte Hill, said claims had fallen by 72% since May 2025.Councils rated red will receive extra support, including an additional £300,000 each, to help them improve.The government said that future funding would be \"linked to performance\" to encourage councils to use \"taxpayer money efficiently to repair and maintain their roads before potholes form\".Alexander said no data had previously been collected on potholes - nor was there an official definition of one - so the government was gathering data \"in a way that hasn't been done before\".She told Sky News the map assessed areas based on three factors - the condition of the road, the level of investment being put in and the extent to which the local authority was \"using best practice and providing value for money\".The UK is thought to have more than one million potholes, leading to 25,758 incidents in 2025, according to the RAC. The RAC says damaged roads lead to dozens of serious injuries, accidents and breakdowns every year. The motoring group says drivers pay an average of £590 for pothole damage -  but some are out of pocket by more than £1,000.Common vehicle problems caused by potholes include damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels.Tom Hunt, chair of the Local Government Association's Inclusive Growth Committee, said the \"boost in funding is a helpful step in the right direction.\"He added that councils faced a £17bn backlog of road repairs, and that \"long term funding certainty\" and preventative measures would help to save tax payers' money and reduce the need for repairs.Shadow transport secretary Richard Holden said: \"A map won't stop tyres blowing or suspensions snapping.\"Motorists, already being squeezed tight by Labour, deserve real action to back them.\"",

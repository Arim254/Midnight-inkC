    "body": "Are fans being turned off multi-club ownership model?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Strasbourg's ultras have stayed silent for the first 15 minutes of games and held up banners in protest at the club being involved with BlueCoByFootball issues correspondentMost Strasbourg fans thought they had it good from the deal which tied them together with Chelsea. After all, the BlueCo investment has given the French side a team competitive in Ligue 1 and finished top of the Uefa Conference League table last month. There has been a £157m revamp of their Stade de la Meinau home, improving facilities and increasing capacity.Then there is their activity in the transfer market. Before Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital-owned BlueCo took control in 2023 the club's total transfer fees paid out per season were £6.1m, £3.9m and £9.5m.In the following three seasons Strasbourg have spent £52.6m, £53.6m and £96.5m. They were the biggest-spending club in France last summer, outgunning even Paris St-Germain (£89.2m).Success on the pitch was underpinned by the attacking and exciting football under Liam Rosenior. Until now.Last week the Englishman left to take charge of Chelsea. Those who were happy to accept success over a loss of autonomy in a multi-club ownership (MCO) structure now know the trade-off.There is evidence that opinion appears to be changing as fans find out what it means to be the perceived subservient partner.Strasbourg-based L'Equipe journalist Cyril Olives-Berthet says BlueCo have \"shot themselves in the foot\".\"The general opinion is utter shock,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Even people who thought there was some interesting stuff with BlueCo are shocked.\"BlueCo had a relatively good image around France after last season. That is Rosenior, the players and the style of play.\"The backlash is harsh, in the media and with football fans.\"Gary O'Neil has arrived as Rosenior's successor but Olives-Berthet says there is much scepticism. Supporters feel the 42-year-old lacks the experience for the job, having amassed 100 games during managerial spells at Bournemouth and Wolves.'A symbol of everything that is wrong with modern football'Some Strasbourg supporters have never accepted BlueCo. The club's ultras stay silent for the first 15 minutes of every match in protest.For them, Rosenior's move to Stamford Bridge reinforces their stance.\"The fact Rosenior is jumping on the Chelsea bandwagon is a symbol of everything that is wrong with modern football, and especially with multi-club ownership,\" Alexandre, spokesperson for the Strasbourg supporters' federation, told BBC Sport.\"It is different to legitimate ambition, and we know someone is going to, at some point, leave for a bigger club. No problem with that.\"But leaving your team in the middle of a season, that's not OK. That's not a thing you would do.\"Alexandre has long been a strong critic and described Strasbourg as a \"Chelsea B team\".It stings for club president Marc Keller, too. He took the club from financial ruin in the fifth tier of French football in 2012 and back to the top flight before selling to BlueCo.Keller recently rejected suggestions Strasbourg had become Chelsea's \"feeder club\" in an interview with BBC Sport. That came after it was announced star striker and captain Emmanuel Emegha would join Chelsea at the end of this season.Rosenior taking the same path appears to weaken his argument.Keller said he wanted to keep him, but denied reports he had threatened to quit himself if Rosenior went to Chelsea.\"Liam's departure wasn't planned,\" said Keller, a former midfielder at Strasbourg as well as West Ham, Portsmouth and Blackburn.\"I can understand the surprise, even the disappointment, of some of our supporters.\"And do you think I'm happy about it? The situation was neither planned nor desired by anyone at the club. Sometimes, you have to adapt in football.\"Keller said Rosenior rejected an offer from another Champions League club, believed to be Bayer Leverkusen, earlier this season but now wanted to be \"closer to his family\".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Strasbourg will lose Emmanuel Emegha to Chelsea in the summerChelsea and Strasbourg a 'unique' collaborationHalf of the Premier League is now in some form of multi-club ownership (MCO). But those clubs are at the top of the food chain and would not have experience of being the poorer relative.The City Football Group has Manchester City as its core club, and full control of teams in Italy, France, Brazil, Australia, Uruguay and Belgium. It also owns 47% of Girona in Spain.Red Bull is a majority owner of teams in Germany, Austria, the United States and Brazil, with minority stakes in other clubs, including Leeds United.These are major football operations, MCO behemoths. Players and managers will move between entities. It is like an employee getting promoted through a multi-national company.Head coach Jesse Marsch, for instance, went from New York Red Bulls to Salzburg to Leipzig. But never in the middle of a season.Other MCOs are set up share ideas and enjoy relative growth, such as Tony Bloom's interest in Brighton, Union Saint-Gilloise, Hearts and Melbourne Victory.Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos owns 100% of Nice and Swiss club FC Lausanne-Sport, but only 28.94% of Manchester United. But his decisive influence in football operations at Old Trafford is enough to trigger one of Uefa's indicators of an MCO.Chelsea and Strasbourg's two-club MCO is \"unique\", football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport. While most MCOs tend to be football focused, he added BlueCo is more of a hedge-fund strategy. That means bringing in assets that are low value and selling them on high returns. \"Strasbourg are perhaps slightly adrift in the sense they are seen as a holding area of talent that perhaps Chelsea want to bring to the club at a later point,\" said Maguire. \"You could argue that's the case with Rosenior, to get experience at another part of the Chelsea empire.\"BlueCo target younger players, they put them on long-term contracts. The players deliver and the value of the player is locked in.\"Strasbourg have the youngest squad in Europe's top five leagues, with Chelsea fourth-youngest.How both clubs are linked in the transfer marketStrasbourg now have a football team that appears to be going places and that could not have happened without BlueCo.It has worked the other way, too, in transfer spending.Strasbourg twice broke their record fee received in 2025. First Sunderland paid £27.3m to sign academy product Habib Diarra. Then Nottingham Forest spent £30.3m on Dilane Bakwa, giving Strasbourg a £27.1m profit on a player who came from Bordeaux as one of the first BlueCo signings.BlueCo would argue that without its involvement, these players - who are evidence of its strategic model - would be sold sooner, and for less. Transfers by market forces are part of the game, as Alexandre alluded to, but the inter-MCO transfers have raised eyebrows.Eleven players have moved between Chelsea and Strasbourg, with the Ligue 1 club largely benefiting from loans and the arrival of England left-back Ben Chilwell in September.There are strange cases, though, like Ishe Samuels-Smith, who moved to Chelsea from Everton's academy in 2023 and has never played a first-team game. In July, the 19-year-old full-back joined Strasbourg, only to return to Chelsea on transfer deadline day in September and immediately be loaned to Swansea City.Defender Mamadou Sarr was sold to Chelsea in the summer, but made only one appearance as a substitute at the Fifa Club World Cup and is now back at Strasbourg on loan for this season.Emegha will become the 12th player in July. With 14 Ligue 1 goals last season and  seven in 11 in all competitions this campaign, the Dutch forward's departure is more significant.Another of BlueCo's initial signings, he had only been made club captain weeks before the announcement. The ultras unfurled banners calling for the player to hand back the armband.Could this mark a shift in opinion?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, \"Crystal Palace downgrades. Even when you win, you lose. No to multiple ownership\" - Strasbourg fans display a message of support to Crystal Palace after their demotion to the Conference League due to being in an MCOStrasbourg are finding out that things are not always rosy down the food chain.They are not the only fans to show their displeasure, either.For instance, in May 2024 supporters of fellow French club Troyes, part of the City Football Group, protested by throwing flares on to the pitch and getting a match against Valenciennes abandoned. Troyes had been facing back-to-back relegations to the third tier and were saved only by the bankruptcy of Bordeaux. They are now clear at the top of Ligue 2.Fans can protest but there appears little football's authorities can do to roll back on MCOs despite genuine concerns over the integrity of competitions.Technically Fifa could restrict international transfers between the clubs, but that is not on the table. Fifa does have jurisdiction within its own competitions. It removed Mexico's Club Leon from last summer's Club World Cup due to their association with Pachuca.Uefa is getting tougher but has the same restrictions. Crystal Palace, Drogheda United and FC DAC 1904 became the first clubs ever to face demotion or removal from a competition this season for being in a multi-club structure.It just so happened Strasbourg played Palace in the Europa Conference League. The French club's ultras held up banners in solidarity with the Eagles when the two clubs met  in November. Last season Chelsea and Strasbourg could have been in the same European competition, but BlueCo took steps to be compliant with Uefa's rules so both would be admitted. In the end that move was not tested, but it may be needed another time.Uefa is expected to go further but whether it has the power to do anything which would halt MCOs is debatable.That ship may have already sailed.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJack FenwickPolitical correspondentReutersThe government has identified a legal basis which it believes can be used to allow UK military to board and detain vessels in so-called shadow fleets, BBC News understands.Russia, Iran and Venezuela have all been accused of operating ships without a valid national flag to avoid sanctions on oil.Last week British armed forces assisted US troops in seizing the Marinera oil tanker, which American officials accused of carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions.To date, no UK military personnel have boarded any vessels, but officials have spent the last few weeks exploring what measures could be used.The Sanctions and Money Laundering Act from 2018 can be used to approve the use of military force, ministers believe.It is understood there are plans for the armed forces to use these powers, in what is being described inside government as a ramping up of action against the ships. It is not known exactly when the first UK military action might occur.Two oil tankers subject to US sanctions were reportedly spotted sailing east through the English Channel towards Russia on Thursday.The UK has already imposed sanctions on more than 500 alleged shadow vessels, which it believes are helping to fund hostile activity, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Ministers say that action taken by the UK and its allies has forced around 200 ships off the seas, most of which will have been operating without a legitimate flag.Ship flagging is the process used to register a vessel to a specific country, which then allows it to travel in international waters and offers it certain protections under law.The government believes the new legal mechanism they have identified could be applied to any sanctioned vessels not legitimately flagged.Officials say this would have included the Marinera tanker, which was seized last week.The Marinera, a Venezuelan-linked ship previously known as the Bella 1, was stopped by the US Coast Guard as it travelled through the North Atlantic ocean between Iceland and Scotland.The Ministry of Defence said the US asked the UK for assistance, and that RAF surveillance aircraft and a Royal Navy support ship RFA Tideforce took part in the operation.Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was \"in full compliance with international law\", adding the UK \"will not stand by as malign activity increases on the high seas\".Healey told MPs on Wednesday that the government was \"stepping up action on the shadow fleet, developing further military options and strengthening co-ordination with allies\".It is understood that identifying this legal mechanism was one of the further military options that Healey was referring to.The US has increased action against shadow fleet vessels, with five tankers seized in recent weeks.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"The defence secretary set out in parliament this week that deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government\".They added: \"We will not comment on specific operational planning\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said on Sunday that the number of insurance checks were being increased, with more than 600 ships stopped while sailing close to the British Isles.Vessels not legitimately flagged generally have no insurance, which experts have warned could lead to a crisis if they were involved in an incident like an expensive oil spill.But Alexander said it would not be appropriate to say how many alleged shadow vessels were known to have sailed in UK waters.She told Sky News: \"Providing you with that information only helps one person and that is President Putin.\"",

They were world champions in pairs figure skating in 1994 and skated for Russia.They later moved to the US and coached at the Skating Club of Boston. On Saturday, Naumov, 24, placed third behind Ilia Malinin and runner-up Andrew Torgashev at the US Figure Skating Championships in St Louis. He will now be one of 16 figure skaters representing the US at the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina.As Naumov was competing this week, he held a photo of himself as a child with his parents. \"I thought of them immediately,\" Naumov said on Sunday, according to US Figure Skating. \"I wish they could be here to experience it with me, but I do feel their presence, and they are with me.\"Last January, his parents were among those killed after an American Airlines plane from Kansas carrying 64 people onboard collided with a military helicopter, manned by three personnel. There were no survivors. Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova were on their way back from Wichita, Kansas, which was hosting the 2025 US championships. Of those on board the flight, 28 were athletes, coaches, or parents connected to US figure skating.The Olympic figure skating competition starts on 6 February.",

    "body": "A British man has died in an avalanche in the French Alps.The man, believed to be in his 50s, was skiing with a group off-piste at La Plagne, a statement from the resort said. Rescuers were alerted to the avalanche at 13:57 (12:57 GMT) on Sunday and went immediately to the area, it added.The man was discovered under 2.5 metres (8ft) of snow after a 50-minute search. He had been skiing without an avalanche transceiver or a professional instructor, the resort said.La Plagne said its thoughts were with the man's family.BBC News has asked the Foreign Office for comment. The rescue team was made up of more than 50 people including medics, ski instructors and a helicopter-deployed dog.La Plagne's official website prompts visitors wanting to ski off-piste, also known as backcountry skiing, to make sure they have read the Avalanche Risk Bulletin and to use an avalanche victim detector. December through to February is peak season for avalanches in the northern hemisphere. Only last month, five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, died in an avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains.",

The taxi driver was named as Masrob Ali, from Blackburn.Police have yet to formally identify the victims but are continuing to investigate what happened.

    "body": "39 minutes agoJacky Martens, Vikas Pandey and Nikita YadavDelhiGetty ImagesSergio Gor took the oath as US ambassador to India in NovemberIndia and the US are continuing to actively engage on trade deal negotiations, Sergio Gor, the new US ambassador to India, has said during a trip to Delhi.  The next call to discuss the deal was scheduled for Tuesday, Gor said, but did not elaborate on who would participate.He also said the friendship between US President Donald Trump and Indian PM Narendra Modi was real and that \"real friends can disagree but will always resolve their differences at the end\".Gor's remarks come just days after some US officials blamed India for the delay in signing the deal, a claim that Delhi has denied. Trade negotiations between the nations have been strained since the US imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods  - the highest in Asia - in August, including penalties linked to India's purchase of Russian oil. Washington has pushed for greater access to India's agricultural sector, a long-standing sticking point which Delhi has strongly resisted.Sworn in at the White House in November, Gor is yet to formally present his credentials to India's president. On Monday, he was formally welcomed as the ambassador at an event in Delhi. The ceremony had the feel of a mini-inauguration, rich in pomp and careful stage-management. A round of applause greeted him before he addressed reporters. Classic American songs filled the room - a playlist, aides said, personally chosen by the ambassador - with tracks ranging from Hello, It's Me by Lionel Richie to YMCA by Village People and Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash.Speaking to reporters, he described India as having \"no partner more essential\" than the US, adding that the bilateral relationship could become the \"most consequential\" partnership of the century.\"Remember, India is the world's largest nation, so it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there,\" Gor said, adding that the two sides were also working closely on \" other very important areas\" - such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education and health.AFP via Getty ImagesRelations have cooled since Modi and Trump met at the White House last FebruaryRelations between Trump and Modi, once seen as warm, have cooled in recent months, with disagreements ranging from trade to India's stance on mediation on its conflict with Pakistan, even as the two leaders continue to speak periodically by phone.On Friday, India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that both sides have been \"close to a deal\" on several occasions but they remain engaged in negotiations. Delhi's comments came after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed that the trade deal between the countries stalled because Modi did not call Trump.\"It was all set up. I said [to the Indian side] you got to have Modi call the president. They were uncomfortable doing it, so Modi didn't call,\" Lutnick said in a podcast released last week.India said the categorisation of the discussions between Delhi and Washington was \"not accurate\".Meanwhile, Trump has also made several comments about India and Modi in recent days, including a warning that he would increase tariffs if Delhi does not stop buying Russian oil.Separately, US Senator Lindsey Graham last week said that Trump had \"greenlit\" a punishing Russia sanctions bill that, if passed by Congress, would allow for even higher secondary tariffs and sanctions on countries doing business with Moscow.Jaiswal said India was \"aware of the proposed bill\" and was \"closely following developments\".India became one of the biggest markets for Russian oil as Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russian troops invaded Ukraine in 2022. Delhi had defended its decision, saying that it needed to think about the energy needs of its vast population. But since the tariffs kicked in, oil refiners in India have reportedly been cutting their energy purchases from Moscow. Even though India was among the first countries the US was negotiating a deal with, almost a year later, it is now among the last major economies yet to get a trade pact with the US.

    "body": "3 hours agoIran has warned the US not to attack following protests \"that have rocked the country\" as Donald Trump weighs up the \"options for a response from Washington\", the Guardian reports. Trump has previously threatened to strike Iran over the killings of protesters, and on Saturday said the US stood \"ready to help\". The European Union wants to future proof its post-Brexit \"reset\" deal with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as part of ongoing negotiations with the UK, the Financial Times says. The move has been dubbed the \"Farage clause\", after Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, which would see any future British government pay significant compensation if it quit the deal, the paper reports.The i Paper leads with a warning from US generals saying they are not ready to bomb Iran as Trump contemplates his next move. Iran has said it will retaliate if attacked by the US, the paper says, another reason why US commanders say \"they need more time to prepare military strikes\". Similarly, tensions are ramping up between the US and the Middle East amid the growing number of protester deaths in Iran, the Independent reports.

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond Chia,Business reporterandSilvano Hajid,BBC IndonesiaMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok over its ability to produce sexually explicit deepfakes.Grok, a tool on Musk's X platform, allows users to generate images but has recently  been used to edit images of real people to show them in revealing outfits.The South East Asian countries said Grok could be used to produce pornographic and non-consensual images involving women and children. They are the first in the world to ban the AI tool.There is also growing pressure to block Grok in the UK, with its technology secretary saying she would back the move, leading Musk to accuse the government of wanting to suppress free speech.Malaysia and Indonesia's communications ministries announced their move against Grok in separate statements over the weekend.The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said on Sunday that it issued notices to X earlier in the year to seek tighter measures after it found \"repeated misuse\" of Grok to generate harmful content.But in its response, X failed to address the inherent risks of its platform's design and focused mainly on the reporting process for users, the regulator said.It added that Grok will be blocked until effective safeguards are implemented and urged the public to report harmful online content.Using Grok to produce sexually explicit content is a violation of human rights, dignity and online safety, Meutya Hafid, Indonesia's communications and digital affairs minister, said in a post on Instagram.The ministry has also asked Musk's X to provide a clarification on the use of Grok.Indonesian authorities have cracked down on other online sources of pornographic material in recent years, with platforms such as OnlyFans and Pornhub already banned in the country.Indonesian X users who found their manipulated pictures on the platform said they felt angry that this was allowed to happen.Kirana Ayuningtyas, a wheelchair user who posts online about her daily experiences, found that a stranger had commented on her picture with a prompt asking for Grok to depict her wearing a bikini.Ayuningtyas said she adjusted her privacy settings and contacted the platform to get the image removed prevent users from editing her photos.\"Unfortunately, none of that really worked,\" she said, adding that it was hard to tell if someone out there is holding on to the images.She asked her friends to report the accounts that published her faked images, but doing so meant even more people see the edited images, which is deeply embarrassing for her.The BBC has contacted the Grok platform for comment. The use of Grok to generate sexualised images has been condemned by leaders worldwide, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called it \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\".The country's Technology Secretary Liz Kendall has also said she would back regulator Ofcom if it blocks UK access to Elon Musk's social media site X for failing to comply with online safety laws.She said the UK's Online Safety Act \"includes the power to block services from being accessed in the UK, if they refuse to comply with UK law\" and \"if Ofcom decide to use those powers they will have our full support\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterHost Nikki Glaser returned to host the Golden Globes on Sunday, delivering a scorching opening monologue that roasted many of the celebrities in the room.\"Just like Wicked, I'm back for a sequel,\" she told the A-list crowd. \"Just like Frankenstein, I've been pieced together by an unlicensed European surgeon.\"And just like the podcasters nominated tonight, I should not be allowed to be this close to Julia Roberts.\"Golden Globes: The red carpet in picturesThe full list of winners and nomineesTop moments: Amy Poehler and Snoop Dogg to K-Pop triumphsLeonardo DiCaprio's love life, George Clooney's coffee commercials, and the proposed Warner Bros sale were among the topics Glaser had in her sights. The stars took her cutting comments in good humour as Glaser reflected on the last year in film and TV. Here are 21 of her best jokes.1. Welcome to the Golden Globes - without a doubt, the most important thing that's happening in the world right now.2. So let's get down to business, shall we? We'll start the bidding for Warner Bros at $5, do I hear $5?3. Tonight we are celebrating the best of TV and film, right here in the heart of Los Angeles, where no TV or film has been made for the past six years.4. There are so many A-listers here, and by A-listers I mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted. The Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department. 5. George Clooney, you're amazing, I'm such a fan. I've always wanted to ask you this question, it might be unprofessional but here goes: My Nespresso has been coming out kind of watery, and I'm wondering, is it like a pod issue, or do you think it might be the filter?6. The Rock is nominated tonight, and, luckily for him, the TV show The Paper is not, so he might win.7. Kevin Hart is here, the Rock's plus one-half. 8. Kevin and the Rock are like my favourite comedy duo. You're like Steve Martin and Martin Short but for people under-50 IQ. \"Jumanji: Next Level\" - was it? 9. What a career Leonardo DiCaprio has had. Countless iconic performances, you've worked with every great director, you've won three Golden Globes and an Oscar, and the most impressive thing is you were able to accomplish all that before your girlfriend turned 30. 10. Leo, I'm sorry I made that joke, it's cheap, I tried not to, but we don't know anything else about you, man. There's, like, nothing else. 11. Sean Penn, you're such an original. Everyone in this town is obsessed with looking younger, meanwhile Sean Penn is like, 'What if I slowly morph into a sexy leather handbag?'12. Fun fact: Hamnet was actually the original name for Spanx. I'm wearing three ham-nets right now.13. In Sinners, Michael B Jordan played two brothers. Am I allowed to say that? Doesn't sound right. He played twins. 14. Wicked was back this year, with Wicked: For Money.15. Once agin, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande gave us two career-defining performances. Two hours into that movie, I was in tears. I was like, 'I can't believe there's still 45 minutes left'.16, Ariana, I would listen to you sing the phone book. Grab the one Kevin Hart is sitting on tonight.17. Timothée Chalamet is here for Marty Supreme - he's the first actor in history to have to put on muscle for a movie about ping-pong.18. It's a privilege to be in this room with you all. Please keep doing what you're doing. Guillermo del Toro, keep making weird monster sex movies. And James Cameron, keep making weird monster sex movies. 19. Noah Wyle, keep being the only doctor I've seen regularly for the last 35 years. 20. Jacob Elordi and Paul Mescal, keep being the same person to my mom.21. And lastly, Steve Martin and Martin Short, keep proving that in this industry, you're never too old to still need money.",

    "body": "An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains has killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, according to rescuers. The mountaineers, travelling in separate groups, were scaling Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps at around 16:00 local time on Saturday when the fast-moving snow hit.  A group of three people \"was fully swept away by the avalanche\" and all died, said Italy's Alpine rescue service, Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico.Separately, the father and daughter were carried away by the avalanche and their bodies were recovered on Sunday. Two other climbers in a third party survived.The alarm was raised by the survivors, triggering the rescue operation.Olaf Reinstadler, a spokesperson for the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, told German media that the avalanche on the 3,545-metre (11,630ft) mountain, also called Vertainspitze, could have been caused by recent snow drifts which had not bonded to the ice below.He said climbing tours were popular and the weather conditions were good, but wondered why the mountaineers were climbing late in the afternoon, as the descent would have then taken until nightfall.The bodies of the three people climbing together were recovered on Saturday before rescue efforts were suspended due to fading light and safety conditions. The Alpine rescue service said that due to fog and low visibility, helicopters could not take off at first light on Sunday.However, once conditions improved, rescuers and avalanche dog units were airlifted to 2,600 metres before setting out on foot.By late morning, the bodies of the two missing mountaineers - the father and daughter - were found.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPA MediaAlex Salmond successfully sued the Scottish government over its handling of two harassment complaintsThe estate of former first minister Alex Salmond is seeking sequestration – the Scottish legal equivalent of bankruptcy – due to costs linked to court action.Salmond successfully sued the Scottish government for £512,000 over the handling of two harassment complaints against him by civil servants which were ruled to be \"tainted with apparent bias\".His former lawyers, Levy and McRae, are now acting for his wife, Moira, in winding up his estate.Senior partner David McKie  said \"exposing the unlawful conduct of the Scottish government\" had been \"a matter of great satisfaction\" for Salmond and his wife, but that success came \"at a huge cost\" personally and financially.After Salmond won his case against the Scottish government, he was later acquitted of a series of sexual misconduct charges at the High Court in Edinburgh.Mr McKie said the step of appointing a trustee in sequestration on behalf of Salmond's widow was \"very unfortunate\" but necessary \"to protect her interests and those of creditors\".He said: \"It is a matter of profound regret that Alex had to invest so much time and money in clearing his name. \"But most people will understand that faced with such attacks and an unlawful process brought against him, there was no choice for Alex but to defend himself with every resource available to him.\"This matter will now rightly be passed to the Accountant in Bankruptcy and, if appointed, the new Trustees in Sequestration.\"Salmond died in October 2024 at the age of 69 after suffering a heart attack while attending an event in North Macedonia.",

    "body": "US airports have been hit with widespread delays because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the federal government shutdown.A ground stop was issued at Newark Airport on Sunday morning, a major hub servicing New York. Average delays at Newark are more than three hours and could last until Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration says.Half of the 30 major airports in the US have staff shortages, and Transport Secretary Sean Duffy said flights will be cancelled across national airspace \"to make sure people are safe\".Nearly 13,000 air traffic controllers are working without pay as the government shutdown enters its second month.Air traffic controllers, like other essential federal workers, are required to work without pay during the shutdown, including Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents.  The aviation agency called on lawmakers to end the shutdown so that workers \"receive the pay they've earned and travelers can avoid further disruptions and delays\". The FAA said the shortages means it has had to reduce the flow of air traffic \"to maintain safety\". \"This may result in delays or cancellations,\" it added.On Saturday, about 4,500 flights within the US were delayed and more than 500 were cancelled, according to FlightAware. In New York, the largest US city, about 80% of air traffic controllers were absent heading into the weekend, according to the FAA.Transportation Secretary Duffy on Sunday told ABC the aviation agency would take any steps necessary to make sure travellers are safe.\"But there is a level of risk that gets injected into the system when we have a controller that's doing two jobs instead of one,\" he said.He added that air traffic controllers were under a great deal of stress and working without pay.\"They don't make a lot of money, and so they may be the only person that is bringing money into the household,\" he said.\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\"Lawmakers are at an impasse as a Republican-led bill to fund the government has failed to pass the Senate over a dozen times.In exchange for re-opening the government, Democrats are seeking to extend tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans.They are also calling for a reverse to US President Donald Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people.",

    "body": "France's consumer watchdog has reported fast fashion giant Shein to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website. The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said in a statement that the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\", French media reported.Shein told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\" It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\".Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.The decision to allow Shein to open at BHV Marais, a shop in France's capital city that traces its roots back to 1856, has provoked controversy. The company has faced criticism for its labour practices and environmental record.Shein will open at BHV on Wednesday ahead of other shops across France, all owned by property firm Société des Grands Magasins.Commenting on the dolls sold on Shein's site, France's consumer watchdog warned that \"the dissemination, via an electronic communications network, of child pornography is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine of €100,000 (£88,000)\".Shein said it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any content or products that violate our platform policies or applicable laws\".A spokesperson said the fast fashion firm is taking the matter \"extremely seriously\".\"We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again,\" they said. Shein has already been fined millions of euros in recent months.In September, France's data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de L'informatique et des Libertés, imposed a €150m (£132m) penalty on Shein for failing to get users' consent to allow \"cookies\" which collect information about people visiting a website.  Shein is contesting the fine, which it called \"wholly disproportionate\" and \"politically motivated\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoNoor Nanji & Laura KuenssbergSamir Hussein/WireImage/Getty ImagesThe government is \"working to remove\" Andrew Mountbatten Windsor's last honorary military title at the King’s request, the defence secretary has said.John Healey said King Charles had \"indicated that's what he wishes\".Andrew, who was stripped of his title as a prince on Thursday, retained his rank as a Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy after giving up his other military positions in 2022.Healey told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"This is a move that's right, it's a move the King has indicated we should take and we're working on that at the moment.\"Andrew spent decades in public life as a war hero and prince, but has since suffered a major fall from grace.The King’s younger brother had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, and served as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War.He also commanded the mine countermeasures vessel HMS Cottesmore.This week, he lost his last remaining royal titles and privileges following months of pressure over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.PA MediaAndrew served in the Royal Navy for 22 yearsSpeaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, royal author and journalist Valentine Low said this latest move, to lose his final military title, will be a \"blow\" to Andrew.\"Royals, and particularly Andrew, are very proud and determined to hang onto military titles,\" he said.\"It seems the King is intent on taking absolutely everything away from his brother.

    "body": "Three men have been killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said. It is the latest in a series of attacks on vessels the Trump administration says are being used to smuggle drugs into the US.Since they began in September, experts have questioned the legality of the strikes under international law, which have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Combatting the flow of illegal drugs is a key policy for US President Donald Trump - but some have suggested the strikes are part of efforts to influence politically opposed governments in the region.Hegseth said the boat targeted on Saturday was operated by a designated terrorist organisation - without specifying which one - and had been travelling in international waters when it was hit.The vessel was travelling along a known drug-smuggling route and carrying narcotics, he said, without providing evidence.Hegseth's statement late on Saturday was accompanied by a video that appears to show a blurred-out boat travelling through the water before exploding.Announcements of these strikes are usually accompanied with grainy footage but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel.The Trump administration has previously said that some boats targeted had departed from Venezuela.The Trump administration has insisted that it was targeting \"narco-terrorists\".The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported that at least 64 people have been killed by American airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has previously described the attacks as \"murder\" and said they were being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Meanwhile, Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro accused Washington of \"fabricating a war\".The two left-wing leaders have increasingly been at odds with the Trump administration. Following Petro's comments, the US placed sanctions on him and his inner circle, as well as removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs. Trump has threatened military action against land targets in Venezuela.But this, he has admitted, may require the consent of the US Congress.However, some US lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, have said the strikes on vessels also required congressional approval - something Trump has denied. Others have questioned whether the lethal strikes were legal at all.The UN's human rights chief Volker Turk said on Friday that such attacks were a violation of international human rights law. \"Over 60 people have reportedly been killed in a continuing series of attacks carried out by US armed forces... in circumstances that find no justification in international law,\" he said. \"These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.\"Experts in Latin American politics have suggested the strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific were part of a suite of measures designed to influence change in Colombia and Venezuela.The US is among many nations that consider Maduro's election last year as illegitimate, while Trump has been critical of Petro's policies on combatting the drug trade in his country, which has traditionally been a US ally.Washington has steadily been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean over the past few months, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking but which military analysts say is much larger than what is needed.",

    "body": "Bonfire Night's Beaver supermoon to be biggest and brightest of 2025Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Fireworks night in Sefton Park, Liverpool, in 2009 featuring an almost full MoonBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter The second of three consecutive supermoons of 2025 will coincide with Bonfire Night on Wednesday.The full Beaver Moon rises in the UK at around 15:55 GMT on 5 November.It will be the largest and brightest Moon this year.If you want to catch a glimpse, keep an eye on the forecast to see where has the best chance of seeing clear skies.Why is this Moon a 'supermoon'?Image caption, At its 'perigee' the Moon is 30,000 miles closer to Earth than at its 'apogee'The Moon does not orbit the earth in a perfect circle but has more of an egg-shaped, elliptical orbit. Therefore it is not always the same distance from the Earth.  At its closest point - or perigee - the Moon is about 220,000 miles away from Earth, whereas at its furthest point - or apogee - it is around 250,000 miles away.If the Moon is full at its closest point to Earth, or within 90% of its perigee, it can be referred to as a 'supermoon'.  The term was first coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle to describe full Moons that appear noticeably larger and brighter as they coincide with the perigee. They can seem to be up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full Moons, external.November's Beaver Moon will be the closest full Moon to Earth this year, therefore it will be the brightest and will appear to be the largest.Image source, Dan Kitwood/Getty imagesImage caption, Last month's Harvest supermoon - pictured here with a passenger plane flying above London -  was the first of the yearWhy is it a called a Beaver Moon?Image source, Andrew Matthews/PA WireImage caption, After centuries of absence, beavers are starting to roam wild again in parts of England and ScotlandEach month's full Moon has a nickname reflecting what is happening in nature and the weather at that time of year. Many of these names date back centuries and some are more obvious than others such as February's 'Snow Moon' or June's 'Strawberry Moon'.But what about November's Beaver Moon? It is thought that the term may have been used in a range of cultures from certain Native American tribes to early European settlers.  It is the time of year beavers become particularly active as they build dams and stock up on food for the winter.Beavers in the UK were hunted to extinction in the 16th Century, mainly for their furs.  However, in recent years rewilding projects have been reintroducing beavers to several parts of England and Scotland. They can bring huge benefits to nature, including improving river water quality and increasing biodiversity.Whilst this will be the brightest and largest full Moon of 2025, you won't have to wait long until the next one, as we will see the third and final supermoon of the year on 4 December.What is the forecast?Image caption, Current most likely weather conditions for Bonfire Night's Beaver Moon viewingThe week ahead is looking changeable, with a series of low pressure systems expected to move west to east across the UK. This means spells of rain and wind at times interspersed with calmer and drier interludes.It is too soon to say exactly where will have optimum viewing conditions for the Beaver Moon on Wednesday but the current most likely weather pattern is for a frontal system to bring cloud and rain to the south, with increasing chances of clearer skies and drier conditions further north.Keep up to date with the forecast as we approach Bonfire Night by checking the BBC Weather website or App.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "4 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersLast month's jewellery heist at the Louvre museum was carried out by petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.\"This is not quite everyday delinquency... but it is a type of delinquency that we do not generally associate with the upper echelons of organised crime,\" Laure Beccuau told franceinfo radio.She said four people arrested and charged so far over the theft that shocked France and the world were \"clearly local people\" living in Seine-Saint-Denis, an impoverished area just north of Paris. Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the most-visited museum, in the French capital, on 19 October.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenIn Sunday's interview to franceinfo radio, Beccuau said the four arrested people - three men and a woman - \"all live more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis\".She said two of the male suspects had been known to the police, as they each had multiple theft convictions.On Saturday, a 38-year-old woman was charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy.The suspects - who have not been publicly named - both denied any involvement.Beccuau said the two were in a relationship and had children together, without giving any further details.Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Investigators believe four men carried out the daylight theft, and one of them is still on the run.Three other people detained earlier this week have been released without charge.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 local time (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Ms Beccuau told reporters last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBrandon Drenonin Westmoreland, JamaicaBrandon Drenon / BBC NewsA town just outside of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish sits in ruinsFive days after Hurricane Melissa pummelled into western Jamaica with record force, residents in devastated communities along the coast are still desperately waiting for help.Many of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return.The government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds.That is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days.Local official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland.Westmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elisabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed.Hurricane death toll rises as Jamaica aid effort strugglesA long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history.Piles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction.On Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill.A policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic.\"We don't know what lies ahead,\" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as \"total devastation\".Brandon Drenon / BBCBrandon Drenon / BBCRoy Perry says he has lost everything in the wake of the strongest hurricane in Jamaican historyBrandon Drenon / BBCAnthony Burnett (left) and Gary Williams (right)Those living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating.Gary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but \"they no turn up\".He sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next.Williams said he lost his house in the storm and has \"nowhere to live\", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch.Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now.\"About 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world.Jamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet.He addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were \"several factors\" contributing to delays.\"Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,\" Vaz said on X.Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the \"immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services\", as well as providing food and medical supplies.But that would only solve part of the problem.Brandon Drenon / BBCResidents of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish try to piece their lives back togetherIn a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood.\"We all devastated here, man,\" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now \"flat\".\"Melissa take everything down,\" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as \"mashed up\".Morris also told of \"no help, no food, no water\".\"We just have to try and see what we can do,\" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish.Even then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch.The people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances.Seated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but \"we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still\".Brandon Drenon / BBCRobert Morris fishing village in view over his right shoulder has been entirely destroyedBrandon Drenon / BBCOreth Jones, a local farmer, said his farm was \"all wrecked\" \"Can't give up. Not gonna give up,\" he said.It is the same tone struck by Oreth Jones, a farmer sitting in the bed of his truck selling pears, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes – the last of his produce that was spared from the storm.Of his farm, he said: \"It's all wrecked. They all destroyed.\" But he quickly followed up with: \"We have to give God thanks we're alive.\"Jones survived the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history while he was injured, wearing a homemade splint on his right leg from a fracture he suffered during a biking accident before Melissa hit.When asked about how the community will move forward, he said: \"Pray. Nothing else we can do. Nothing else.\"Meanwhile, foreign aid has now started entering into Jamaica. The US State Department announced on Friday that its Disaster Assistance Response Team had arrived. And countries including the UK have also pledged millions in aid relief funds and emergency supplies.",

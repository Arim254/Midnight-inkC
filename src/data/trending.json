Citing the “fog of war” in a chaotic situation, Hegseth said he “did not personally see survivors” after a deadly strike on an alleged drug boat in the Carribean, amid concerns that US forces may have violated laws governing armed conflict.  \nSarah, Anthony and Justin unpack Hegseth’s explanation, and where it leaves Trump’s ongoing dispute with the Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro.  \nWe also hear Trump’s tirade against Somalian immigrants and why he doesn’t want them in the United States, telling reporters they are “garbage” who should go back to where they came from and that “their country is no good for a reason”. Americast looks at the reasons behind Trump's outburst, and how immigration authorities will now be targeting Minnesota’s large Somali community.  \nAnd - did Trump fall asleep during Tuesday's cabinet meeting? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

Officer Martin said the animal had fallen through one of the ceiling tiles before going \"on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything\". Only one blurry CCTV image of the boozy break-in exists, so it's unknown just how much alcohol the thirsty creature consumed before passing out in the bathroom.In a social media post, the store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter for its professionalism and providing its visitor with a \"sober ride home\".Officer Martin said it was \"just another day in the life of an animal control officer\".

    "body": "3 hours agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondentandPatrick JacksonFive Palestinians were killed, including two children, and several wounded when Israeli aircraft struck tents for displaced people west of Khan Younis, according to medics at the Kuwait Field Hospital.The strikes hit Gaza's coastal al-Mawasi area.Medical teams said the dead were two women aged 46 and 30, a 36-year-old man, and two boys, aged eight and 10.Some 32 injured people were treated in hospital, the medics said.Rescue workers told the BBC they recovered the bodies from al-Najaat camp, a cluster of tents that has housed hundreds of displaced people in recent months.The Israeli military said it had \"struck a Hamas terrorist\" after five of its soldiers were wounded earlier on Wednesday.\"The Hamas terrorist organization carried out a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, during which terrorists attacked IDF troops deployed in the Rafah area,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had vowed to \"respond accordingly\". Witnesses said the initial strike had targeted a tent inside the al-Mawasi displacement area, followed by blasts near the Kuwait hospital, prompting panic among families sheltering nearby.Hamas called Israel's action barbaric, indiscriminate and a violation of the ceasefire which began on 10 October.The Israeli military launched its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 70,100 Palestinians have since been killed as a result of Israel's campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoJosh Martin,Business reporterandScott Duffield,Politics reporterGetty ImagesEV levies, tourist taxes, pension changes and income tax policy were announced in the Budget on 26 November, but were reported by media beforehandChancellor Rachel Reeves is backing an inquiry into pre-Budget leaks from the Treasury which knocked business and consumer confidence and moved markets.The chief secretary to the Treasury told the Commons on Wednesday an inquiry into pre-Budget leaks was under way,  led by top Treasury civil servant James Bowler and had \"the full support of the chancellor\".Policies such as a freezing of income tax thresholds, a pay-per-mile levy on electric vehicles and a tourist tax were all reported in the lead-up to the Budget on 26 November. A downgrade of UK productivity from the Office for Budget Responsibility, and a plan to raise income tax rates, later abandoned, were also briefed to media.Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle criticised the leaks, branding it the \"hokey-cokey Budget,\" and reminded the government that policy should be announced first to the Commons.James Murray, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the Commons: \"The government puts the utmost weight on Budget security, including prevention of leaks of information. \"A leak inquiry is now under way with the full support of the chancellor and the whole Treasury team.\"Mr Bowler would investigate the \"security processes to inform future fiscal events\", Mr Murray said.The Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Dame Meg Hillier MP, said: \"Leak inquiries have a habit of not finding someone responsible. But if somebody is found responsible, will they follow the lead set by Richard Hughes [and resign]?\"Mr Murray responded saying he would \"not speculate on the outcome of the leak inquiry\".'Unhelpful' speculationThe steady flow of headlines around taxation and forecasts for the economy also influenced the bond markets, which dictates the interest rates the UK pays on its debt.A pre-Budget survey by Barclays pointed to more than half of business leaders saying they had delayed investment decisions until after the two-month lead-up to the Budget.\"Hundreds of thousands\" of people drew down part of their pension savings prematurely ahead of this Budget and the previous one because they were worried about what might be in it, the boss of one of the UK's biggest pension providers told Radio 4's Today programme. Mark FitzPatrick, chief executive of the FTSE 100 wealth manager St James's Place, said: \"The run-up to the Budget this time...there was a lot of speculation...and people act on speculation.\"The flying of kites is unhelpful when it affects people's lives.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "4 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondentMetropolitan PoliceVincent Chan first came to attention for filming the children in his careA nursery worker has admitted sexually abusing young children in his care in north London.Vincent Chan, 45, appeared at Wood Green Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to 26 charges including sexual assault by penetration, sexual assault by touching and making indecent images depicting the most severe category of child sex abuse.The investigation into Chan followed a tip-off from a whistleblower and became one of the most \"harrowing and complex\" cases undertaken by the Metropolitan Police, the force said.Chan, of Stanhope Avenue in Finchley, will be sentenced on 23 January.Warning: This article contains distressing detailsJudge David Aaronberg KC told the defendant: \"Mr Chan, you have pleaded guilty to matters which are going to result in a custodial sentence of many years.\"Chan first came to attention for filming children at Bright Horizons nursery,  Finchley Road, West Hampstead. The nursery branch has since closed.When police started to investigate, they found what detectives called \"deeply disturbing material\" on Chan's devices and iPads seized from the nursery.They later found the video evidence of sexual abuse of children at the nursery, some of which had been filmed on nursery iPads.Julia QuenzlerChan was warned by the judge to expect a custodial sentence \"of many years\"Det Supt Lewis Basford, who led the Met Police's investigation, said the offences had caused \"deep shock and distress\".Chan had been advance vetted by the Disclosure and Barring Service, having previously worked as a karate club instructor and in a school.Chan, who was born and raised in the UK and is of Chinese heritage, took on a number of roles at the nursery including art specialist, room leader and nursery nurse. He was entrusted with the care of children aged between two and four.Moment Vincent Chan arrested by Met Police officersFamily members of many of the victims sat in the dock as charges were read out, many of them in tears.Following Chan's guilty pleas, the victims' parents made a joint statement through their solicitor.\"As parents we are still trying to process the sickening discovery that our children were subjected to despicable abuse... We feel that Bright Horizons has failed us, and we want answers.\"How was someone like Vincent Chan employed? And how were such horrific crimes against children able to continue for so long without the staff responsible for safeguarding at Bright Horizons nursery acting?\"We are concerned that failures in management and supervision at Bright Horizons allowed this abuse to go undetected, and we are committed to securing accountability for our children.\"Bright Horizons said it was \"shocked and appalled\" by Chan's crimes, adding that its \"thoughts are first and foremost with the children and families affected\".A spokesperson for the chain said: \"Whilst this individual's actions came to light after a colleague raised concerns and followed our whistleblowing procedures to report him, we fully accept that the evidence shows the individual was able to commit these crimes despite our safeguarding measures.\"In light of this, we have commissioned an external expert in this field to undertake a full review of our safeguarding practices.\"Watch: Victims' parents want answers from nursery, says solicitorHelen Reddy, prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said Chan's actions were \"a heinous breach of trust\" by someone working in a caring profession in what should have been a safe place for children.She added: \"The evidence against him was compelling and the nature and number of offences the CPS charged him with reflects the seriousness of his offending.\"Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the Department of Education was working with Ofsted and local leaders to assess what more can be done to keep children safe.She said: \"The details of this case are absolutely sickening, and my thoughts are with the families affected at this extremely distressing time.\"No child should ever suffer abuse. Their safety and life chances are at the heart of every decision that this government makes.\"If you have been affected by this story or would like support then you can find organisations which offer help and information at the BBC Action Line Related internet links",

    "body": "5 hours agoArchie Mitchell,Business reporterandMichael Sheils McNameeGetty ImagesBritish adults are hiding their outgoings on things like beauty products, gambling and cryptocurrencies from their partners as part of a pattern of \"secret spending\", a new report has found. More than half of adults in relationships spent in secret on a range of products, according to the research by investment platform AJ Bell and pollster Opinium.  The survey of 4,000 adults showed that men, on average, spent £2,545 without their partner's knowledge in the past year.By contrast, women spent an average of £1,769 in secret, the survey found.The most common secret purchase for men and women was clothing - with it being a purchase for 20% of men and 35% of women. For women in relationships, beauty products were the next most common, with a quarter saying they had secretly bought them.Men said their most common secret spend after clothing was on vices such as cigarettes and alcohol, with a fifth (19%) saying they had made the purchases without telling their partner.Men were also found to be more likely to use their cash for gambling or to send gifts to friends and family without telling their partners.Gen Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, are more secretive with their spending than older generations, with an average of £4,303 in the past year. Those over 55, meanwhile, spent an average of just £384 in secret over the same period.AJ Bell's personal finance director Laura Suter said a bit of secret spending \"might sound harmless\" but could potentially highlight \"a much bigger issue around how couples manage, discuss and plan their finances\".She said money being spent in secret could make it \"difficult to budget properly or plan for longer-term goals like buying a home, building an emergency pot or saving for retirement\". Ms Suter warned that gaps between what people say they are spending and what they are actually spending is \"likely to be one of the quickest routes to financial friction in a couple\".She added: \"Ultimately, you don't have to report every time you buy a coffee or get your nails done to your partner, but major costs, recurring habits or anything that risks derailing a joint financial plan should be on the table.\"And finance expert Iona Bain said couples maintaining a degree of financial independence can be \"very sensible\".But Ms Bain warned some partners hide spending from each other \"because they have failed to be honest about their values and priorities at an early stage, and they know deep down that their partner wouldn't approve\".\"This kind of behaviour is understandable but it actually creates more conflict in the long run because it's impossible to do things like buy a house together or have children without being honest about how you spend your money,\" she added.",

The three-time Grammy winner was seen wearing a gold and diamond ring on her engagement finger at the premiere of Avatar: Fire and Ash in Los Angeles on Monday.In an interview with US TV show Good Morning America on Wednesday, the 33-year-old said Morando had got down on one knee for the proposal during a recent trip to Asia.\"I am not easy to surprise because I love to control every situation and I had completely surrendered and I'm telling you, I was so, so, so surprised,\" she said.Cyrus, whose hits include Flowers and Party in the U.S.A, previously married Australian actor Liam Hemsworth in 2018. The couple had been in a relationship for a decade but announced their divorce in 2019. Speaking to British Vogue in 2023, Cyrus said she and 27-year-old Morando met after being \"put on a blind date\". Morando is a drummer with LA-based band Liily. The band participated in NBC's Miley's New Year's Eve Party - hosted by Cyrus - in 2022, alongside musicians including Cyrus's godmother Dolly Parton and David Byrne.Holding up her ring, Cyrus told Good Morning America that Morando \"did good\" with the choice.\"Me and Max have been together for four years and it's very obvious the drastic amount of growth that I've had in those four years,\" she said.\"You want to have someone by your side that always tells you you can do it.\"The pop star's latest song, Dream as One, is featured in the latest Avatar instalment. She released her ninth album earlier this year but has said she has \"no desire\" to go on tour, saying she is put off by how hard it is to maintain sobriety and her mental health while on the road.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAmy WalkerandLaura GozziGetty ImagesPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukrainian officials are preparing to meet US negotiators, after high-stakes talks between the US and Russia over a plan to end the war in Ukraine failed to produce tangible results.Zelensky said a meeting would be arranged \"in the coming days\" once the US team had returned from Moscow.President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner spent almost five hours with Russia's Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday.Afterwards, Putin's adviser Yuri Ushakov said \"no compromise\" on ending the war had been found. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ subsequently accused Putin of \"wasting the world's time\".In a statement on Wednesday, Zelensky said Ukrainian officials would speak to the US either \"in person or by phone\".\"Right now, the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war,\" he continued in a statement on X, alongside a video. But he added that negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\".The US-Russia talks at the Kremlin followed days of US meetings with Ukrainian and European leaders, after concerns had been expressed that a peace deal was being hatched that was too slanted towards Russia's demands. \"Some of the US proposals look more or less acceptable, though they need to be discussed further\", Ushakov said, while adding that others had been openly criticised by Russia's leader.Although Ushakov did not elaborate further, at least two major points of contention remain between Moscow and Kyiv - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Reuters/Pool/SputnikPutin (R) and Yuri Ushakov took part in almost five hours of talks with the US envoys on TuesdayKyiv and its European partners believe that, even in the event of a peace deal, the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato.Russia is vehemently opposed to such a proposal, and Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Kyiv into the alliance.The prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Ushakov, a senior foreign policy adviser to Putin, implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to recent successes on the battlefield.Russian soldiers had \"helped make the assessments of our foreign partners regarding the paths to a peace settlement more appropriate,\" he said.Ahead of the US visit to the Kremlin, Putin was filmed in army fatigues at a Russian command post, being briefed by commanders claiming the conquest of the key strategic city of Pokrovsk, in eastern Ukraine, as well as other nearby settlements.Fighting in Pokrovsk is continuing and Russian forces do not control the whole city, but Russian officials clearly believe their message of military gains has been heard by the US. Russian forces have made some incremental advances in the east and appear to have stepped up their campaign in recent weeks. They seized about 701 sq km (270 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory in November, according to AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and they now control 19.3% of Ukrainian territory.The Kremlin on Wednesday said Putin was ready to keep meeting with the Americans \"as many times as needed\".But as Russian-American relations appear to grow more cordial, the gulf between Moscow and Europe widens.Putin has accused Europe of sabotaging Russia's relations with the US, of putting forward demands Moscow could not accept and of blocking the peace process. Shortly before meeting Witkoff and Kushner, Putin told a forum in Moscow that while he did not want conflict with Europe, he was \"ready for war\".ReutersEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has hailed a deal to end Russian imports of gas to the EU by 2027UK government officials rejected Putin's message as \"yet more Kremlin claptrap from a president who isn't serious about peace\".Nato foreign ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday and Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that it was positive that peace talks were taking place but Ukraine had to be put in \"the strongest position to keep the fight going\".Meanwhile, EU member states have reached a deal with members of the European Parliament to make Europe fully independent of Russian gas before the end of 2027.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen hailed \"the dawn of a new era\", under a deal that means long-term gas pipeline contracts with Russia will be banned from September 2027 and long-term contracts for liquefied natural gas will be banned from January 2027. \"We've chosen energy security and independence for Europe. No more blackmail. No more market manipulation by Putin. We stand strong with Ukraine,\" EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen said on Wednesday.The Commission is also proposing to raise €90bn for Ukraine to fund its military and basic services while Russia's war continues.The plan would either require Belgium to agree to a \"reparations loan\" using frozen Russian assets held in a financial institution in Brussels, or the money would be funded by international borrowing.Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko has welcomed the proposal, which would cover two-thirds of Ukraine's financing needs for the next two years.Belgium has resisted the plan to use frozen assets held on its territory, over concerns about legal repercussions from Moscow. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also opposed the idea, saying it would not act as a backstop for a reparations loan.The proposed loan is smaller than the planned €140bn loan initially planned and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said \"we support this and, of course, take Belgium's concerns seriously\".",

    "body": "15 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesPeople who have cosmetic filler injections in their face should be warned of the risk of a dangerous complication involving blocked arteries that can lead to skin loss and even blindness due to damaged blood flow, say experts. Researchers used ultrasound to study 100 cases of filler injections that had gone wrong.Clinics are now being advised to carry out ultrasounds before giving dermal fillers in the face, to avoid harming any nearby arteries.Lead researcher Dr Rosa Sigrist says that, although uncommon, such \"vascular occlusion\" events - where the filler is injected into or too close to blood vessels - can be devastating because they can cause tissue death and facial deformity if not treated.Dermal fillers are injectable substances, commonly used to target wrinkles and smooth or \"rejuvenate\" the skin.Sometimes they are used to contour or shape the nose or lips. Areas around the nose are particularly risky injection sites, says Dr Sigrist, because nasal blood vessels communicate with some very important parts of the head. Damage to these vessels can cause severe complications including skin damage, blindness and stroke, she explains. Dr Sigrist's team, from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, studied filler-related vascular complications in 100 patients across four radiology centers (two in Brazil, one in Colombia and one in Chile), one dermatology centre in the Netherlands and one plastic surgery centre in the US between May 2022 and April 2025. Her work will be presented at a medical conference - the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America - this week. In just under half the cases, ultrasound scans showed absent blood flow to small blood vessels that connect superficial arteries to deep ones in the face.And in a third of cases, blood flow was absent in major blood vessels. Rosa Maria Silveira Sigrist, M.D., and RSNAAn ultrasound scan of a patient's lip shows absent blood flow (black areas located at the top, middle of the picture) in a segment of an artery. Meanwhile, red shows blood flow towards the ultrasound probe, while blue shows flow away from it.To avoid complications in the first place, she advises clinics to use ultrasound to plan where to inject. If complications do arise, ultrasound can guide where to treat. \"If injectors are not guided by ultrasound, they treat based on where the clinical findings are and inject blindly,\" Dr. Sigrist says.\"But if we can see the ultrasound finding, we can target the exact place where the occlusion occurs.\" Rather than flooding the area with a drug called hyaluronidase to dissolve the filler, clinicians can do guided injections that use less hyaluronidase and provide better treatment results, she says. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says that the use of ultrasound is increasing, but is not routine or standard care yet.Ultrasound is non-invasive, does not use ionizing radiation and has no known harmful effects. Nora Nugent, president of BAAPS, said it was proving very useful in many areas of surgery and medical aesthetic procedures. \"Mapping out the location of blood vessels undoubtedly provides valuable information ahead of treatment. \"Risks like these from dermal fillers are one of the many reasons why we have been campaigning for a long time for increased regulation of aesthetic procedures and restricting the provision of medical procedures like injectable treatments to those who have medical training.\"The UK government has said it plans to bring in restrictions for cosmetic procedures. Under the proposals, only \"suitably qualified\" healthcare professionals would be able to deliver high-risk procedures such as Brazilian butt lifts.Clinics administering fillers and Botox would need to meet strict standards to obtain a licence.A public consultation will be published in early 2026, with views on the range of procedures which should be covered in the new restrictions. Parliament will then decide what to introduce. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterThe Liberal Democrats are calling for a 'Farm First' scheme to train graduates for careers in farming, aiming to prevent what they describe as a \"lost generation\" in the sector.The scheme would be similar to Teach First, a charity which trains graduates as teachers and places them in schools. The party estimates their proposal would cost £60m per year, funding two-year training placements for 1,000 trainees. It says the scheme could be paid for through money-raising measures including a windfall tax on big banks and increasing the Digital Services Tax, paid by big tech companies. A Labour spokesperson said the government was \"committed to supporting the farming sector\". \"We're investing billions in the sector through supportive programmes and schemes and working closely with the Institute for Agriculture to promote careers in farming.\"\"The Lib Dems had the opportunity to help farmers while in government but instead cut capital spending to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by a third and led the country into austerity.\"Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat's environment spokesperson, said his party was calling for \"a fundamental cultural shift in our attitude towards farming\".\"Our Farm First scheme would treat food security with the seriousness it deserves, finally giving young people the training and incentive they need to choose farming,\" he said.\"By ignoring this impending crisis and rural brain drain, they are severing the lifeline of our domestic food supply.\"Pointing to government figures suggesting that only 5% of farmers in the UK are under the age of 35, the party said urgent action was needed to encourage young people to the sector. The numbers, published in September, found that 40% of farmers were aged over 65 and 15% were under the age of 45. In September, an agricultural university said what it called the \"Clarkson effect\" had led to an 11% increase in applications for its farming course.Will Marsh, director of external relations at the Royal Agriculture University told the BBC Jeremy Clarkson's Amazon Prime show, documenting his efforts to run the Diddly Squat Farm had helped boost applications. \"When you watch the programme, you can see how rewarding that career is, you can see how complicated it is and how far-reaching it is,\" he said.The Liberal Democrats are also calling for more children to be taught about nutrition and food.\"Instilling an understanding of how food is produced from a young age, making better use of food grown locally and investing in agricultural training opportunities are key to future domestic food security and to tackling poverty,\" the party says. Earlier this year a senior executive at Marks & Spencer warned that the government's planned changes to inheritance tax would put off young people from working on a farm. \"We want to see a vibrant, viable farming structure where young people can come in and make a good living and be proud of what they do,\" he told the BBC.\"So being able to give greater surety, greater security is going to be key to viable farming structure going forward.\"The change - which has not yet come into force - would see tax charged on inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m. Some Labour MPs have questioned the move, with around 30 believed to have abstained on an initial vote on the tax.Markus Campbell-Savours, who represents the rural Cumbrian seat of Penrith and Solway, was suspended from the parliamentary party after voting against the plan.The government has argued the move is a fair way to raise money for public services.

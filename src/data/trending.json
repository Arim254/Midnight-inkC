    "body": "4 hours agoNick Eardley,Political CorrespondentandSue Mitchell,Investigations reporterGetty ImagesAsylum seekers will be banned from using taxis for medical appointments from February, the government has announced.It comes after a BBC investigation found some people had travelled long distances by taxi, with one  asylum seeker saying they went on a 250-mile journey to a GP, costing the Home Office £600.In response the government launched an urgent review into the use and cost of taxis to transfer asylum seekers from their hotels to appointments in September.Now, the government has confirmed it has spent an average of around £15.8 million per year on transport for asylum seekers.Earlier this year, BBC Radio 4's File on Four found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used, including the case of a 250-mile journey to a GP.And on Friday, one subcontractor told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said.But Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this was now going to change.She said: \"I am ending the unrestricted use of taxis by asylum seekers for hospital appointments, authorising them only in the most exceptional circumstances.\"I will continue to root out waste as we close every single asylum hotel.\"She said the government had inherited expensive Conservative contracts.Instead of taxis, ministers want asylum seekers to use alternatives like public transport.There will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy related needs. These will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules.There are other circumstances in which taxis can be used - such as moving between accommodation - but ministers are reviewing the wider use of taxis for asylum seekers and want to extend the principle that they are only used in exceptional circumstances with support evidence.Ministers have pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the next election. They want to increase the use of alternative accommodation, such as large military sites.But figures earlier this week showed 36,273 people were still living in asylum hotels in the UK – an increase compared to June.There has also been criticism of the growing cost of running asylum accommodation – which has gone up significantly since the contracts were signed.When the home secretary was asked if the government was prepared to exercise break clauses in contracts with providers in a BBC interview earlier this year, Mahmood said she would explore all options.But doing so would mean alternative accommodation needs to be found.The government has also announced significant changes to overhaul the asylum system – with refugee status becoming temporary and the ending of guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers.The government has recovered £74m since it came to power – but the chair of the home affairs select committee said that was only a start.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"The issue is that Labour can't get a grip on the illegal immigration crisis.\"As Labour hammer working people with £26 billion in tax rises, they have allowed costs for illegal arrivals to spiral because Labour don't have the backbone to take the tough decisions needed. Namely, deporting all illegal arrivals and leaving the ECHR. Until that happens, the bills will keep mounting.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoTheo Leggett,International business correspondentandYang Tian,BBC NewsThousands of Airbus planes have been grounded after it was discovered that intense solar radiation could interfere with onboard flight control computers, leading to delays around the world.Around 6,000 A320 planes are thought to be affected, half the European firm's global fleet, but it is understood most will be able to fly again after undergoing a quick software update.The UK's aviation regulator said there would be \"some disruption and cancellations to flights\" though the impact at airports appears to be limited.Airbus said it discovered the issue after an investigation into an incident in which a plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude in October.The JetBlue Airways flight made an emergency landing in Florida after at least 15 people were injured.Live updates on this storyAs well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the vulnerability also impacts the A318, A319 and the A321 models.It is understood that on around 5,100 Airbus planes, the issue can be addressed using a relatively simple software update which would typically take about three hours.However, the remaining 900 aircraft, which are older versions, will need to have onboard computers physically replaced, and will not be allowed to carry passengers again until the job has been completed. The length of time that takes will depend on the availability of replacement computers.Airbus said it acknowledged this will lead to \"operational disruption to passengers and customers\" and has apologised.Aviation analyst Sally Gethin told BBC News the situation is \"very much out of the ordinary\", saying the disruption to passengers will depend on the \"different approaches\" airlines take to upgrade their software.\"I understand that Lufthansa is saying it may take its aircraft out of service to do this, in other cases airlines are saying that it shouldn't have much of an impact at all,\" she said.In the UK, disruption at airports has been limited so far. London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations.The extent of the disruption varies between airlines: British Airways is understood not be be heavily impacted by the issue, while Wizz Air and Air India said it was undertaking the updates already.Easyjet said said it was \"expecting this to result in some disruption\" but later added it had started and \"already completed the software update on many aircraft\" and was planning a full service on Saturday.In the US, the software issue emerged on the same weekend as Thanksgiving, one of the busiest travel periods of the year.American Airlines said 340 of its planes were affected and that it expected \"some operational delays\", but added the vast majority of updates would be completed on Friday or Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be \"limited\".In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights after confirming around a third of its fleet was impacted.Tim Johnson, policy director at the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, said the notice from Airbus \"unfortunately may mean there is some disruption, some delays or cancellations over the coming days\".He added that aviation was still \"one of the safest forms of transport\" due to the rigorous maintenance programs airlines have in place, and described the mass-grounding of flights as a \"a very rare event\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said \"the impact on UK airlines seems limited\", adding: \"It is heartening this issue has been identified and will be addressed so swiftly, demonstrating the high aviation safety standards globally.\"The problem identified with A320 aircrafts relates to a piece of computing software which calculates a plane's elevation. Airbus discovered that at high altitudes its data could be corrupted by intense radiation released by periodically by the sun. That led to the October incident in which an aircraft suddenly lost altitude - though the manufacturer said this was the only time an incident of its kind had occurred. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive, ordering the problem be addressed before each plane can carry passengers again.They will be allowed to make so-called \"ferry flights\", without passengers, in order to reach a maintenance facility.The A320 family are what is known as \"fly by wire\" planes. This means there is no direct mechanical link between the controls in the cockpit and the parts of the aircraft that actually govern flight, with the pilot's actions processed by a computer.",

    "body": "9 hours agoImogen FoulkesGeneva CorrespondentThe United Nations committee on torture says there is evidence that Israel is operating a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\". The committee regularly reviews the records of all countries which have signed the convention against torture, taking testimony from their governments, and from human rights groups.During Israel's review both Israeli and Palestinian rights groups gave harrowing details about conditions in Israeli detention centres. It is alleged that thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel since the Hamas attacks of October 7th 2023. Under Israel's laws on administrative detention and on Unlawful Combatants – suspects who cannot be classed as prisoner of war - they can be held for long periods without access to a lawyer or family members. Many Palestinian families say they have waited months to even find out that a loved has been detained, amounting, the UN committee said, to \"enforced disappearance\".The committee was particularly critical of Israel's reported use of the Unlawful Combatants law to detain whole groups of Palestinians, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.But it is the reported conditions in detention which make the grimmest reading in the committee's conclusions, published today. Palestinians, the evidence suggests, are regularly deprived of food and water, and subjected to severe beatings, attacks by dogs, electrocution, water boarding, and sexual violence. Some are allegedly permanently shackled, denied access to a toilet, and forced to wear diapers.The committee concluded that such treatment \"amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity\". It said evidence of a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\" by Israel was one of the acts which constitute the crime of genocide under international law. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.One committee member, Peter Vedel Kessing of Denmark, said he and his colleagues were \"deeply appalled\" by what they heard. Committee members also said they were very concerned at the lack of investigations or prosecutions into allegations of torture. They called on Israel to launch independent investigations, and to ensure those responsible, including senior military officers, are held accountable.Israel, which has long accused the UN of bias against it, did not comment publicly today on the committee's findings, but during the committee hearings its ambassador, Daniel Meron, described the allegations of torture as \"disinformation\". He said that Israel was \"committed to upholding its obligations in line with our moral values and principles, even in the face of the challenges posed by a terrorist organisation\".In its conclusions, the UN committee took care to unequivocally condemn the Hamas attack of October 2023, and acknowledged the security challenges Israel faces. But it also warned that violations of international law by one side did not justify the other side doing the same. Under the convention, to which Israel is a party, the prohibition on torture is absolute: it is not allowed under any circumstances.Israel's domestic law is less clear however, suggesting that the convention only applies to Israeli territory, and not to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank – an interpretation that many international lawyers dispute.The findings come amid increasing pressure on Israel over its human rights record. On Friday in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Office said the killing by Israeli soldiers of two Palestinians in the West Bank looked like a \"summary execution\". Video of the killing showed the two men with their hands up, apparently surrendering to Israeli forces.And UN aid agencies say conditions for people in the Gaza strip remain dire, despite the ceasefire. Thousands of families are facing the winter cold and rain in tents, they warn, not enough aid supplies are getting in, and Israeli air strikes against what Israel says are Hamas targets continue.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the ex-president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post on Friday, congratulating the former president on the pardon, saying he was \"treated very harshly and unfairly\".Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.In the same post, Trump also said he supported conservative candidate Tito Asfura in the upcoming general election in the Central American country on Sunday. Hernández, a member of the National Party who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the United States in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to traffic hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. He was convicted by a New York jury two years later. Polls show the Honduran election remains a toss-up between Asfura, who is the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and now leader of the National Party, Rixi Moncada, the former defence minister with the ruling leftist LIBRE Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla in his Friday post, writing that Nasralla is \"a boderline Communist\" who is only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura. Trump in his post on Friday called Asfura a candidate that is \"standing up for democracy\" and fighting against Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration has accused Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as rigged by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.President Trump on Friday accused Maduro \"and his narcoterrorists\" of taking over Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro of the LIBRE Party, who had forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a cooperative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with the United States. Her country also  hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. In August, the US launched a counternarcotics operation targeting boats it accuses of transporting drugs from Venezuela to America. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on suspected vessels since.According to US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" is to remove \"narcoterrorists\" from the Western Hemisphere. But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterReutersDowning Street has denied Rachel Reeves misled the public about the state of the public finances ahead of this week's Budget.In the run-up to Wednesday's statement, the chancellor repeatedly talked about a downgrade to the UK's predicted economic productivity that would make it hard for her to meet her spending rules.But in a letter to MPs sent on Friday, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revealed a forecast of higher wages - which she had not mentioned - would help her meet the rules.The Conservatives have accused Reeves of giving an overly pessimistic impression of the public finances as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes.Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the letter showed Reeves had \"lied to the public\" and should be sacked.In a letter to the Commons Treasury select committee, OBR chairman Richard Hughes revealed that he told the chancellor on 17 September that the public finances were in better shape than widely thought.The letter also reveals that on the 31 October, the OBR told the Treasury it was on course to meet its main rule of not borrowing for day-to-day spending, albeit by £4.2bn, less than the £9.9bn in \"headroom\" she had left herself last year.On 4 November, Reeves used a rare pre-Budget speech in Downing Street to warn the UK's productivity was weaker \"than previously thought\" and that \"has consequences for the public finances too, in lower tax receipts.\"Then, on 10 November, she told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"These comments, along with her speech, fuelled speculation she needed to raise significant sums to meet her fiscal rules.However, the Office for Budget Responsibility has now confirmed that although it did indeed downgrade productivity, it also predicted this would be \"offset\" by higher wages increasing the government's tax revenues.That meant she had a surplus to meet both of her fiscal rules.A spokesperson for the Treasury said:\"We are not going to get into the OBR's processes or speculate on how that relates to the internal decision‑making in the build‑up to a Budget, but the Chancellor made her choices to cut the cost of living, cut hospital waiting lists and double headroom to cut the cost of our debt.\"Budget 2025But Reeves continued to indicate that she was likely to increase income tax rates.In her Downing Street press conference, she said: \"It is already clear that the productivity performance…is weaker than previously thought.\"She added: \"What I want people to understand ahead of that Budget, is the circumstances we face.\"In the end, Reeves backed away from hiking income tax rates, although her Budget still contained £26bn of tax rises, including by freezing income tax thresholds for a further three years, dragging more people into higher tax bands over time.Conservative shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said that while Reeves had repeatedly talked about the productivity downgrade, she had \"failed to mention\" the offsetting effect of higher wages on the forecast.He added: \"It was all a smokescreen. Labour knew all along that they did not need to raise taxes and break their promises.\"It appears the country was deliberately misled to try to explain away Labour's decision to spend billions more on welfare.\"Asked whether Reeves had misled the public and the financial markets, the PM's spokesperson said: \"I don't accept that.\" He added: \"As she [Reeves] set out in the speech that she gave here (Downing Street), she talked about the challenges the country was facing and she set out her decisions incredibly clearly at the Budget.\"He added the government had increased the headroom for the Treasury to meet the fiscal rules, which would creates \"certainty and stability for business\".",

The discovery was made when staff went to feed the herd of Irish Red Deer,\" Fingal County Council said in a statement.The stag, who was eight years old, was one of two in the herd.The killing of the stag is also under investigation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.'He was a big favourite with the public'The Mayor of Fingal, councillor Tom O'Leary, condemned the killing.He said: \"I have visited this park area with my granddaughters who really enjoyed meeting the stag and deer.  A wonderful animal to behold close up. \"It's truly shocking that someone would carry out this act,\" he said.\"I am appealing to anybody with information to contact the gardaí or the National Parks and Wildlife Service. It is illegal to kill deer without a licence and I hope that the perpetrators can be brought to justice.\"Ivan Smith, foreman of Works at Newbridge House and Traditional Farm, said the team was \"absolutely shocked\" by the incident.\"He was a lovely stag with a beautiful pair of antlers and was a big favourite with the public who walk through the park.\"'Unnecessary killing'Ireland's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) have expressed \"horror\" at the attack.\"The unnecessary killing of such a majestic creature for, what appears to be, a trophy is appalling,\" Pat Watt of the NSPCA said.\"It is the NSPCA's hopes that the perpetrator/s will be caught and prosecuted with the full force of the legal system relating to this type of crime. Animal abuse is not acceptable in any situations.\"'Disgusted and appalled'Councillor for the area Eoghan Dockrell told BBC News NI that he was \"in shock\".\"The one common response to anyone I've spoken to in the community is they're disgusted and appalled,\" he said.He added that he has \"an awful lot of sympathy for the staff members who would have had to come upon that scene and how distressing that must have been\".\"I have been in touch with council officials to see if they'd review security procedures in the park and while a lot of patrols are being carried out during the day, we're going to see if we can increase patrols at night time,\" he said.Anyone who has any information should report it to National Parks and Wildlife Service, Fingal County Council or their local Garda Station.Gardaí (Irish police) also said they wish to speak with anyone who has footage, including dashcam, from between 00:00 and 02:30 local time on Thursday on the R126 road, Cobbe's Lane and Turvey Avenue, around Newbridge Demense, to make it available.",

    "body": "4 hours agoThe fallout over the Budget continues to dominate the front pages of Saturday's papers. \"Reeves on the brink over tax lies\" says the Daily Telegraph, as it reports Chancellor Rachel Reeves is being accused of misleading the public over the state of the country's public finances. The paper says the chancellor is fighting for her job after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revealed a forecast of higher wages - which she had not mentioned - would help her meet spending rules.\"'Liar' Reeves must go now\" is the Daily Mail's take. The paper quotes calls from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch for the chancellor to be sacked, saying she had \"lied to the public to justify record tax hikes\". Downing Street has denied the chancellor misled the public about the state of the public finances ahead of the Budget.The Independent follows with \"Reeves 'misled the public' over fake fiscal black hole\", focusing on the OBR telling the chancellor that instead of a deficit, she had a surplus of £4.2bn.The Sun cites the \"fury\" at Reeves over the revelations, dubbing her \"Chancer of the Exchequer\".The i paper shifts its focus to the verdict from voters on the Budget, summing it up as \"nice ideas but we will be poorer\". The paper says its own polling shows Reeves's Budget is \"the least popular since Liz Truss era\" but voters do like some measures, including higher gambling taxes and the minimum wage hike.Daily Express highlights the Budget's impact on pensioners, saying an extra 200,000 are set to lose their winter fuel payments. The paper cites documents published on a government website that reveal 2.2m pensioners are about to be denied the benefit, with experts warning that number \"will only go up\".The hospitality industry is also facing a \"stealth tax\" after the Budget, according to the Times. The paper says a separate government agency revealed a much higher assessment of the value of the buildings used to calculate business rates, which means the levy \"will rise significantly next year\" for the average high street business.The new \"mansion tax\" leads the Financial Times. Wealthy homeowners are rushing to \"sidestep\" Reeves' council tax surcharge by agreeing to asking prices below the thresholds set out in the Budget, the paper says. Elsewhere, the \"crisis in Kyiv\" takes the top picture spot, showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his top aid Andriy Yermark, who resigned yesterday after anti corruption raids.The chancellor is calling on Britain's wealthy to shoulder the burden of paying to fix the country's \"creaky\" public services, reports the Guardian. In an interview with the paper, Reeves says her decision to increase taxes by £26bn aims to help improve schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, and that she made \"fair and necessary choices\".Meanwhile in entertainment news, the Daily Mirror features an interview with TV host Ruth Langsford opening up about her split from fellow broadcaster Eamonn Holmes.Finally, the Daily Star splashes their front page with football star Wayne Rooney's strong opinions about TV clown Mr Tumble. According to the paper, Rooney jokes about his \"hate\" for the character, saying \"after four children, he's why I got the snip\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoBBCCameron Barracks is a 140-year-old army recruitment and training baseThe Home Office has delayed plans to house asylum seekers at two military sites in East Sussex and the Scottish Highlands.About 540 men were due to be sent to Crowborough army training camp and another 300 men to Cameron Barracks in Inverness.The UK government originally wanted to move asylum seekers by early December as part of drive to close asylum hotels.The Home Office said it wanted to avoid rushed plans leading to \"unsafe and chaotic situations\". It said it would proceed when facilities were \"fully operational and safe\".Crowborough and Cameron Barracks were both earmarked earlier this year as potential temporary asylum seeker accommodation.In East Sussex, the local authority Wealden District Council passed a motion formally opposing the Crowborough proposal.Highland Council also raised concerns over the scale of the barracks plans and pressures on local services.The 140-year-old base, near Inverness city centre, was previously used to house families fleeing Afghanistan.Charlie Rose/BBCThe Home Office plans to house 540 male asylum seekers at the Crowborough siteThe Home Office said it still planned to \"accelerate\" the movement of people.  But it said it would not do so at the expense of the safety of local communities.A spokesperson added: \"We are furious at the level of illegal migrants and asylum hotels. \"Moving to large military sites is an important part of our reforms to tackle remove the incentives that draw illegal migrants to Britain.\"We are continuing to accelerate plans to move people into Cameron Barracks, when it is fully operational and safe.\"We will continue to work closely with local representatives and authorities throughout this transition.\"PA MediaPeople board a small boat in Gravelines, France.Widespread protests against the housing of asylum seekers in hotels exploded across the UK in the summer.In Scotland, protests were held outside hotels housing asylum seekers in Perth and Aberdeenshire as well as Falkirk during August.A brick was thrown through the window of the Cladhan Hotel in Falkirk in September, months after hundreds of pro and anti-immigration protesters held rival demonstrations outside.The Park Hotel in the town was also targeted after a former resident, Sadeq Nikzad, was sentenced to nine years in jail for the rape of a 15-year-old girl.Highland Council officials recommended writing to the Home Office to seek \"urgent clarity\" on the proposals at the start of November.The local authority previously said that about 60 people per week could arrive at the barracks from the second week of December.They said the plan was to use the site for 12 months, before it reverted back to being an army base.But a report also raised concerns over the scale of the proposal, the potential of protests and the barracks becoming a target for people \"deliberately wishing to incite violence and hatred\".A spokesperson for the council said: \"A multi-agency partnership involving the council, NHS Highland, Police Scotland, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the Scottish government, Cosla, and the Home Office is now meeting weekly to plan for the arrival of asylum seekers and learn from best practice.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentChancellor Rachel Reeves has said that people whose only income comes from the state pension will not have to pay tax.The state pension is set to rise above the normal level for paying tax in April 2027, due to increases in payments and tax thresholds being frozen.But Reeves has confirmed that anyone who receives the state pension but no other income will not have to pay income tax before 2030.The announcement has raised questions over the winners and losers of such a policy. Most pensioners have other pension payments which means they already pay tax, and experts say the move could add further complexity to the system.Anyone solely receiving the new flat-rate state pension - for those who reached state pension age after April 2016 - will get £12,547.60 next year.That is just below the income tax threshold of £12,570. That threshold is frozen and highly likely to be breached by the state pension from April 2027, meaning the portion of pension income over this threshold would be taxed.Small tax sums would normally be collected by the Simple Assessment process where HM Revenue and Customs does all the calculations and sends the pensioner a tax demand at the end of the year.But the chancellor said in her speech that, if this was the only source of income people had, then they would not face the administrative hassle.She later told Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, that \"in this Parliament, they won't have to pay the tax\".The Conservatives made a similar pledge during the last general election campaign.About three-quarters of pensioners already pay income tax because they have additional income to the state pension.They include 2.5 million pensioners - including widows and widowers - whose state pension operates under the pre-2016 system. They receive a basic pension and a SERPS pension, which means they pay tax.Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, also highlights those with a very small private pension who would have to pay tax.Workers on the same income as the level of state pension would also be taxed, while pensioners would not be.\"There is a real risk that pensioners on the new system will be more favourably treated,\" Mr Webb said.\"There is no costing for this policy in the Budget documents which suggests that it is still very much an idea rather than a firm plan.  But it will be incredibly difficult for the Treasury to come up with something that is workable and fair.\"Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at investment platform AJ Bell, said: \"Collecting the little bits of tax owed from millions of pensioners was always going to be an administrative headache for the government. \"It's no wonder they've put their tax collecting thinking caps on to find ways to avoid it, but we will have to wait and see what process they come up with and whether it will indeed make pensioners' lives simpler.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoGetty ImagesThe UK's National Screening Committee has recommended that only a very small group of men at high risk of prostate cancer should be screened for the disease.There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men.But there has been some energetic campaigning for change by high-profile figures, including Sir Chris Hoy, who has terminal prostate cancer, and Lord David Cameron, who recently revealed he'd been treated for it.The expert advice will now be consulted on for the next three months, before the screening committee gives its final recommendations to governments in the four nations of the UK in March.What is screening?Screening is when people are invited for a test to look for disease despite them having no symptoms.Examples include women being invited for a mammogram to look for breast cancer or the at-home bowel cancer test that is posted to your home every two years over the age of 50.The idea is to catch cancer before someone starts to get ill and when it can still be treated.What was recommended today?Experts say there is no justification for screening the large majority of men for prostate cancer.They looked at all the available evidence and concluded that screening was only suitable for:men with a genetic risk of prostate cancer (with a confirmed BRCA gene variant)The advice says this group should be screened every two years between the ages of 45 and 61.This means no screening is recommended for other high-risk groups of men such as:black menmen with a family history of prostate cancerWhy did they come to that conclusion?The UK National Screening Committee said a mass screening programme for prostate cancer was likely to cause more harm than good.Tests for the disease are unreliable, and can lead to men being treated for a slow-growing cancer that isn't going to cause them any harm. The treatment itself can cause incontinence and impotence, which can significantly affect quality of life.Balanced against that, finding cancers early and treating them can save lives. But it's difficult for doctors to work out which cancers are going to be aggressive and spread, which means men can be treated unnecessarily.The committe said the number of lives saved by screening does not outweigh its harmful effects on healthy men.Why not screen all high-risk men?Many predicted that all men at high risk of the disease were likely to be included in new screening plans.But the committee stopped short of that recommendation.Despite black men having twice the risk of prostate cancer, it said there should be no screening for black men due to \"uncertainties\" around its impact, and a lack of evidence from clinical trials in these men. It also recommended no screening for men with a family history of the disease, for the same reason - too many cancers would be overdiagnosed and overtreated.But men with specific genetic mutations - called BRCA variants - develop faster-growing and aggressive cancers at an earlier age, making screening for them justified.Treating these cancers earlier is more likely to benefit those men and outweigh the potential harm from unnecessary treatment, compared to men in the general population, the experts said.How do you test for BRCA variant?A genetic test is needed which looks for a mutation of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes.These gene variants can affect men and women, increasing the risk of a range of cancers, including prostate, breast and ovarian cancer.Around three in 1,000 men have BRCA variants, but many will be unaware unless they have family members that are known carriers, and then had it confirmed with a test.Experts say more genetic tests will need to be offered to high-risk men in future, in order to work out how many are affected.How many men get prostate cancer?Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men.Some 55,000 men are diagnosed with the disease each year, and 12,000 men die from it in annually in the UK.Is this the final word on screening?No, a three-month consultation on the recommendations starts today.The committee will meet again after that and give its final advice to ministers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.They will then have to make their own individual decision on prostate screening. Wes Streeting, Health Secretary in England, says he wants screening in place but only if it's \"backed by evidence\". He said he would examine the evidence \"thoroughly\" ahead of his final decision in March.",

    "body": "Zelensky's top adviser resigns after Ukrainian anti-corruption raid on his home10 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor andJaroslav LukivReutersYermak has for years been Zelensky's closest aide and has played a key role in talks towards ending the warUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Yermak, a towering figure with enormous political influence, has been Zelensky's closest adviser throughout Russia's full-scale war, but has come under increasing pressure over an escalating scandal - even though he is not accused of any wrongdoing.Zelensky had recently appointed him to head crucial negotiations, with US President Donald Trump leading a new drive to end the Russia-Ukraine war.In a stark address to the nation outside his presidential office, Zelensky called for unity, warning: \"We risk losing everything: ourselves, Ukraine, our future.\"The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine for weeks, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position with the US at a delicate time.Ukraine, backed by its European allies, has sought to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Early on Friday Ukraine's two anti-corruption agencies raided Yermak's apartment in Kyiv's government quarters and the chief of staff said on social media that \"from my side there is full co-operation\".\"I'm grateful to Andriy that Ukraine's position on the negotiating track was always presented as required: it was always a patriotic position,\" Ukraine's president said during his video address in Kyiv.Zelensky said he would start consultations on Saturday on who would replace Yermak as his top adviser: \"When all the attention is focused on diplomacy and the defence in a war, inner strength is required.\"\"Russia wants Ukraine to make mistakes – there won't be any mistakes from our side. Our work continues, our fight continues. We have no right... to retreat, to quarrel [among ourselves].\"Yermak's departure from Ukraine's leading circle will come as a major blow for Zelensky, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as part of Trump's draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week and Russia's Vladimir Putin said on Friday he backed a Hungarian offer to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest.Putin has continued to promote Russia's maximalist demands to bring an end to the war. He claimed on Thursday that Russian forces had the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from the entire eastern Donbas region, including several strategically important cities under Ukrainian control.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Putin said.Hours before the raid on his flat, Yermak continued to explain his government's position as it comes under US pressure to make territorial concessions to Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\"As long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory,\" Yermak told The Atlantic website.Yermak, 54, admitted during his interview he was under \"enormous\" pressure to stand down, adding \"the case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\".AFP via Getty ImagesEarlier this week, Yermak took part in talks in Geneva with US Secretary of State Marco RubioUkraine's anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) did not explain why they searched his flat.In the past few weeks investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Russian officials involved in Trump's draft peace plan have talked up the corruption claims, which have alarmed European Union allies. Ukraine is a candidate to join the EU and a report earlier this month highlighted doubts over \"commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\".Earlier this year Zelensky sought to curb the powers of the two anti-corruption agencies, but he was forced to backtrack almost immediately after widespread protests and objections from Kyiv's Western allies.Zelensky has already fired Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and several suspects have been detained in the burgeoning corruption scandal that has outraged public opinion because of allegations that money was diverted from key infrastructure projects vital for safeguarding Ukrainian power supplies.As winter starts in Ukraine, Russian attacks have already badly damaged its energy infrastructure and Ukrainians across the country have had to cope with only a few hours of electricity a day.One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has left the country in the wake of the corruption allegations.Mindich was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.In recent weeks Andriy Yermak's popularity has nose-dived and MPs from all parties, including his own, have been calling for his sacking, initially for what they saw as his inflated power for an unelected official, but more recently, the burgeoning corruption scandal.Recent polling suggested 70% of the public wanted him to resign.Zelensky and his now-former chief of staff became friends about 14 years ago, while the future president was a senior media executive and Yermak worked for him as a lawyer. Yermak was made chief of staff a year after Zelensky was elected president in 2019.On the first night of Russia's invasion, they appeared together with colleagues delivering a defiant video message outside the presidential office on Kyiv's Bankova Street, vowing to stay and fight.\"We are all here,\" Zelensky told Ukrainians. \"Our soldiers are here, the citizens are here and we are all here. We are defending our independence, and that's how it will continue.\"",

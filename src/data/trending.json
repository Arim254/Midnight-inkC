As it attempts to drive off, one of the agents points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. \nWith the Trump administration characterising the incident as “domestic terrorism”, alleging Renee Good had “harassed” officers all day prior to the shooting, the mayor of Minneapolis has labelled this account “bullshit” and called on immigration officers to get out of the city. The governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, is calling for a full investigation but says a fair outcome will be difficult because \"people in positions of power\" - naming Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem - have \"already passed judgement\". Walz says they've shared information that he says is \"verifiably false\" and \"inaccurate\" and made assumptions about Renee Good's character and actions ahead of the shooting.\nIn today’s episode, Justin, Sarah and Marianna discuss the reasons why Americans can’t agree on what happened in the videos posted to social media, and reflect on whether the shooting has the capacity to lead to a larger protest movement across the nation. And, as recent polling suggests more Americans are growing dissatisfied with some of the tactics used by ICE, we ask what it would take to change Donald Trump’s mind on his flagship deportations policy.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "12 hours agoJiyar GolBBC News PersianTehran has witnessed its largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, as protests swept through dozens of districts across the capital and its wider metropolitan area of nearly 16 million people. For several hours there on Thursday night, security forces appeared unusually restrained. In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back.That restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story.According to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago. BBC Persian's verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic \"will not back down in the face of vandals\". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage. Referring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings \"just to please the president of the United States\".Following the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran's leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran's nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. It is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation.President Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime's calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed.In a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would \"get hit very hard\" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to \"stampedes\", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been \"told very strongly\" where the red lines lay.It is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime's response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city.Outside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal.During the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests.Historically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes. In more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force.Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as \"legitimate protests,\" but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency. The current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.",

    "body": "Man jailed for making woman have sex with strangers15 hours agoClare Wordenat Norwich Crown CourtNorfolk PoliceProsecutors said more than 100 men were involved in the abuse which was photographed and filmed by Rodney JohnstonA man who coerced a woman into having sex with more than 100 strangers over three decades has been jailed for a minimum term of 16 years. Rodney Johnston threatened the woman if she did not comply with his demands to engage in a range of sex acts with men at secluded countryside locations as well as in cars and in hotels, the court has heard.The 67-year-old, from Starston in Norfolk, was found guilty after a trial in September, which also heard he photographed and filmed the abuse.Sentencing him to life in prison at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Alice Robinson said the victim's impact statement was \"harrowing\" and showed \"the severe and lifelong impact\" of the abuse. Police found some 30,000 images and videos documenting the abuse.The court heard the coercion involved physical and verbal threats.'Rape in all but name'The judge said the victim was forced to \"go out\" several times a week. \"Going out became a byword for her being raped by strangers. This is rape in all but name,\" said the judge.Robinson said she believed Johnston would remain a danger to the victim for the rest of his life.  In a police statement released after sentencing, the woman said she had been left feeling \"used\" and \"terrified\" by the abuse. She said: \"I had no voice, no choice.\"I feel anxious about the future, but for the first time in decades I am free.\"Johnston was found guilty of multiple offences dating between 1994 and 2024, including:three counts of procuring a woman to have sexual intercourse by threats or intimidationtwo counts of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consentone count of intimidation of a witnessThroughout the seven-week trial, Johnston denied all the charges and claimed the acts were consensual.However, police said evidence proved the woman's account that she was not a willing participant and had been coerced and exploited.He made connections through adult social networks and sent out bulk text messages to advertise times and places where men could have sex with the woman.Norfolk Police said he claimed many of these messages were him living out \"a fantasy\" and dismissed them as \"banter\".However, thousands of other messages and images, including messages the victim sent to a friend detailing the abuse, supported her account, detectives said.In a statement, the victim said Johnston \"took her out\" up to five nights a week to hotels or outdoor locations, despite insisting she did not want to go.She said she was disgusted afterwards and was threatened or punished if Johnston felt she was not being co-operative.'Disturbing abuse'Police said Johnston caused further distress to his victim when he broke the conditions of his bail, following his arrest in July 2024.Senior investigating officer Duncan Woodhams said the sentence was \"the result of painstaking work due to the sheer volume of evidence involved, and of course the courage of the victim telling us about what she endured\". \"We're grateful for her trust in us, allowing us to present the full scale of Johnston's prolonged, disturbing and truly awful abuse,\" he said.\"Our focus will now shift to establishing if any further offences have been committed and if so we'll conduct a thorough investigation to identify those responsible and do everything we can to bring them to justice.\" If you have been affected by this story or would like support then you can find organisations which offer help and information at the BBC Action Line.Related internet links",

    "body": "4 hours agoA number of the papers have splashed on the ongoing demonstrations across Iran, which began two weeks ago in response to the nation's economic woes. \"Regime teeters in Tehran\" reads the headline of the Times, leading on remarks from US President Donald Trump, after he told Fox News that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was \"looking to flee the country\".The Guardian says that Iran is preparing for \"violent clashes\" as tensions continue to escalate, pairing its leading story with a photo of a protester gesticulating in front of a burning building in Tehran. Khamenei has warned that authorities will \"not back down\", which the paper says could set the stage for an \"intensified violent crackdown\" on the second day of a national internet shutdown.\"Tehran hardens crackdown on protesters 'working for Trump'\" reads the weekend edition of the Financial Times. Iranian officials have said that protesters will receive the maximum punishment, with diplomats concerned that the \"cover of the internet blackout\" could be used to suppress the demonstrations. The paper says that the protests \"present the biggest domestic threat to the regime in several years\". The Duke of Sussex will ask King Charles III to open the Invictus Games in Birmingham next year, according to the Sun. Founded by Prince Harry in 2014, the games sees injured military personnel and veterans from around the world compete in a range of sports every two years. A source told the paper that the 2027 iteration of the event would be a brilliant chance for the pair to \"come together\".Catherine, Princess of Wales, is pictured in the English countryside on the front page of the Mirror, after she released a new video to mark her 44th birthday. In the footage, the princess said she was \"deeply grateful\" for the healing power of Mother Nature, as she reflected on \"what it means to be alive\".\"Kate's 'deeply grateful' for nature's healing power\" reads the Express, pointing towards Catherine's ongoing \"cancer recovery\".The shadow secretary of state for justice, Robert Jenrick, has penned a piece for the Saturday edition of the Telegraph, declaring that police are \"giving in to Islamists because it is too challenging to confront them\". His remarks come as the Labour government prepares a new official definition of Islamophobia, which free speech campaigners claim could prevent legitimate criticism of the religion.The i Weekend says that the Home Office is set to start evicting asylum seekers from hotels, ahead of new legislation planned for the spring.The Mail suggests that thousands of Britons have been prescribed \"super-strength cannabis\" as a treatment for anxiety and depression. The paper found that specialist pharmacies had referred patients to \"almost 10,000 different products\" via a \"shocking loophole\".\"Loot Littler\" announces the Star, after darts champion Luke Littler, 18, signed a historic sponsorship deal worth a reported £20m.

    "body": "Elon Musk has said that critics of his social media site X are looking for \"any excuse for censorship\", amid reports that X's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok was creating non-consensual sexualised images of people, including children. Ofcom says it is conducting an urgent assessment of X in response, which has been backed by Technology Secretary Liz Kendall. She described the sexual manipulation of images of women and children as \"despicable and abhorrent\", adding that she would expect to see an update from Ofcom in \"days\".X has now limited the use of AI image function to those who pay a monthly fee, a change dubbed by Downing Street as \"insulting\" to victims of sexual violence.The BBC has seen several examples of the free AI tool undressing women and putting them in sexual situations without their consent.Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk's children, told BBC Newshour that Grok had generated sexualised photos of her as a child. The conservative influencer said her image had been \"stripped\" to appear \"basically nude, bent over\", despite her telling Grok that she did not consent to the sexualised images.St Clair, who filed a lawsuit against Musk last year seeking sole custody of their child, accused the social media site of \"not taking enough action\" to tackle illegal content, including child sexual abuse imagery. \"This could be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" she said.As of Friday morning, Grok was telling users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\", adding users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We urgently made contact [with X] on Monday and set a firm deadline of today [Friday] to explain themselves, to which we have received a response.\"\"We're now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly.\"Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping X raise money or be accessed in the UK - should the firm refuse to comply.Kendall has said that Ofcom will have the government's full support if it makes the decision to block X in the UK.The use of Grok to generate non-consensual sexualised images has been condemned by politicians on all sides: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling it \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said it was \"horrible in every way\" and that X \"needs to go further\" than the changes it had made to Grok on Friday, but he added that banning the platform would be an attack on free speech The Liberal Democrats called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site was investigated.",

    "body": "'Unprecedented' numbers seeking debt help post-Christmas, say charities4 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesDebt charities say they are receiving an influx of calls as people worry their financial situation has slipped towards becoming unmanageable.The first weeks of January are usually the busiest time of year for helplines following a particularly expensive period.Advice charity StepChange said Monday was busier than any single day last year, and credit counselling service Money Wellness said a fifth of those accessing its services at the turn of the year did so between 22:00 and 03:00.Dave Murphy is working his way out of debt and said demands from creditors could have become overwhelming, but he urged anyone struggling to ensure they asked for help - for their financial and mental wellbeing.Money Wellness, which runs free debt and money advice services, said thousands of people had accessed its services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Expanded assistance online allows people to increasingly find information outside of normal hours - including overnight.Sebrina McCullough, its head of advice, said: \"The numbers we're seeing over Christmas and New Year are unprecedented.\"People often feel pressure to celebrate the holidays, even when money is tight, and our data shows many are turning to us late at night when they feel most anxious.\"Pressure of priority billsStepChange's website had 3,958 visitors on Christmas Day, and 15,401 on New Year's Eve and 1 January combined.Many may have simply been exploring their options, but calls came in thick and fast at the start of the month. While not at the level of the energy crisis of a few years ago, call numbers were notably up on last year.The Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said the first working days of January had seen more calls than last year.Monday was the busiest single day in its history, when 1,365 calls came in.Concerns are particularly acute for those struggling to pay priority bills such as council tax and rent.The colder weather could also place extra strain on vulnerable households, with £4.4bn already owed to energy suppliers following a period of high prices, although the government's cold weather payments have been triggered in many areas.Charities are urging anyone whose debt has become unmanageable to seek help as soon as possible, rather than making matters worse by ignoring the situation.That is a view shared by Dave, who has managed to work his way out of difficulty. A few years ago, he found his previously manageable credit card debt becoming a problem when he was unexpectedly made redundant at the same time as going through a divorce.Dave has turned his finances around after receiving help from StepChange\"They were two quite dramatic things in six months,\" said Dave, who has previously spoken to the BBC about his debt issues.\"The debt was around £20,000 to £25,000 at its height. It became so overwhelming. You feel that you are letting creditors down because you want to do what they ask of you - but you are scared, you are renting, and at times you struggle to get through each day.\"Once you are in a spiral, it is really hard to get out of it.\"He is now working in insurance, his debts are manageable and being paid off, and he said he wanted to help others \"to show that you can get through these things\".Figures published earlier in the week by the Bank of England fuelled concerns that everyday costs were becoming harder for some households to manage without turning to borrowing.The data showed that credit card borrowing grew at the fastest annual rate in nearly two years in the run-up to Christmas.The annual growth rate for credit card borrowing increased to 12.1% in November, from 10.9% the previous month - the highest figure since January 2024 when it was 12.5%.",

    "body": "12 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterThe government is refusing to deny reports that plans to make Britain's armed forces \"war ready\" will require billions more than it has allocated so far.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes it will require an extra £28bn over the next four years to meet its forecast costs, according to The Times and The Sun. The department's investment plan has been delayed, with Sir Keir Starmer reportedly ordering a rewrite of the proposals.The plan was initially supposed to have been completed in autumn last year, but could now not emerge until the spring. The document is due to set out how new equipment and defence infrastructure will be funded over the coming decade, following a wide-ranging review of Britain's capabilities published in June last year.The review pledged billions in extra spending for extra ammunition, next-generation fast jets, drones, and new attack submarines, as ministers pledged to move the UK to \"war-fighting readiness\".According to the reports, the projected £28bn shortfall was made by MoD officials in an internal assessment conducted last year.Sir Richard Knighton, the chief of the defence staff, delivered the forecast to Sir Keir and Chancellor Rachel Reeves in the run-up to Christmas at a meeting in Downing Street, it is reported.The prime minister's spokesman said he would not discuss \"specific meetings,\" but acknowledged that the armed forces were facing additional demands, including a potential deployment to Ukraine to police any deal to end its war with Russia.Asked several times if he could deny there was a £28bn spending gap, he said he could only reiterate the spending pledges already made by the government.The MoD's budget is due to rise by 3.6% in real terms by 2029, under departmental spending plans fixed last year.The increase was weighted towards the long-term investment budget, which pays for new military kit, rather then the day-to-day budget that covers things like administration costs and salaries.Labour has pledged to raise overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, estimated to cost an extra £6bn a year.It has then promised it will rise to 3.5% by 2035, in line with a pledge made by Nato countries at a summit last year.This is not the first time that there have been warnings about the MoD's ability to fund its spending commitments.The investment plan is meant to replace decade-long \"equipment plans\" released on a rolling yearly basis until 2022, when the department halted publication whilst it assessed the effect of \"extraordinary inflation\" on its plans.An analysis published by the department in December 2023, under the previous government, found that the MoD's most recent equipment plan was forecast to exceed its budget by £16.9bn.A report by MPs published the following year said the biggest cause of that shortfall came from spiralling costs from maintaining the UK's nuclear weapons system, alongside inflation.The delay to the investment plan has also delayed the release of a separate document detailing yet to be specified \"productivity savings\" within the department worth £6bn between now and 2029. An MoD spokesperson said it was working \"flat out\" to finish the investment plan, adding that Labour had inherited an \"underfunded defence programme\" from the previous government. ",

    "body": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers\" who are trying \"to please the president of the US\".Iran also sent sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council blaming the US for turning the protests into what it called \"violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism\" in Iran. Trump, meanwhile, said Iran was \"in big trouble\".The protests, in their 13th day, erupted over the economy and have grown into the largest in years - leading to calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and some urging the restoration of the monarchy. At least 48 protesters and 14 security personnel have been killed, according to human rights groups. An internet blackout is in place.\"We will be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was watching the situation in Iran carefully and that any US involvement does not mean \"boots on the ground\".\"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,\" he said. These remarks echo ones the US president made about the Iranian government on Thursday, where he pledged to \"hit them very hard\" if they \"start killing people\". Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday.\"Let everyone know that the Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this,\" the 86-year-old said.Later, in remarks made to a gathering of supporters and broadcast on state television, Khamenei doubled down, saying Iran \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\".Iran's United Nations ambassador accused the US of \"interfering in Iran's internal affairs through threats, incitement, and the deliberate encouragement of instability and violence,\" in a letter to the Security Council. Since protests began on 28 December, in addition to the 48 protesters killed, more than 2,277 individuals have also been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) said.The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed.BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran.In a joint statement, the leaders of the UK, Germany and France said they were \"deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces, and strongly condemn the killing of protesters\".\"The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal,\" French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the United Nations was very disturbed by the loss of life. \"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said.Meanwhile the Iranian security and judicial authorities issued a series of coordinated warnings, hardening their rhetoric and echoing an earlier message of \"no leniency\" by Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).Iran's National Security Council - responsible for domestic security and not to be confused with the SNSC - said \"decisive and necessary legal action will be taken\" against protesters, which it described as \"armed vandals\" and \"disruptors of peace and security\".In a brief statement, it warned against \"any form of attack on military, law-enforcement, or governmental facilities\". The intelligence arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it would not tolerate what it described as \"terrorist acts\", asserting that it would continue its operations \"until the complete defeat of the enemy's plan\".Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah who was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution, called on Trump on Friday to \"be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran\". Pahlavi, who lives close to Washington DC, had urged protesters to take to the streets on Thursday and Friday.Protests have taken place across the country, with BBC Verify verifying videos from 67 locations.On Friday, protesters amassed after weekly prayers in the south-eastern city of Zahedan, videos verified by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show. In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting \"death to the dictator\", referencing Khamenei.In another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard.Another verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured.Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout.The country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, with minor amounts of traffic returning on Friday, internet monitoring groups Cloudfare and Netblocks said. That means less information is emerging from Iran.IHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that \"the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious\".Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible \"massacre\" during the internet shutdown.One person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran. He reported a run on supermarkets by residents trying to stock up on food and other essentials, expecting worse days to come.The shutdown of the internet has meant that cash machines are not working, and there is no way to pay for purchases in shops where debit cards cannot be used due to the lack of internet.Mahsa Alimardani, who works for the human rights NGO Witness, told the BBC in London that she had not been able to make contact with her family since Thursday evening.\"It's very anxiety-inducing, not having access to information, not knowing if your loved ones participated [in the protests] or if they're okay,\" she said.The protests began nearly two weeks ago with shopkeepers in Tehran angry about the collapsing currency, before spreading to students and street demonstrations.The last major protests were in 2022, when demonstrations erupted after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.Additional reporting by Reha Kansara, Kasra Naji and Soroush Negahdari",

    "body": "Video emerges of Minneapolis shooting filmed by ICE agent who opened fire1 hour agoElaine OkyereWatch: Video filmed by ICE agent who shot Minneapolis woman has emergedA video filmed by the US immigration agent who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday has emerged, showing the moments before gunfire rang out.The 47-second footage, obtained by Minnesota-based outlet Alpha News, shows Renee Nicole Good sitting behind the wheel of her car and speaking to the officer. US Vice-President JD Vance shared the clip on social media, commenting that the agent had acted in self-defence. Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger.Good's wife has paid tribute to the 37-year-old, saying the pair were trying to support their neighbours when she was shot. Her death has sparked protests across the US. President Donald Trump's administration says Good tried to run over the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in an act of \"domestic terrorism\" after blocking the road and impeding the agency's work.Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has described that account as \"garbage\" based on the video footage.The BBC has asked the homeland security department and the White House for comment on the new video that emerged on Friday.The footage starts with the officer getting out of his car and filming Good's vehicle and registration plate while he walks around the Honda SUV. A dog is in the backseat. Good says: \"That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you.\"Her wife, Becca Good, is standing on the street filming the interaction with her mobile phone. She tells the ICE agent: \"That's OK, we don't change our plates every morning just so you know. It will be the same plate when you come talk to us later.\"She adds: \"You want to come at us? You want to come at us? I say go and get yourself some lunch, big boy.\"Another agent approaches Good on the driver's side and uses an expletive as he says: \"Get out of the car.\" The agent filming the clip moves in front of Good's car as she reverses.In a chaotic couple of seconds, she turns the wheel to the right and pulls forwards.The camera jerks up to the sky. \"Woah, woah!\" a voice says, as bangs are heard.In the final part of the video the car is seen veering down the road. The ICE agent swears.Other clips released previously from the scene show the maroon SUV crashed into the side of the road after the woman was shot by the agent.The officer appears to stay on his feet, and is later seen in other videos walking towards Good's crashed car. Federal officials say the agent was injured and treated in hospital. The FBI is investigating the incident.An earlier video shows the incident from another perspectiveThe officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car. When asked about the video at the White House on Friday, President Trump said: \"You have agitators and we will always be protecting ICE, and we're always going to be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.\"On Friday, Vance reposted the video on X, and defended the agent's actions, saying: \"The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self-defence.\"White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt also reposted the video, saying the media had smeared an ICE agent who had \"properly defended himself from being run over\". Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours. \"We had whistles,\" Becca Good said. \"They had guns.\"When speaking about Good - a mother-of-three, including a six-year-old son - she said \"kindness radiated out of her\".\"We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness,\" she added.On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open an inquiry into the shooting after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation.Trump was asked by a reporter at the White House on Friday whether the FBI should share its findings with Minnesota, and said: \"Well normally I would, but they're crooked officials.\"Hennepin County's top prosecutor Mary Moriarty and the state's Democratic attorney general, Keith Ellison, said they were launching their own probe.It came a day after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI had initially pledged a joint investigation, then reversed course.One federal agency that is not looking into the shooting is the US justice department's Civil Rights Division, which has in the past investigated alleged excessive use of force by law enforcement.But prosecutors have advised its criminal section that there will be no investigation in this case, sources told the BBC's US media partner CBS News. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials, but Vice-President Vance said it was a federal matter. Demonstrators turned out for a second night of protests on Thursday over the killing of Good. Governor Walz said he had activated the state's National Guard to help with security of the protests.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSarah SmithNorth America editorPresident Donald Trump says the US needs to \"own\" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so. \"Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC.We will do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\", he added. The White House said recently the administration is considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force. Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance.Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\".The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a lease agreement was not good enough.\"Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,\" he said, adding that they had to have ownership. \"I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\"\"And by the way Nato's got to understand that,\" the US president added.Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\".Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.In a joint statement on Friday night, Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the \"US's disregard for our country to end\".\"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" they said. \"The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoJames W KellyLondonHeinekenHeineken's campaign is TfL's latest commercial Tube rebranding dealThe commercial rebranding of a London Underground line may cause \"unnecessary confusion\" for some passengers, a disability rights charity has said.Signage along central London Bakerloo line stations are being rebranded as \"Bakerl0.0\" and \"Waterl0.0\" as part of an advertising campaign by Heineken to promote its zero alcohol products.Emma Vogelmann from Transport for All said getting around London with confidence and ease depended on having \"consistent, recognisable information across the Tube network\".Transport for London (TfL) said advertising campaigns provide additional funding and are \"fully assessed to ensure they do not impact services, staff or customers\".HeinekenThe Dutch beer brand said it was partnering with TfL to help \"keep Londoners' social lives on track\" during what will be a alcohol-free \"dry January\" for many. While Heineken's rebranding is more subtle than some previous campaigns - including Burberry's 2024 renaming of Old Street and Bond Street stations - Ms Voglemann said name and navigation signs should not be altered as part of advertising as it creates unnecessary confusion.She added: \"For many people – including those with visual impairments, learning disabilities, neurodivergent people, or people who experience fatigue or brain fog - these campaigns can turn a routine journey into a stressful or unsafe one.\"She said accessibility wasn't optional, and that there was plenty of advertising space on the Tube network \"without undermining essential information\".Transport for All branded the Bond Street renaming as a \"thoughtless PR stunt\" at the timeEmma Strain from TfL said the organisation was \"always keen to work with brands to create new experiences\" for the millions of people who travel on the network.She added that the funding raised through advertising deals was invested into London's transport network to provide further improvements.Burberry's temporary name change of the two stations netted TfL £500,000.

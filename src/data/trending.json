    "body": "\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle final (10:20-11:40) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (13:30-14:50 - re-arranged from Tuesday because of weather)British teenager Mia Brookes was a potential medal hope in this event but she is not in the final after finishing 16th in qualification. Reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand topped qualification, ahead of the Netherlands' Melissa Peperkamp. The rest of the field were at least nine points behind the pair. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "8 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykUS Department of Justice/PAEpstein took dozens more flights to the UK than were previously knownEssex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.The BBC understands that while the police is \"assessing\" the information, it would not necessarily lead to a full investigation.Last year a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.An Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.The former PM wrote to the chief police constables and commissioner of the Met, Essex and Thames Valley Police.He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".Stansted Airport said in a statement: \"All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.\"The airport said that these terminals are \"entirely independent\" and that \"no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal\". Immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out \"directly by Border Force\", it said, adding that it does not \"manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft\".The Essex Police statement comes as a new national group has been set up to support UK forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.He was dismissed from his role as ambassador in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.",

    "body": "The lowest temperatures first thing are expected across parts of eastern Scotland. Whist Tuesday saw lows in the Highlands down to -7.2C (19F), Wednesday morning could be even colder at around  -8C (18F) or -9C (16F).  However, a sub-zero start to the day is also expected in many other areas including central and northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland.   Many places will be dry first thing, but the weather is set to turn much more unsettled during the day. Low pressure approaching from the south-west will bring rain initially to Northern Ireland in the early morning, which will then spread into western parts of England and Wales. As the rain bumps into cold air, it will increasingly turn to sleet and snow across Wales and later on into parts of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and the West Midlands.  There could be around 2-5cm of snow fairly widely, and up to 10-15cm over the highest ground in Wales, Herefordshire and Shropshire.  This is likely to lead to some travel disruption and potential power cuts.The more widespread UKHSA cold alert, external covers all of England except for London and the South East.  This warns of the risk of minor impacts on health and social care services. Vulnerable people in particular may be affected by this spell of colder weather, with increased use of healthcare services and an increased risk to life.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPolice accessing Stansted Airport private flights over Epstein ties leads a number of Wednesday's papers. \"Flight logs and emails for Epstein's 'Lolita Express' are being accessed\", the i Paper reports, after allegations women were flown in and out of England. Meanwhile, MPs are weighing up whether to open \"an investigation into Andrew's work as UK trade envoy\", the paper says. The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.The Sun reports on Mountbatten-Windsor being faced overnight with \"a criminal probe into sex trafficking claims\". It claims there are at least seven UK police forces on the Epstein case. The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Similarly, the Daily Mail covers the \"pressure piling on Andrew\" with claims of a \"fourth police force probe\" into Epstein ties. The Guardian features US civil rights leader Jesse Jackson who died aged 84 on Tuesday morning. The paper remembers the leading Democrat with a quote from Barack Obama saying \"We stood on his shoulders\". Meanwhile, the paper reports that one in nine new homes in England built between 2022 and 2024 could now be at risk of flooding. The Financial Times remembers Jesse Jackson as the leader whose advocacy spanned the death of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 to the election of Barack Obama in 2008 - featuring an image of the late US civil rights leader taking part in a rally in Washington in 1992. The paper also reports that the UK government has pulled the plug on a \"programme to build frictionless post-Brexit trade border\" after the end of a contract with Deloitte and IBM. The Daily Express leads with unemployment figures hitting 5.2%, and points the finger at Labour's job taxes, which it calls the \"silent killer of inspiration\". The paper reports that one Tory claims \"millions are crying out for the reward of hard work\". The Daily Star leads with Gordon Ramsay's reflections on his tough childhood that he says \"made me a better dad\". Elsewhere on the page, Jesse Jackson is remembered and the countdown for the Cheltenham races begins. A \"Putin Critic\" who says he \"checks his door handle every day\" in fear of nerve agent assassinations is the subject of the exclusive lead story in the Metro. The Russian national and journalist, Roman Dobrokhotov, 42, was \"named as a target at the trial of a Putin spy ring in Britain\" and claims to be \"on Putin's kill list\", the paper reports. The Daily Mirror calls Nigel Farage's new team, which he unveiled yesterday, \"no laughing matter\". The Reform UK leader's new cabinet is \"full of Tories\", the paper says, and whom Labour chair Anna Turley says \"failed Britain before\" and would \"do they same again\". Rachel Reeves is reportedly rejecting requests \"from military chiefs to spend billions more on defence\", the Daily Telegraph says. It reports a £28bn shortfall as being flagged by the Ministry of Defence. Meanwhile, Dame Prue Leith takes the lead image in a outfit made out of \"leaves and stems from the King's private estate\" for the opening night of London Fashion Week. Labour considering dropping their youth wage pledge after \"suggestions the policy is fuelling record youth unemployment\" is the focus of the Times. Business groups say ministers are \"pricing a generation of young people out of the workplace\". The front of the paper also has Dame Prue Leith posing in her London Fashion Week outfit on its front page.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "5 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesIllegal skin lightening products are being sold in butchers and specialist food shops across the UK as well as online, a watchdog has warned.The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) said the dangerous and illicit products are appearing in an increasingly wide range of places.It has told the public to avoid the creams and report shops that continue to sell them.\"As a black woman and a long-standing advocate for equality, diversity and inclusion, I want to be absolutely clear: the sale of illegal skin lightening products is not only dangerous, it is unlawful,\" Tendy Lindsay, a CTSI member and former chair, said.The CTSI said many of the products have been banned for containing ingredients such as hydroquinone, mercury, and powerful corticosteroids.The ingredients are illegal because they increase the risk of skin damage, infections, and pregnancy-related complications.The standards body said users are driven toward skin lightening by \"complex social and personal factors\", including colourism, a type of discrimination which favours lighter skin shades.The BBC this month reported on the dangers posed by illegal skin lightening products and their prevalence.Speaking to Morning Live, Daniel Murrell-Williamson from Essex, said he spent two months as a 17-year-old using a cream he did not know contained toxic and illegal ingredients.Hoping to cover dark patches on his skin that had been caused by acne, Daniel relied on an unmarked product given to him by a friend.\"I definitely saw a difference in my skin complexion and felt like I needed to keep up with it, because if I stopped, I would revert back to my original skin complexion,\" he said.Daniel added that eventually, he was using the bleaching product all over his body on a daily basis.The product he was using was illegal because it contained hydroquinone, which can weaken the skin, increasing the risk of cancer - as well as causing liver and kidney damage.Arlene Dihoulou said she was unaware of the dangers posed by skin lightening creams but had done so after experiencing colourism and racism related to her skin tone as a child.A cosmetics retailer in Peckham, London, was fined £30,000 in November after being caught selling illegal skin lightening products for a second time. Across the borough of Southwark alone, 62 companies or individuals have been prosecuted for selling skin lighteners since 2002. Southwark Trading StandardsA butcher in Southwark sold illegal skin whitening products, seen here on the top shelfAs part of its warning, the CTSI said consumers should: Never use skin lightening products on childrenNever buy them from unverified sellers or social media accounts and avoid buying cosmetics from online marketplacesAlways speak to a doctor or dermatologist before using any product intended to alter skin toneLindsay said she was \"deeply concerned\" about the social factors fuelling demand for skin lightening products, warning that \"colourism and harmful beauty standards can create vulnerability\".And she warned those supplying the products, some of whom do not know they are illegal, that \"a lack of awareness is not a defence\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoChris Mason,Political editorandBrian Wheeler,political reporterCivil Service Blog / GOV.UKDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles in three government departmentsThe frontrunner to be the next head of the UK civil service faced allegations from several people about her behaviour when she was a senior diplomat in New York, according to documents seen by the BBC.Former officials have told the BBC that it is \"disingenuous\" for the Cabinet Office to state that there had only been a single official complaint.Dame Antonia Romeo is currently the senior civil servant at the Home Office and is highly regarded by some in Whitehall for her ability to get things done.But claims about her conduct when she was the UK's consul general in New York a decade ago have led critics to question her suitability for the role of cabinet secretary, which would put her at the head of the civil service.The government says three allegations relating to her use of expenses and bullying of staff when she was in New York were investigated and there was \"no case to answer\".The Cabinet Office said the three allegations were from a single complaint, that she had been spoken to about her management style after the complaint had been dismissed, and that no similar claims have been raised in any of her other roles.Sources have told the BBC there had, in fact, been complaints about Dame Antonia's conduct in New York from several people.Sir Matthew Rycroft, who was the UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York when Dame Antonia was consul general and Rupert McNeil, the government's then head of human resources have both said in recent days that there was just one complaint.But a source told the BBC: \"To argue publicly that there was just one complaint is wilfully misleading. They were presented to London in one dossier, but there were multiple complaints.\"In documents setting out the complaints, Dame Antonia is described as behaving in an \"unreasonable\", \"degrading\", and \"demeaning\" way towards staff and of being more interested in promoting her own \"personal brand\" on social media than that of the UK government.\"She's a diplomat, not a D-list celebrity. My 15-year-old, social-media-obsessed, brother is less shameless in his self-promotion,\" reads some contemporaneous testimony.One member of the UK's team described feeling \"emotionally battered\".As the UK's consul general between 2016 and 2017 Dame Antonia's job involved promoting UK trade and business in New York, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum to take Britain out of the EU.The BBC has learned that 47% of staff in New York said they had experienced bullying in the workplace in an annual staff survey  - the highest level ever recorded anywhere in the Foreign Office.It is understood that in most government departments or divisions the figure is usually in low single figures. The survey covered a 12 month period, including three months in which Dame Antonia was in post.Dame Antonia's critics acknowledge her abilities in the documents seen by the BBC, with one saying she was \"smart, dynamic and really talented.\" Another said she was an \"extremely intelligent, innovative thinker\".But there was also criticism of her management style, with one person saying she was  \"very demanding, very disrespectful, very threatening\".\"I'm used to big egos but this was something else. The minute she heard the word 'no' she'd say I'll go to your boss. But it was worse than that. She would go to your boss's boss and your boss's boss's boss,\" they added.Someone else told us: \"If you don't say 'yes' to her she's not only going to screw your career, but she'll screw all of those around you.\"Her approach, it was claimed, \"inflames rather than calms a situation\" and \"creates a culture of fear and anxiety\".The majority of the complaints seen by the BBC were from female members of staff.The allegations were so serious a former ambassador to Japan, Sir Tim Hitchens, was flown to New York to look into it.His work examined allegations of \"bullying behaviour, financial probity, and putting her private objectives above those of the wider Consulate-General or government\".The BBC has been told the Foreign Office's investigation concluded there was a case for Dame Antonia to answer about her behaviour towards colleagues, but there was no case to answer about what was called \"financial probity\" and is understood to refer to expenses.A Whitehall source said: \"The fact that selective excerpts are now being resurfaced, almost a decade on, to substantiate vexatious anonymous briefings from disgruntled individuals is frankly unconscionable.\"An email from the time raised concerns about Dame Antonia's use of social media.It said: \"Antonia's obsession with promoting her personal brand over the work and priorities of HMG has created an untenably tense and bullying atmosphere for all staff\".Staff also reported, as one put it, that Dame Antonia insisted they \"frame articles in Vogue and the New Yorker about her and place them in the Residence guest bathroom directly in the line of sight at all angles so that regardless of, um, how you use the bathroom, you have to stare at a photo of her in a magazine spread staring back at you.\"One former colleague said in an email: \"I'm extremely alarmed that Antonia, who holds one of the highest diplomatic positions here in the United States, seems to be focusing an undue amount on building her personal Twitter brand.\"Government sources say the magazine interviews were arranged by the Foreign Office communications team and it is the role of any diplomat overseas to promote the UK and British brands, including on social media.Dame Antonia has held a string of senior roles since her time in New York and is currently one of three figures sharing the role of cabinet secretary on an interim basis, following the departure of Sir Chris Wormald last week.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"Antonia Romeo is an outstanding leader with 25 years of public service. She has been appointed to three different Permanent Secretary roles and has led hundreds of thousands of public servants to deliver for governments of all stripes.\"As we have repeatedly said, one formal complaint was raised nine years ago which was thoroughly investigated. The allegations were dismissed on the basis that there was no case to answer.\"It is entirely inappropriate to resurface dismissed HR proceedings almost a decade later.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisAFP via Getty ImagesNine people have been arrested in France following an investigation into the murder of a far-right nationalist student by suspected militants from the far-left.Those detained include a parliamentary assistant for a deputy from the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party.Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student, died in hospital on Saturday - two days after being beaten and kicked about the head by a gang of masked young men in Lyon.It happened after a small demonstration by far-right feminists - who Deranque was supposed to be helping protect - at the city's Institute of Political Studies (IEP), commonly known as Sciences-Po. The arrests confirm what has widely been reported: that those suspected of the murder are far-left militants linked to a banned group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard). The most striking news is that among the nine in custody is Jacques-Elie Favrot, a young man who until now has been employed as parliamentary assistant at the National Assembly in Paris for a deputy from LFI.The murder is putting huge pressure on LFI, on its 70 MPs, and on its veteran leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is a likely contender in next year's presidential election.On Sunday, Mélenchon said his party had \"nothing to do with this story. Those who accuse us are committing a libel.\"We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends. We have said dozens of times that we oppose all forms of violence,\" he said.On Monday, state prosecutor Thierry Dran told a news conference that Deranque was kicked and punched by \"at least six\" individuals, and that the post-mortem examination showed fatal damage to his skull and brain.",

Two other skiers who where part of the group in La Grave, a German and an Australian, escaped without injury.On Tuesday, the French weather service marked the avalanche risk in the La Greve area as \"high\" or four on a five-point scale due to fresh snow and wind.At the Valloire resort, the risk was categorised at the maximum of five.Local authorities have launched investigations to determine the cause of death in both avalanches.Following the deaths of the two British nationals on Friday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Office told the BBC they were \"in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance\".There have been a number of fatal avalanches in the French Alps since the start of the year, including six deaths in one weekend in January.",

    "body": "Six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will compete under their nations' flags at the upcoming Winter Paralympics.In September, the International Paralympic Committee lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.Both countries were suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus a close ally of Russia. A partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023. However, the four individual governing bodies in charge of the six sports contested at the Paralympics decided to keep their bans in place.In December, Russia and Belarus won an appeal against FIS - the governing body for skiing and snowboarding - at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), permitting them to compete and accumulate ranking points.The IPC confirmed to BBC Sport that the 10 athletes have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete in Para-alpine skiing, Para-cross country skiing and Para-snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games.\"The IPC can confirm that NPC Russia has been awarded a total of six slots: two in Para-alpine skiing (one male, one female), two in Para-cross country skiing (one male, one female), and two in Para-snowboard (both male),\" it said in a statement.\"NPC Belarus has been awarded four slots in total, all in cross-country skiing (one male and three female).\"Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said it was \"completely the wrong decision\".\"Allowing athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete under their own flags while the brutal invasion of Ukraine continues sends a terrible message,\" Nandy wrote on X.\"The International Paralympic Committee should reconsider this decision urgently.\"Bipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\", among other factors.Ukraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.It will mark the first time a Russian flag has been flown at a Paralympic Games since the Sochi 2014 Games, firstly due to the country's state-sponsored doping programme, before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Russian news agency TASS reports that among the athletes set to compete are Aleksey Bugaev, a three-time Paralympic champion in alpine skiing, and cross-country skiers Ivan Golubkov and Anastasiia Bagiian - both are World Championship medallists.All three returned to competition in January, and both Bugaev and Bagiian have since won World Cup titles.The Milan-Cortina Winter Paralympics will take place from 6-15 March.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDamian GrammaticasandClaire KeenanGettyThe US supports the UK's decision to 'proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago'. The US government has given its official backing to the UK's plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base. In a statement, the US Department of State said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\". The announcement comes ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week. In its statement, the US Department of State said that \"the US reiterates its desire\" for guaranteed \"continued use\" of the military base on Diego Garcia. Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used by the UK and US armed forces. Under the new plan, the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years.Continuing on the military base would \"advance US national security\" and ensure the \"security and stability across the Indian Ocean\", the US Department of State added. The US government had previously signalled it would back the deal worth £3.4bn ($4.6bn) that was signed by the UK in May. At the time the Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US \"welcomed\" the deal, before Trump described the plan in a post on Truth Social last month as \"an act of great stupidity\". The comments came amid high tensions between the White House and European nations over the US President's desire to purchase Greenland from Denmark and his threats to impose tariffs on the UK and other nations that had backed Denmark.The UK government said it would \"never compromise on our national security\", while at the time the prime minister's official spokesperson insisted the US still supported the move.The talks set to take place next week will be held in the capital of Mauritius, Port Louis. They will focus on \"security co-operation\" and \"effective implementation of security arrangements\" to ensure long-term success between the Mauritius government and the US, the US State Department has said. The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean. The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965. But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.",

    "body": "10 hours agoDearbail JordanBusiness reporterEPAThe European Union (EU) has launched a formal investigation into fast fashion giant Shein over possible breaches of digital law, including the sale of childlike sex dolls.The European Commission (EC), the EU's executive arm, said it will examine what systems the Chinese firm has in place to prevent the sale of illegal products \"including content which could constitute child sexual abuse material\".It will also investigate the \"addictive design\" of Shein's platform and the transparency of the system it uses to suggest products and content to shoppers.Shein said: \"Protecting minors and reducing the risk of harmful content and behaviours are central to how we develop and operate our platform.\"Last year, Shein was reported to French authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website.The firm said it removed the products immediately, banned the sellers, and removed the sale of sex dolls \"regardless of appearance\" across its global site. It also said it worked with local and international authorities on investigations into both the buyers and sellers of the childlike sex dolls.The Commission said it will investigate the systems Shein uses to limit the sale of illegal products. It said that would include weapons but declined to specify particular items.It has sent a number of requests for information to Shein in the past and EC spokesperson Thomas Regnier told the BBC's World Business Report that Shein was \"very cooperative\". But the EC said that once there were indications that a platform may have systemic risks for its users, the EC could open proceedings to investigate further.Regnier said the EC was concerned about the \"addictive\" nature of Shein's website, and the \"gamification\" of the platform, including its \"rewards programme\" for consumers.He said that the Commission was not against reward programmes per se, but that online platform algorithms were \"often opaque\".\"You don't know how they're being designed [and] you're not in control of what you see,\" he said.The EC will also examine the transparency of so-called \"recommender systems\" which use a shopper's data to push certain products their way. It said that under the Digital Services Act (DSA), Shein must disclosed the main parameters it uses to recommend products and must provide users with \"at least one easily accessible option\" that is not based on using their data to profile their likely purchases. Opening a formal investigation into a company means that the EC can take \"enforcement steps\" such as fines of up to 6% of a company's global sales. In the most recent figures available, Shein reported $38bn in sales for 2024.A spokesperson for Shein said: \"Over the last few months, we have continued to invest significantly in measures to strengthen our compliance with the DSA. \"These include comprehensive systemic-risk assessments and mitigation frameworks, enhanced protections for younger users, and ongoing work to design our services in ways that promote a safe and trusted user experience,\" it said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick Triggle,Health correspondentandJoe McFadden,Health reporterGetty ImagesTighter restrictions on high-risk cosmetic procedures such as liquid Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) are needed immediately, a cross-party group of MPs says.The Women and Equalities Committee said only doctors should be allowed to carry out these treatments because of the risks involved.That would act as a de facto ban as doctors would only perform them in the most essential cases, the MPs say.The government has proposed a similar measure, but has yet to confirm when the restrictions will come into place. Currently there is no regulation over who can provide procedures that do not involve incisions.The committee said this had created a \"wild west\" market with procedures, including liquid breast enlargements, reportedly being done in Airbnbs, hotels rooms, garden sheds and public toilets.'Complete nightmare'In early 2024, Sasha Dean, from Bedfordshire, was left in a coma after receiving a liquid BBL. Some of the treatment was in a private house and she ended up developing sepsis.\"Very quickly it turned into a complete nightmare,\" Dean told the BBC.\"I had a heart attack, one of my lungs had collapsed, my kidneys were failing. My body was just completely shutting down.\"Sasha Dean from Bedfordshire was left in a coma after receiving a liquid BBLAfter five days in an induced coma, Dean pulled through and has since recovered, but she says the experience has still left her with physical side effects.\"It's just been the most horrendous couple of years. I lost all my hair, I've got cognitive issues, I've had problems dropping things and I've had problems with my eyes. It's just an ongoing battle,\"she says.\"It's ruined my life, quite frankly.\"Dean is now warning other women against the dangers of the procedure.\"Because it's not surgery, people still think that it's safe. But for me, I just think it is the most dangerous procedure out there. \"I'd like to see it banned in all honesty.\"Tough measuresLabour MP and committee chair Sarah Owen said liquid BBLs and liquid breast augmentations pose a serious threat to safety.\"The government is not moving quickly enough. There is no need for further consultation and delay,\" she said.\"This 'wild west' of procedures is placing the public at risk.\"Owen also said the government needed to commit to introducing its licensing scheme for lower-risk non-surgical procedures by the end of this parliament, in 2029.Under the government's plans, high-risk procedures will only be able to be performed by regulated healthcare professionals and services will be inspected by the Care Quality Commission.Lower-risk procedures such as Botox and lip fillers will fall under council licensing schemes.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokeswoman said the government was already taking action to crack down on 'cosmetic cowboys' and root out dangerous treatments.\"Our tough new measures will ensure only qualified healthcare professionals will be able to perform the highest-risk procedures.\"For anyone considering a cosmetic procedure, please check the provider's qualifications and insurance - and avoid treatments that appear suspiciously cheap.\"But DHSC said there was no date confirmed yet when these measures would be introduced.The government began consulting on these changes in 2023, although there had been calls for tougher regulations for a decade before that, the committee said.In the meantime, there has been a rapid growth in businesses offering these procedures.A recent University College London study found there were now more than 5,500 clinics offering non-surgical cosmetic treatments in the UK with only a third of practitioners being qualified doctors.The committee's report said there was no consistency in training standards, with some relying only on online training courses before providing treatments.Social mediaDr Sophie Shotter, of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine, says there was no reason to delay introducing tougher regulation.\"If the government clearly defines which procedures are considered high-risk and legislates that only regulated healthcare professionals can perform them, implementation could happen relatively quickly. \"The key is clarity,\" she added. \"Without a clear definition of 'high-risk', enforcement becomes difficult. \"But once that legal line is drawn, it should be a prosecutable offence for non-clinicians to carry out those treatments.\"The MPs committee also wants the NHS to start recording data on complications after cosmetic surgery carried abroad, amid reports of people receiving emergency care following botched treatment in other countries.And the MPs said they were concerned by the influence of social media platforms and online influencers who are contributing to worsening body image and increasing demand for cosmetic procedures, particularly among young women and girls.The government said it would consider the committee's recommendations.",

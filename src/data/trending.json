    "body": "1 hour agoMatt TaylorEast MidlandsBBCManjula Sood was described as \"an inspiration\" and \"community leader\"Tributes have been paid after the death of a councillor who became the UK's first female Asian lord mayor.Manjula Sood, who was 80, was described as \"a dedicated servant to the Leicester community\", having also served as assistant mayor and Labour councillor for the Stoneygate ward in the city.According to her website, Ms Sood came to Leicester from India, where she had been studying for a PhD, in 1970, and completed her studies before becoming a primary school teacher for about 20 years.She became the city's first female Hindu councillor in October 1996, after winning a by-election triggered by her husband Paul's death earlier that year.Twelve years later, in May 2008, she became the UK's and Leicester's first Asian female lord mayor, and said at the time: \"This is great news for a great city, especially as a woman who came here to make it her home.\"Shockat Adam, Independent MP for Leicester South, said he was taught by Ms Sood and described how she touched \"countless lives through her work and kindness\".He said her death was \"a great loss to the city of Leicester\".Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West, also paid tribute to and said Ms Sood had had \"a massive impact on Leicester\", as well as \"championing women and our incredible diverse communities\".'Shining light'Ms Sood moved from a 25-room house in the Punjab district of Ludhiana to a small flat on an inner-city estate in Leicester with her late husband.\"There were no carpets and no heating and it was snowing. I told my husband 'I'm not staying here',\" Ms Sood previously said.\"But my granddad told me to make the most of it. He said: 'Definitely not - I have given you an education, now Leicester is your home and Britain is your country'.\"Now I am glad I stayed.\"Suleman Nagdi, of the Federation of Muslim Organisations, said Ms Sood was \"a shining light – a woman of extraordinary compassion, dignity, and unwavering dedication\".\"The void she leaves behind is immeasurable. We have lost a guide, a mentor, and a beautiful soul whose presence made the world a kinder place,\" he said.'Deep sadness'According to the biography section on her own website, Ms Sood \"faced and successfully overcame many challenges\" in her early career. \"She had to juggle learning politics with supporting her two children and looking after her elderly mother,\" it says.While serving as lord mayor, a position she held for a year, Ms Sood was appointed an MBE and awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Leicester.A message on her website said: \"It is with deep sadness that we share the passing of Manjula Sood, a loving mother and grandmother, and a dedicated servant of the Leicester community\"Details of a memorial service will be shared in due course. The family kindly request privacy at this time and ask that there be no home visits.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "Thailand carried out air strikes on a disputed border area with Cambodia on Friday, as officials from both sides continued talks to try to end fighting.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry accused Thailand of \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses and injuring several people.Fighting broke out again earlier this month after a fragile ceasefire in July halted five days of intense border clashes. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the hostilities resumed.Both countries have blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.Since then, fighting has spread to nearly every province along the 500-mile (800km) border.Cambodia's defence ministry said Friday's attacks were in the north-western Banteay Meanchey province. Up to 40 bombs were dropped by F-16 fighter jets, the ministry said in a Facebook post.Thailand said the action was aimed at controlling Nong Chan village, and was \"carried out efficiently and successfully\".It came as Thai and Cambodian negotiators held their third day of talks at a border checkpoint. Defence ministers from both sides are due to join the discussions on Saturday.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Friday that once both sides agreed to each other's conditions, a ceasefire agreement could be signed.\"I hope this time will be the last one we'd have to sign, so that peace can occur in the area,\" he said, \"[and] people can return to their homes.\"The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years.But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on 24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.",

    "body": "6 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA US judge has temporarily blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, who took legal action against the US government over having his visa removed.The Center for Countering Digital Hate founder was among five people denied US visas after the Trump administration accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" tech platforms into censoring free speech.The move brought a backlash from European leaders defending the work of organisations monitoring online content.Mr Ahmed, a US permanent resident, had warned that being detained and possibly deported would tear him away from his American wife and child. Praising the judge's decision, he told BBC News he would not be \"bullied\".Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said online that the individuals were blocked over concerns that they had organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and \"punish American viewpoints they oppose\".Mr Ahmed filed a legal complaint on Wednesday against officials including Rubio and US Attorney General Pamela Bondi over the decision to have him sanctioned.In court documents seen by the BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick said on Thursday he had granted Mr Ahmed's request for a temporary restraining order.The judge also temporarily blocked the officials from detaining Mr Ahmed without the chance for his case to be heard.The BBC has contacted the state department and White House for comment.When approached by AFP news agency, a state department spokesperson was quoted as saying: \"The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here.\"Mr Ahmed said: \"I will not be bullied away from my life's work of fighting to keep children safe from social media's harm and stopping antisemitism online.\"His lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said the speed of the judge's decision was telling. \"The federal government can't deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn't like what he has to say,\" she said.In 2023, Mr Ahmed's centre was sued by Elon Musk's social media company after it reported on a rise in hate speech on the platform since the billionaire's takeover of the firm, now called X.The case was dismissed but an appeal is pending.

    "body": "14 hours agoMadeline HalpertEric Thayer via Getty ImagesCars were buried in debris in Wrightwood, CaliforniaHeavy rain storms across large parts of California triggered floods and mudslides and left three dead as of Christmas night, local officials said. The storms - which were expected to continue through Friday - brought 11 inches (27 cms) of rainfall to some parts of Los Angeles County, prompted evacuations and shut down major roads. Emergency responders have had to perform several rescues, including people stuck in vehicles as flood waters rise. California's Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Wednesday in Los Angeles and other southern Californian counties. About 100,000 people in the state were without power as of Thursday evening. The US Weather Prediction Center said on Thursday that \"numerous flash flooding events are possible\". \"In addition, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.\" A 64-year-old man from San Diego was killed on Wednesday morning by a fallen tree, the police department told US media. Another person, a 74-year-old, died from flood waters over the weekend as police tried to rescue him from inside a vehicle in Redding, the town's mayor told local news.Watch: Powerful storm batters southern CaliforniaAnd on Monday, a woman in her 70s died after she \"was knocked off a rock by a large wave and swept into the ocean\" at MacKerricher State Park in Mendocino County, the sheriff's office said.Evacuation warnings were in effect for some residents of San Bernardino County in southern California, and flash food warnings were issued for those in the San Francisco Bay area on Thursday morning. Wind speeds in the Bay Area topped 100mph (161km/h) at one observatory near San Jose, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.In Altadena, near Los Angeles, flooding caused a mudslide in a vegetation-stripped area that was less able to absorb water due to the wildfires that scorched the neighbourhood in January, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has also declared an emergency from the storms and warned residents to be cautious on roads during a time of busy holiday travel. \"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"The storms came from multiple atmospheric rivers that carried large plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, CBS News reported.Heavy rain threatens US west coast",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Diogo Jota joined Liverpool from Wolves in 2020 The sons of former Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Diogo Jota will accompany the mascots when the Portuguese's two former sides meet at Anfield on Saturday. Dinis and Duarte, two of Jota's three children, will join the matchday mascots on the pitch before kick-off. Jota, 28, was killed in a car crash in Spain in July, alongside his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva. The Portugal winger joined Liverpool in 2020 after three seasons with Wolves. Saturday's Premier League fixture at 15:00 GMT is the first time that the two teams have met since Jota's death. In his programme notes before Liverpool's final home fixture of 2025, manager Arne Slot said he hopes the affection Jota is held in can bring his family \"solace\". \"Reflecting on everything that has happened over the last 12 months ignites a rollercoaster of emotions but it is normal at this time of year to look back to everything that has happened,\" said Slot. \"Doing so leads me to think especially of the family of Diogo Jota on what will be their first Christmas without him. \"It is not my place to tell them where they should look for comfort – if that is even possible – but I can only hope that the feeling of love and affection that Diogo still generates brings them some solace.\" Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for Liverpool, helping them win the FA Cup and League Cup in 2022 and the Premier League title last season.The forward joined Wolves on an initial season-long loan deal from Atletico Madrid in 2017 and went on to score 44 goals in 131 appearances.

    "body": "3 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterandJaroslav LukivUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has given a positive assessment of a conversation he had with US envoys on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Zelensky said Thursday's call with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, which lasted nearly an hour, had yielded \"new ideas in terms of formats, meetings, and... timing on how to bring a real peace closer\". He added later that he would hold another meeting with President Donald Trump \"in the near future\".Earlier this week Zelensky gave details of an updated 20-point peace plan, agreed by US and Ukrainian envoys in Florida. The Kremlin said it was analysing proposals brought back from the US by a Russian envoy.Trump and his envoys have been holding talks with both Ukraine and Russia in an effort to reach a deal to end the war which was started by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.There appears to have been some progress in recent days with Ukraine's president praising the \"good ideas\" put forward by Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Kushner.Zelensky said it had been an \"active day\" for his country's diplomacy, as he went into details with the US envoys.He conceded that there was still \"work to be done on sensitive issues\" but added that \"together with the American team, we understand how to put all of this in place\".Zelensky added that Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov, the country's top security official, \"will continue discussions with the American team\".The 20-point peace plan agreed by the US and Ukraine is seen as an update to the  initial draft prepared by Witkoff several weeks ago.That draft was widely seen as heavily geared towards Russia's maximalist pre-invasion demands, which Kyiv and its European allies said would mean the de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Describing the updated proposal on Wednesday, Zelensky had said it offered Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone in their place.He said the plan now included security guarantees from the US, Nato and Europeans for a co-ordinated military response if Russia invaded Ukraine again.On the key question of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donetsk region, Zelensky said a \"free economic zone\" was a potential option. Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. They are collectively known as Donbas.Zelensky has been under heavy pressure from Trump to cede all of Donbas to Russia during ongoing Washington-led peace negotiations.The Ukrainian leader has so far rejected any territorial concessions, and instead demanded iron-clad security guarantees for Ukraine in any potential settlement.Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must leave Donbas or Russia will seize it.On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was studying the proposals brought back from the US by the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"We are examining this material, and depending on the decisions made by the head of state, we will continue our communication with the Americans,\" he said.While diplomatic efforts to end the conflict inch forward, fighting continues on the ground. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that it had struck one of Russia's key oil refineries in the southern region of Rostov with cruise missiles. The Novoshakhtinsk refinery near the Ukrainian border is critical for supplying fuel for Russian military operations in occupied eastern Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken control of the settlement of Sviato-Pokrovske in the Donetsk region.Earlier this week, Ukrainian troops withdrew from the embattled eastern town of Siversk.The capture of the town brings Russia closer to the last remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk still in Ukrainian hands in the Donetsk region.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJaroslav LukivandSean SeddonThe US has launched strikes against militants linked to the Islamic State group (IS) in north-western Nigeria, where militants have sought to establish a foothold. Camps run by the group in Sokoto state, which lies on Nigeria's border with Niger, were hit, the US military said, adding that an \"initial assessment\" suggested \"multiple\" fatalities.US President Donald Trump said the Christmas Day strikes were \"powerful and deadly\" and labelled the group \"terrorist scum\", saying it had been \"targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians\".Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" and had \"nothing to do with a particular religion\".Tuggar said the strikes had been planned \"for quite some time\" and had used intelligence information provided by Nigeria. He also did not rule out further strikes. Referencing the timing of the strikes, he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas, it could be any other day - it is to do with attacking terrorists who have been killing Nigerians\". The Nigerian government has for several years been fighting a complex network of jihadist groups, which includes Boko Haram and IS-linked splinter groups, but largely in the north-east of the country, hundreds of miles away from Sokoto state.The Trump administration has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks and has claimed a \"genocide\" is being perpetrated.Trump has previously labelled Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\", a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".The US military was ordered to prepare to intervene in Nigeria in November.At the time, an adviser to Nigerian President Bola Tinubu told BBC News that militants had targeted people \"across faiths\", and said any US military action should be carried out jointly. Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is divided roughly evenly between followers of the two religions.In a social media post late on Christmas Day confirming the strikes, Trump said that he would \"not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". \"Merry Christmas!\" he added, writing on X.The US Department of Defense later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a ship.On Friday morning, the Nigerian foreign ministry said in a statement that the country's authorities \"remain engaged in structured security co-operation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism\".\"This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West,\" the statement said.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and IS-linked offshoots have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people.Most victims have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group that analyses political violence around the world.Nigerian human rights lawyer and conflict analyst Bulama Bukati speculated that Thursday's strikes had targeted a relatively new IS-aligned splinter group, which originated in the Sahel region and has recently moved its fighters to Nigeria.The largest IS-linked group in Nigeria - Islamic State West Africa Province - operates in the north-east of the country, he told BBC World Service, while the smaller group - known locally as Lakurawa - has sought to establish a base in north-western Sokoto state. He continued: \"They started slipping into Nigeria in 2018 but over the past 18 months or two years they established camps in Sokoto state and Kebbi state.\"They have been launching attacks and imposing their social laws over people in Sokoto state over the past 18 months or so.\"According to BBC Monitoring, a pro-IS social media channel has been reporting on almost daily US reconnaissance flights in Sokoto, as well as in the north-eastern state of Borno, where the Nigeria's largest IS-linked group has its stronghold. In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture.Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed - but atrocities have been committed on both sides.The Nigeria strikes are the second major US intervention targeting IS in recent weeks.Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria.US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.Those strikes were launched in retaliation for the killing of three Americans - two soldiers and a civilian interpreter - in an ambush launched by the group.

Jurgen Dissman, chairman of Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team, said it was a \"busy month\" of people getting into difficulty due to the area's terrain \"being underestimated\". Nathan Mburu, 24, from London, became stuck on the route in May and said if it weren't for the rescue team, he and his friends could have died due to being \"overconfident\" and \"under-prepared\". Nathan, a fitness influencer, and his friends planned a weekend to tackle Crib Goch - an advanced scrambling route - when the three of them were free. While it wasn't his first climbing experience, with Nathan previously completing the three peaks challenge in Yorkshire, he admitted they didn't plan ahead. \"We didn't really look at the weather too much. It was more so 'we're free, let's do it',\" he said. The group left London early and, upon arrival, the friends noticed the weather beginning to change from a sunny day to windy and cloudy.  \"One of my friends was like, 'should we be doing this?' And I said, 'we just drove from London to do this. We're here now, we're gonna do it',\" he said. He admitted the nerves started to set in but, as they arrived at the base, adrenaline kicked in. Nathan MburuThe friends noticed the weather beginning to change from a sunny spring day to windy and cloudyThey continued through the heavy rain and wind and had just reached the ridge when Nathan started to feel a pain in his legs. \"I was just trying to warm up my legs, trying to get moving and it just couldn't happen,\" he said. It was then that Nathan and his friends realised they were stuck. \"We couldn't go down the way we came, otherwise we would have fallen off and then we couldn't go forward because I couldn't move,\" he said.He said at that moment he felt hopeless and it was then he called emergency services for help. Due to the weather conditions, Nathan and his friends waited nearly six hours before it was safe for the mountain rescue team to get to them.Nathan MburuNathan and his friends waited nearly six hours before it was safe for the mountain rescue team to get to themNathan started to feel the impact of hypothermia and began to lose consciousness on the ridge.  He recalled the relief he felt when the rescue team reached them.\"That feeling of seeing that torch in the distance was indescribable,\" he said. The men were assessed and treated by the team before they were equipped and assisted down the mountain. \"We were all rejoicing because at a certain point, we thought we were going to die. My friends were telling me 'Nathan, we thought you were dead.'\"Nathan MburuNathan says he's very appreciative of the mountain rescue team for getting themIn November, 15 of the 22 callouts Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team received required full team deployment.  British Mountaineering Council says the grade one scramble of Crib Goch can be relatively straightforward for most, but it warns it can become difficult during winter conditions. Mr Dissman said winter weather could turn a manageable day into something extremely dangerous very quickly. He added that if the weather was too severe, the team had to wait until conditions improved, and the delay could be long. \"We are highly trained and experienced, but rescuer safety will always be a major part of our decision-making,\" he added. A spokesperson for Brecon Mountain Rescue Team - which covers Wales' second largest national park, Bannau Brycheiniog - said it had also received call-outs where people had underestimated conditions.Nathan added that, while he believes it's good for people to challenge themselves, it's important to also \"be realistic and aware of your capabilities\". \"You see videos of people attempting these things. It's easy to think that you can do that when you're in the comfort of your own home,\" he said. \"But once you're out there, there's no turning back, and it's not as easy as it looks like on the screen.\"More top stories",

    "body": "4 hours agoGiancarlo RinaldiSouth Scotland reporterPA MediaThe cooling towers at Chapelcross were a prominent landmark in the south of ScotlandSeventy years ago work started on a project which profoundly changed the landscape of a part of southern Scotland.About 2,000 workers were drafted in as construction began in 1955 on the Chapelcross nuclear power station near Annan - the first in Scotland.It started generating electricity in 1959 and continued until 2004, with decommissioning work still ongoing on the site today.Now there are plans in place which could continue its role meeting the nation's energy needs - but from very different sources.Getty ImagesThe plant generated electricity for about 45 yearsBuilding the plant was a massive task with the concrete housing the four reactors up to eight feet (2.5m) thick.Its four cooling towers - which became a familiar landmark before being demolished in 2007 - stood 300ft (91m) high.The site was officially opened on 2 May 1959 and at its peak provided employment for hundreds of people.At full power it could generate enough electricity to meet the needs of every home in south west Scotland, the Borders and Cumbria.It also produced vital elements for use in atomic bombs.Richard MurrayRichard Murray has worked at Chapelcross for more than 30 yearsAfter it ceased operation there were some calls for a replacement nuclear plant to be built on the site but the Scottish government is opposed to constructing new ones.Instead, it is hoped the area can take advantage of its links to the national grid by becoming a green energy hub and ensure it remains a big employer in the area.One man who has seen more of its story than most is site director for Nuclear Restoration Services at Chapelcross, Richard Murray.Courtesy Nuclear Restoration ServicesAbout 700 staff were employed at the plant at its peak making it one of the area's biggest employersHe started out as an apprentice in 1987 and has spent a little over 30 years of his career in total at the Dumfries and Galloway plant.\"I'm an Annan person, born and bred,\" he said.\"I've had quite a number of aunts and uncles and cousins work on the site, so I've got quite a long family affinity to the site as well and obviously being brought up in Annan I knew a large number of people who worked here.\"He said its importance for the local economy was hard to overstate.\"At its peak, it was well in excess of 700 people employed here,\" he said.\"It was a 24/7 operation, 365 days a year - parts of the town of Annan were built to accommodate the site in terms of housing workers from the area.\"Courtesy Nuclear Restoration ServicesThe plant opened in 1959There are still about 200 people working during decommissioning so it remains an important employer but well short of the numbers it once had.He said the taking down of the cooling towers in 2007 was a big moment as many people from the area used to say that when you saw them you knew you were nearly home.\"From my own personal perspective, I could see them from my bedroom window when I was growing up as a child, so it was a real landmark for the area,\" he added.He hopes it can see worker numbers rise again in its new role looking at hydrogen, solar power, battery storage and developing renewables technology.Courtesy Nuclear Restoration ServicesTechnology has moved on since the Chapelcross plant was builtAlongside it, of course, is the decommissioning process where Richard says they have \"decades of work ahead\".The latest estimate was another 70 years at least which will have to be carried out alongside any new developments.Richard said new nuclear plants were very different to Chapelcross and he believed it still had its part to play in meeting the nation's energy needs.The Scottish Greens, though, are happy to see it take on a different role.\"Turning the site into a green energy hub is a great opportunity,\" said the party's Laura Moodie.\"It means clean power, good jobs, and a real step towards tackling the climate crisis.\"Repurposing old sites for renewables, especially if done alongside training and supporting local workers, is exactly the kind of forward thinking Scotland needs.\"Courtesy Nuclear Restoration ServicesBuilding the plant was a massive operation and needed about 2,000 workersThe details of exactly what it means are still being fine-tuned.Graeme Anderson, the chief executive of CX Power, strategic developer of the green energy hub plans, said they were still at an \"early and exciting stage\".\"Our focus right now is on developing ideas, building strong relationships, and working closely with the local community and stakeholders to understand what matters most to them and where opportunities lie,\" he said.They hope that can deliver \"real, long-term benefits\" for the whole of the region on a site which pioneered nuclear power in Scotland.Courtesy Nuclear Restoration ServicesPlans have been drawn up to turn the site into a green energy hub",

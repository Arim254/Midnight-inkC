The Trump administration has been defending its seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast.  In a dramatic video shared by the US Attorney General, armed camouflaged soldiers are shown swinging down ropes from low flying helicopters, and running along the vessel’s decks. \nThe US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".  The Venezuela government in response has called the seizure blatant theft, claiming Trump is after the country’s rich oil and energy resources. \nIn this episode, Sarah and Justin unpack how far Donald Trump is willing to go in his ongoing campaign against the Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.   In recent months, the US president has accused Maduro of “forcing” criminals into the US and facilitating drug smuggling, which Maduro denies.  And this week, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the killing of over 80 people in US military strikes on alleged drug boats as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere”.  \nThe Americast team also look at how this fits in with other South American countries, with Trump recently offering Honduran ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández a ‘full and complete pardon’.   \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against a Georgia county seeking access to 2020 voting records, as Donald Trump continues to assert the presidential election was stolen from him.The justice department lawsuit asks the state to turn over \"all used and void ballots, stubs of all ballots, signature envelopes, and corresponding envelope digital files from the 2020 General Election in Fulton County\".The government accuses the county of violating the Civil Rights Act, after local officials said that the ballots were sealed and could not be produced without a court order.Trump narrowly lost the state of Georgia to Joe Biden in 2020 - one of several losses that cost him the White House.According to the lawsuit, the justice department sent a subpoena to Fulton County election officials in October demanding the ballot materials, citing a need to investigate \"compliance with federal election law\".In a statement on Friday,  Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said that states must protect against \"vote dilution\".\"At this Department of Justice, we will not permit states to jeopardize the integrity and effectiveness of elections by refusing to abide by our federal elections laws,\" she said.. \"If states will not fulfil their duty to protect the integrity of the ballot, we will.\"The county did not immediately return requests for comment.After losing the 2020 election to Biden, Trump alleged widespread fraud. Numerous courts rejected the legal challenges brought by his campaigns and allies.Georgia, particularly Fulton County and the greater Atlanta region, became a focal point of Trump's challenges to the 2020 election results.After the election, Trump called Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and told him, \"I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\"Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's elections and certifies results, confirmed that Biden won the state even after multiple reviews.His office declined to comment on the justice department's lawsuit.Later, it was in Fulton County that Trump was criminally charged in connection with a scheme to overturn the state's election results.Fulton County prosecutor Fani Willis brought an unsuccessful racketeering case against him alleging he led a criminal conspiracy to undermine Georgia's election results. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges in August 2023.A judge dismissed the case earlier this month, after a series of procedural blows hampered the prosecution and Trump's return to the White House in 2025 put the case on ice.The Georgia election interference case was once considered the most threatening of Trump's four criminal indictments, because he could not pardon himself from state-level charges if he returned to office.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulAFP via Getty ImagesIranian security forces have \"violently arrested\" Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, her foundation has said. The Narges Foundation said Ms Mohammadi, 53, was detained in the eastern city of Mashhad, along with other activists. The Nobel Committee said it was \"deeply concerned by today's brutal arrest of Narges Mohammadi\" and called on the authorities \"to immediately clarify Mohammadi's whereabouts, ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\". Iran does not appear to have commented.  Ms Mohammadi was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights. In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from jail for three weeks on medical grounds, after being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison since 2021. She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences. Her latest arrest reportedly came as she attended a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer found dead in his office last week. Norway-based group Iran Human Rights had called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances around his death were \"suspicious\". Several other activists were detained at the ceremony, where it's reported they shouted slogans, including \"death to the dictator\" and \"long live Iran\". Taghi Rahmani, Ms Mohammadi's husband, told BBC Persian: \"They arrested Narges violently. The brother of the lawyer witnessed her arrest at the memorial.\"This act is against human rights laws, and amounts to some kind of revenge. \"This happened in Mashhad today and is concerning because the establishment's crackdown has intensified recently.\"Ms Mohammadi had recently accused the Iranian authorities of intensifying repression since the June ceasefire with Israel. Last week she wrote an article for Time magazine about the Iranian state controlling all aspects of personal or public life. \"Their peace is disrupted by surveillance, censorship, arbitrary arrest, torture, and the constant threat of violence,\" she said. She had also told the Nobel Committee she had received warnings from \"agents of the regime\" through indirect channels and her lawyers. \"The threats conveyed to Ms Mohammadi make it clear that her security is at stake, unless she commits to end all public engagement within Iran, as well as any international advocacy or media appearances in support of democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression,\" the Nobel committee's statement added.Over the past year, she has continued to remain defiant, refusing to wear the mandatory headscarf and meeting fellow activists across the country.Across her lifetime, Mohammadi has been arrested 13 times and been sentenced to more 36 years imprisonment and 154 lashes, according to her foundation.

    "body": "From booze to black belts: Virginia's drunk raccoon suspected in karate shop break-inA raccoon that broke into a Virginia store and joyfully drank its way through the liquor aisle is now suspected of a wider crime spree, officials say.A Hanover animal control officer suspects the stripe-tailed mammal also broke into a nearby karate studio and then raided the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for snacks.\"Supposedly, this is the third break-in he's had,\" said Officer Samantha Martin.The raccoon, now nicknamed the \"trashed panda\", was first discovered passed out in the bathroom of the Ashland liquor store two days after Thanksgiving. After sobering up, the unlikely outlaw was released back into the wild.A new study found the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving and getting comfortable around humans.Ms Martin says it's only a matter of time before the masked bandit strikes the shopping centre again.\"This is not the first time he's been in one of the buildings,\" she told the county government's official podcast, Hear in Hanover, on Thursday. \"He was in the karate studio. I think he got into the DMV [and] ate some of their snacks one time,\" she said. She later added that there is a chance the earlier break-ins could have been perpetrated by a different raccoon - but officials have identified him as their prime suspect.Raccoons are known for breaking into peoples garbage cans, leading to the nickname \"trash panda\".The county has been selling shirts with the logo \"trashed panda\" and has raised a whopping $207,000 (£155,000) as of Friday. The money will be used to renovate the shelter, and add to its capacity, Ms Martin said. Officials say the little Kung Fu trash panda was living his best life when he was detained in the liquor store and kept his spirits up even after being placed in the county kennel. \"I just set him in there, [and] let him kinda relax for a few hours. The sun was beating on him so he was feeling good,\" Ms Martin said, adding that he was released about one mile away from the shopping complex. \"He didn't do anything wrong. He was just having a good time.\" The story has gone viral, which Ms Martin says is because it is so \"relatable\".\"Everybody's been there,\" she says. \"Everybody's had a few extra and passed out by the toilet, and hopes somebody can come get you the next morning.\"\"I hope he learned his lesson,\" she said, before adding that there's a good chance he might be found committing another heist soon. \"He'll be back. He's not a dummy.\" ",

    "body": "1 hour agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandMatt SpiveyFighting between Thai and Cambodian forces continued early on Saturday hours after US President Donald Trump said the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire.Thai prime minister Anutin Charnvirakul said he told the US president a ceasefire would only be possible after Cambodia had withdrawn all its forces and removed landmines.\"Thailand will continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people. I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke,\" he said on social media.Shelling continued overnight, as Thai forces push to take a number of vantage points along the border. At least 21 people have died in the renewed fighting and 700,000 have been evacuated on both sides.Trump had claimed earlier in the week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out on Monday just by picking up the phone.After speaking to both prime ministers on Friday night he wrote on social media that the two countries had agreed to \"cease shooting effective this evening\" and go back to the agreement they signed in front of the US president in October.\"Both countries are ready for peace,\" he wrote.However, Anutin said he told Trump that Thailand was not the aggressor, and that Cambodia must show that it had withdrawn its forces and removed landmines from the border before a ceasefire was possible. \"They must show us first,\" he said.There was no mention of the use of tariffs as leverage to force the two sides to disengage, as happened in July.Thailand has warned the US not to link the conflict to trade.On Saturday Cambodia reported that it had been struck by more Thai air strikes.\"On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs\" on a number of targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said in an X post.\"Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet,\" it said.The Thai military also confirmed that fighting continued.The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.Both countries have accused each other of initiating the attacks. After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.However both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.Since then, tensions continued to build.This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.",

    "body": "9 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondent Angry French farmers are calling for more protests over the government-backed slaughter of cattle herds affected by so-called Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD).On Thursday there were clashes between riot police and demonstrators in the southern Ariège department, after vets were called in to destroy potentially contaminated cattle at a farm.Elsewhere in the south, farmers have dumped manure outside government buildings and blocked roads. The offices of several environmentalist groups were ransacked in the Charente-Maritime department.LSD is a highly contagious bovine disease which is transmitted mainly by fly-bites.  The symptoms are fever, mucal discharge and nodules on the skin.Though mainly non-fatal, it can badly affect milk-production and the cows are unsaleable. The disease arrived in Europe from Africa about ten years ago. France's first outbreak was in the Alps in June, when an infected herd forced the Tour de France cycle race to cut short one of its stages.The government's policy of slaughtering entire herds where a single animal has been infected has run up against bitter opposition from two of the three main farmers' unions.Conféderation Rurale and Conféderation Paysanne say the policy is being brutally applied, and is in any case unnecessary because a combination of selective culling and vaccination would suffice.But most vets disagree. \"Right now we are unable to tell the difference between a healthy animal and a symptomless animal carrying the virus. That is the only reason we have to carry out these whole-herd slaughters,\" said Stephanie Philizot who heads the SNGTV vets' union.Since June there have been around 110 outbreaks of LSD in France, originally in the east but now increasingly in the south-west. Ministry officials blame the illegal movement of cattle from affected zones. Around 3,000 animals have been slaughtered.The French government is worried the protests could snowball into a wider movement among a farming population that feels itself under growing threat from the imposition of EU norms and competition from abroad.A big protest is planned in Brussels next week during the summit of EU leaders.  Several French farming sectors are in deep crisis, from wine-growers hit by falling consumption to poultry farmers hit by avian flu.There is also widespread opposition to the impending signature of an EU free-trade agreement with South American countries, which farmers fear will open France to more cheap food imports, much of it produced under looser environmental and sanitary constraints.",

    "body": "4 hours agoVitaly ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringWarehouses supplying the vast majority of Ukraine's pharmacies have been destroyed in a series of Russian attacks over recent months.Medical supplies worth about $200m (£145m) were destroyed in just two strikes in December and October.A large warehouse storing medicines in the city of Dnipro was destroyed in a Russian air strike on 6 December. As a result, about $110m worth of medicines were destroyed - estimated at up to 30% of Ukraine's monthly supply.\"It was a missile and drone strike against our facility. The missiles flew past, but the drones hit it,\" said Dmytro Babenko, acting director-general of pharmaceutical distributor BADM.\"They caused a fire which unfortunately proved impossible to contain and the whole facility was destroyed.\"BADM is one of two companies that supply about 85% of Ukrainian pharmacies in roughly equal shares.The other company is Optima Pharm, whose warehouses have been hit three times this year - on 28 August, 25 October and 15 November.The October attack destroyed its main storage facility in Kyiv, and cost the company more than $100m, says Optima Pharm's chief financial officer Artem Suprun.Russia denies hitting civilian targets, but when the Optima Pharm warehouse was hit in October, the defence ministry in Moscow said only that it had targeted a factory producing drones.On the day BADM's warehouse was destroyed, Russia said it had hit \"a warehouse storing military equipment\" as well as energy and transport infrastructure.Such attacks significantly complicate the treatment of sick and wounded in Ukraine,   after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war.The International Rescue Committee (IRC), an NGO that had been using the warehouse in Dnipro, says it lost $195,000 worth of medication and supplies, which could have served 30,000 people in need.\"When I arrived at the site I was devastated, the scene was simply awful. All of this medicine could have served people for years, and in a single moment it was all lost,\" says the IRC's Andriy Moskalenko.The IRC said the Dnipro facility had served \"as a critical hub for hospitals, healthcare providers, pharmacies and humanitarian actors\".Mr Babenko from BADM said the Russian attack had destroyed \"vitally important medicines\" that had been imported and are not produced in Ukraine.\"It's a pretty complicated situation,\" he told the BBC.But he is hopeful that the attack will not leave Ukrainians without medicines.\"There won't be significant shortages, possibly only of certain types of goods. We're hoping to restore all supplies in a month or a month-and-a-half,\" Mr Babenko said.Ukrainian authorities accuse Russia of deliberately targeting hospitals, ambulances, medics and rescue workers, claims Moscow has denied. According to the government in Kyiv, more than 2,500 medical institutions have been damaged or destroyed, and more than 500 civilian doctors, nurses and other medical workers killed.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said it had recorded 2,763 attacks on Ukraine's healthcare system since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, and it said that in 2025 there had been a 12% increase in attacks from the previous year.",

    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer has urged resident doctors not to go ahead with \"reckless\" strikes planned for next week, saying it is \"beyond belief\" they could take place during a flu outbreak.The prime minister said the NHS is in its \"most precarious moment\" since the coronavirus pandemic due to soaring flu cases across the UK, and that strikes would put the healthcare system and its patients in \"grave danger\".The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), is polling its members to see if they are willing to call off the walkout, with the results to be released on Monday.But if they vote against it, a five-day strike by resident doctors will begin two days later on Wednesday 17 December. A BMA spokesperson said the government could stop the strike by tackling pay, conditions and trust with a credible offer.Flu has come early this winter, and it looks to be a particularly nasty season because of a new mutated version of the virus which is circulating, say experts. Many are now calling it \"super flu\", but it is not more severe nor harder to treat.An average of 2,660 patients per day were in hospital with flu in England last week – the highest ever for this time of year and up 55% on the week before, NHS England said.Flu cases are also rising in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, figures show. Children and young people are particularly affected by the outbreak, health officials said.Writing in the Guardian, Sir Keir said the strikes \"should not happen\" and said resident doctors, formerly known as junior doctors, should accept a deal to avert industrial action.Sir Keir said as well as the government's new offer, they had also given the BMA the chance to reschedule the strikes until after Christmas. \"Don't get me wrong – of course I would rather they were cancelled... But under the circumstances, I wanted to be sure we have left no stone unturned in our efforts to protect the NHS,\" he said.The BMA said it will ask its members whether the government's offer will be enough to call off Wednesday's strikes.If members indicate yes, then they will be given time to consider the offer in more detail and a formal follow-up referendum would be held on ending the dispute completely.The offer aims to address problems for some doctors trying to find work and to provide more training places for newly qualified medics to progress in their careers.Health Secretary Wes Streeting made a similar intervention to Sir Keir's on Friday, warning strikes coupled with increasing flu patients would be a \"double whammy\" for the NHS.However, the medical director for the NHS in London, Chris Streather, said the flu situation was \"well within the boundaries\" of what the NHS could cope with and that hospitals were better prepared for large disease outbreaks since the Covid pandemic.

    "body": "10 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterEPAReform UK claims it is now the largest political party in Britain, following reports Labour has lost more members.According to the Times newspaper, internal figures show Labour's membership has fallen below 250,000.Reform said it had more than 268,000 paid-up members, which would mean it has overtaken Labour to become the biggest party by membership in the UK.Labour refused to comment on the accuracy of the membership figures in the Times, with a spokesperson saying they would be published in the party's annual report.There is no legal obligation for political parties to publish their membership figures, which are not verified by outside bodies.Reform tracks its membership figures using a live online counter, which the party said only included people who had paid an annual fee of £25 or £10 for under-25s.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"As we have suspected for some time, Reform has overtaken Labour to become the largest political party in British politics - a huge milestone on our journey to win the next election. \"The age of two-party politics is dead.\"The party has consistently been leading in national opinion polls since the spring.Labour's membership has been steadily falling since Sir Keir Starmer became leader in April 2020, according to the latest publicly available figures.The party's annual accounts published in August put the party's membership at 333,235 at the end of last year, down from a peak of more than 530,000 under Jeremy Corbyn.Despite the party's landslide election victory, it shed 37,000 members over the course of 2024 and reports suggest this trend has continued.In February, the LabourList website reported the party's membership had fallen to around 309,000 and the Times says the figure has now dropped below 250,000.A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Our membership figures are published in our annual report. We do not give a running a commentary on them throughout the year.\"The party's standard membership fee is £70.50 a year, with reduced rates of £35.50 or £12 available for certain groups.The Mainstream network, a new Labour campaign group which includes supporters of Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, said: \"To transform Britain and defeat the far-right, Labour needs a grassroots movement in every community.\"Our plummeting membership figures prove the top-down model has failed. The answer is to democratise, open up, and empower members.\"Meanwhile, the Green Party says it has seen a surge in membership since Zack Polanski took over as the party's new leader in September, rising from around 70,000 to more than 180,000.The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures.Some 131,680 members were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election but reports suggest the party's membership has fallen to around 123,000 since then.The number of Liberal Democrat members has also dropped, almost halving over the last five years to around 60,000.Your Party - the new left-wing outfit founded by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana - says it has 55,000 paid-up members.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKing Charles III's video message providing an update on his cancer treatment is the focus of Saturday's papers. \"Strong to reign over us\", the Sun splashes on its front page, writing: \"King Charles revealed the 'good news' that doctors are reducing his cancer treatment – almost two years since his diagnosis.\" In a Channel 4 broadcast of the King's pre-recorded video, the paper quotes him saying \"early diagnosis quite simply saves lives\". \"Good news by sticking to doctor's orders\" is the Daily Express's take, quoting the King - who said his \"early diagnosis, effective intervention, and adherence to doctor's orders\" means his scheduled treatment can be reduced next year.The Daily Telegraph leads with the monarch's emphasis on the benefits of early diagnosis. It reports King Charles did not confirm if he is \"in remission\". He used his speech to insist cancer detection is \"not as 'frightening, embarrassing or uncomfortable' as some imagined... calling it a 'few moments of minor inconvenience'\", according to the paper.The Daily Mail says the King's news has brought \"Christmas cheer\" to the royal family. It quotes an anonymous royal source who describes it as a \"just about the best Christmas present\" the 77-year-old monarch \"could have asked for\".The King uses his cancer \"milestone\" to \"urge Britons to go for life-saving treatment\" is the Times's headline. The paper provides some behind-the-scenes details on its front page, saying the short film was \"recorded in the Morning Room at Clarence House in the last week of November\". It also says the King wore a \"Stand Up To Cancer\" badge in the video as part of Channel 4's broader campaign.The King's TV message \"offers hope to others\", the Daily Mirror says in its headline, describing his address as \"touching\". \"King Charles: I was overwhelmed by my cancer diagnosis,\" is the headline on the Independent's front page. It also features photos released on Friday from the estate of the late convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein, which include photos of US President Donald Trump, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and former US President Bill Clinton. Being pictured in files related Epstein is not an indication of wrongdoing.\"EU freezes €210bn (£185bn) of Russian assets\" is the top story in the FT Weekend. The move \"paves the way for a loan to be raised against the assets to prop up Ukraine's defence\" against Russia, according to the paper. However, EU members must \"overcome strong objections from Belgium, where the assets are mostly held\", as it seeks to avoid legal and financial reprisal from Russia, according to the paper.\"Urgent NHS drive to give children the flu vaccine before Christmas\" is the i weekend's headline story. Health officials warn \"unvaccinated children may risk passing the virus to older relatives during family gatherings\", the paper writes. The NHS is \"braced for one of its toughest winters on record\", the paper says, noting the North East and Yorkshire have the \"worst hospitalisation rates\" in the UK.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticises planned doctors strikes during a flu outbreak as \"reckless\" and \"beyond belief\", the Guardian reports. Sir Keir has penned a column in the paper accusing the doctor's union, the British Medical Association (BMA), of placing \"the NHS and patients who need it in grave danger\". The paper quotes the BMA saying the government \"should not be scaremongering\" and making the public think \"that the NHS will not be able to look after them and their loved ones\".\"Teen darts sensation Luke Littler\" was almost derailed by a wasp on stage during his first round win at the World Championship in Ally Pally (Alexandra Palace), reports the Daily Star. \"Other players have been told to bee on the guard!\" the paper quips.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "A nonprofit organisation tasked by the US Congress with helping preserve historic sites has sued the White House to stop construction on President Donald Trump's new ballroom.The National Trust for Historic Preservation filed the suit on Friday, arguing that the White House failed to seek necessary reviews before demolishing the historic East Wing in October.\"No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Joe Biden, and not anyone else,\" the lawsuit says.The White House has called the project a \"much needed and exquisite addition\".The lawsuit represents the first major legal challenge to the ballroom project. The organisation is asking a federal court in Washington DC to halt construction on the addition until the White House \"complies with the law by going through the legally mandated review processes\", including a public comment public period, according to a statement.\"The White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognized symbol of our powerful American ideals,\" said Carol Quillen, President of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit organisation  created in 1949 with a congressional charter.The group said it was \"compelled\" to go to court after the White House ignored  concerns it raised in October.In the lawsuit, the group argues that the White House broke the law by beginning construction without filing plans with the National Capital Planning Commission, by not seeking an environmental assessment of the project, and by declining to seek authorisation from Congress.It also alleges Trump is violating the US Constitution, \"which reserves to Congress the right to dispose of and make all rules regarding property belonging to the United States\".The White House said in a statement responding to the lawsuit on Friday that \"President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House - just like all of his predecessors did.\"The East Wing was demolished in October to make way for Trump's multi-million dollar ballroom, which he says is being paid for by private donors. Since then, the proposed blueprint has expanded from a ballroom with a capacity of 500 people to a space that can fit 1,350 guests.The White House had pledged previously that its construction plan would be assessed by the National Capital Planning Commission before building began, but the lawsuit claims that the site is already undergoing extensive construction.The lawsuit describes the White House grounds as \"a bustling construction site, with dozens of workers driving piles, stockpiling materials, and amassing heavy machinery. \"Just last week, a towering construction crane was erected on the White House grounds, and President Trump recounted that work on the Ballroom Project was audible all night.\"Last week, the White House replaced the architect overseeing the project. The previous lead architect had reportedly clashed with Trump officials over the size and scope of the addition.On Thursday night, Trump, a former real estate developer, promised that the ballroom would be built before he leaves office in 2028.\"You know, for 150 years, they've been trying to do a ballroom,\" Trump said at the Congressional Ball.  \"They never got it up, but we got it off. In a very short period of time, like about a year and a half, you're going to have the best ballroom anywhere in the country.\"",

    "body": "When does a 147 become a 180?When you're Ronnie O'Sullivan, making more history. That's when.In a year when snooker's maximum break, once considered as suppositious as the Himalayan Yeti, has repeatedly shown up for the cameras, it fell to O'Sullivan to show that nobody does it better.When he sank his second maximum in barely two hours at the Saudi Arabia Masters in August, O'Sullivan secured a record £180,333 in bonuses.As his 50th birthday arrives in December, O'Sullivan retains an audacious streak that sets him apart. Nearly three decades after his famous five-minute 147 at the Crucible, he remains pure box office.But O'Sullivan, who begins his bid for a record-extending ninth UK title on Tuesday, is not alone in knowing the route to a maximum. There have been an eye-watering 25 already on the professional tour in 2025, obliterating the calendar year best of 14 - 2024's tally.Chang Bingyu's 147 in November came in a UK Championship qualifier in Wigan. It took the tour's 2025-26 season total to a record 16 - the campaign began in late June and runs until May.England's Shaun Murphy has made two maximums in 2025 - timeless brilliance from the 2005 world champion and this year's Masters winner.Ireland's Aaron Hill has also had two 147s in 2025, and if you're thinking \"who's Aaron Hill?\", you're probably not alone.He's the world number 43, but he's had wins against Judd Trump and O'Sullivan. Remember the name.BBC Sport has spoken to Murphy and Hill about this rush of maximums.So what's happening, given the recipe - 15 reds and blacks followed by the colours in order - remains untouched?And what next, if the code to snooker's one-time final frontier has been cracked?\"You can imagine Moira Stuart in 1983 coming on the Six O'Clock News and telling the nation Cliff Thorburn's had a 147 at the Crucible. It would now get missed because it's just like, 'oh, there's been another 147'.\"That's the verdict of Murphy, fourth on the all-time list with 10 maximums.He is not wrong. Thorburn's maximum was a defining moment for 1983's armchair sports fan, alongside Steve Cram and Daley Thompson winning World Athletics Championship golds in Helsinki.It was only the second official maximum, Steve Davis making the first at the Lada Classic in Oldham 15 months earlier. Davis' reward? One of the sponsor's cars.There were just eight 147s across the 1980s, a snooker decade bursting with soap opera drama and towering characters.For sheer quality, nothing touches the current era.One long-time Crucible spectator, who also attended World Championship qualifiers at Stockport in the early 1980s, recently said of the latter: \"You were lucky if you saw a fifty break all day. People think it was the glory days, but the standard was terrible.\"At the World Championship qualifiers this year, Wales' Jackson Page became the first player to have two 147s in the same tour match.Page did not reach the Crucible but earned £167,000 in bonuses and £15,000 for reaching the final qualifying round - total earnings just £18,000 short of Mark Williams' prize as the tournament's runner-up.\"Players are chasing their career records and the tour are putting incentives out there,\" says Murphy.\"People are more aware of these challenges. They're practising for them.\"Alex Higgins never had a maximum break on tour. Nor did fellow world champions Terry Griffiths, Dennis Taylor, Joe Johnson, John Spencer and Ray Reardon.Davis was one and out.Yet Hill made two inside four weeks. The 23-year-old from Cork cannot believe Higgins never had a maximum.But Hill says: \"There will be a lot of players who haven't had one. It was always a goal to have my name on the board of those who have. The buzz is great.\"Everyone on the tour now could make one. We're almost expecting one in every tournament. It's everyone egging each other on.\"Is Hill pleasingly rich now? Not quite.His maximums came at September's English Open and October's Xi'an Grand Prix, events with £5,000 high-break prizes and no bonuses. Rubbing it in, there were other maximums, so the money was shared with Ali Carter at the English Open and split three ways in China.Is there a 147 society on tour? A WhatsApp group unlocked by a first maximum?\"There won't be anything like that. Players aren't that friendly!\" Hill says.I think if there is a knack to it, it's seeing it early, like with a 59 in golf when you make a few birdies in the first few holes and think 'I'm on for something good here'.If you come to the table early and take a couple of reds and couple of blacks, and you see the black's available to both pockets and the reds aren't on cushions, we all think 'hang on a minute, there's a 147 on here'.I've always been proud of the one I made in the Shoot Out a couple of seasons ago because I tried to make it from the very first pot.To have the personal challenge of 'let's see how far down the 147 journey you can get', and then get it in the cauldron of the Shoot Out, was pretty special.I think I'd had three or four double gin and tonics - that had something to do with it. It's not quite as serious as some events and the hospitality was being well used.When you're on a maximum, everyone in the room knows it and it heightens their attention.Everyone's focus zooms in on you. When I made one at the Masters this year at Ally Pally the whole room went silent.Are maximums losing their magic? I don't think so.Snooker awaits its first official maximum by a woman. China's Bai Yulu had a 145 at the recent International Championship.Two 147s in the same match has been achieved. Two in successive frames next?The 155 (a 147 plus eight points from a free-ball scenario, external at the start of a frame) has never been achieved in competition. Footage exists of Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh making one in practice.The 167 is \"probably the next step\", says Murphy. At the Riyadh Season Championship, a player must follow a 147 with a 20-point golden ball to earn $1m (£760,000), snooker's biggest prize.Ronnie O'Sullivan, he's coming for you...Murphy suggests the surge of maximums is easily explained.\"I just think everyone's getting better,\" he says. \"Some of the players down the rankings that the general public have never heard of, on their day they can beat anyone.\"World Snooker Tour points to improving \"quality and consistency of playing conditions\", crediting table-fitting teams and suppliers.The players are the ones sinking the balls though.Hill has two maximums. O'Sullivan holds the record of 17.Watch out Ronnie, he's coming for you.It is said in jest, but Hill fancies the chase.\"At the end of my career, I believe I'll be well up there with maximum breaks,\" he says.At the very least - and Murphy is the same - Hill will go about his daily business with the thought in the back of his mind that the next frame is rich in promise.Sink the red, add the black. Rinse and repeat.",

    "body": "7 hours agoTabby WilsonLuca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Mayor Andrea Biancani said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoBefore it was opened on 29 November, Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Alamy/Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoOpera star Luciano Pavarotti's statue seen earlier in the year in the town of Pesaro (left), and in November, surrounded by an ice rink (right).Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

    "body": "27 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterJustice Secretary David Lammy told BBC Breakfast two of the 12 prisoners released are still at largeJustice Secretary David Lammy has said 12 prisoners have been accidentally released in the past three weeks, two of whom are still at large.It comes on top of the 91 prisoners who were freed by mistake between April and October in England and Wales.Speaking to the BBC, Lammy said there would always be a \"human error\" while prisons were using a paper-based system and that the situation would improve once a \"completely digital system\" was adopted.He said there had been \"a spike\" in accidental releases but added it was now on \"a downward trajectory\".Speaking to ITV later, Lammy said he had been \"reassured\" that the two prisoners at large were not violent or sex offenders.\"I'm not going to give details of those cases, because these are operational decisions made by the police, and you'll understand if they're about to arrest somebody they don't want me to blow the cover,\" he added.The subject of accidental releases gained attention after Hadush Kebatu, who was jailed after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel in Epping, was mistakenly freed.Kebatu was re-arrested two days after his release and has now been deported to Ethiopia. Shortly after Kebatu's release, news emerged of two other prisoners who had been released in error - William Smith, who later handed himself in, and Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, who was rearrested. The cases led to the government implementing new security measures including a \"clear checklist\" for prison governors to follow when releasing prisoners.The latest releases happened since 11 November, when Lammy gave a statement to the House of Commons, outlining the steps the government was taking to resolve the issue.The number of prisoners who have been let out in error rose by 128% last year, increasing from 115 in 2023-2024 to 262 in the following year.There were just over 57,000 releases of prisoners who had finished the custodial part of their sentences in England and Wales in 2024-25 - a rise of about 13% on the year before. The figures on mistaken releases include cases where individuals were released either too early or too late.Lammy acknowledged there had been a rise in numbers adding: \"I want to bring it down but we have got a mountain to climb.\"He said the problem had been partly caused by the system losing 6,000 officers under the previous Conservative government. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick has previously blamed the increase on \"the confusion created by Labour's botched early release scheme\", a project introduced by the government to ease overcrowding in prisons.Responding to the news of the 12 new prisoner releases, he said \"The public are consistently being put at risk because of his shambolic management. When will this fiasco end?\"Liberal Democrat spokeswoman Jess Brown-Fuller said: \"It's utterly unacceptable that public safety has been put at risk yet again - both the government and the prison service must own up to their failures and guarantee that these mistakes will stop happening once and for all.\"Last month, Lammy set out the actions the government was taking to tackle the problem including investing up to £10m for new AI tools to reduce human error and upgrade the paper-based system used by the prison system.The government has also asked former deputy commissioner of the Met Police Dame Lynne Owens to conduct a review into the mistakes that led to Kebatu's release and what had led to errors across the prison estate. She is due to report back in February 2026. Charlie Taylor, chief inspector of prisons, has said the rising number of mistaken releases was evidence that \"something is going badly wrong\" with the prison system. Speaking to the BBC in October, he said mistakes partly occurred because \"inexperienced\" staff were having to deal with \"huge caseloads\".He added that prisons were having to adapt to different policies including various early release schemes introduced both by the previous Conservative government and the current Labour one.Taylor also said that many prisons are \"reliant\" on officers from West African countries and warned that new Home Office visa rules could mean they would have to leave the UK.

    "body": "Image source, Reuters/Tony MelvilleByHelen WillettsLead Weather Presenter and Ben RichLead Weather PresenterDecember has arrived, ushering in the start of meteorological winter.However if you prefer to wait for the winter solstice before getting your scarf and gloves out you will have to wait for a few more weeks. The solstice marks the shortest day - and longest night - in the northern hemisphere and the start of astronomical winter.Technically speaking the solstice is a specific moment, not a whole day and in 2025 it happens at 15:03 on 21 December.What is the winter solstice and what happens during it?The word 'solstice' comes from the Latin sol, meaning 'sun', and sistere - to 'stand still'.The winter solstice is the moment the Sun appears to stand still, directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, the most southerly latitude it reaches annually.This gives the southern hemisphere its longest day of the year with the Sun reaching its highest angle in the sky.It leaves the northern hemisphere with less sunlight and consequently its maximum amount of darkness.We have solstices because the Earth is tilted on its axis by 23.5 degrees, which affects which part of the planet's surface the sun is directly overhead at any given time.Image caption, The part of the Earth tilted towards the sun varies throughout the yearAfter the winter solstice the Sun begins to move north again relative to the equator until eventually - six months later - it reaches it most northerly point, overhead the Tropic of Cancer, and gives us the summer solstice.Midway between the two solstices we have the equinoxes where the sun is directly over the equator.Media caption, Tomasz Schafernaker explains more about the winter solsticeWhy does the date of the solstice vary?The date of the winter solstice can vary slightly from year to year. This is because Earth takes around 365.24 days (give or take a few decimal places) to complete an orbit around the Sun - so not an exact year.It means the timing of the solstice slips by about six hours each year, which adds up to a full day over four years.At this point we observe a leap year, an extra day in the calendar, allowing the solstice to revert back to its earlier date.Other factors that influence the timing of the solstices include variations in the length of the Earth's orbit, and a wobble in its axis caused by its rotation.How much daylight will there be?Due to the tilt of the Earth the winter solstice will mean shorter days at higher latitudes.In the UK the day will be shorter the further north you are, and you can check the exact sunrise and sunset times for your location on the BBC Weather website and app.Within the Arctic Circle - down to a latitude of 23.5 degrees from the North Pole - the sun will not rise at all.Image caption, South-west England will have just over eight hours of daylight, northern Scotland will see six and a half - but in the north of Norway it will stay dark all dayIs the solstice the start of winter?This depends on how we define the seasons.Meteorological winter starts on 1 December - approximately three weeks before the solstice - and runs until the final day of February.This is because weather forecasters divide the year into four equal chunks of three months each, with spring running from March to May, summer from June to August and autumn from September until November.It means weather records are standardised, using the same dates every year, allowing for straightforward analysis of changes in the climate over time.However the astronomical seasons are defined by the Earth's position in its orbit, marked out by the solstices and equinoxes.And so by this criteria, the winter solstice is the first day of winter.",

He was released after seven months of the six-year sentence.He was previously sentenced to six years in 2010 for supporting anti-government protests and creating \"propaganda against the system\". He was released on conditional bail after two months.In an interview with the Financial Times conducted in Los Angeles shortly before his latest sentence was delivered, he recalled a recent conversation with an elderly Iranian exile who he had met in the city.\"She begged me not to go back,\" he said. \"But I told her I can't live outside Iran. I can't adapt to anywhere else.\"And I said she shouldn't worry, because what are the officials going to do that they haven't done already?\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoMatthew RichardsBBC WalesDominic Fraser/Aston Martin WorksThe Aston Martin DB5 was described by an expert as \"very special\"A 1960s James Bond-style Aston Martin DB5 - which became so dilapidated local children played on it - has been restored and is now worth £1m.John Williams, 71, from Mold, Flintshire, bought the vehicle second hand in 1973 for £985 - the equivalent of about £15,000 today.He last drove the car, made famous in films Goldfinger and Thunderball, in his 20s, before leaving it to rust on his driveway. Mr Williams saved £400,000 for a three-year restoration at Aston Martin's Buckinghamshire works, where experts had to remove a mouse nest before carrying out 2,500 hours of repairs.Getty ImagesJames Bond actor Sean Connery on the set of Goldfinger with a 1964 Aston Martin DB5He fell in love with Aston Martins when he was given a toy car at eight, and by 19, he had saved enough money to buy one advertised in a motoring magazine.But after getting a job in the Middle East at the end of the 1970s, the DB5 went into storage, and then sat on the drive exposed to the elements - and local children.\"The neighbours' kids used to bounce on the bonnet and we used to tell them off,\" said his wife, Susan. \"And then one was jumping on the roof thinking, 'does it work?' because he'd seen the Bond film and thought it was going to come up.\"'Saved and sacrificed' There were only 1,022 DB5s made between 1963 and 1965, which were given a huge boost when James Bond, played by Sean Connery, drove one complete with ejector seat and revolving number plates.The DB5 Vantage in silver birch grey owned by Mr Williams is one of only 39 such models in the world.Even in its undriveable condition sitting rusting outside their home, Aston Martin still valued the car at £500,000, meaning the couple considered cashing in. And they weren't short of offers. John WilliamsThe Aston Martin DB5 fell into disrepair while sitting outside but has now undergone a three-year restoration Susan added: \"Money comes into it and reality, and sitting at the kitchen table he said 'what do you think?'.\"And I said, 'well, you'll never get another one'. \"So he said, 'no, we're keeping her'.\"The decision was made, and they described how they \"saved and sacrificed\" to pay for the three-year restoration. Marc Bow/Timbuktu ContentThe car had become home to a number of mice while it remained on the driveAfter removing the mouse nest, technicians spent 2,500 hours replacing parts and restoring features, including the original paint job. Mr and Mrs Williams made regular visits to the workshop in Newport Pagnell to follow the progress.Now work has been completed, the car maker estimates it to be worth £1m.'It's such an overwhelming car to be in the presence of'Aston Martin's historian Steve Waddingham said: \"It would almost be easier to build a brand new car, but to actually repair and put new sections into a very heavily corroded car like this one took an awful lot of skill and patience.\"But he said the effort is worth it, adding: \"It's such an overwhelming car to be in the presence of - the smell of, it the feel of it, the noise it makes. \"They are very special and you cannot get out of your mind those various famous film scenes.\"Marc Bow/Timbuktu ContentThe restoration took an \"awful lot of skill and patience\"After taking his first drive in the car for more than 45 years, John said: \"It must be better now than it was when it came out of the factory originally. \"It was mind-blowing. I wish they could do a number on me to make me look 27 again. I definitely feel 27 today.\"Susan had only previously sat in the car when it was being towed after leaving storage.She enjoyed her first proper trip with John at the wheel, adding: \"The sound of her was wonderful. Dominic Fraser/Aston Martin WorksFinancial pressures meant John and Susan Williams almost sold the car\"And then when we were going a bit faster I thought, 'Yeah, go a bit faster. Let's see what she can do'.\"Although John has fulfilled his lifelong ambition, he said he doesn't expect to drive the car very often, saying: \"You're limited to where you can take it and leave it. \"And the weather affects it. \"I don't want to be taking it through big puddles of water, and I've neglected it once. I'm not going to do that again.\"More top stories",

    "body": "6 hours agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandNick Eardley,Political correspondentThe UK government has criticised delays in aid being allowed into Gaza after a consignment of more than 1,100 tents it sent to the strip took more than a year to arrive.The foreign secretary has also raised concerns that other UK-funded aid had been unable to reach residents, despite the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.Yvette Cooper said the situation in Gaza remains \"dire\" as the United Nations warned that 1.5 million people are in need of urgent shelter amid worsening rains and plummeting temperatures ahead of winter.The BBC has asked the Israeli government for a response.The tents - each capable of housing a family of five - reached Gaza on Monday, with more expected to arrive this week.Government sources said the tents will provide shelter to as many as 12,000 people over the winter months.Cooper said the delay in getting aid into the strip could not be allowed to continue  and that all crossings into the territory should be opened to allow unhindered humanitarian access. She said: \"The situation in Gaza remains dire, with worsening weather conditions compounding the critical issues caused by damaged infrastructure and over two years of conflict. \"Parents have been trying to shelter their children under broken roofs and open skies. \"These tents will provide a lifeline to thousands of people needing shelter, protecting them from the cold winds and relentless rain turning rubble into mud.\"About 1.9 million people in Gaza, nearly 90% of the population, have been displaced since the Israel-Hamas conflict began in October 2023, according to the UN.Cooper said the arrival of the aid was welcome but only a step towards the major reconstruction that is \"badly needed\" and she was frustrated to see \"yet another consignment of aid stuck at the border\" earlier this year.\"This cannot be allowed to continue,\" she said. \"The arrival of these tents shows the scale of potential impact when our aid gets in, and we will continue to do all we can to urge unhindered humanitarian access, the opening of all the crossings, the implementation of the peace plan, and a path to peace.\"Unicef Special Representative to the State of Palestine Jonathan Veitch said the arrival of the tents \"represents months of ongoing work by the international community to push for greater aid access\".\"The situation in Gaza is devastating as cold, and heavy rains continue to affect families living in extremely difficult conditions. \"Even with the ceasefire, daily life remains incredibly challenging for children in the Gaza Strip. \"UK aid–supported tents have now entered Gaza and will provide urgently needed shelter to help families face the harsh winter. Much more is needed.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "British tennis player Emma Raducanu says she no longer feels she is \"hiding from anything\" after being targeted earlier this year by a man who \"exhibited fixated behaviour\".The 2021 US Open champion was distressed and tearful when she saw a man who had followed her to four successive tournaments in the stands during a match in Dubai in February.The man, who was removed and later given a restraining order by Dubai police, had given Raducanu a letter and asked for a photograph in a coffee shop the previous day.The Briton says she has \"got over\" the incident - but does, however, admit to being occasionally unnerved when seeing printed photographs of herself.\"What did creep me out was I saw a photo of myself in London, and I didn't see the paparazzi [photographers] taking it,\" the 23-year-old said.\"I was with my two best friends. I just didn't see the 'paps'. That's obviously creepy, when you're like: I didn't see them - how did they take this photo?\"But other than that, I feel good because someone's always watching my back.\"Raducanu shot to worldwide fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021.She has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.The Englishwoman had increased security with her at tournaments after the upsetting incident in Dubai, and praised events for the protection she was given.In June, Raducanu told BBC Sport she had been feeling more safe at tournaments, but was still wary whenever she went out.She is training with coach Francisco Roig in Barcelona this month, but has spent much of the past few weeks commuting to London by train from her parents' house in Bromley.Raducanu said she had considered going on holiday after ending her season early because of illness and a foot problem, but wanted to experience home comforts.\"I've barely been in the UK this year because I've been competing so much, but spending quality time with my parents has been so nice,\" she said.\"It reminds me of when I was younger - the same bedroom, same everything.\"While being part of rush hour travel is an experience in itself, Raducanu says she is becoming more comfortable being recognised in public.\"In rush hour, people are so locked in to their world. They're not really paying attention and probably not expecting to see me either,\" she said.\"I have my hood up, or whatever, but they're just so focused and absorbed in their own world.\"It's all so crazy. It's like everyone's on a mission. You have to get the elbows out, just to get through.\"If people recognise me, if people see me, and they want to come up to me, then that's great, but I don't necessarily feel like I'm hiding from anything any more.\"",

    "body": "'Hung by my wrists and beaten': Israeli-Russian woman says Iraqi militants tortured her in captivity3 hours agoTim FranksBBC NewshourBBCElizabeth Tsurkov spoke to the BBC from Israel, where she is recovering from her ordealAn Israeli-Russian woman held captive for two and a half years by militants in Iraq has told the BBC how she invented \"confessions\" to try to get her captors to stop torturing her. Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was freed in September, says she suffered extreme abuse for 100 days, leaving her physically and mentally scarred.Warning: This article contains distressing content including descriptions of torture\"My health is not great,\" Ms Tsurkov says. The interview she gave to BBC Newshour was conducted in central Israel, propped  up on a bed. It is now almost three months after her release from captivity in Iraq, where she was held for 903 days. The first four and a half months had been particularly brutal: she was, she says, trussed and hung from the ceiling, whipped, sexually abused, electrocuted.In March 2023, Ms Tsurkov, a 39-year-old doctoral student at Princeton University in the US, was living in Baghdad, conducting fieldwork for her PhD in comparative politics. She agreed to meet a woman who described herself as a friend of a friend. The woman never showed up. Ms Tsurkov started walking home. She says that a car pulled up behind her and two men dragged her in, beating and sexually assaulting her. She was driven to the outskirts of the capital.\"During the first month, they starved me and interrogated me, but at the time they didn't know about my Israeli citizenship. They're simply convinced that all foreigners are spies.\" Ms Tsurkov had insisted that she was a Russian citizen. But then the kidnappers accessed her phone, and \"because I'm not a spy and don't have multiple encrypted devices, everything showed that I'm Israeli\".She says that was when the torture started: electrocutions, beatings, whippings, sexual abuse and what she calls Middle Eastern \"specialities\". \"Being hung from the ceiling with hands cuffed behind my back. Being hung with the hands above my head.\" And \"a particular method that is used in Iraq. It's called 'the scorpion'. You get handcuffed with [your] shoulders crossed behind the back. It often leads to dislocation of shoulders.\"Elizabeth TsurkovMs Tsurkov was carrying out fieldwork for her PhD in Baghdad when she was kidnappedMs Tsurkov believes she was held by members of Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran-backed militias in Iraq, designated a terrorist organisation by the US and others. These militias are part of the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces and are widely seen in the country as wielding considerable behind-the-scenes power in government and in commerce.In the brief periods between torture, she tried to strategise. \"I had to learn all sorts of weird conspiracy theories. They live in an alternative reality in which Israel and the United States and Saudi Arabia together created ISIS [the Islamic State group], and the US spreads homosexuality through single sex cafes.\"She created confessions about herself to try to avoid torture, based on spy plots and her captors' \"quite insane worldview\", while not implicating any Iraqis. Many of her friends, she says, were activists whom the militants also wanted to kidnap and torture.But her strategy had one major downside. \"They would torture me so I would give them these confessions that I would invent, and then they simply got greedy. So, they would return, hang me by my wrists and start beating me with a stick and using even harsher methods of torture and saying, 'I want something new.'\"Ms Tsurkov says she does not understand why, after 100 days of abuse, she was moved to another location. She was still in solitary confinement with no outside light, but the torture stopped.What she is certain about is how she came to be released. The US businessman Mark Savaya, who campaigned for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, was appointed US special envoy to Iraq this October.According to Ms Tsurkov, one month before, he had travelled to Baghdad to speak to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Among the messages he conveyed, she says, was that President Trump was extremely annoyed about her captivity, and that if she were not freed within a week, the leadership of Kataib Hezbollah would be killed. Within days, she was released.When he announced Ms Tsurkov's freedom from captivity on 9 September, Iraq's prime minister described it as \"a culmination of extensive efforts exerted by our security services over the course of many months\". He also stressed Iraq's commitment to law enforcement and state authority.He made no mention of Kataib Hezbollah or any US threat. But two weeks later, a senior official in Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Ali al-Askari, put out a statement saying that Sudani's government had sought Ms Tsurkov's release in order to prevent a US strike on Iraq and to oblige the US to comply with its agreement to withdraw its forces from the country. He also claimed that Ms Tsurkov had been released after \"giving out all the information she had\" under interrogation by the \"entity\" holding her.The US State Department did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.ReutersPresident Trump said Ms Tsurkov was held by Iraqi militia Kataib HezbollahMs Tsurkov's long road to rehabilitation - mental and physical - is beginning in Israel. But she is determined to complete her PhD at Princeton. Since her release, she has watched the parties associated with the Iran-backed militias grow in strength in recent parliamentary elections in Iraq.  More broadly, she says, it is ordinary Iraqis who lose out from a \"horribly corrupt system in an incredibly rich country\", where the commanders of the militias \"continue to operate above the law\".Ms Tsurkov, who has lived in Israel since her release, says she sees a country transformed in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 and Israel's protracted war in Gaza. \"I'm undergoing therapy, and many of the kind of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are collectively experienced by Israelis since October 7th. There's a great sense of insecurity and desire to unleash the anger that exists within people.\" Ms Tsurkov has been a long-standing critic of Israeli government policy towards Palestinians and within the region. She has a wide circle of Palestinian, Lebanese and Iraqi friends. She's worked for the Israel NGO Gisha, which campaigns to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians.The events of the last two years have, she says, left her much more pessimistic about the possibility of peace. \"October 7th was a literal massacre of the left, because many of the people who live in the kibbutzim, the communities along the Gaza border, were peace activists. And it's a massacre of the left in the sense that the voices who support peace have gotten much weaker and more demonised.\"More immediately, she has her own recovery to concentrate on. She had, she says, previously worked with victims of torture. \"But nothing prepares you for the horror of undergoing it.\" She also reveals the toll of the false confessions. \"It kind of seeps through in some way; maybe like the situation of a battered wife who internalises to some extent the view of the abuser of herself.\"There is one key fact to cling to: that she got out. \"For sure, I have more recovery ahead of me. But I think I was lucky, in a very unlucky situation.\"",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England head coach Thomas Tuchel caused a stir by leaving Jude Bellingham out of his last squadByChief football writer in RigaEngland confirmed qualification for next summer's World Cup with victory over Latvia, enabling head coach Thomas Tuchel to start finalising his plans as the countdown to the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico continues.Competition for places will be intense, with disappointment inevitable for some of those who have played a part in England's smooth qualifying campaign.The jockeying for positions will continue over the next months - so who are those players with something to prove to Tuchel as he considers England's squad to take to the World Cup?Jude BellinghamIt is inconceivable that Jude Bellingham will not be part of England's squad at the World Cup but does the Real Madrid star, who is arguably the biggest global name available to Tuchel, still have something to prove to the head coach?The recent evidence on and off the pitch suggests he does.It all stems from Bellingham being left out of England's latest squad despite telling Tuchel he wanted to be included, to the constant narrative of team spirit and the excellence of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers in the number 10 role.England's next squad for what are effectively dead rubbers against Serbia and Albania will now have one main point of interest, namely whether Bellingham is included.If he is, Bellingham will return to duty having been made acutely aware by Tuchel that there is no star system, no special cases, no automatic route back into England's team.And it will also come after it has been made crystal clear that Tuchel's England world does not revolved around Bellingham and how best to utilise his undoubted talent.Bellingham is not exactly starting again with England - the odds will still be on him being in the line-up their first game in next summer's World Cup - but he has to prove to Tuchel that he can be part of the team spirit the German cherishes, and that he deserves his place back in the side.The England star famously mouthed \"who else?\" when scoring a spectacular stoppage-time overhead kick when England beat Slovakia in the last 16 at Euro 2024, but he now knows there are others Tuchel is willing to consider.Cole PalmerCole Palmer's England career has, so far, been a mixed bag ranging from the moment of brilliance that gave England hope with the equaliser against Spain in what was eventually a losing cause in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin, to other occasions when he has left even supporters of his superb talent wanting more.Palmer's current problem is a lingering groin injury. Further down the line it will be the Chelsea star performing in consistently eye-catching fashion that might persuade Tuchel to find a place for the 23-year-old in what is already a crowded area.Tuchel is unlikely to start fitting square pegs in round holes so close to a major tournament - therefore Palmer, who has only played 64 minutes under the German, has work to do.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cole Palmer celebrates scoring for England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain in BerlinHe is unlikely to get in as the 10, with Rogers currently in possession and Bellingham waiting in the wings.It is hard to see a place on the flanks, where he is less effective, with Anthony Gordon and Marcus Rashford contenders on the left and Arsenal pair Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke fighting for a place on the right.This effectively means Palmer will have to produce a spectacular run of form to force his way back into Tuchel's thinking.Phil FodenManchester City's brilliant 25-year-old was, along with Bellingham, a stand-out exclusion from Tuchel's squad for the friendly against Wales and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Foden, who has won two caps under Tuchel, has been rebuilding form and confidence with an excellent start to the season after a poor campaign last term.And he will do all this with his sights set on the World Cup.He was a permanent fixture in Sir Gareth Southgate's plans up to Euro 2024, but getting Foden and Bellingham in the same team was often a struggle and never felt like a neat fit at the time, with the former often out on the left rather than his preferred central role.No-one, least of all Tuchel, can ignore Foden's talent but he must continue to impress to reclaim what was once an automatic place in England's squad.Like Palmer, Foden operates in what is now a congested place under Tuchel, whether it is in the centre or pushed out wide.Never rule a player of Foden's quality out, but he has a fight on his hands to make England's World Cup squad.Trent Alexander-ArnoldThis ship may have already sailed.Trent Alexander-Arnold's World Cup hopes were already in deep trouble even before he sustained the hamstring injury that has interrupted the start to his Real Madrid career.If Alexander-Arnold has been looking for signs of a bright England future under Tuchel, then not many of them are promising.He played former Liverpool team-mate Curtis Jones, a midfield player, ahead of him at right-back in the 1-0 win away to Andorra then dropped Alexander-Arnold completely for the return World Cup qualifiers with Andorra and visit to Serbia.This came after Tuchel appeared to publicly cast doubt on Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities when he spoke about his influence at Liverpool, saying: \"If he wants to have this impact in the English national team, then he has to take the defensive part very, very seriously.\"Tuchel is also a big admirer of another right-back, Reece James, who played under him at Chelsea, although he has had injury problems of his own.Alexander-Arnold may have to make other plans for the summer unless his form for Real can force a change of heart from Tuchel.Jack GrealishJack Grealish has been a player and personality reborn since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City, but Tuchel saw fit to ignore the clamour for an England recall when he selected his latest squad.Tuchel is a confirmed Grealish fan but, at present, it is hard to see where the midfielder would fit into England's plans, and who would make way to accommodate him.Grealish can join names like Palmer and Foden, who both face a fight to win places either as the 10 or on the flank.This is not to denigrate Grealish's form, which has already made him a hero with Everton's fans, but a brutal reality.Tuchel may also want to see Grealish produce consistently over 20 Premier League games rather than the seven so far. This is the task facing the popular 30-year-old if he is to put himself back in World Cup contention.Adam WhartonAdam Wharton has been outstanding for Crystal Palace for a long time now, running games against elite opponents, especially Manchester City when the Eagles won the FA Cup at Wembley last season, and in the win against Premier League champions Liverpool recently.Wharton's loping, languid style may sometimes disguise a classy, fiercely competitive midfielder, but his England breakthrough has not arrived, despite going to Germany as part of Southgate's Euro 2024 squad.He is yet to get his first minutes under Tuchel and was another surprise omission.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Adam Wharton during his only England appearance - 28 minutes as a substitute against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June 2024 under Sir Gareth SouthgateWharton's only England cap came under Southgate against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June 2024, when he made a 28-minute appearance as a substitute.Like others, he is still waiting for his chance to make his mark as Nottingham Forest's Elliott Anderson has taken the opportunity handed to him by Tuchel with excellent performances, looking right at home on the international stage.Tuchel has made all the right noises, even down to contacting Wharton to re-assure him he is in his thoughts.Wharton, however, has still not made Tuchel's squad so he is another who must continue to press his case to finally get some action under England's head coach.Marcus RashfordBarcelona is the latest stop on Marcus Rashford's road to redemption after being exiled by Manchester United - but he still has a way to travel to re-establish himself as a permanent fixture in England's squad.If the 27-year-old needed any reminding that he still has to prove himself to be fixed firmly in Tuchel's World Cup plans, he only needed to listen to the head coach's words before the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Tuchel said: \"It's not a question of talent. It's a question of whether he can prove the point at club and international level.\"It never has been a question of Rashford's talent, it is the times when he has lost his way after producing stunning performances in spells that raise doubts.He has to produce consistency at Barcelona then, as Tuchel suggests, \"prove the point\" with England as well.Rashford knows Tuchel has faith in his ability - he is selecting him for starters - but the warning is clear. He cannot afford to slip, or fail to prove his point, otherwise others are ready and waiting to take his place.Myles Lewis-SkellyWhen Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal of the Tuchel era against Albania in March, becoming the youngest player to score on his senior England debut, aged 18 years and 176 days, he not only looked like a superstar in the making but the answer to the problem left-back position.He may well still be, starting England's victory in Latvia, but has a potentially major problem ahead that Tuchel has already made reference to.And it is a problem that comes in the imposing shape of Riccardo Calafiori.England apart, Lewis-Skelly has been ousted from Arsenal's left-back slot by the Italian this season, starting only two games for the Gunners and playing only 263 minutes.This is not a question of Lewis-Skelly's quality - that is there for all to see. This is a question of how much football he will play.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal of the Thomas Tuchel era when he made his debut against Albania in March.It is a subject that has already been exercising Tuchel's mind, even though he played Lewis-Skelly in Riga.It is clear that unless he can find his way back into Arsenal's starting line-up, Tuchel may face a difficult choice with the gifted youngster, saying: \"Maybe it becomes a problem for him, yeah.\"Being a good team-mate in camp may not be good enough to stay the whole year with us. You have to perform at club level on a regular basis.\"Lewis-Skelly's task is clear. He may yet claim the left-back berth if Tuchel is unable to find a better alternative but he cannot rely on past credit. He has to find a way into Arsenal's starting line-up.Jordan HendersonJordan Henderson has a huge admirer in Tuchel. He was an instant inclusion for his first squad in March, winning a recall after being absent from England duty since November 2023.It was a pick that raised eyebrows but Tuchel was unmoved, continuing to keep faith with Brentford's veteran midfielder, even to the exclusion of Palace's Wharton, saying: \"He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"No-one could ever question the desire and attitude of one of the game's most consummate professionals, but Henderson will be 36 during next summer's World Cup, which will be played in gruelling conditions in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Tuchel has praised Henderson's influence around camp, and his impact can already be seen at Brentford, but he will need to be seen as someone who will figure on the pitch as well. There is no room for non-playing figureheads at a major tournament.Plenty question Tuchel's wisdom on this decision. It remains to be seen how much longer he will include Henderson, so the former Liverpool captain must produce high-class performances with Brentford consistently to stop eyebrows being raised further.Morgan Gibbs-WhiteMorgan Gibbs-White is a real talent and the Nottingham Forest player has won four caps under Tuchel, who is clearly an admirer of his quality.The problem for Gibbs-White may come with competition for places in the areas he likes, especially with Bellingham, Palmer and Foden not currently in England's squad and Aston Villa's Rogers producing excellence.This is no slight on Gibbs-White, who has been outstanding at Forest. Tottenham Hotspur thought they had signed him in a £60m deal during the transfer window but were left desperately disappointed when Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis persuaded him to stay by offering an improved contract.It is simply that, when the final numbers take shape, Gibbs-White could be in an area where there are just too many names to fit into a limited pot.Gibbs-White has the ability to be in that shake-up, although he may hope for some stability at the City Ground, where new manager Ange Postecoglou is already under pressure after the sacking of Nuno Espirito Santo, who got Forest into Europe and also got the best out of the 25-year-old.Who else must make a good impression?The understudy to England captain Harry Kane is always a thorny issue with options seemingly limited beyond Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.Spurs striker Dominic Solanke and Chelsea's Liam Delap will want to be in Thomas Tuchel's thoughts but both are currently troubled by injuries.Arsenal's Eberechi Eze operates in an area of the pitch where England competition is red-hot, but he offers variety and versatility, so that may well bolster his claims when the time comes for Tuchel to name his squad.The same may just apply to Newcastle United's Dan Burn with limited choices in central defence and left-back, but he will need to maintain good form and there are still questions about his quality at international level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, James Trafford hoped to be Manchester City's first choice keeper when he moved from Burnley - but was then replaced by Gianluigi DonnarummaEverton's Jordan Pickford is unchallenged as goalkeeper with Crystal Palace's Dean Henderson as his understudy - but what does the future hold for James Trafford?He is currently third choice but had hoped to challenge Pickford for top spot after he moved from Burnley to Manchester City.This plan unravelled somewhat when City bought world-class Italian Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain, Trafford losing his place immediately.City manager Pep Guardiola has insisted Trafford will get game time - but will it be enough to make Tuchel feel comfortable about his match sharpness?Arsenal's Declan Rice believes England have the all-round quality to cope with any squad issues, saying: \"I think every time you play for England you want to grab the shirt, you want to grab your chance. \"We do miss Jude for sure, we miss Phil, we miss Cole, we miss loads of players that have not been turning up for reasons the manager has said. \"We are an unreal team when they are in the team as well. What they have done for England in an England shirt is nothing short of incredible. \"We are looking forward to having them next camp hopefully, as a team we want to keep integrating as many people as possible before the World Cup.\"",

    "body": "Football, fashion & the rise of the replica shirtMedia caption, Classic Football Shirts' Doug Bierton shares his favourite shirts from an impressive collectionBySport ReporterBrazil 1970. Liverpool 1984. Netherlands 1988. Arsenal 1991.Which is the greatest football shirt of all time? The debate is not a new one.Yet, for more than a hundred years, most football kits failed to stoke the imagination at all. Even for a professional club it was practicality over pomp.Predominantly kits were kept to a single colour - two if you were feeling bold, three if you were feeling like a maverick. Stripes, hooped and halved were as adventurous as designs got.Wind forward to the modern day, however, and shirts are now as much a fashion item as a means of identifying players on a pitch.So how did we reach this point? What were the seminal moments that shaped the adulation afforded to football jerseys today? And what next for the sellers and buyers of the retro shirt industry?How a chance encounter changed the gameImage source, Getty ImagesIn times gone by, each season a club would buy a set of shirts and they'd likely be worn for the entirety of the campaign - home and away.But as David Moor, author and editor of the Historical Kits website, explains, all that changed after a chance encounter between then Leeds United manager Don Revie and Bert Patrick, founder of Admiral sportswear company.\"Up until then, Leeds just wore white shirts,\" says Moor. \"As a fan you could go into any sports shop anywhere in the country and buy a plain white shirt with their logo on it.\"There was nothing to differentiate that one from one sold by another store. Patrick's idea was to redesign and copyright the kit so nobody could steal it, nobody else could manufacture it.\"He'd charge a premium to the public for buying it but more importantly he'd pay Leeds to wear it.\"The result was Leeds' now iconic yellow shirt, which the team wore for all away games that year. Until then teams would only wear their alternate shirts if there was a kit clash. The idea was a success and it wasn't long before other clubs followed.Admiral were the originators of the movement, but other brands like Umbro soon joined the party.\"Soon the football kit became every kid's desired Christmas and birthday gift,\" said Moor.\"Over the next few years more and more clubs, including particularly the big ones who were at Wembley for the big showpiece matches, came out of the tunnel wearing a brand new specially designed kit.\"This completely revolutionised the way football kits were looked at,\" Moor added.It's also worth noting the important role the invention of the colour television played in all this. As more TV sets found their way into homes and businesses, the daring new designs and colour schemes had a means by which fans could appreciate them in all their glory.Italia '90: Gazza's tears and the restoration of national prideImage source, Getty Images\"First and foremost, the easiest way for a kit to become iconic is if the team was successful in it,\" podcast host and football historian Peter Kenny Jones tells BBC Sport.England were famously beaten by West Germany on penalties in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup in Italy but, after decades of underperforming at major tournaments, Bobby Robson's team showcased the skill, determination and strength of character that fans had been calling out for.\"Although England didn't win that tournament, they came home to an open-top bus parade and the whole country gathered around them,\" Jones added.\"Paul Gascoigne become a national hero. Iconic moments like him crying and Gary Lineker asking the bench to have a word.\"Not only was there an increase in sales of England shirts during and after Italia '90, the jersey remains a fan favourite to this day.However, it wasn't only the Three Lions jersey from that tournament that caught the imagination.Football fans Doug Bierton and Matthew Dale, who met while studying at university, have turned the sale of retro football shirts into a near-£40m business empire.The kit that started it all? The West Germany home shirt worn at that World Cup. \"I think it cost £20 in a charity shop in the student area of Manchester. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it,\" Bierton says.Italia '90 was the first major football tournament Bierton watched on TV and it was the initial difficulty in tracking down this specific shirt, worn by the likes of Rudi Voller and Lothar Matthaus, which led him to assume other fans had similar problems when searching for an old jersey.The idea for Classic Football Shirts was born. The company began from a spare bedroom and the first few shirts were bought using Bierton and Dale's student loans.\"My goal was to collect every kit from Italia '90,\" he said. \"But the problem is, they only made half of them that you could buy in the shop. So you've got to dig around, contacting ex-players, going down wormholes to find them. I've ticked off most, but I'm missing four.\"So I need Cameroon 1990 away, United Arab Emirates home, Uruguay home, South Korea home. Then I've got the full set.\"Bierton has a personal collection of about 6,700 match-worn shirts, while his company's warehouse is home to a million football shirts.Premier League names and numbers changed everythingImage source, Getty ImagesThe arrival of the Premier League in 1992 heralded big changes, not least in the amounts of money invested into the sport.As player transfer fees and wages skyrocketed, so too did sales in replica shirts. What seemed a small change for the 1993-94 season made a huge impact. The league announced that all players would have their names printed on the shirts, as well as players having squad numbers.Suddenly a fan could wear a team's shirt - but with the added bonus of supporting their favourite player.A shift in the marketImage source, Getty ImagesFast-forward to 2018 and for most football historians, the Nigeria shirt for the World Cup in Russia was the moment a football shirt became a fashion statement.As the folklore around the shirt grew so did demand - and the manufacturer simply couldn't keep up.\"Everyone wanted this shirt,\" Jones said. \"The issue was everywhere you went it was sold out.\"Suddenly what we saw were accounts popping up on social media sites claiming they could 'get their hands' on a few shirts.\"Such promises came with no assurance the shirts were official and, more often than not, they weren't.By now modern kits were made mostly of polyester, and the ability to replicate the designs meant forging the genuine shirts had become commonplace.However, in a move to protect customers and the retro shirt industry, it's now common practice for reputable sellers to destroy any counterfeit products they come across.The rise in demand for women's replica shirtsImage source, Getty Images / AdidasImage caption, A number of women's teams at Euro 2025 had their own bespoke kits, that differed to their men's teamOnce limited to wearing men's replica shirts, women can now buy shirts specifically for them. Meanwhile, the growth of the women's game has itself triggered a demand for women's replica shirts.Many nations now have their own bespoke international shirts and the recent success of Sarina Wiegman's England side has meant Lionesses shirts are now in high demand.For kit collector Arbon McNulty, the team's performance in France at the 2019 World Cup was the moment that triggered her love affair with them.McNulty turned her passion into a profession and works for Foudys - the first and only store in the world dedicated to women's football. McNulty explains the Lionesses successes at the 2022 and 2025 European Championships have been vital in driving the sales and demand for the team's replica shirts.\"The people who come to us don't want Harry Kane or Declan Rice, they want Beth England or Leah Williamson on their shirt.\"There's now demand for retro women's shirts. People want a Kelly Smith or a Hope Powell shirt - previously you were never able to get those. Like me, I would have loved a Casey Stoney shirt and I'm glad that's now possible.\"We remade some retro shirts last year and they were so popular, and everyone loved them.\"You just need to cast your mind back to the Mary Earps goalkeeping shirt debacle -where her 2023 World Cup shirt wasn't on sale to the general public - to understand what owning a jersey in support of your hero means to some football fans.What does the future look like?Whether collecting football shirts is a hobby or an investment, the industry shows no signs of slowing down.\"I think it can only grow. As more and more shirts come out, it means more and more shirts become retro,\" says Jones.\"Now when I hold a shirt from the 90s it's surprising how old it looks. They're always going to have value in them.\"Teams release three or four shirts every season. And whoever didn't or couldn't get them now will want them in a few years' time. So if you've got one, hold on to it.\"The football shirt has created its own fashion trend. So much so, some of the world's biggest fashion brands now produce their own football-inspired designs - which have graced the catwalks of London, Milan and Paris.Personal collections of jerseys span thousands of shirts and monetary sums reach millions of pounds.Louis Bever is a photographer who combines fine art and football shirts - and, while he wasn't even alive at the start of the Premier League era, he admitted to BBC Sport he has an \"unhealthy\" number of shirts in his collection.\"The great thing about collecting shirts is I might not even notice what another individual considers the Holy Grail,\" Arsenal fan Bever said.\"Somebody could be looking at getting their hands on a Carlisle shirt from the late 1990s because they think that is the ultimate shirt.\"That's why I love it. It's all purely based on nostalgia and your personal taste.\"What each collector chooses to do with their prized assets simply comes down to personal preference. Some frame them to hang in an office, some lock them away in a vault and some wear them to the park for a casual kickabout.The important thing appears to be - don't throw them away.",

    "body": "\"Big John\" Fisher, a British social media star known for his viral fast food reviews, has been detained in Australia over a visa issue.Famous for his love of Chinese takeaway and signature catchphrase \"bosh\", Fisher arrived in Western Australia on Tuesday ahead of a tour of the country.However, in social media posts, he said he would have to cancel his scheduled appearances in Perth and Sydney as he would be deported to London.Fisher said he was questioned by border officials for four hours, and though his visa was \"legit\", Australian authorities \"weren't happy\" that he was going to be working during his visit. It is understood that Fisher entered Australia on an incorrect visa.A spokesperson for the Australian Border Force said it could not comment on individual cases, due to privacy issues.\"Will explain more when I get home but absolutely gutted,\" he said. \"Sorry, Perth, sorry, Sydney.\"In a post on Wednesday morning local time, Fisher complained about his treatment by authorities and said he was spending his 52nd birthday in a detention hotel waiting to be deported.\"I'm still smiling and I still love Australia,\" he wrote before signing off with his famed slogan \"bosh\" - a British slang word often used as an enthusiastic exclamation.In another Instagram story, Fisher wrote that many people had offered to drop food off for him at the hotel, but he was not allowed to receive it.\"Thank you for the gesture but if you have got me food please take to a food bank -Bosh,\" he wrote.Fisher's son - British heavyweight boxer Johnny Fisher - confirmed on Instagram that his father would be flown home.\"Rumour has it they are frightened of his express pace bowling ahead of the Ashes,\" he said.Fisher, who has previously visited Australia to meet fans, was due to appear at four events in the country this week. His schedule included hosting a \"Bucking Bull\" challenge at a greyhound race in Sydney and doing a DJ set at a horse racing meet in Perth.With almost 700,000 followers on Instagram and another half a million on TikTok, Fisher often films himself eating meals and gives a short review that almost always finish with him saying \"bosh\".He was recently interviewed on BBC's Newsnight programme about a Chinese takeaway in York which was vandalised. He later visited the takeaway to show his support and posted a review of its food. Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "Royal Mail fined £21m after post arrived late - Ofcom2 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA quarter of all first-class post was delivered late last yearRoyal Mail has been fined £21m after almost a quarter of first-class post arrived late, Ofcom has announced.It is the third-largest fine the communications watchdog has ever issued and follows its investigation after Royal Mail missed its targets for both first and second-class post in 2024/25.Ian Strawhorne, director of enforcement at Ofcom, said: \"Millions of important letters are arriving late, and people aren't getting what they pay for when they buy a stamp.\"Royal Mail said it will \"continue to work hard to deliver further sustained improvements to our quality of service\".It delivered 77% of First Class mail and 92.5% of Second Class mail on time in the 2024/25 financial year, which was short of its 93% and 98.5% targets.This is the third time it has been fined over delivery delays in recent years, with penalities of £5.6m in November 2023 and £10.5m in December 2024.Ofcom said the fine would have been £30m, but it had reduced it by 30% to reflect Royal Mail's admission of its failings.The regulator warned fines were \"likely to continue\" unless the company urgently delivers \"a credible improvement plan\".'Empty promises'Ofcom said Royal Mail published an improvement plan for last year, aimed at delivering 85% of first-class post on time and 97% of second-class post, but \"this has not materialised\".Mr Strawhorne said: \"Royal Mail must rebuild consumers' confidence as a matter of urgency. And that means making actual significant improvements, not more empty promises.\"Ofcom's investigation found the company \"breached its obligations by failing to provide an acceptable level of service without justification\".It said the actions taken by Royal Mail to try and reach its targets were \"insufficient and ineffective\".The fine, Ofcom said, reflected the \"harm suffered by customers\" as a result of Royal Mail's poor service.Citizens Advice said the postal service's track record was \"woeful\" but that the fines may not push the company to do better.\"When these failures are just an ordinary part of doing business, Ofcom's fine risks becoming another operating cost, doing little to encourage the company to improve its service,\" Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said.\"Missed post has real life consequences, with people left waiting for urgent medical appointment letters, legal documents and benefit decisions.\"Second-class scrapped on SaturdaysUnder the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK.Since July, some areas only receive second-class letters every other weekday and not on Saturday, a change proposed by Ofcom earlier this year.Responding to Ofcom, a Royal Mail spokesperson said: \"We acknowledge the decision made by Ofcom today and we will continue to work hard to deliver further sustained improvements to our quality of service.\"The spokesperson said that the reduction of second-class deliveries in some areas enabled the company to \"drive a step change in quality of service\".Royal Mail has also made changes in recruitment and training and has provided more support in delivery offices, the spokesperson added.The fine will be paid to the Treasury.Royal Mail was bought by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky for more than £5bn last year. It posted a profit in September, following three years of losses.More on this story",

    "body": "'I never used the word retirement' - Daniel Day-Lewis is back on screen after a seven-year break4 hours agoLizo MzimbaEntertainment correspondent, the London Film FestivalPA MediaDaniel Day-Lewis at the premiere of his new film AnemoneDaniel Day-Lewis may have returned to acting after a seven-year absence, but the actor has said he has not been inundated with new scripts.The 68-year-old was last seen on film in 2017's Phantom Thread, after which his agent released a statement saying he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".But he was tempted back to the screen by the opportunity to work with his son Ronan, who directed and co-wrote his new film Anemone.Asked if he had been swamped with new scripts now that he's returned, Day-Lewis told BBC News: \"No, there's been no inundation. I'm definitely open to the idea of working. \"And just to put the record straight, I never used the word retirement. People have happily used it on my behalf. \"But I felt I needed to work at something else for a while, which I did. I'm glad to be back doing this, and I'm certainly open to doing it again.\"Before stepping back from acting in 2017, Day-Lewis was one of cinema's most sought-after actors, having won three Oscars and starred in films such as Gangs of New York, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.The actor and his son Ronan, 27, co-wrote the script for Anemone, which premiered at the London Film Festival on Tuesday.Universal PicturesDaniel Day-Lewis and director Ronan Day-Lewis discussing a sceneDay-Lewis plays Ray, a former soldier living in isolation in the woods, who is sought out by his brother during a family crisis.\"It was just the idea of working with Ronan,\" the actor said. \"We just thought we'd find a way of doing something together. So it was a very open and unspecific impulse that started it.\"Daniel says he and Ronan quickly found that their ideas were well aligned early in the writing process.\"We very soon found our way into some common ground. The idea of a story about brothers, and it went on from there.\"'Brotherly love'The film sees the three-time Oscar winner's character Ray dealing with his difficult past in the military by cutting himself off from society. Years later, his brother finds him, and tries to persuade him to come home to reunite with his ex-wife and son, who is in trouble after assaulting another young man.That kind of fraternal family dynamic was something that Ronan Day-Lewis was keen to explore, when writing the script with his father.\"I have two brothers,\" he explains. \"And for a few years before we had started working together on anything, I'd had the vague idea of wanting to find a way into that, as a kind of archetype in the story.\"Once we both locked into that and realised that we independently had that interest. It was really just a matter of finding these characters and then just following them into the dark.\"Universal PicturesSean Bean and Daniel Day-Lewis in AnemoneRay's brother Jem is played by Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings star Sean Bean. The British actor says it was a pleasure acting opposite someone of the calibre of Day-Lewis, whom he matches beat for beat in some of the film's most intense scenes.\"Yeah, I was alright,\" laughs Bean. \"He's great to work with. He's very welcoming, he's very generous. \"He's very focused, obviously. We all know his approach to acting, which is admirable. And I just felt very comfortable with that relationship we had together.\"'New themes and emotions'Throughout his career, Day-Lewis has demonstrated his range with a wide variety of roles. Did this one have new themes or emotions that he hadn't tackled before?\"That's a really interesting question,\" he says, pausing to consider it for a few moments. \"I'd say yes, for sure. I think what happened inadvertently was it also became an exploration about the generations of relationships between fathers and sons.\"And that's something, for my own personal reasons, has preoccupied me since childhood. And so I think that certainly became something that was really new and interesting to me.\"Anemone is released in UK cinemas on 7 November.",

His three albums won four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D’Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US media partner.Fellow musicians Beyoncé, Nile Rogers and Lauryn Hill were among those paying their respects.'Strength and sensitivity'Singer Beyoncé thanked D’Angelo for his music on her website. \"You were the pioneer of neo-soul, and that changed and transformed rhythm and blues forever,\" she wrote. \"We will never forget you.\"Writing about his first meeting with D'Angelo, guitarist and producer Rogers recalled having encouraged the late star - who was then on the way up - to put out his material as it was \"perfect\".\"About a year later I heard one of those songs on the radio. It was genius and it was exactly what he had played for me,\" wrote Rogers. \"I know... I still have the original cassette.\"Singer and rapper Hill, who worked with D'Angelo at the start of his career, shared a similarly lengthy and personal reflection, saying his \"beauty and talent were not of this world\".\"You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,\" she wrote.Fellow rappers Doja Cat and Missy Elliot also paid their respects, as well as singers Jill Scott and Jennifer Hudson.\"A true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come,\" Doja Cat wrote on X. \"Rest Peacefully D'Angelo,\" posted Elliot, who was becoming one of hip-hop's biggest around the same time as the soul singer's rise in the late 1990s.Scott posted: \"I never met D'Angelo but I love him, respect him, admire his gift.\"Hudson noted how \"we lost a true original today\". \"D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King!!!\"Tyler the Creator said his \"musical DNA\" was shaped by D'Angelo - \"We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art,\" he wrote.ReutersThe award-winning singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazzD’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the number 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot on the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.Getty ImagesD'Angelo's song Lady earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music sceneIt went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute was hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"The Voodoo album which was released in 2000 topped the US charts and in its most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporter andHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentRachel Reeves has said she is looking at raising taxes again at her autumn Budget next month.The chancellor also said she was considering further measures on public spending, in a bid to put the UK's finances on a firmer footing.Speaking to broadcasters ahead of an international finance summit in the US, she added that she would \"continue to prioritise economic and fiscal stability\".The Budget in November is the moment when the chancellor outlines the UK government's plans for the economy.Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes at the Budget on 26 November, after poor economic figures and a series of U-turns on welfare cuts made it harder to meet its self-imposed spending rules.Some analysts have estimated that the chancellor will have to increase taxes or cut spending to fill a hole in the public finances, estimated to be £20bn-£30bn.Reeves received the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecast of the economy on 3 October.It is likely that in the weeks before the Budget, as Reeves learns more about how much money she needs to raise and makes decisions about how to do it, she and other ministers will become more explicit still about the direction of travel.Speaking to broadcasters in Washington DC ahead of the the International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meeting, the chancellor said: \"I've always been very clear that we will continue to prioritise economic and fiscal stability in the UK.\"Asked whether she would have to raise taxes at the Budget, she replied: \"As we get the forecast, and as we develop our plans, of course we are looking at further measures on tax and spending, to make sure that the public finances always add up.\"Speaking to the BBC earlier, Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said he wouldn't speculate on what might be in the Budget.\"The chancellor makes all her decisions on Budget day on 26 November and sets out her package there,\" Murray said.\"Yes, a budget focuses on tax and spend and we'll set out how we're keeping a tight grip on public spending.\"The additional suggestion of spending cuts by Reeves is intriguing - many Labour MPs believe that spending cuts in most areas would be politically unviable after the failed attempts at welfare cuts earlier this year, although the government could promise to cut spending in four or five years.In an interview earlier, Reeves told Sky News the effects of Brexit, austerity policies and former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget had damaged the UK economy.Sky News reported that when asked how she would deal with the country's economic challenges, Reeves said: \"Now, of course, we are undoing some of that damage by the deal that we did with the EU earlier this year on food and farming, goods moving between us and the continent, on energy and electricity trading, on an ambitious youth mobility scheme, but there is no doubting that the impact of Brexit is severe and long-lasting.\"In her speech to Labour conference last month, Reeves said the government was facing difficult choices and promised she would not take risks with the public finances.The chancellor pledged to keep \"taxes, inflation and interest rates as low as possible\".Labour promised in its 2024 manifesto ahead of last year's general election not to increase taxes on \"working people\", saying the party would not \"increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT\".On Monday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the UK was set to be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year.But the IMF also predicted the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills.Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said needed to get a grip on public spending, rather than raise taxes again.He said: \"Be in no doubt, this tax doom loop is down to the Chancellor's economic mismanagement.\"Under Rachel Reeves we have seen inflation double, debt balloon, borrowing costs at a 27-year high, and taxes up - with more pain on the way in the autumn.\"",

    "body": "Stephen Graham hopes father-son book will 'continue the message of Adolescence'3 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterJoseph SinclairNetflix's hit TV series Adolescence explored toxic masculinity and the impact of mobile phones and social media on teenagers and family life.Graham, whose letter to his own son will be included in the book, told the BBC: \"My hope for this book is that it will be a continuation of the message of Adolescence and a tool for fathers to start more conversations with their sons.\"The Bloomsbury book will be made up of a collection of letters from fathers from all walks of life, with submissions open from 15 October until 12 January. In a press statement, Graham added: \"After the huge impact of Adolescence, I realised there was a greater need for communication between fathers and sons. \"There is arguably an even bigger disconnect than ever before, and I would love to help create more opportunity for fathers to reach out to their sons and carry on the conversation.\"We want to hear from men of all ages, first-time fathers, absent fathers, fathers who've been there but never truly been there, fathers who've lost and fathers who just want to find a way to say I love you, to tell their sons what they mean to them and to talk openly about what it means to be a man.\"The book will be published in October 2026.Graham is working on the project with psychology lecturer Orly Klein. The pair will make a donation for every letter published to the charity ManUp? and social enterprise Dad La Soul, two organisations that support young men struggling with mental health. Bloomsbury will also make a donation to ManUp?Getty ImagesOwen Cooper and Stephen Graham were the stars of AdolescenceFor several weeks earlier this year, Adolescence dominated the news agenda, and eventually went on to become Netflix's second most watched English-language series ever (after the first season of Wednesday).The UK government supported Netflix's proposal to make the drama available to schools. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was a need to tackle the \"emerging and growing problem\" the show raised.Many critics shared the sentiment in their reviews. \"If you're a parent to a school-age boy... it will chill your blood,\" said the Telegraph's Anita Singh.\"It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\"The show went on to win several Emmy awards in the US. Its young star, Owen Cooper, 15, was named best supporting actor in a limited series for his portrayal of a schoolboy accused of murdering a classmate.The four-part drama also won best limited series, as well as prizes for its directing and writing, and acting prizes for Stephen Graham and Erin Doherty.",

    "body": "Some migrants coming to the UK will need to speak English to an A-level standard under tougher new rules set to be introduced by the government.The changes, which will come into force from 8 January 2026, will affect some graduates and those applying for skilled worker or scale-up visas, which are for people employed by fast-growing businesses.The new rules  form part of wider plans to cut levels of immigration to the UK outlined in a white paper in May.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"If you come to this country, you must learn our language and play your part.\"\"This country has always welcomed those who come to this country and contribute,\" Mahmood said. \"But it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life.\"Applicants will be tested in person on their speaking, listening, reading and writing at Home Office-approved providers, with their results checked as part of the visa process.Those applying for skilled worker, scale-up and high potential individual (HPI) visas will be required to reach B2 level - a step up from the current B1 standard which is equivalent to GCSE.To come to the UK on the skilled worker visa, migrants have to work for a government-approved employer and earn at least £41,700 a year, or the \"going rate\" for their type of work, whichever is highest.The scale-up visa is open to migrants coming to work for a fast-growing UK business. Migrants can apply for a high potential individual visa if they have been awarded a qualification from a top global university within the last five years.According to the British Council, which offers English language courses, learners who achieve B2 level can \"understand the main ideas of complex texts on concrete or abstract topics.\"They can express themselves \"fluently and spontaneously\" and communicate comfortably with other English speakers. They can also produce \"clear, detailed text on many subjects and explain a complex viewpoint\".Further English language requirements for other visa routes and family dependants are expected to be introduced in due course, Home Office Minister Mike Tapp told Parliament on Tuesday.The prime minister previously said the changes outlined in the white paper would make the UK's immigration system \"controlled, selective and fair\".Home Office estimates suggest the measures could reduce the number of people coming to the UK by up to 100,000 per year.Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - fell to 431,000 in 2024, down almost 50% on the total in 2023, when it reached a record high of 906,000. Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the government faced a \"trade-off\" between \"ensuring migrants speak good English and enabling employers to recruit workers who are expected to bring economic benefits.\"Many graduate jobs already require language skills above A-level standard, she said.The new language requirements will have \"more impact in middle-skilled jobs involving technical and manual skills, where employers sometimes do not require high language proficiency\".Immigration lawyer Afsana Akhtar told BBC News she thought it was \"unfair\" that migrants had to reach such a high standard of English \"because even many people in the UK probably wouldn't be able to pass English A-level\". \"This would rule out even skilled workers who want to come and contribute to our British economy,\" she said. \"The GCSE standard is sufficient - and then when they come live here, [and] integrate into England and the English way of life, their English will improve inevitably.\"Other measures in the white paper include cutting the time period international students can stay in the UK to find a graduate job after their course ends from two years to 18 months, which will take effect from January 2027.Students will also have to meet higher financial requirements, raised to £1,171 per month outside London (from £1,136) for up to nine months.The Global Talent visa, for high achievers in technology, arts and academia fields has also been expanded to include winners of more prestigious prizes. Further plans in the White Paper include, the immigration skills charge for UK employers to pay when sponsoring foreign workers on specific visas has also been  increased to £480 per person per year for small organisations or charities, and to £1,320 for medium and large organisations.This is raised from £364 and £1,000 respectively.As part of the government's efforts to attract highly skilled people to the country, the HPI route will be expanded. The number of migrants on the visa is expected to double from 2,000 to 4,000, but there will be a cap of 8,000 applications each year.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSayeda AkterBBC Bangla, Dhaka andKelly NgSingaporeAt least 16 people have died after a huge fire broke out at a garment factory in Bangladesh, with officials warning that the toll could rise.Sixteen bodies have been recovered and would be handed to families after DNA testing, as they have been burnt beyond recognition, the fire service said.Distraught relatives gathered outside the four-storey factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area on Tuesday in search of their loved ones still missing.The blaze, which broke out at the factory around midday, was extinguished after three hours. But an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, authorities said.Large fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, often due to lax safety standards and poor infrastructure. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years.Up until 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the fire at the chemical warehouse in Mirpur had not been completely doused, media reports said.Fire service officials have not ascertained which of the two buildings caught fire first. According to eyewitnesses, the chemical warehouse stored bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, all of which can intensify fires. Plastic also releases toxic fumes when burned.Most of the deaths were caused by toxic gas and the building's roof door being locked, the fire service said.Fire service director Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury told local media the victims probably died \"instantly\" after inhaling \"highly toxic gas\". Police and military officers are still trying to locate the owners of the factory and the warehouse, Mr Chowdhury told reporters.An investigation into whether the warehouse was operating legally was also ongoing, he added.The fire service said that the chemical warehouse had no fire safety clearance or licence from their department. Meanwhile, officials in northern Dhaka had confirmed that the warehouse had no occupancy certificate or licence to operate, local media reported.Tearful family members stood outside the charred buildings, many of them clutching photographs of their missing relatives. Among them is a man searching desperately for his daughter, Farzana Akhter. \"When I heard about the fire, I came running. But I still haven't found her... I just want my daughter back,\" he told Reuters news agency.Bangladesh has a long history of deadly industrial disasters. In 2021, a fire at a food and drink factory left at least 52 people dead and another 20 injured. The factory was built illegally and had no emergency exit, an investigation later found.In 2019, a fast-moving fire swept through a historic district in Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, including members of a bridal party.The country's deadliest industrial accident to date took place in 2013, when the eight-storey Rana Plaza building housing garment factories near Dhaka collapsed owing to a structural failure, killing more than 1,100 people.",

    "body": "An Israeli couple who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks have been reunited, two years after they were violently split up.Noa Argamani and Avinatan Or were seized at the Nova music festival. Video of Ms Argamani being dragged away in terror on the back of a motorbike became one of the most widely recognised images of the attacks.She was rescued by Israeli commandos on 8 June 2024. Mr Or, who was held separately in central Gaza, was released on Monday - one of 20 living hostages to be returned as part of the ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump.In a post on Instagram, Ms Argamani said the couple could now begin \"healing together\".After reuniting, Israeli media said the pair shared their \"first cigarette together after two years\".A day after her partner's release, Ms Argamani shared an emotional Instagram post alongside their first photos together since 2023.\"Two years since the last moment I saw Avinatan, my love. Two years since terrorists kidnapped us, put me on a motorcycle, and tore us apart in front of the whole world,\" she wrote.She said she had been held with other women and children inside houses during her captivity, \"while Avinatan was only in the tunnels\". \"Hamas released videos and signs of life from me, while there was no information at all about Avinatan,\" the post, in Hebrew, continued.She said the pair could now begin their recovery. \"We won our personal war and the whole world's fight with us to get to this moment, and now it's time for us to begin our shared journey together,\" the post said.Ms Argamani also thanked Trump for his part in bringing the hostages home and helping them \"overcome the darkness\".Mr Or's father told Israeli media about the conditions his son had been kept in - food supplies which were \"meagre\" and a lot of time alone, chained up in tunnels and small enclosures during his 738 days in captivity.He said his son - who is around 2m (6ft 5in) tall - was held at one point in a space just 1.8m high, and just slightly longer than the mattress he slept on.\"He's extremely thin,\" Yaron Or told reporters, adding that his son had had \"no books, no human contact - nothing\", but was given a Rubik's Cube at one point.He was given very little information about the outside world, including the whereabouts of his girlfriend or the full scope of the Hamas attacks and subsequent Israeli offensive.\"Around him were guards whose relatives had been killed in IDF [Israel Defense Forces] strikes, I think it's simply a miracle they didn't harm him, except for one time he tried to escape,\" the senior Mr Or said.Avinatan Or reportedly tried to escape whilst being moved through a tunnel but was captured and beaten for the attempt. \"He's sharing things gradually, we're not asking directly,\" his father said.\"Physically, he still needs to recover,\" he continued. \"But mentally, thank God, he's the same Avinatan - same humour, same strength.\"",

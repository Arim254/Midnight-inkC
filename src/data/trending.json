    "body": "Arsenal are sitting top of the Premier League at Christmas, but it is BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton who leads the way when it comes to predictions.\"I'm number one at Christmas - again,\" said Sutton, who as a player led the Premier League table at this point with Norwich in 1992 and Blackburn in 1994, and went on to win the title with Rovers.\"It's a big deal for me to be top, as well as for Arsenal.\"AI is the go-to for virtually everyone in the world whenever they have to ask anything, so the fact that I am beating it - and let's face it, I have stuffed it for half a season now - is pretty incredible. It says a lot about me, and I'm delighted. \"Rather than asking AI about everything, maybe people should come to me to tap into my intelligence instead?\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For week 18 - the festive fixtures on Boxing Day and the weekend of 27 and 28 December - he takes on Jonny Stewart, bass singer with sea shanty folk supergroup The Wellermen, who is a Newcastle fan.The Wellermen were the originators of the sea shanty trend on TikTok, with their versions of Misty Mountain, Nancy Mulligan and Hoist the Colours racking up billions of views.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, The WellermenImage caption, The Wellermen's eponymous debut album achieved 110m streams across all platforms. Their latest album, Northern Sky, is out now - as is their latest single of the same name, featuring Rose BettsSome of Jonny's earliest memories as a fan were the FA Cup finals that Newcastle lost in 1998 and 1999, but he was finally able to celebrate a trophy when the Magpies won the Carabao Cup in March.\"We were actually on tour in Colorado at the time - we had just done a show in Boulder and we had one in Denver the next day,\" he told BBC Sport.\"I was frantically Googling where I could watch the game a few weeks before, when we'd reached the final, and whether I could find anyone to watch it with me - because on Mountain Time it kicked off around 10am.\"I connected with the Mile High Magpies, the Denver area supporters' club, and they said to come along to this bar. There were a couple of Liverpool fans in there but more than 100 Newcastle fans were crammed into it. It was brilliant.\"I'd bought a Dan Burn Carabao Cup final shirt in the run-up to the game because I thought, if we win, it is going to mean so much having the ultimate local lad on the back of my jersey.\"So, when Big Dan scored one of the best headers I've ever seen to put us 1-0 up, I cried so hard.\"Being away from home, and away from my best mate Angus, who I'd usually watch our games with, was hard - he was Facetiming me from this pub in Chelmsford which had about two people in, so I'd found a much better place.\"And then I saw us totally outplay the best team in the league, and end our trophy drought. It really doesn't get much better than that.\"Chris Sutton and Jonny Stewart were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.Premier League predictionsFriday, 26 DecemberOld Trafford, 20:00 GMTManchester United got a bit of praise for their performance against Aston Villa, even though they were beaten.The key to how this game goes is what they do without Bruno Fernandes, and how they are going to cope without him.You look around Ruben Amorim's squad and he does not seem to have a lot of leaders in there. It will be interesting to see if Amorim plays centre-back Lisandro Martinez in that holding midfield role, the same job he did when he came on for Fernandes against Villa, because he could provide that leadership they will need.Newcastle United will be absolutely sick that they let a two-goal lead slip against Chelsea last week, while their away record has a lot of room for improvement - they have won only one of their eight away league games so far.Manchester United are three points and four places above them in the table, but they are missing a few players at the Africa Cup of Nations and, in my mind, Newcastle United have the better squad anyway.Because of that, I am going to back Eddie Howe's side here. There won't be many goals, though, and they may only need to score one to win it.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Jonny's prediction: Manchester United blow hot and cold - they are capable of playing some really nice football but I don't know where their goals will come from without Bryan Mbeumo or Bruno Fernandes. This is genuinely really hard for me to call but I am going with my heart over my head - I have to! 1-2AI's prediction: 2-2Saturday, 27 DecemberCity Ground, 12:30Nottingham Forest are still lingering just above the relegation places, and Monday's defeat at Fulham was a disappointing result for them.I still think Sean Dyche's side are going to be fine, however, and they have definitely made strides since he took charge at the end of October.This is a tricky game for Manchester City but they are on a bit of a roll at the moment.I thought Arsenal were going to run away with the title, but not any more. City are getting better and better as the season goes on, and I can understand why Pep Guardiola feels there is even more to come from his side.Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden are both flying, they are creating stacks of chances for Erling Haaland and, at the other end, they are keeping clean sheets now too. You just can't back against them at the moment, and I am expecting more moments of quality like we saw when they won 3-0 at Crystal Palace a couple of weeks ago.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Jonny's prediction: City are hitting a really good run of form at the right time. As well as Pep's tactical sophistication, I am loving seeing a flair player like Cherki get to impose his will on games. Foden is filling that David Silva role he was always earmarked for, too. 0-3AI's prediction: 1-3Emirates Stadium, 15:00People are saying that Arsenal are wobbling but I think they have had their wobble, really, when they scraped past Wolves.The Gunners won 1-0 at Everton last time out, and it was a bit of a battle, but they were up against a David Moyes side so I didn't expect anything else.My only criticism of Arsenal at the moment is that Viktor Gyokeres shouldn't be taking their penalties - Bukayo Saka should, because he is in my Fantasy team. It really annoyed me to see Gyokeres scoring from the spot against the Toffees.It won't be easy for them against Brighton, but I still think they should win this one.The Seagulls are such a strange team, and they are extremely difficult to predict.They have not won any of their past four games but they pushed Liverpool all the way when I watched them at Anfield recently, and I think they will do the same here.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Jonny's prediction: Manchester City have cut Arsenal's lead pretty dramatically and they are probably looking over their shoulders a bit. Needing two own goals to beat Wolves, one of the worst Premier League teams of all time, says a lot about where they are at the moment. Even so, I still think Arteta's side have probably got too much in the tank for the Seagulls, even though they have got ex-Gunners star Danny Welbeck leading their attack. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-1Gtech Community Stadium, 15:00Brentford picked up their first away win of the season against Wolves last time out, and their home form is really strong, although Leeds held them in their most recent game there.I feel like this game has got goals in it, because Bournemouth seem to score and concede a lot.The Cherries have drawn their past three games, and I have a feeling this is one will also end up with the points being shared.Sutton's prediction: 2-2Jonny's prediction: Brentford are a lot like Newcastle in that their home form is so strong, while their away results have been pretty poor. So, this is not an easy game for the Cherries at all - apologies to their fans because, despite spending many years living in the Bournemouth area, I don't see them returning to winning ways here. 2-0AI's prediction: 1-2Turf Moor, 15:00Burnley got a late goal that earned them a point at Bournemouth, which felt big for their boss Scott Parker - it felt like a few Clarets fans were questioning whether he is the man to keep them in the Premier League.As I've said before, I've always felt like Burnley were being competitive, even when they were losing games.This is going to be a close game, too. Everton's problem is that they are missing Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, and they might have to settle for a point.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Jonny's prediction: Scott Parker's teams seem to do incredibly well in the Championship, then struggle a bit when they get to the Premier League.Everton were on a really good run before they lost to Chelsea and Arsenal and I am backing them here, even with Ndiaye at the Africa Cup of Nations and Dewsbury-Hall injured. 0-1AI's prediction: 0-1Anfield, 15:00Poor old Alexander Isak. His form has been awful all season following his move from Newcastle, and now he is out for a couple of months.I don't think Liverpool are going to struggle with Hugo Ekitike leading the line, however. Yes, they are also missing Mohamed Salah while he is with Egypt at Afcon, but Ekitike is having a phenomenal season.Dominik Szoboszlai is out for Liverpool too, after picking up his fifth booking of the season against Spurs.Maybe it is time for Florian Wirtz to really come to the fore for Arne Slot's side.Wolves did really well to hold out for so long at Arsenal recently, and that kind of backs-against-the-wall defending seems to suit them.They will try to make things awkward for Liverpool too, but I don't see it working out for them.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Jonny's prediction: Hugo Ekitike has got brilliant confidence, can do a bit of everything and seems to integrate really well with the team. Liverpool also spent £125m on someone who was a bench striker before he got injured. Even though they have not had the season they would have liked, Arne Slot's side are going to have too much for Wolves who, in terms of bad teams in the past few years, are right up there as one of the worst. I don't know who they are going to beat this season. 3-0AI's prediction: 3-1London Stadium, 15:00West Ham really need a win here. They are staring down the barrel of relegation after taking only two points from their past five games.Nuno Espirito Santo got a bit of a bounce at the start of November but they have not maintained that form.There does not seem to be much Christmas cheer at London Stadium at the moment and if they get off to a bad start here, things could turn quite quickly.Fulham got an important win over Nottingham Forest on Monday, which was enough for them to keep their heads above water in the relegation struggle. They always seem to pose a goal threat, and I have a feeling they will have something to celebrate here, too.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Jonny's prediction: Fulham tend to be sneaky good - I always underrate them, and then they end up delivering really good team performances, and I love watching Kevin because - as well as flair - he has an end product too. West Ham are not having a great time of it right now but they will be up for it and they really need something here. 1-1AI's prediction: 2-1Stamford Bridge, 17:30I could not believe that Aston Villa were getting criticism on the Monday Night Club because they are only winning games by the odd goal.I made the point that I don't remember going in the dressing room as a player and being down about only winning 2-1. They are on an incredible run of 10 wins on the spin, including beating Arsenal and Manchester City. Morgan Rogers is on fire, and I think you have to respect them as title contenders.This is a real test for them, however, and it is only a few weeks since we were saying the same about Chelsea being in the title race after they drew against Arsenal with 10 men.I played for both these clubs and am highly thought of by both sets of fans.It is the Chelsea fans who I think will be smiling at full-time, though, once they've finished singing my name.I have got a lot of time for Blues boss Enzo Maresca, who is like Villa manager Unai Emery in the way he sticks to his footballing principles.Chelsea showed their resilience when they fought back from 2-0 down to draw with Newcastle and I can see them digging in again here, to end Villa's winning run.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Jonny's prediction: Unai Emery's side didn't start the season well but now they have got that confidence that, even if they concede, they can score more than the opposition. This was a hard one to call but I am going with Villa, probably because I want them to win rather than because I think they will. 1-2AI's prediction: 1-2Sunday, 28 DecemberStadium of Light, 14:00Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been absolutely unbelievable up front for Leeds. They are just a much better team with him in it, and their confidence must be sky-high at the moment too, because they have had some excellent results recently.The worry for Sunderland is how much they will miss their players who are away at Afcon, but I don't think it will affect them.The Black Cats don't score a lot of goals but they are always so well-organised - I am going for them to win, and keep out Calvert-Lewin to keep a clean sheet too.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Jonny's prediction: It depresses me how good Sunderland are this season. They have recruited so wisely and even with losing players to Afcon, the core of their team is really strong. Leeds have picked up recently and it's nice to see Dominic Calvert-Lewin scoring, but I think Sunderland will still win this - the Tyne-Wear derby has given them an even bigger boost in confidence, sadly. 2-1AI's prediction: 1-2Selhurst Park, 16:30Both teams have got problems at the moment.Crystal Palace have been feeling the effects of a heavy schedule, and at the moment their squad seems really stretched.That's the main reason I am thinking Tottenham might get something at Selhurst Park and, let's face it, Thomas Frank really needs to.Frank must be hoping the way his team played with nine men against Liverpool can kick-start his side's season, but I'm not sure that will happen.I am certainly not going to back them to win this one, but I am hardly confident about Palace's chances either.Sutton's prediction: 0-0Jonny's prediction: Palace should be the stronger side but Ismaila Sarr is a big loss for them while he is away at Afcon, he is so explosive. Thomas Frank is under a bit of pressure at Spurs - they are more pragmatic, but they are not scoring and they are still conceding. 2-2AI's prediction: 1-2How did Sutton do last week?Chris got three correct results with one exact score from the 10 matches in week 17, giving him 60 points.His guest, rapper Sampa the Great, got eight correct results with one exact score, leaving her on 110 points.AI did even better, with five correct results, but including three exact scores, for a tally of 140 points.But to the relief of Chris, because it keeps him top of the overall league table, it was the collective efforts of the BBC readers who took the weekly win.AI was ahead after Saturday's games, leading the readers by 130 to 120, but the readers got an exact score from Aston Villa's 2-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday - out of more than 33,000 predictions, 31% of you went for that scoreline.That meant the outcome went down to the final game of the week, between Fulham and Nottingham Forest on Monday. The readers went for a 1-1 draw while AI backed Fulham to win 2-1.An exact score for AI would have seen it grab the victory but, in the end, Fulham's 1-0 win meant the readers triumphed. Overall, they managed seven correct results and three exact scores, and that gave them 160 points.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHarry SekulichGetty ImagesSupporters of Palestine Action hunger strikers protested outside Pentonville prison last weekA fourth remand detainee awaiting trial for alleged offences relating to the Palestine Action group has ended a hunger strike after more than 50 days.Amy Gardiner-Gibson, who also goes by the name Amu Gib, has joined three others in ending the strike after reportedly being taken to hospital.Lawyers for the group set a deadline of Tuesday afternoon for the government to respond to a threat of a High Court challenge.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"We want these prisoners to accept support and get better, and we will not create perverse incentives that would encourage more people to put themselves at risk through hunger strikes.\"Since the hunger strike began on 2 November, protesters have been taken to hospital on a number of occasions. Four people have ended their strike, while three others are said to be continuing.Supporters say an eighth member of the group is intermittently refusing to eat because of an underlying health condition.Gardiner-Gibson, who is reportedly being held at HMP Bronzefield, jointly started the protest with Qesser Zuhrah on 2 November. It was confirmed on Monday she had ended her strike after 48 days.The other remaining hunger strikers are Heba Muraisi, Teuta Hoxha and Kamran Ahmad. They are said to have been refusing food for 50 days, 44 days and 43 days respectively - accounts that have not been disputed by officials. Prison and NHS guidelines make clear that clinicians must oversee treatment decisions for hunger strikers. They can only be given food-related treatments if they consent or it is clear they lack the mental capacity to choose.Prisoners for Palestine have called for improved treatment of detainees while they are held on remand and for Palestine Action's ban to be lifted.The High Court has been reviewing the home secretary's decision to proscribe the group and a judgment is expected in the New Year.Minister of State for Prisons, Probation and Reducing Reoffending Lord Timpson said: \"While very concerning, hunger strikes are not a new issue for our prisons.\"Over the last five years, we've averaged over 200 a year and we have longstanding procedures in place to ensure prisoner safety.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterBP has struck a $6bn (£4.4bn) deal to sell a majority stake in its motor oil division Castrol to a US investment firm.The oil giant sold a 65% stake in Castrol, which makes lubricants for cars, motorcycles and industrial vehicles, to New York-based Stonepeak.The deal valued Castrol at $10.1bn (£7.5bn), with BP receiving $6bn in cash, which it will use to pay down debts and allow it to focus on its core business.BP will hold onto a 35% stake in Castrol, which it first took control of in 2000.The London-based oil major said the sale is a \"milestone\" in its plans to overhaul its business and strip out costs.BP in February announced plans to sell off $20bn (£15bn) worth of assets in a bid to focus on its core crude oil and gas business and strengthen its balance sheet.Following today's deal and previous announcements, the company says its over half way to meeting that target.It is also shifting its strategy away from investment in green energy and renewing its focus on oil and gas following pressure from some investors who were frustrated that its profits and share price had lagged behind rivals.Rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's call to \"drill baby drill\" has encouraged firms to invest in fossil fuels.The Castrol sale comes a week after BP unveiled its first female chief executive, Meg O'Neill, who will take the helm in April 2026.Her surprise appointment came only three months after BP appointed a new chairman, Albert Manifold.And she was handed the top job less than two years after Murray Auchincloss took over from Bernard Looney as chief executive.Wednesday's deal is the latest in a series of sales by the firm, which included offloading its US onshore wind energy business and its Dutch mobility and convenience arm.Interim chief executive Carol Howle said the sale is a \"very good outcome for all stakeholders\".\"We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan,\" she added.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the deal was \"an early Christmas present\" for BP shareholders.\"The significant proceeds from the transaction will allow BP to make a decent dent in its onerous borrowings pile. It also means it is well on the way to achieving its goal of $20 billion worth of divestments by 2027,\" he said.Shares in BP opened higher on Wednesday morning on the news, before giving up most of their gains.",

The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria.

In 1925 AA Milne, a Londoner, bought a country home a mile to the north of the forest at Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield.Winnie-the-Pooh, featuring the imaginary adventures of Milne's son Christoper Robin and his toy bear, was published in 1926 and its sequel The House at Pooh Corner in 1928. There were also two books of poems featuring the much-loved characters.The original bridge where Milne and his son Christopher Robin created the game Pooh sticks became worn and unsafe in the late 1990s.It was dismantled and replaced with a replica which is still in place in Ashdown Forest.The original structure sold at auction in 2021 for £131,000.Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyAA Milne with his son Christopher Robin and the well-loved bear in 1926 The honey-loving bear took on a new level of fame when Disney acquired the rights to the stories in 1961.Pooh Corner has been a gift shop and tea room close to Pooh Sticks Bridge in Hartfield since 1978 and is filled with mementos.Owner Neil Reed said: \"It's amazing to have people travel to our little village hidden in the English countryside from all over the world to celebrate Winnie-the-Pooh.Pooh CornerPooh Corner has acquired a rare copy of the 1925 Evening News story which features illustrations by J. H. Dowd\"We love hearing from visitors about why he is special to them and the reasons behind them travelling so far to come to the Ashdown Forest.\"Pooh Trek Tours has organised guided walks around the forest since 2018, taking in the sites made famous by the books.Founder Gerry Manser said around 90% of people on his tours came from outside the UK, predominantly from north America. PA MediaChristopher Milne revisited the original Pooh Sticks Bridge in 1979He said: \"The 100th anniversary is an extremely important event for the forest. \"Without Pooh one of the most remarkable landscapes in the UK wouldn't be as well-known.\"The commemorations in Ashdown Forest to mark Pooh's 100th birthday are expected to include an installation, which would transform the forest's visitor centre into a life-sized pop-up book.There are also plans to create new walking trails within the forest, designed to avoid protected sites.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "11 hours agoCharlotte GallagherGetty ImagesJessica Gunning won a Bafta for her role in Baby Reindeer in May Baby Reindeer was one of the standout television moments of the past few years and it catapulted actress Jessica Gunning to stardom. She played the obsessive and troubled woman, Martha, who dramatically unravels onscreen. For Gunning it was the \"role of a lifetime\", describing life as a \"surreal\" but also a \"dream\" since the show's release. \"I got goose bumps when I first read the script,\" the British actress tells the BBC, adding she had five auditions for the role.But she thought the television series might have been an indie hit, not the phenomenon on Netflix it became.  Of course, a potential downside of starring in a show like that does mean you get stopped in the street and occasionally confused with your character. \"I'd just parked near where I live and a woman screamed in my face! But in her defence she had just finished the series, walked out of her home and there I was. \"So that's surreal, occasionally being screamed at,\" she says.\"But everyone has been so lovely, there's also an incredible statistic about the difference the show has made to charities, especially ones for male survivors of sexual assault. \"I think it shows people want complicated stories. I have had 14-year-olds come and talk to me about it, as well as 90-year-olds.\"Getty ImagesShe played the troubled character MarthaAnyone who has watched Baby Reindeer may tell you it can be a difficult and upsetting watch.The show says it was based on real-life events experienced by the show's creator, Richard Gadd, who also plays the lead character. But this is disputed by the woman who allegedly inspired the person Martha is based on, who has said Netflix told \"brutal lies\" about her to more than 50 million viewers around the world.She said in June 2024 she was suing Netflix for defamation, negligence and privacy violations.The show is billed as \"a true story\", but a judge concluded in his ruling in September 2024 that certain key events in the series, like the conviction for stalking, did not happen in real life.Netflix failed in its attempt to persuade the judge to throw out the legal case brought against it, but said: \"We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd's right to tell his story.\"'It's all been a bit pinch me'Filming such an intense drama has given Gadd and Gunning a \"unique bond\" the actress says.\"We always checked in with each other and the producers and director made sure everything felt safe and considered.\"Baby Reindeer started life as a stage show at the Fringe at Edinburgh, Gunning had tried to see but couldn't get tickets so bought the play text instead.\"That was a little bit Martha of me\" she laughs.Her persistence paid off, and Gunning swept up during award season, winning an Emmy, a Bafta, a Golden Globe, an RTS and a Screen Actors Guild award. \"It's all been a bit pinch me, for all of the cast and crew really, we were out in LA, which is just crazy anyway to be in Hollywood. All the clichés are true, even to be nominated is an honour.\"Sometimes I look at the shelf that has my awards on and I think 'Oh my gosh', it feels like a dream really.\"Gunning has been in the industry for almost two decades, but Baby Reindeer has been a life-changing experience.\"I feel like on the one hand my life has completely changed, but I also feel exactly the same in a good way.\"\"I feel like if something like Baby Reindeer happened straight after coming out of drama school, maybe I'd feel like a bit of a deer in the headlights, pardon the pun. \"Now I feel a lot more grounded and I've got a big group of family and friends. But it is kind of strange, the number of viewers that Netflix bring in, you can't really compute. If you think about it too much it can feel a little bit scary.\"She is well aware of the significance of the role saying: \"I waited 17 years for a part like Martha to come along, so hopefully it won't be another 17 years.\"Getty ImagesJessica Gunning and her Baby Reindeer co-star Richard GaddGunning will next be on-screen on Christmas Eve, in the BBC One and Children In Need animation Pudsey and the Thread of Hope. It is based on an original story by McFly star and composer for the Paddington muscial Tom Fletcher, who's also written the music for the cartoon. Gunning plays a woman grieving for her husband, while her son is also navigating his way through grief. It is a handbrake turn after Baby Reindeer, but Gunning says the script was \"beautiful\" and she wanted to be involved \"in the special charity\". \"Children can deal with big issues like this, and hopefully children will watch and feel seen if they've experienced this, or are going through something similar.\" \"All my life I've grown up with Children In Need, I went to school dressed up as an Emu and wore it all day.\" Jessica Gunning took Pudsey Bear into a recording studioSo what next for Gunning? She's starring alongside Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield in a film adaptation of Enid Blyton's much-loved children's book, The Magic Faraway Tree, and is filming a comedy with Angelina Jolie. The actress who's from the West Yorkshire market town where enduring BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine was filmed jokes: \"It's Holmfirth to Hollywood.\" Pudsey and the Thread of Hope airs on 24 December at 10:20 GMT on BBC One and iPlayer, and on 27 December at 17:00 GMT on CBeebies and CBBC.",

    "body": "12 hours agoLana LamSydneyAustralian Federal PolicePolice arrested and charged the British man, 43, earlier this monthA British national in Australia has had his visa cancelled and faces deportation for allegedly displaying Nazi symbols.The 43-year-old man living in Queensland was arrested and charged earlier this month, after allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community.The man was taken into immigration detention this week in Brisbane and is due to face court in January. Police have been cracking down on the use of prohibited symbols amid a recent rise in antisemitism and right-wing extremism.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"He came here to hate - he doesn't get to stay.\"\"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest,\" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Wednesday.Last month, Burke also revoked the visa of Matthew Gruter, a South African national who had been living in Australia since 2022, after he was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally in front of the New South Wales parliament. Like Gruter, the British man can appeal his visa being revoked. He can leave Australia voluntarily or wait to be deported to his home country. It is understood police are assessing whether to delay deporting the man so he can face court next month.The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.Earlier this year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute.Police began investigating the British man in October over alleged posts on X. The social media platform blocked his account, prompting him to create a new one with a similar name where he continued posting offensive and harmful content, police said. Australian Federal PolicePolice seized weapons including axes and knives from the British man's homeAuthorities searched the man's home in Caboolture, on the outskirts of Brisbane, in late November and seized phones, weapons and several swords with swastika symbols. He was charged with three counts of displaying banned Nazi symbols and one count  of using the internet to cause offense.\"We want to ensure these symbols are not being used to fracture social cohesion,\" Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Nutt said earlier this month.  \"If we identify instances where this is happening, we will act swiftly to disrupt the behaviour, prosecute those involved and protect the dignity, safety and cohesion of our diverse community.\"",

Two traffic police officers saw a \"suspicious individual\" near a police car on the city's Yeletskaya Street, and when they approached the suspect to detain him, an explosive device was detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee has said. The two police officers died from their injuries, along with another individual who was standing nearby. The blast took place close to the location where a senior Russian general was killed in a car bombing in the capital on Monday.Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died after an explosive device - which had been planted under a car - was detonated.Investigate Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement on Telegram that a criminal case was being investigated in Moscow \"regarding an attempt on the lives of traffic police officers\". The officers have been named by Russian media as Ilya Klimanov, 24, and Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Speaking to the Reuters news agency, Alexander, a resident who lives close by, said: \"There was an explosion.\"It was loud bang - like with the car a few days ago.\"Russia said it suspected Ukraine was behind Monday's explosion, however Ukraine has not said whether it was involved in Fanil Sarvarov's death.It is also not known whether the two explosions are linked. Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department.He was the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIain Watson, Political correspondentThe government's partial U-turn on what opponents dubbed the \"farms tax\" was a Christmas present for those who had campaigned against the imposition of 20% inheritance tax from next April.About half the farms that would have been affected will now be exempt.But given that minsters had defended the policy in the 14 months since last year's Budget, the questions are: Why change it? And why now?Sustained protests - the regular convoys of tractors, horns blaring, converging on Parliament Square - certainly played a part. The National Farmers' Union which had organised the noisy demonstrations had also engaged in quieter diplomacy behind the scenes with Downing Street and the agriculture department. It has been reported that discussions shifted to mitigating rather than obliterating the policy completely. But there are other factors.A consequence of last year's landslide Labour election victory is that more of the party's MPs represent rural and semi-rural seats. Behind closed doors, some of them had been pressing hard for concessions. While only one voted against, more than 30 of them actively abstained on a parliamentary vote on the inheritance tax policy earlier this month to demonstrate their concerns.Beyond this, the reasons for the timing of the government's volte face are speculative.One of the rural rebels told me that conversations with ministers had been more positive this month - though they had not been told in advance of yesterday's announcement.And some believe that Sir Keir Starmer's appearance this month before the liaison committee - which consists of senior MPs who chair cross-party parliamentary committees - played a role.He was subjected to uncomfortable questioning by the Labour MP Cat Smith and the Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, both of whom in effect suggested some farmers were contemplating suicide - or as Smith put it, \"actively planning to expedite their own deaths\" - before inheritance tax was introduced next April so they could pass on their family farms.The prospect of personal tragedies - and awful headlines - was made very clear to the prime minister.Downing Street is keen to get on the front foot when MPs return to Parliament in January, and dispelling this particular political dark cloud might have been regarded as an essential precursor.The Conservatives maintain that the policy change was \"sneaked out\" while MPs were away and could not subject ministers to scrutiny.A recess reversal certainly does not radiate confidence from a government that has 400 of parliament's 650 seats.While some Labour MPs are relieved that the government has listened, others are wondering why it persisted with a policy that was going to raise relatively little revenue. This change is going to cost £130m. To put that in context, it is a tiny fraction of the around £900bn generated in total in taxation annually.And of course with Labour trailing in the polls, there are concerns about the government's ability to make the political weather.Something of a modus operandi is emerging where revenue raising policies are announced by the Treasury, then there is a public backlash, and internal Labour discontent followed some time later by a partial reversal once the political damage has been sustained.Think winter fuel, welfare reform and now family farms.The policies may have changed but questions over political judgment remain.",

    "body": "Venezuela has accused the United States of the \"greatest extortion\" at an emergency session of the UN Security Council in New York.  Washington's seizure of two Venezuelan oil tankers was \"worse than piracy,\" the Venezuelan ambassador to the UN said. The emergency meeting of the Security Council was called to discuss the seizure of the tankers, which took place off the coast of Venezuela earlier this month. The US has also said it was pursuing a third Venezuelan oil tanker. President Trump has accused Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drugs cartel and said gangs had operated with impunity for too long.On 16 December, Trump ordered a naval blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. The US president has said the US will keep or sell the crude oil it has taken, as well as the vessels themselves.The US has been building up its military presence in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas in recent months, sending 15,000 troops and a range of aircraft carriers and warships to the area. It is the largest deployment to the region since the US invaded Panama in 1989, and the stated aim is to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US.The US has carried out strikes on what it says are Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, targeting more than 20 vessels and killing at least 100 people. Some experts say the strikes could violate laws governing armed conflict.Venezuela's envoy to the UN said the US was subjecting his country to the \"greatest extortion\" in its history. Speaking at the UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday, Samuel Moncada said \"we are in the presence of a power that acts outside of international law, demanding that Venezuelans vacate our country and hand it over.\"Regarding the US seizure of Venezuelan oil, he added: \"We are talking about pillaging, looting and recolonisation of Venezuela. \"The government of the United States does not have jurisdiction in the Caribbean.\"Referring to the Venezuelan oil industry, he said: \"What does that have to do with drugs?\"In response, the US Ambassador to the UN, Michael Waltz, told the Security Council the US does not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.\"Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claims to power and his narco-terrorist activities,\" Mr Waltz said. On a visit to a trade fair in Caracas, President Maduro said \"the Security Council is giving overwhelming support to Venezuela.\"Russia and China accused the US of bullying and aggression.The US was \"illegally destroying\" civilian vessels in the Caribbean Sea, the Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the UN meeting. He warned that other countries could be next. The US actions against Venezuelan vessels, he said, were \"a template for future acts of force against Latin American states.\"Meanwhile, China's envoy to the UN, Sun Lei, called on the US to \"immediately halt relevant actions and avoid further escalation of tensions.\"",

    "body": "Arsenal are sitting top of the Premier League at Christmas, but it is BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton who leads the way when it comes to predictions.\"I'm number one at Christmas - again,\" said Sutton, who as a player led the Premier League table at this point with Norwich in 1992 and Blackburn in 1994, and went on to win the title with Rovers.\"It's a big deal for me to be top, as well as for Arsenal.\"AI is the go-to for virtually everyone in the world whenever they have to ask anything, so the fact that I am beating it - and let's face it, I have stuffed it for half a season now - is pretty incredible. It says a lot about me, and I'm delighted. \"Rather than asking AI about everything, maybe people should come to me to tap into my intelligence instead?\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For week 18 - the festive fixtures on Boxing Day and the weekend of 27 and 28 December - he takes on Jonny Stewart, bass singer with sea shanty folk supergroup The Wellermen, who is a Newcastle fan.The Wellermen were the originators of the sea shanty trend on TikTok, with their versions of Misty Mountain, Nancy Mulligan and Hoist the Colours racking up billions of views.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, The WellermenImage caption, The Wellermen's eponymous debut album achieved 110m streams across all platforms. Their latest album, Northern Sky, is out now - as is their latest single of the same name, featuring Rose BettsSome of Jonny's earliest memories as a fan were the FA Cup finals that Newcastle lost in 1998 and 1999, but he was finally able to celebrate a trophy when the Magpies won the Carabao Cup in March.\"We were actually on tour in Colorado at the time - we had just done a show in Boulder and we had one in Denver the next day,\" he told BBC Sport.\"I was frantically Googling where I could watch the game a few weeks before, when we'd reached the final, and whether I could find anyone to watch it with me - because on Mountain Time it kicked off around 10am.\"I connected with the Mile High Magpies, the Denver area supporters' club, and they said to come along to this bar. There were a couple of Liverpool fans in there but more than 100 Newcastle fans were crammed into it. It was brilliant.\"I'd bought a Dan Burn Carabao Cup final shirt in the run-up to the game because I thought, if we win, it is going to mean so much having the ultimate local lad on the back of my jersey.\"So, when Big Dan scored one of the best headers I've ever seen to put us 1-0 up, I cried so hard.\"Being away from home, and away from my best mate Angus, who I'd usually watch our games with, was hard - he was Facetiming me from this pub in Chelmsford which had about two people in, so I'd found a much better place.\"And then I saw us totally outplay the best team in the league, and end our trophy drought. It really doesn't get much better than that.\"Chris Sutton and Jonny Stewart were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.Premier League predictionsFriday, 26 DecemberOld Trafford, 20:00 GMTManchester United got a bit of praise for their performance against Aston Villa, even though they were beaten.The key to how this game goes is what they do without Bruno Fernandes, and how they are going to cope without him.You look around Ruben Amorim's squad and he does not seem to have a lot of leaders in there. It will be interesting to see if Amorim plays centre-back Lisandro Martinez in that holding midfield role, the same job he did when he came on for Fernandes against Villa, because he could provide that leadership they will need.Newcastle United will be absolutely sick that they let a two-goal lead slip against Chelsea last week, while their away record has a lot of room for improvement - they have won only one of their eight away league games so far.Manchester United are three points and four places above them in the table, but they are missing a few players at the Africa Cup of Nations and, in my mind, Newcastle United have the better squad anyway.Because of that, I am going to back Eddie Howe's side here. There won't be many goals, though, and they may only need to score one to win it.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Jonny's prediction: Manchester United blow hot and cold - they are capable of playing some really nice football but I don't know where their goals will come from without Bryan Mbeumo or Bruno Fernandes. This is genuinely really hard for me to call but I am going with my heart over my head - I have to! 1-2AI's prediction: 2-2Saturday, 27 DecemberCity Ground, 12:30Nottingham Forest are still lingering just above the relegation places, and Monday's defeat at Fulham was a disappointing result for them.I still think Sean Dyche's side are going to be fine, however, and they have definitely made strides since he took charge at the end of October.This is a tricky game for Manchester City but they are on a bit of a roll at the moment.I thought Arsenal were going to run away with the title, but not any more. City are getting better and better as the season goes on, and I can understand why Pep Guardiola feels there is even more to come from his side.Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden are both flying, they are creating stacks of chances for Erling Haaland and, at the other end, they are keeping clean sheets now too. You just can't back against them at the moment, and I am expecting more moments of quality like we saw when they won 3-0 at Crystal Palace a couple of weeks ago.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Jonny's prediction: City are hitting a really good run of form at the right time. As well as Pep's tactical sophistication, I am loving seeing a flair player like Cherki get to impose his will on games. Foden is filling that David Silva role he was always earmarked for, too. 0-3AI's prediction: 1-3Emirates Stadium, 15:00People are saying that Arsenal are wobbling but I think they have had their wobble, really, when they scraped past Wolves.The Gunners won 1-0 at Everton last time out, and it was a bit of a battle, but they were up against a David Moyes side so I didn't expect anything else.My only criticism of Arsenal at the moment is that Viktor Gyokeres shouldn't be taking their penalties - Bukayo Saka should, because he is in my Fantasy team. It really annoyed me to see Gyokeres scoring from the spot against the Toffees.It won't be easy for them against Brighton, but I still think they should win this one.The Seagulls are such a strange team, and they are extremely difficult to predict.They have not won any of their past four games but they pushed Liverpool all the way when I watched them at Anfield recently, and I think they will do the same here.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Jonny's prediction: Manchester City have cut Arsenal's lead pretty dramatically and they are probably looking over their shoulders a bit. Needing two own goals to beat Wolves, one of the worst Premier League teams of all time, says a lot about where they are at the moment. Even so, I still think Arteta's side have probably got too much in the tank for the Seagulls, even though they have got ex-Gunners star Danny Welbeck leading their attack. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-1Gtech Community Stadium, 15:00Brentford picked up their first away win of the season against Wolves last time out, and their home form is really strong, although Leeds held them in their most recent game there.I feel like this game has got goals in it, because Bournemouth seem to score and concede a lot.The Cherries have drawn their past three games, and I have a feeling this is one will also end up with the points being shared.Sutton's prediction: 2-2Jonny's prediction: Brentford are a lot like Newcastle in that their home form is so strong, while their away results have been pretty poor. So, this is not an easy game for the Cherries at all - apologies to their fans because, despite spending many years living in the Bournemouth area, I don't see them returning to winning ways here. 2-0AI's prediction: 1-2Turf Moor, 15:00Burnley got a late goal that earned them a point at Bournemouth, which felt big for their boss Scott Parker - it felt like a few Clarets fans were questioning whether he is the man to keep them in the Premier League.As I've said before, I've always felt like Burnley were being competitive, even when they were losing games.This is going to be a close game, too. Everton's problem is that they are missing Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, and they might have to settle for a point.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Jonny's prediction: Scott Parker's teams seem to do incredibly well in the Championship, then struggle a bit when they get to the Premier League.Everton were on a really good run before they lost to Chelsea and Arsenal and I am backing them here, even with Ndiaye at the Africa Cup of Nations and Dewsbury-Hall injured. 0-1AI's prediction: 0-1Anfield, 15:00Poor old Alexander Isak. His form has been awful all season following his move from Newcastle, and now he is out for a couple of months.I don't think Liverpool are going to struggle with Hugo Ekitike leading the line, however. Yes, they are also missing Mohamed Salah while he is with Egypt at Afcon, but Ekitike is having a phenomenal season.Dominik Szoboszlai is out for Liverpool too, after picking up his fifth booking of the season against Spurs.Maybe it is time for Florian Wirtz to really come to the fore for Arne Slot's side.Wolves did really well to hold out for so long at Arsenal recently, and that kind of backs-against-the-wall defending seems to suit them.They will try to make things awkward for Liverpool too, but I don't see it working out for them.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Jonny's prediction: Hugo Ekitike has got brilliant confidence, can do a bit of everything and seems to integrate really well with the team. Liverpool also spent £125m on someone who was a bench striker before he got injured. Even though they have not had the season they would have liked, Arne Slot's side are going to have too much for Wolves who, in terms of bad teams in the past few years, are right up there as one of the worst. I don't know who they are going to beat this season. 3-0AI's prediction: 3-1London Stadium, 15:00West Ham really need a win here. They are staring down the barrel of relegation after taking only two points from their past five games.Nuno Espirito Santo got a bit of a bounce at the start of November but they have not maintained that form.There does not seem to be much Christmas cheer at London Stadium at the moment and if they get off to a bad start here, things could turn quite quickly.Fulham got an important win over Nottingham Forest on Monday, which was enough for them to keep their heads above water in the relegation struggle. They always seem to pose a goal threat, and I have a feeling they will have something to celebrate here, too.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Jonny's prediction: Fulham tend to be sneaky good - I always underrate them, and then they end up delivering really good team performances, and I love watching Kevin because - as well as flair - he has an end product too. West Ham are not having a great time of it right now but they will be up for it and they really need something here. 1-1AI's prediction: 2-1Stamford Bridge, 17:30I could not believe that Aston Villa were getting criticism on the Monday Night Club because they are only winning games by the odd goal.I made the point that I don't remember going in the dressing room as a player and being down about only winning 2-1. They are on an incredible run of 10 wins on the spin, including beating Arsenal and Manchester City. Morgan Rogers is on fire, and I think you have to respect them as title contenders.This is a real test for them, however, and it is only a few weeks since we were saying the same about Chelsea being in the title race after they drew against Arsenal with 10 men.I played for both these clubs and am highly thought of by both sets of fans.It is the Chelsea fans who I think will be smiling at full-time, though, once they've finished singing my name.I have got a lot of time for Blues boss Enzo Maresca, who is like Villa manager Unai Emery in the way he sticks to his footballing principles.Chelsea showed their resilience when they fought back from 2-0 down to draw with Newcastle and I can see them digging in again here, to end Villa's winning run.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Jonny's prediction: Unai Emery's side didn't start the season well but now they have got that confidence that, even if they concede, they can score more than the opposition. This was a hard one to call but I am going with Villa, probably because I want them to win rather than because I think they will. 1-2AI's prediction: 1-2Sunday, 28 DecemberStadium of Light, 14:00Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been absolutely unbelievable up front for Leeds. They are just a much better team with him in it, and their confidence must be sky-high at the moment too, because they have had some excellent results recently.The worry for Sunderland is how much they will miss their players who are away at Afcon, but I don't think it will affect them.The Black Cats don't score a lot of goals but they are always so well-organised - I am going for them to win, and keep out Calvert-Lewin to keep a clean sheet too.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Jonny's prediction: It depresses me how good Sunderland are this season. They have recruited so wisely and even with losing players to Afcon, the core of their team is really strong. Leeds have picked up recently and it's nice to see Dominic Calvert-Lewin scoring, but I think Sunderland will still win this - the Tyne-Wear derby has given them an even bigger boost in confidence, sadly. 2-1AI's prediction: 1-2Selhurst Park, 16:30Both teams have got problems at the moment.Crystal Palace have been feeling the effects of a heavy schedule, and at the moment their squad seems really stretched.That's the main reason I am thinking Tottenham might get something at Selhurst Park and, let's face it, Thomas Frank really needs to.Frank must be hoping the way his team played with nine men against Liverpool can kick-start his side's season, but I'm not sure that will happen.I am certainly not going to back them to win this one, but I am hardly confident about Palace's chances either.Sutton's prediction: 0-0Jonny's prediction: Palace should be the stronger side but Ismaila Sarr is a big loss for them while he is away at Afcon, he is so explosive. Thomas Frank is under a bit of pressure at Spurs - they are more pragmatic, but they are not scoring and they are still conceding. 2-2AI's prediction: 1-2How did Sutton do last week?Chris got three correct results with one exact score from the 10 matches in week 17, giving him 60 points.His guest, rapper Sampa the Great, got eight correct results with one exact score, leaving her on 110 points.AI did even better, with five correct results, but including three exact scores, for a tally of 140 points.But to the relief of Chris, because it keeps him top of the overall league table, it was the collective efforts of the BBC readers who took the weekly win.AI was ahead after Saturday's games, leading the readers by 130 to 120, but the readers got an exact score from Aston Villa's 2-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday - out of more than 33,000 predictions, 31% of you went for that scoreline.That meant the outcome went down to the final game of the week, between Fulham and Nottingham Forest on Monday. The readers went for a 1-1 draw while AI backed Fulham to win 2-1.An exact score for AI would have seen it grab the victory but, in the end, Fulham's 1-0 win meant the readers triumphed. Overall, they managed seven correct results and three exact scores, and that gave them 160 points.",

    "body": "Nasry Asfura has been declared the winner of Honduras' razor-thin presidential election, after weeks of delays following technical problems and allegations of fraud. The conservative National Party candidate - backed by US President Donald Trump - won with 40.3% of the vote, according to the National Electoral Council (CNE), edging out Salvador Nasralla of the centre-right Liberal Party, who got 39.5%. In a post on X,  Asfura said: \"Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down.\" Meanwhile, Nasralla said at a press conference: \"I will not accept a result built on omissions.\" But he also urged his supporters to remain calm.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged all parties to respect the result \"so that Honduran authorities may ensure a peaceful transition of authority\".  But the president of the country's Congress, Luis Redondo, posted saying the result was \"completely illegal\".The vote was held on 30 November but the count was delayed twice by technical outages, which electoral officials called \"inexcusable\".The president of the CNE, Ana Paola Hall, blamed the private company tasked with tabulating the results for the delay.She said the firm had carried out maintenance without warning or checking with the CNE.The stoppage came a day after the portal displaying real-time results had crashed.Results of the election were tight and, because of the tumultuous nature of the processing system, around 15% of the tally sheets had to be counted by hand for the winner to be decided. There have been tensions in Honduras as a result of the delays with protests held across the country last week. Thousands of supporters of the governing Libre party demonstrated in the capital Tegucigalpa over what they considered fraud in the vote.  The outgoing President, Xiomara Castro, had alleged that an \"electoral coup\" was taking place and earlier this month said the election was being marred by \"interference\" from Trump. When he endorsed Asfura for president, Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\" if his very narrow lead was overturned in the count. He also threatened to withdraw financial support from the US if Asfura didn't win.In a surprise move, the US president also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, a member of Asfura's National Party, who was serving a 45-year jail sentence in the US on drug and weapons charges. Castro was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term.Nine days after the vote, Nasralla accused \"corrupt people\" of manipulating the vote count in the Central American nation. He also said Trump's comments had damaged his chances of winning.  In his statement following the announcement of the result, Rubio said the US would \"look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security co-operation\", adding the two countries would \"end illegal immigration\" to the US, while strengthening economic ties.

    "body": "Tarique Rahman, the front-runner to be the next prime minister of Bangladesh, has returned to the country after 17 years in exile ahead of landmark general elections.The 60-year-old is the figurehead of the influential Zia family and the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. The party he leads, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is eyeing a return to power when Bangladesh goes to the polls in the new year.Rahman, who has lived in London since 2008, is expected to become the country's new leader if the BNP emerges as the largest party. Rahman's return comes in the wake of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year.He had been the subject of various criminal investigations launched while her Awami League party was in power but was cleared of all charges when her regime fell. Hasina is living in exile in India and her party is unlikely to be permitted to take part in the elections, which many view as among the most consequential in Bangladesh's history.Last month, Hasina was sentenced to death for her role in suppressing anti-government protests. According to UN investigators, up to 1,400 people died in the student-led unrest.Hasina, who was put on trial in absentia, has denied committing crimes against humanity. ",

He also had a recurring role on Murphy Brown between 1995 and 1997.He starred as Joe Mayo in Seinfeld in 1998, playing a party host known to delegate burdensome jobs to his guests.He made guest appearances on popular shows throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, including on the King of Queens, Friends, That '70s Show, and House.

    "body": "What are professional footballers tucking into at Christmas? 7 hours agoSrosh KhanandNaomi de Souza,BBC NewsbeatHandoutTommy Cole works with nutritionists at football clubs to make sure players get the most out of their mealsMany of us have been waiting all year to tuck into our favourite festive treats.Christmas dinner can look very different for each household - but for professional footballers, it is still a time to stay focused on fitness and recovery for matches.Private chef Tommy Cole whips up meals for Premier League players from major clubs - including Fulham, Chelsea and Brighton - all year round. When it comes to the main Christmas meal, he takes a traditional approach, but makes it \"a little boujee-r\" and healthier. \"With roast potatoes, for example, it's just being careful not to roast them in a crazy amount of fat, whilst still trying to make them nice and crispy,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\"Also things like your fillings, again, just being careful with the amount of fat that you're cooking them in.\" Getty ImagesProfessional footballers have still got to stay focused on their fitness at Christmas He also tries to stick to slightly leaner cuts of meat.\"Turkey's very popular at Christmas so we would use the breast and not quite so much of the dark meat, which tends to be a bit fattier, and then just try and get plenty of veggies,\" the 33-year-old explains.Tommy works with nutritionists at the footballers' clubs to make sure they get the most out of their meals.\"We communicate with the players themselves and get their likes, dislikes,\" he says.\"Then we basically build a menu around that information and try and feed them some really tasty food.\"The Christmas period is a particularly busy time for some of his football clients, so he's got to ensure they're getting the fuel they need to stay at the top of their game.\"The guys that are playing games, especially around Christmas, we'll see the fixtures are a bit more frequent,\" he says. December is notoriously busy for major clubs, with additional Premier League matches, extra European fixtures and cup competitions like the Carabao Cup and FA Cup.Clubs like Chelsea and Arsenal are going to be playing more than 15 matches in December and January. HandoutTommy started his chef journey eight years agoThe relentless football fixtures have been long spoken about by players and managers, who have complained about injuries and the short turnaround between matches.Due to the increased schedule, Tommy says they will need to be eating more carbohydrates to keep up their energy. \"So more potatoes, pasta, that sort of thing. We're just increasing those in their meals,\" he says.He will also try to get plenty of vegetables in to their diets for added nutrients, and for those who aren't the biggest fan, he has some tricks to sneak them in.  \"We might make some kind of sauces with vegetables,\" he says. \"So quite a popular and tasty one is making a katsu sauce.\"I make the base of the sauce with carrots, onions, garlic, that sort of thing.\"When it comes to helping players' recovery, oily fish, nuts and seeds are top of the menu. HandoutThe chef will try to add plenty of vegetables for added nutrientsHandoutTommy admits he didn't initally plan to get into the culinary worldTommy's cooking videos have racked up millions of views on TikTok, fuelled by a mix of curiosity and fascination into the diets of professional players.The mystery behind who is he catering for also draws people in - but he tells Newsbeat he is keeping that secret to himself.He is part of a growing industry dedicated to cooking high-end dinners for the rich and famous.But Tommy admits he didn't initially plan to get into the culinary world.  \"It never was a real big sort of dream or aspiration to be a chef,\" he says.\"I got into it because I went on a ski season, I just wanted to have a good time and then ended up cooking through that.\"After catching the cooking bug, he trained as a chef. Through his work at luxury chalets and hotels, he cooked for several celebrities and Premier League players, and one thing led to another. But over his eight years as a chef, Tommy has had some strange requests.\"I have had people request just frankfurters,\" he says. \"Which is the most average thing.\"Obviously you give the players what they want, but it's nice to do slightly fancier stuff.\"Matches being played on Boxing Day is a long-standing tradition in English football, but this year only one will be played in the Premier League.For Boxing Day, Tommy leans into tradition: \"It's just going to be bubble and squeak, lots of veggies in there, that good stuff.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "Organisers of some Christmas and Boxing Day swims in Devon and Cornwall have postponed or cancelled events due to a yellow weather warning for wind.The Met Office warning is in place for the South West from 04:00 until 23:59 GMT on Christmas Day, with gusts of up to 65mph forecast. There is also a yellow cold-health alert issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UHSA).Organisers of the annual Coverack swim, in Cornwall, said its Christmas Day swim had been postponed for the first time in its 57-year history.Several Boxing Day swims have been cancelled in Devon. The Met Office warning also affects Somerset and a large swathe of Wales.  It says east to northeasterly winds will become particularly strong and gusty during Christmas Day, with peak gusts fairly widely of 45-55mph, and 55-65mph possible along some exposed coasts. Large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts, it adds.Organisers of the Coverack swim said with the weather forecast, it would be \"too dangerous\" for the event to go ahead.The swim has been postponed until New Year's Day, organisers added.Start Bay Inn, in Devon, said it was \"really sad\" to announce its Boxing Day swim had been cancelled.It said on social media: \"We are really sad to say that due to the rough NE wind it will be too rough here at Torcross for our annual swim.\"RNLI Teignmouth said it had made the \"difficult decision\" to cancel its Boxing Day walk in the sea event.It said: \"The annual event, which usually sees hundreds of participants take a festive dip in support of RNLI lifesavers, has long been a highlight of the Boxing Day calendar. \"While organisers understand the disappointment this decision may cause, safety considerations must come first.\"The Royal Air Force Air Cadets 200 Squadron Torquay said on social media on Tuesday, Torbay Council's Boxing Day Dip at Torre Abbey had been cancelled.It said a statement from the council said: \"With reference to the Boxing Day Dip hosted by Torbay Council which 200 Squadron has been a part of for many years, unfortunately the RNLI have advised to cancel the Torre Abbey Boxing Day Dip due to large swells and easterly winds producing rough seas on Boxing Day and therefore the Boxing Day Dip at Torre Abbey Sands is cancelled for everyone's safety.  \"We understand that this is disappointing for some however the safety of all participating is paramount and we must ensure all are safe at this event.\"",

    "body": "Algeria's parliament has unanimously passed a law declaring France's colonisation of the North African state a crime, and demanding an apology and reparations. The law also criminalises the glorification of colonialism, state-run TV reports.The vote is the latest sign of increasingly strained diplomatic relations between the two countries, with some observers saying they are at their lowest since Algeria gained independence 63 years ago.France's colonisation of Algeria between 1830 and 1962 was marked by mass killings, large-scale deportations and ended in a bloody war of independence. Algeria says the war killed 1.5 million people, while French historians put the death toll much lower.France's President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged the colonisation of Algeria was a \"crime against humanity\" but has not offered an apology.Lawmakers wore scarves in the colours of the national flag and chanted \"long live Algeria\" as they applauded the bill's passage through parliament, AFP news agency reports.It says the legislation states that France has \"legal responsibility\" for the \"tragedies it caused\", and \"full and fair\" compensation was an \"inalienable right of the Algerian state and people\". France has not yet commented on the vote. It comes at a time of growing pressure on Western powers to offer reparations for slavery and colonialism, and to return looted artefacts still kept in their museums.Algerian lawmakers have been demanding that France return a 16th Century bronze canon, known as Baba Merzoug, meaning \"Blessed Father\", that was regarded as the protector of Algiers, now Algeria's capital.French forces captured the city in 1830, on their third attempt, and removed the cannon - which is now in the port city of Brest in north-western France.In 2020, France returned the remains of 24 Algerian fighters who were killed resisting French colonial forces in the 19th Century.Last month, Algeria hosted a conference of African states to push for justice and reparations.Algeria's Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said that a legal framework would ensure that restitution was neither regarded as \"a gift nor a favour\".Diplomatic relations between between Algeria and France soured last year, when Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal was then arrested at Algiers airport in  and jailed for five years, before being pardoned by Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune last month.Prosecutors said he had undermined national security for making remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.",

    "body": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked an appeals court to release him from prison and overturn his conviction on two prostitution-related crimes.In a court filing for an expedited appeal, the rap mogul's attorney argued that he was improperly sentenced, and that the conduct that resulted in his conviction was not criminal in nature.Attorney Alexandra Shapiro called Combs' 50-month prison sentence \"unlawful, unconstitutional, and a perversion of justice\". She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety. The request is the latest attempt by his team to reduce his sentence or throw out his conviction.The Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.Combs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction.Federal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters.During a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.The jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.In September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act was used to prosecute Combs. That bid was not successful.Ahead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years.US District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\".Combs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison.It argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\". Before Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\"\"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\"Combs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. Many of the lawsuits allege that the rapper used his fame and power to silence accusers through threats. Some detail allegations that the rapper - or those who worked for him - drugged people at parties before alleged assaults. Representatives for Mr Combs have repeatedly said he \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor\".",

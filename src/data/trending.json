    "body": "14 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media Editor, Los AngelesBBCTwo-time Oscar winner, Sir Anthony Hopkins tells the BBC that he can't \"take credit\" for his successNot many people can say they've been given a private piano recital by Sir Anthony Hopkins. But that's exactly what happened when our four-strong BBC team went to interview the double Oscar-winning actor in Los Angeles.We were in the same room as the man who terrified as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, shattered as a butler in The Remains of The Day and devastated as a dad with dementia in The Father.An actor who was cast by Oliver Stone as President Nixon because - according to Sir Anthony - the director said \"you're nuts like Nixon\".At a grand piano in a hotel in Beverly Hills, as he plays us a piece he calls Goodbye, it's clear an artistic soul exudes from his every pore. Haunting notes of music, lines of poetry and Shakespearean verses cascade out of him.A private piano recital with Sir Anthony HopkinsWe were meeting because Sir Anthony's publishing his autobiography, We Did OK, Kid, an honest and at times upsetting account of a loner who was bullied and written off as a child in Wales and became one of Britain's finest acting exports.He puts his success down to sheer luck, telling me: \"I couldn't take credit for any of it, I couldn't have planned any of this - and now at 87, about to turn 88, I get up in the morning and I think, 'Hello, I'm still here,' and I still don't get it.\"From the outside, it looks less about luck and more about his deep understanding of human emotion, as his performances testify. I ask what makes him such an instinctive actor.\"It's such a miracle being alive,\" he says. He finds the complexity of human beings \"fascinating... I mean, how can you produce Beethoven, Bach and then Treblinka and Auschwitz?\"Sir Anthony has always understood the duality of being human, and it explains his acting range.He got his first break on film when the actor Peter O'Toole suggested he audition for the 1968 movie The Lion in Winter, in which O'Toole was playing Henry II.At that point, Sir Anthony had been a member of Sir Laurence Olivier's National Theatre company for several years. But, he recalls: \"I couldn't fit into the British theatre style, I just felt out of it.\"He also \"didn't want to be standing on stage holding a spear for the rest of my life, in wrinkled tights, I just wanted to have a bit of a life\".He was cast as Richard the Lionheart and couldn't believe that a baker's son from Port Talbot was working with Katharine Hepburn.The actress, playing his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, gave him \"the best advice I've had\" as they rehearsed their first scene together. She told him to \"just speak the lines... Don't act, just do it\". She also said he was \"real good\".Hepburn was right, of course. Some classically trained theatre actors, particularly back then, didn't appreciate how much they needed to adjust their performance for the intimacy of a camera. He did.He doesn't much care for talking about the craft of acting, or certainly the reverence there can be around it, but he shares his method with me: \"Be still. Be economic. Don't act or twitch around, you know, 'showing off' acting... simplify, simplify, simplify'.\"Hollywood PicturesDirector, Oliver Stone (L) told a reluctant Sir Anthony that he wanted him to play Nixon because he was \"nuts\" like President NixonHis performances stand out because he's an actor of huge emotional depth and psychological insight. Think of him as Dr Treves, the friend and protector of John Hurt's Elephant Man. Or as Lecter, still for me the most terrifying of characters more than 30 years on. The serial killer is a monster but Sir Anthony understood that less is more, on screen.Getty ImagesSir Anthony and Jodie Foster both won Oscars for their roles in The Silence of the LambsInstead of playing Lecter as obviously monstrous, \"you go the opposite way, you draw back\", he explains. He realised as soon as he had read a few pages of the script that the role was \"a life-changer\". He writes in his memoir that he \"instinctively sensed how to play Hannibal. I have the devil in me. We all have the devil in us, I know what scares people\".Watch: Sir Anthony Hopkins on playing the infamous Hannibal LecterHe tells me he played Lecter still - and deadly. So when he was in character opposite other actors, he decided, \"Don't take your eyes off the person. That's terrifying.\" He puts on Lecter's metallic rasp for me and appears to enjoy repeating his character's words to Jodie Foster's Clarice. \"You're not real FBI,\" he almost hisses.\"That's scary,\" he says. He's not wrong. Even in an upmarket LA hotel on a warm autumn afternoon, I'm feeling chilled.And what about the famous line - \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which he follows with that vampire-like hiss? He explains as a child he'd seen the Hungarian-American actor Bela Lugosi do the same when playing Count Dracula in the 1931 movie. Sir Anthony decided in the moment of filming to copy it and The Silence of the Lambs director, Jonathan Demme, kept it in.Getty ImagesBela Lugosi's portrayal of Count Dracula in the 1931 horror film influenced Sir Anthony when playing Hannibal Lecter What is startling about the memoir is the disconnect between how the world viewed the young actor and how much it was clearly missing about him. He was bullied at school for what other kids saw as his large \"elephant\" head. He was slapped around by teachers who deemed him a complete dunce. Even his parents pretty much wrote him off.He believes it was the making of him. It \"gave me a core of anger, resentment and revenge\", he says.But why hadn't they all noticed his talents? This was a child who was given the 10 volume Children's Encyclopaedia when he was six (\"I was so captivated, I read every one of them\") and became fascinated by astronomy. A boy who played the piano, made art and loved Dickens and Shakespeare, quoting from them extensively.A school report in 1955 when he was 17 marked \"the turning point\" in his life. It was terrible, as usual. \"What's going to happen to you?\" Sir Anthony recalls his father lamenting. \"I said: 'One day, I'll show you, both of you'.\"Sir Anthony HopkinsSir Anthony, a \"little confused boy\" by his own recollection, with his father at Aberavon Beach in 1941Sir Anthony HopkinsSir Anthony Hopkins, here in 1953, says he was bullied at school, where teachers thought he was \"thick\"He's pleased his parents lived long enough to see him succeed. When he won his first best actor Oscar, for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992, 11 years to the day after his father died, he rang his mother in Wales and said: \"I guess I did OK.\"But it was a rough ride in the early days. He was an alcoholic who picked fights with directors and others. He wasn't always a good husband to his first two wives. Booze turned him nasty. \"That's the ugly side of alcoholism,\" he writes. \"It brought out a brutal side of me. I'm not proud of it at all.\"The anger, he believes, came \"from inside, my own insecurities, being bullied at school and all the rest of it. I didn't like authority\".ShutterstockSir Anthony (seen with co-star Kate Nelligan) played an alcoholic actor, Theodore Gunge, in the 1974 TV drama The Arcata PromiseThen one night in LA in December 1975, almost 50 years ago, he drove his car while in \"a complete alcoholic blackout\". When he came to, he realised that he was \"out of control\" and could have killed someone. He made a phone call to ask for help.\"Suddenly, something said 'it's all over, now you can start living'... the craving left and it's never come back.\"At his first meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, he had a realisation about everyone else in the room.\"They're all misfits like me. Like all of us. We feel we never belong. We feel self-hatred. All of us are the same. I'm not alone.\"It's that feeling of disconnection that shines out of the book. He writes that his wife Stella believes he is on the autism spectrum which is \"likely right, given my proclivity for memorisation and repetition... and my lack of emotionality\" but he says he prefers the term \"cold fish\". I want to know why.It seems to have begun as a reaction to the bullying and screaming at him through school and National Service. \"I'd just stare them out, and that drove them mad,\" he recalls. \"You withdraw into yourself and think, 'OK you can't hurt me, can you?\" It was, he says, his \"only defence... and that's a power, you see: I don't care.\"Of course, Sir Anthony does care and we talk a little about the state of the world. It's at this point in our interview that he becomes his most passionate. He grew up in Port Talbot surrounded by people who had been impacted, even brutalised, by war. He played Sir Nicholas Winton, the man who saved hundreds of mainly Jewish children from the Nazis, in the film One Life.Warner Bros.In One Life, Sir Anthony played Sir Nicholas Winton, a stockbroker who helped to save nearly 700 mainly Jewish children from the NazisWhen I ask him about whether he worries about increasing polarisation now, he becomes very animated and intense.\"The world has always been a place of utter turmoil. But I think if we go on in this way of hatred... we are dead.\"Nobody's allowed to have an opinion. Nobody can have a different view. That's fascism. And it's insanity.\"If he has any advice about it all, it's to say \"'Come on, stop this rubbish, beating each other up over ideas. They're only ideas and we're only going to be dead one day'.\"Sir Anthony Hopkins' best performances  ShutterstockBrooks FilmsSir Anthony played President Nixon, but told us that, if offered the role of President Trump, he'd say noSir Anthony played the role of Dr Frederick Treves with compassion and said of his character that he \"wrestled with his goodness\"I ask him, as he looks back at his long life, what his biggest regrets are and he's quick to answer. \"People I've hurt over the years, the stupid things I did.\"He's estranged from his only child, his daughter Abigail, who he walked out on when she was just one and he was in the depths of alcoholism.He writes that \"after realising I was unfit as a father for Abigail, I vowed not to have any more children... I couldn't do to another child what I'd done to her\".He has tried to repair their relationship over the years.Getty ImagesSir Anthony with his daughter, Abigail  (here at the premiere of Little Man Tate in Los Angeles in 1991), describes his estrangement as \"a tremendous source of pain\"When he took on the role of King Lear in his 80s, in Sir Richard Eyre's 2018 film, Lear's words to his daughter Cordelia struck a painful chord. He writes in his new book: \"The line that hit me harder than perhaps any other I've ever spoken was 'I did her wrong'. Saying those words, I felt deeply, perhaps for the first time in my life, how I had hurt my own daughter.\"I remembered how as a baby she'd lit up when I walked into the room. I remembered how I said goodbye to her the night I walked out. I remembered how I had tried and failed to win her back later. I remembered how I had given up. And as Lear, but also as myself, I began to cry.\"He didn't want to talk about it in our interview. Poignantly, in this section of the book, he writes: \"I hope my daughter knows that my door is always open to her.\"I couldn't help feeling moved reading this. It's as if he is trying to send a message to her, hoping against hope that there might be a reconciliation before it is too late.Playground TelevisionSir Anthony (pictured with Florence Pugh) says playing King Lear made him reflect on the hurt he caused his own daughter, AbigailAt 87, he is looking back, aware he has lived many years longer than he has left to live. \"Most of my friends have died, they're gone, God bless them,\" he says. \"I hope to be around a little longer. But even that, I'm thinking, 'oh well, I had a good time'.\"He certainly still appears to be having fun. After some early reserve when we first met, he quickly relaxed. When he played the piano, he shared how he had lost two much-loved pianos when his house burnt down in the LA fires earlier this year. \"They were all under the rubble\".As we walked through the hotel lobby together, he was spotted by guests and waved happily to them. \"I like to say hi because people think actors are special. We're not at all,\" he smiles.ReutersSir Anthony credits his third wife Stella Arroyave with helping him overcome \"feelings of anxiety in a way that set [him] free\"Whatever he says, it was special to spend a few hours in his presence. He's an acting legend who's given us six decades of memorable performances. He's also a genuine heavyweight who is steeped not just in musical knowledge, but culture, history and philosophy.And we end the interview on a philosophical note - as he recites \"They are not long, the days of wine and roses\" from an Ernest Dowson poem and muses on the fleeting nature of life.\"What are we doing here, what are we?\" he asks. \"We can't explain anything about ourselves. We may have fancy ideas, religious ideas, philosophical ideas, scientific ideas... what's that all about? We're nothing finally, and yet we're everything\".We Did OK, Kid by Sir Anthony Hopkins is published on 4 November.",

    "body": "Do Bills have blueprint to beat Chiefs? Best of NFL week nineImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Will Josh Allen and the Bills finally beat the Chiefs in the play-offs?ByPaul HighamBBC Sport JournalistSunday of week nine had just about everything, and with so much to get through it has been tough to pick out the big talking points.Obviously, we have to look at how the Bills beat the Chiefs for the fifth consecutive time in the regular season, but did their performance suggest they can finally beat them in the play-offs?After largely being overlooked it is time to study the Seattle Seahawks, especially their surgical quarterback, while there is only one option for our game of the week when there is an 89-point thriller going down in Cincinnati.Here is what caught our eye from Sunday.The breakdown - are Bills finally built to beat Chiefs?The Patrick Mahomes v Josh Allen head-to-head now stands at 5-5, but the Kansas City star has won all four play-off meetings and has three Super Bowl rings.So make no mistake, this version of the Bills has been built to beat the Chiefs and they produced an almost flawless display.Buffalo dominated both lines of scrimmage and the time of possession, holding the ball for almost 10 minutes more than the Chiefs. The best way to beat Mahomes of course is to keep him off the field.When he was on it, the Bills defence both swarmed him and covered his receivers - resulting in being hit a career-high 15 times and recording a career-low 44.1% completion.Mahomes had never completed less than 50% of his passes in his nine-year career.On the flip side, Allen completed a team record 88.5% of his passes and ran in two short touchdowns to take his career tally to 79 - more rushing touchdowns than any other quarterback in NFL history.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Patrick Mahomes was hit a record 15 times and had a career-low completion percentageThose two 'tush push' touchdowns were a big difference, as the Chiefs largely stopped them in last season's AFC Championship but could not on Sunday - while Mahomes ran three plays from the Bills' one-yard line and failed to find the endzone.Buffalo also cracked the Chiefs defence with Dalton Kincaid having the first 100-yard receiving game against them in 12 matches.And with 114 yards James Cook was the first 100-yard rusher the Chiefs had allowed since Lamar Jackson on the opening day of the 2024 season - and first running back since Zamir White on 25 December 2023. In nine previous meetings the Chiefs average 14 points more in play-off games than regular season, so it's a big 'if', but if they can replicate Sunday the Bills certainly look to have a blueprint for success this time around if they again find the Chiefs blocking their path to the Super Bowl.In focus - Sam Darnold dazzles for SeahawksImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sam Darnold hit 17 straight completions for Seattle in Washington\"Sam's execution right now - he's just ridiculous,\" said Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald after another dazzling Sam Darnold display.Yes, Josh Allen, Jackson and Mahomes have all shown glimpses, but the 'other guys' of the quarterback fraternity are showing up this season.Second-year triggermen Drake Maye and Bo Nix are both 7-2 after leading the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos to wins on Sunday, while in Los Angeles Matthew Stafford is lighting it up for the Rams and Justin Herbert likewise for the Chargers.But it was Darnold's time to shine in Washington on Sunday with a surgical first half in which he completed all 16 passes and threw four touchdowns as the Seahawks dismantled the Commanders.ESPN's, external Total Quarterback Rating (QBR) system is an in-depth metric that takes into account opposing defensive strength and game state as well as yardage and scoring stats - and is a 0-100 system where 75 and above is regarded as excellent.Darnold's 97.8 mark on Sunday was the best of his career and his third over 97 this season - Jackson is the only other player to get over that mark so far.In short, the 2018 third overall draft pick has been excellent this season, proving that his renaissance in Minnesota last year was no one-hit wonder.Seattle are 6-2 but locked in a titanic NFC West struggle with the Rams and San Francisco 49ers also having six wins, but their impressive away form of 4-0 this season and 11-1 since the start of 2024 means they will not fear hitting the road in the play-offs.Plus, general manager John Schneider has said \"we're in and we'll see what's shaking out there\" regards the upcoming trade deadline, so obviously feel they are in the 'Super Bowl window' now with Darnold at the helm.Watch this space.Game of the week - pure cinema in CincinnatiIt started with a Bengals touchdown from the opening kick-off and ended with a Bears touchdown 17 seconds from the end - with everything in between being pure drama.More than 1,000 yards of offence, 89 points and 11 touchdowns - four of them inside the final five minutes of a breathless 47-42 victory for Chicago in a stunned Cincinnati.From Caleb Williams catching a touchdown pass to 40-year-old Joe Flacco having a career-best 470 yards and leading a 14-point comeback inside the final two minutes, this game had it all.Yet the drama was still not over, as after getting the ball back with 54 seconds left, Williams hit rookie tight end Colston Loveland to gallop away for a 58-yard winning score.\"It's like taking years off my life,\" said Bears safety Kevin Byard. \"It's super special. This is the greatest game, greatest sport in the world - just the emotions up and down.\"Spare a thought for the Bengals, especially the offence though, as after blowing a 15-point lead against the winless Jets last week they are now the first team since the 1960s pre-Super Bowl era to score 38 or more points in successive games and lose both.Record books - field goal history made, againImage caption, Field goals have got longer in the past few yearsTom Dempsey - who was born without any toes on his kicking foot - held a field goal record of 63 yards that stood for 43 years before Matt Prater finally broke it in 2013.But kicks are getting longer - in the past 14 months Prater's 64-yard mark has been equalled or bettered four times, the latest being the ironically named Cam Little's huge 68-yard effort on Sunday.That beat Justin Tucker's previous best by two yards, and cleared the crossbar with some room to spare as well.There has now been seven 60-plus yard field goals already this season, with five being the previous best in a campaign, so three points are seemingly available from anywhere these days.It is a tough life being a kicker in the NFL with the game often being on the line, so it is only right they get some praise when perfecting their craft. Week nine game notes and statsThe Indianapolis Colts proved how crucial turnovers are in the NFL, with six of them in one game stifling the league's top offence in the defeat by the Steelers. Was it just a blip for Daniel Jones, who committed five of them, or a worrying sign of things to come?Christian McCaffrey is on his way to legend status with another huge 173-yard outing for the 49ers, in his 16th game with a rushing and receiving touchdown - putting him above the great Marshall Faulk for the most in the NFL.There could be big trouble for the Washington Commanders who lost second-year quarterback Jayden Daniels to what is believed to be a dislocated left elbow.In leading the Vikings to beat the Lions, JJ McCarthy became the first player ever to have two passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in two of his first three career games.Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart also made history as the first rookie with a passing and rushing touchdown in four consecutive games during their defeat by San Francisco.Have your say - who is your MVP so far?Watch - the Whole 10 Yards on Harry KaneMedia caption, The Super Bowl winner who wants to train Harry Kane",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Trent Alexander-Arnold has made 10 appearances for Real Madrid since joining them from LiverpoolByChief football writerTrent Alexander-Arnold returns to Liverpool on Tuesday for the first time since moving to Real Madrid, when he will discover if absence has made Anfield hearts grow fonder after the outpouring of ill-feeling that accompanied his decision to leave his boyhood club.Alexander-Arnold fuelled anger among many Liverpool fans by announcing he was leaving at the end of his contract last summer, with supporters making their fury clear by booing him when he emerged as a substitute in the draw with Arsenal in May.This was despite the 27-year-old - celebrated in song by the Kop as \"the Scouser in our team\" - having already played a pivotal role in bringing the Premier League title back to Liverpool.He is in line to play for Real Madrid in the Champions League match after recovering from the hamstring injury that interrupted his start at the Bernabeu.Alexander-Arnold will find out if time has healed wounds felt by Liverpool's followers - and will also have the opportunity to show what they have missed as the champions' form has faltered this season.What reception will Alexander-Arnold get?Media caption, 'He gets a warm welcome from me' - Slot on TrentThe smart money is on a mixed reception - with a section of Liverpool fans unlikely to forgive or forget the manner of his departure, initially on a free transfer, although Real later agreed a reported £8.4m fee to accelerate his arrival so he could play in the Club World Cup.Feelings had cooled when Alexander-Arnold again came on as a substitute for Liverpool's final home game against Crystal Palace, when the trophy was presented to captain Virgil van Dijk by legendary former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen.The warmer response was, perhaps, a reaction to public admonishment from former manager Jurgen Klopp, who was angered by Alexander-Arnold's vitriolic treatment from fans who previously idolised him.Alexander-Arnold's status as the local boy who made good by winning two Premier Leagues, the Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, Super Cup and Club World Cup undoubtedly heightened emotions when he sought pastures new in Spain.Former Liverpool and England defender Stephen Warnock accepts Alexander-Arnold may not receive a rapturous welcome, telling BBC Sport: \"I know local fans will say he was a Liverpool fan in a great Liverpool team, but sometimes players want something else. I respect that.\"I really hope he gets a good reception. I think he'll want to put on a show, demonstrate why he's such a talent, why Liverpool's fans loved him so much.\"Warnock added: \"I think the reception will be mixed. I don't think he will be expecting a standing ovation after the way things went, and we have to respect those opinions as well.\"I don't think he deserves a mixed reception. He was an incredible servant to the club, but wanted to challenge himself.\"Hopefully he gets a great reception.\"Liverpool manager Arne Slot told a news conference on the eve of the match that he has \"only positive\" memories of working with Alexander-Arnold but does not know how the club's supporters will treat him. \"I have great memories of the player and the human being,\" Slot said.\"How our fans will react I have no clue how that's going to be. He gets a warm welcome from me that's for sure.\"Alexander-Arnold's former Liverpool team-mate Ryan Gravenberch said he will \"give him a hug\" because he is \"obviously a friend of mine\".How much have Liverpool missed Alexander-Arnold?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Only Roberto Firmino (21) assisted more of Mohamed Salah's Liverpool goals than Trent Alexander-Arnold (13)The Alexander-Arnold-shaped hole in Liverpool's team is one of the conundrums facing head coach Slot as the near-£450m summer refit of his title-winning squad has struggled to gel, although Saturday's 2-0 win against Aston Villa stopped the rot after six defeats in seven games, including four straight league losses.Alexander-Arnold's absence, however, has had an impact on all areas of Liverpool's team, particularly Mohamed Salah's influence.Salah has struggled to hit his usual heights, although he scored his 250th Liverpool goal in the win over Villa.It has trained the microscope on his previously potent partnership with Alexander-Arnold, a rich seam of goals and creation as Liverpool swept up their trophy haul under Klopp then Slot.Alexander-Arnold's world-class range of passing created space and opportunities for Salah, with opponents living in fear not only of what he might do himself, but also what he could unlock for the Egyptian.He played 147 line-breaking passes for Salah when the title was won last season, the most any player provided for a team-mate in the Premier League.Warnock said: \"There is a great player in Conor Bradley, but he needs to stay fit and get a run of games to build up a relationship with Salah. These things can take time, even with the best players.\"Trent leaving has had an impact on Salah. Their partnership, if not exactly unnoticed, was almost taken as read. Yes, they are world-class individuals, but it was also a partnership.\"They really complemented each other. Trent could go inside, draw people towards him, which freed up more space for Salah. And when Salah drove at people he had the ability to feed Trent because teams were backing off.\"Alexander-Arnold's comfort in possession with his fellow defenders, plus the ability to move into midfield, means his presence is also sorely missed elsewhere.Warnock said: \"I think Ibrahima Konate probably misses him as well. He knew he could give Trent the ball under pressure. I think it is having an impact on the right-hand side of the pitch, both in defence and attack.\"Liverpool also created a box system in the centre of midfield, which they did so well, when Trent was in the side.\"There was a lot of praise given to Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai, but Trent was a big part of that as well. Losing that extra body in the midfield area, when he was in there, is also missed because opponents were drawn to him, fearful of what he could create.\"Jeremie Frimpong, signed in a £29m deal from Bayer Leverkusen to compete with Bradley for the place vacated by Alexander-Arnold, has had his Anfield start curtailed by hamstring injuries.Warnock said: \"The biggest issue with Frimpong is not only injuries, but what is his best position? At Bayer Leverkusen he spent a lot of time as a right wing-back.\"Liverpool '100%' missing Alexander-ArnoldAs Liverpool's title defence stalled before beating Villa, Alexander-Arnold's ability to unlock defences may have aided them as, by Slot's own admission, they have struggled against teams who defend deep and use long balls.Warnock believes Liverpool are missing a creative source that can be placed in the same bracket as one of the Premier League greats, former Manchester City star Kevin de Bruyne.He said: \"Trent was a right-back, but effectively he was a midfielder [in] that position.\"I liken him to De Bruyne. I know they were different positions, but the way they pass the ball, the way they put fear into defenders with their ability to cross a ball or deliver a pass, is just incredible.\"Warnock added: \"When Trent was at Liverpool, teams would back off. He was hitting balls over the top, trying to find killer passes. Even if he was a fraction off, the opposition were thinking 'if he gets one of these right we're in big trouble'.\"They drop deeper, then he was firing balls into Mac Allister on the half-turn, Szoboszlai, or last season Luis Diaz. He may not find that killer ball every time, but he strikes fear into defences, the fear that he will eventually get one right, which he so often did.\"I actually think this was the idea of bringing Florian Wirtz in, to open up defences.\"If you put all that together and ask if Liverpool are missing Trent? Yes, 100%.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alexander-Arnold was an unused substitute in Saturday's La Liga win over Valencia",

It’s also triggered a number of conspiracy theories online about the presidential bunker that sits underneath the East Wing of the White House.\nAnd, Sarah and Marianna speak to White House historian and First Lady specialist Katherine Sibley about the historic significance of the East Wing, what’s being lost in its demolishment, and what Melania Trump might think about losing her office in the complex.\nHOSTS:\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\nGUEST\n• Katherine Sibley, White House historian\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve, Alix Pickles, Kris Jalowiecki and Rufus Gray.

    "body": "4 hours agoGetty ImagesA search and rescue operation continues for the rest of the group, which includes other foreign nationals and local guidesKathryn Armstrong and Diwakar Pyakurel & Phanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali in KathmanduAt least three climbers, including a French national and two Nepalese people, have died after being hit by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak in north-eastern Nepal, police say. The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. A further four climbers - two Italians, a German and a Canadian - are feared dead but a search for them is continuing. The killed and missing were part of a group of 12 trekkers and local guides that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told the BBC. Five Nepali guides who returned to the base camp were injured but not critically. \"Three bodies have been seen and rescue teams have to find four more,\" local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC. It is not clear if the other two confirmed dead, who are both Nepali, were working with the group or were climbers themselves. Mr Mahato said a rescue helicopter had landed on Monday in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp.Efforts to locate those still missing have been hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, according to local media reports. The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft).The Yalung Ri mountain is located in Nepal's Dolakha districtSeparately, attempts to rescue two Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari mountain in western Nepal are continuing.Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week. The third member of the group, named in media reports as Velter Perlino, 65, has since been rescued.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains. Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas. Two British and one Irish woman were among a group that had to be rescued after being trapped for several days in the western Mustang region. Severe weather also left hundreds of hikers stranded near Mount Everest in October. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoLucy Manning,Special correspondent and Fiona NimoniBBCA Scunthorpe United player and a Nottingham Forest fan are among the victims stabbed in a knife attack on a train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday evening. They are among 10 people injured on the train during the mass stabbing.Footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on a LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were attacked at around 20:00 GMT.Mr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.Mr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and has been operated on, his club said.Anthony Williams, 32, has been remanded in custody following the incident and is charged with 11 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident.'Incredible bravery' of train crew and passengers saved livesWhat do we know about Cambridgeshire train stabbings?Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Mr Crean's left hand could be seen heavily bandaged and he still had blood in his hair. He is one of the train passengers the 32-year-old is accused of attempting to murder.Mr Crean described how he \"tussled\" with the man who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.He said he first saw people running down the train shouting that there was a man with a knife. As people ran to the buffet car he said he wanted to make sure passengers were safe.\"I saw him coming towards me - a guy with a rucksack and he's obviously got something in there.\"Everyone's gone towards the buffet, and that is on the verge of being full up. There's no-one else getting in there. I wasn't even going to bother pushing to get in.\"There's young women and they need to get them in. I confronted this guy, because I've got to make sure that the door's locked and I've looked around to save a bit of time.\"But then he started, he pulled this thing out. It was an over large blade thing\".Mr Crean said the man asked him: \"Do you want to die? Do you want to die?\" \"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms with him and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and must have caught me on the head.\"Scunthorpe UnitedScunthorpe United football player Jonathan GjosheMr Crean says it's nice to hear that people are calling him a hero but that he wasn't the only one.\"It's lovely to hear. But I'd say there are other heroes like the police and the guys that got me off the train and the ambulances and the hospital staff, they're probably real heroes.\"And the train guy that's really badly injured. So, you know, it's a big shout to call someone a hero, but it's nice.\"He says he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the buffet door. \"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"Stephen Crean still had blood in his hair when he spoke to the BBC",

    "body": "4 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Southern Europe correspondent, Rome and Jake LaphamWatch: Moment part of medieval tower collapses in RomePart of a medieval tower in the heart of Rome has collapsed, trapping one worker and leaving another critically injured.A section of the Torre dei Conti, on the edge of the famous Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum, gave way just after 11:30 local time (10:30 GMT). \"It's a very complex situation for the firefighters because there is a person trapped inside,\" Rome Prefect Lamberto Giannini said. The man is conscious and communicating with rescue workers.The tower has been closed to the public for many years, and was undergoing conservation work when a section collapsed.While rescue efforts were still under way, a second section of the 29m (90ft) high tower began crumbling again, with bricks raining down, creating a huge cloud of dust.The firefighters were unharmed, pausing their rescue work for a time, but then continuing their search for the missing man.After the initial collapse, firefighters \"put up some protection\" around the trapped man, so when the second collapse happened, \"they obviously shielded him\", Lamberto Giannini said.\"It will be a very long operation because we have to try to save the person, but we also have to try to mitigate... the enormous risks faced by the people trying to carry out the rescue,\" he added.A police chief has said there is no imminent danger that the tower will disintegrate.One worker was taken to hospital in a critical condition, local and foreign news agencies report.Another worker, 67-year-old Ottaviano, who was inside at the time of the collapse but escaped from a balcony uninjured, told AFP news agency: \"It was not safe. I just want to go home.\"Rome's mayor and the country's culture minister have visited the scene. A crane and drone are also being used to assist with the rescue operation.The 13th Century tower is part of the Roman Forum, a major tourist attraction right in the heart of the city, but it is separated from the main visitors' area by a road. The streets all around have been taped off by police as a precaution.The medieval tower was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his brother.",

    "body": "1 hour agoShayan Sardarizadeh, James Kelly, Kris Bramwell and Benedict GarmanBBC VerifyGetty ImagesOn Saturday night a train from Doncaster bound for London was dramatically diverted after an alarm was raised on board. A man armed with a large knife, who is believed to have joined the train at Peterborough, carried out a vicious attack on multiple victims. Within 20 minutes a suspect had been arrested in Cambridgeshire, more than 70 miles from the train's intended destination of King's Cross in London.Eleven people were treated in hospital, where one person remains in a stable but critical condition. The BBC has spoken to train passengers and stabbing victims alongside video and police statements to build a picture of how the attack and the emergency response unfolded.'You need to run, you need to run'The attack started just over an hour after the LNER train left Doncaster. At 19:29 it had pulled out of Peterborough station, where the suspect had apparently boarded. Just five minutes later the alarm was pulled near the middle of the train in coach J.Amira Ostalski and a friend, both students at Nottingham University, had got on the train at the previous stop of Grantham and were travelling to London to \"have some fun\".Amira was seated watching a film when she saw a man in a white shirt leap out of his seat about five rows in front of her followed by screams of \"knife, knife\". Amira then spotted a man holding a large kitchen knife and fled towards the rear of the train with her friend.'He ran right towards us... we decided to hide in a taxi', says eyewitnessIn the next carriage, coach H, YouTuber Olly Foster heard shouts of \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone\", and initially thought it was a Halloween prank. But as passengers began pushing through the carriage Olly could see \"blood all over the chair\" he had leaned on, covering his hand in blood.Olly then saw an older man, thought to be an LNER staff member, who \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl, leaving him with a gash on his head and neck.Nottingham Forest fan Joe, 24, was not meant to be on the train. He had watched the team's football match against Manchester United earlier and missed a connecting train in Grantham.Joe was texting his friends about his plans for the night when people came rushing through the carriage. \"You need to run, you need to run,\" someone told Joe. He started running but when he turned to look behind him saw \"a tall black male\" holding \"a bloodied knife\".Matt Kingston took his headphones out as he saw a group of people heading his way in coach H and also began running down the train. Another Nottingham Forest fan Alistair Day, 58, was next to the train's cafe bar in coach G, and saw people fleeing down the train with blood on their clothes.Sheltering inside the cafeThe train's cafe bar transformed into an impromptu hiding space for those fleeing the attacker. Alistair said he saw around a dozen people inside this enclosed buffet counter in coach G and they were \"trying to close up the shutters\" to protect themselves from the assailant. Matt had managed to get inside the booth with the others.Alistair saw the man near the door waving a knife and trying to open the shutters, which by then had been locked. A video he provided to the BBC from inside the cafe bar shows multiple passengers inside, with at least one on the phone to emergency services. Alistair and another witness, Tom McLaughlan, told the BBC they saw a Nottingham Forest fan move to confront the attacker. \"He wasn't the biggest guy. We tried to stop him,\" Alistair said.It appears they were referring to Stephen Crean who later told the BBC the man pulled out a large knife when he confronted him outside the cafe bar. \"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and caught me on the head.\"PA MediaStephen Crean sustained injuries to his head and handStephen said he had been trying to give another passenger time to close the door to the cafe bar. \"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"Matt said the attacker then walked past the locked door while waving the knife around. \"He then returned back up the train and passed us again.\" At that point a young man told Matt he'd been stabbed in the chest \"so I helped with putting pressure on the wound and helped hold him up\".Another victim of the train attack was Scunthorpe United footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, who was slashed across the bicep and later needed an operation.Alarm raised and train divertedAs soon as the alarm was raised the train driver, Andrew Johnson, a Royal Navy veteran, sprang into action and contacted the control centre. The decision was made to divert the train, which was travelling at 125mph (201km/h), to a slow track, which allowed it stop at Huntingdon Station just minutes after the emergency services were first called.The East of England Ambulance Service received the first emergency call at 19:38. A minute later, Cambridgeshire police received a report about multiple stabbings on a train. Together, they mobilised a response team outside Huntingdon Station, just under 300m away from the police force's headquarters. At 19:41 the train arrived at the station, a minute before British Transport Police were also called to the incident.Escape at Huntingdon StationWatch: Police rush to scene of Cambridgeshire train attackCCTV footage captured by a business in its car park shows passengers running up platform two towards the main station building. A dramatic TikTok video, filmed from a bridge on Brampton Road overlooking the rail tracks and station, shows police officers running towards the train along the same platform.Tom saw two men who appeared to have been stabbed \"covered in blood\" as he fled the train. Alistair said he saw a man who had been in the cafe bar with him being carried towards an ambulance by paramedics. \"I just want to know he's okay,\" he said.Emergency services took 10 people to hospital where a further victim was treated. Six patients have since been discharged.The LNER staff member who remains in a critical but stable condition \"undoubtedly saved people's lives\" by trying to stop the attacker, British Transport Police said.Forced to flee againCCTV footage shows a man climbing a fence at the station at 19:43 to an adjacent car park while holding a knife.Amira, who had been hiding at the back of coach G armed with a metal tray to fight off the attacker if necessary, had run to the car park with her friend for safety when they got off the train.But they saw the man walk in their direction. Fearing for their lives, they hid in a taxi. An image captured by Amira's friend through its windscreen shows the man being detained by six police officers near several bins in the car park, around 50m (160ft) from the fence.Video filmed from a separate taxi nearby shows the officers armed with guns, Tasers and accompanied by a dog detaining a man on the ground. Clicks from the Taser are audible in the footage.By 19:50 police had two men in custody, 32-year-old Anthony Williams, and a 35-year-old man who was released a day later after police established he was not involved. On Monday morning Williams appeared in court charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over the train attack.Additional reporting by Adam Durbin.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterCivil service bosses have told MPs that Lord Mandelson, who was sacked as UK ambassador to the US due to close links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was never formally interviewed for the job.The head of the civil service, Sir Chris Wormald, said there was no interview because Lord Mandelson was directly appointed to the role.MPs heard that process meant Lord Mandelson was not directly asked about any conflict of interest with interviewers in person, but instead needed to fill in a form aimed more at potential financial conflicts.Sir Chris said this process has been changed since Lord Mandelson's exit, to ensure a formal, minuted interview happens.Lord Mandelson replaced career diplomat Dame Karen Pierce in Washington DC in December 2024, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer decided he was the best candidate to build links with the newly-elected Trump administration. Concern around Lord Mandelson's friendship with Epstein were raised at the time, but his ability to deal with President Trump, as well as his ability as a networker and seasoned political operator, was seen as a valuable asset.That changed when emails were published showing Lord Mandelson sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences in 2008, which the government insisted was new information about the \"depth\" of the pair's relationship.Sir Keir fired him in September, a day after having told MPs the Labour peer retained his \"full confidence\" at PMQs.Ambassadors are managed by the Foreign Office and the civil service, and bosses of both were answering questions from MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee.Foreign Office head, Sir Oliver Robbins, was asked whether Lord Mandelson went through the normal process for appointing an ambassador and told MPs: \"No, it was different because this was not run as a standard civil service process.\"Labour MP Fleur Anderson asked whether Lord Mandelson's interview specifically included the opportunity to share \"anything that could bring the government into disrepute\".Sir Chris said: \"There was no interview for Mr Mandelson, it was done as a direct appointment by ministers, as Sir Oliver has described, and therefore there was no panel interview.\"That was the normal practice for direct ministerial appointments.\"Changes have been made since Lord Mandelson's sacking, Sir Chris added, \"so that we effectively replicate what would normally happen in a panel interview... where there is a minuted conversation with the candidate\".Sir Oliver said Lord Mandelson did complete a conflict of interest form, but when pressed on whether that included \"friendships\", he said: \"No, it's not a sort of reputational conflict that's being targeted by that form, it's about reality of perception of economic or financial conflicts.\"The two were also questioned on why Sir Keir appeared not to have been fully briefed about the seriousness of the new information by civil servants before defending Lord Mandelson at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs).Conservative MP Sir John Whittingdale set out how emails were sent to the Foreign Office by journalists at Bloomberg on Tuesday evening. He said: \"It must have been apparent to you before the prime minister got up at 12 o'clock on Wednesday that this was pretty explosive and did somebody not say to Number 10 'hold on, just before you express your complete confidence in Lord Mandelson there's something here you might like to be aware of'.\"Defending the material being treated \"sensitively and as a management issue\", Sir Oliver said he needed to treat Lord Mandelson \"as an employee to whom I owed a duty of care\". Sir John responded: \"So you're saying to protect Lord Mandelson you gave no indication to Number 10 before PMQs that you had come across information which might cause serious doubt as to the appropriateness of his position?\"Lord Mandelson had not had a chance to respond to the Foreign Office about the \"veracity and risks\" around the emails ahead of PMQs, Sir Oliver said, adding \"I had not personally spoken to the prime minister, no.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterReform UK leader Nigel Farage has rowed back on his party's previous promise to deliver tax cuts worth £90bn a year.Ahead of last year's general election, Reform's pledges included slashing corporation tax, cutting stamp duty on home purchases and lifting the threshold when people start paying income tax.However, Farage said \"substantial tax cuts\" were not currently \"realistic\" because of the \"dire state\" of the public finances.He added that if Reform wins the next election, it would still make some \"relatively modest\" changes, such as raising tax thresholds and immediately scrapping inheritance tax for family farms and family-run businesses.As well as promising huge tax cuts, Reform's election manifesto last year also pledged to reduce \"wasteful spending\" across government by around £50bn a year.However, the pledges prompted scepticism from some economists, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank arguing the party's proposed spending cuts would save less than promised, while the tax cuts would cost more.Meanwhile, Reform's economic plans have also been attacked by Labour and the Conservatives, who have accused Farage of making unfunded spending commitments.In a wide-ranging speech setting out Reform UK's vision for the economy, Farage sought to counter claims his party's plans were not credible.He accused both Labour and the Conservatives of failing to cut public spending and allowing the national debt to increase \"in the most extraordinary way\".\"We want to cut taxes, of course we do,\" he said.\"But we understand substantial tax cuts, given the dire state of debt and our finances, are not realistic at this current moment in time.\"He added that the state of the economy was now \"far worse than it was in the run-up to the 2024 general election\".Challenged during a Q&A session after his speech over how the public could trust Reform if it reversed promises it had made before the last election, Farage said: \"We are being mature, we are being sensible and we are not over-promising. \"But for us not to take account of the dire state of our public finances, that, I think, would be irresponsible.\"He promised to make savings by cutting the benefits bill, reducing the size of the Civil Service and getting a \"grip\" on public sector pensions.\"But we can't have massive tax cuts until the markets can see we've at least got these things in hand,\" he added.Farage insisted it was still Reform's \"aspiration\" to lift the threshold when people start paying income tax to £20,000, saying this was \"vital\" for incentivising people to work.But he said the party had to be \"realistic about the state of the economy\", suggesting that by the time of the next general election it could be \"in an even worse state than any of us in this room could even predict\".In his speech Farage also: pledged to cut energy bills, saying policies like scrapping net zero subsidies and extracting more oil and gas from the North Sea could reduce bills by £165 a yearpromised a Reform government would bring in more advisers and ministers \"with real business experience in their own sector\"said his party would only remove the two-child benefit cap for British couples who were both working.Labour minister Lisa Nandy said Reform's sums \"just don't add up\".She added: \"You just can't trust a word Reform say. Under any kind of pressure their whole programme is unravelling.\"Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Farage's speech \"has left the public with far more questions than answers\".\"Farage did not set out which of the £140bn of commitments he made last year he still stands by, and which he has now dropped,\" he said.\"After this rambling, incoherent speech, it is clear Reform's economy policy is in chaos.\"A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage is exactly what he tries so hard to tell us he isn't: a cynical member of the political class who will break his word whenever it's of benefit to him and his party.\"",

    "body": "Bonfire Night's Beaver supermoon to be biggest and brightest of 2025Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Fireworks night in Sefton Park, Liverpool, in 2009 featuring an almost full MoonBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter Updated 9 hours agoThe second of three consecutive supermoons of 2025 will coincide with Bonfire Night on Wednesday.The full Beaver Moon rises in the UK at around 15:55 GMT on 5 November.It will be the largest and brightest Moon this year.If you want to catch a glimpse, keep an eye on the forecast to see where has the best chance of seeing clear skies.Why is this Moon a 'supermoon'?Image caption, At its 'perigee' the Moon is 30,000 miles closer to Earth than at its 'apogee'The Moon does not orbit the earth in a perfect circle but has more of an egg-shaped, elliptical orbit. Therefore it is not always the same distance from the Earth.  At its closest point - or perigee - the Moon is about 220,000 miles away from Earth, whereas at its furthest point - or apogee - it is around 250,000 miles away.If the Moon is full at its closest point to Earth, or within 90% of its perigee, it can be referred to as a 'supermoon'.  The term was first coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle to describe full Moons that appear noticeably larger and brighter as they coincide with the perigee. They can seem to be up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full Moons, external.November's Beaver Moon will be the closest full Moon to Earth this year, therefore it will be the brightest and will appear to be the largest.Image source, Dan Kitwood/Getty imagesImage caption, Last month's Harvest supermoon - pictured here with a passenger plane flying above London -  was the first of the yearWhy is it a called a Beaver Moon?Image source, Andrew Matthews/PA WireImage caption, After centuries of absence, beavers are starting to roam wild again in parts of England and ScotlandEach month's full Moon has a nickname reflecting what is happening in nature and the weather at that time of year. Many of these names date back centuries and some are more obvious than others such as February's 'Snow Moon' or June's 'Strawberry Moon'.But what about November's Beaver Moon? It is thought that the term may have been used in a range of cultures from certain Native American tribes to early European settlers.  It is the time of year beavers become particularly active as they build dams and stock up on food for the winter.Beavers in the UK were hunted to extinction in the 16th Century, mainly for their furs.  However, in recent years rewilding projects have been reintroducing beavers to several parts of England and Scotland. They can bring huge benefits to nature, including improving river water quality and increasing biodiversity.Whilst this will be the brightest and largest full Moon of 2025, you won't have to wait long until the next one, as we will see the third and final supermoon of the year on 4 December.What is the forecast?Image caption, Current most likely weather conditions for Bonfire Night's Beaver Moon viewingThe week ahead is looking changeable, with a series of low pressure systems expected to move west to east across the UK. This means spells of rain and wind at times interspersed with calmer and drier interludes.It is too soon to say exactly where will have optimum viewing conditions for the Beaver Moon on Wednesday but the current most likely weather pattern is for a frontal system to bring cloud and rain to the north and west, with increasing chances of clearer skies and drier conditions further south and east.If you do not get a chance to view the Beaver Moon, the next and final supermoon of 2025 will be next month on 6 December.

    "body": "Strictly Come Dancing's Amy Dowden has announced she is to undergo \"another mastectomy this week\".The 35-year-old said the surgery was \"not to treat a new cancer diagnosis\" but came following an appointment with her \"incredible\" medical team, adding that she wanted to be \"clear\" and \"open\" with her followers.In a post on Instagram, accompanied by a video of her stroking her dog, the Welsh star said: \"They're [the medical team] confident that, all going well, I can expect a straightforward recovery.\"Once I have healed I look forward to rejoining my Strictly family.\"She added that she would \"of course\" miss not being part of the show as much but would be \"watching from home and look forward to cheering everyone on\". \"Thank you always for all the support,\" said Dowden.The dancer revealed she had been diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2023 after finding a lump in April, the day before going to the Maldives on her honeymoon with fellow professional dancer Ben Jones.After her diagnosis, Dowden had a mastectomy and underwent chemotherapy, with her treatment preventing her from being able to compete with a celebrity partner on the BBC dancing programme that year.Dowden documented her cancer experience online, and revealed in February 2024 that \"no evidence of disease\" was found at her latest health check.She returned to the dancefloor a few months later, partnered with former JLS star JB Gill.However, she was forced to pull out of Strictly midway through the 20th anniversary series due to an injury and was replaced by Lauren Oakley.Dowden returned once again in this year's series where she was partnered with former Apprentice contestant and social media star Thomas Skinner, being eliminated in week two.Her cancer treatment and experience with Crohn's disease have been depicted in the BBC documentaries Strictly Amy: Cancer And Me and Strictly Amy: Crohn's And Me.She was formally made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) earlier in the year for services to fundraising and raising awareness of the inflammatory bowel disease.",

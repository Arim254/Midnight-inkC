    "body": "3 hours agoThe Royal Family dominates the Boxing Day front pages, with pictures of them attending the Christmas Day church service at the Sandringham Estate along with reports of King Charles III's Christmas message. Catherine, Princess of Wales, is pictured waving to crowds on the front page of the Times, while the main story focuses on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' \"mansion tax\" which, it says, tens of thousands of homeowners will have to pay because of inaccurate assessments. According to the paper, properties could be overvalued by as much as £30,000, leading to homeowners being dragged over the £2m threshold. The Guardian leads with its own research, which suggests that fewer than one in 60 public sector workers are sharing leave with their partners when they have a baby. Experts have criticised it as a \"lost decade\" of progress on parental rights. The King and Queen Camilla are pictured on the front as they attend church in Sandringham.A teacher at a school in Oxfordshire says he was referred to the government's counter-terrorism programme after showing videos of US President Donald Trump to his politics class, the Daily Telegraph reports. The teacher says he began a grievance procedure against Henley College and received a £2,000 payoff in a negotiated settlement after he was effectively forced to resign, according to the paper. The school was quoted as saying: \"The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\" Meanwhile, the paper chose to feature Princess Charlotte on its front page as she joined her family for the church service.  The King's Christmas message leads the Daily Mirror,  saying that he spoke of the \"common values that unite us\". The paper notes that his words come as tensions rise both at home and abroad. High Street shops will net £1bn less than last year on Boxing Day, reports the Daily Mail, citing figures from Barclays Bank. The paper says stretched household budgets will lead people to shun the sales on Friday \"as consumer confidence collapses amid Rachel Reeves' tax bombshells\". The Sandringham service is also featured on the front page, with the paper noting that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie joined the Royal Family in Norfolk while their father stayed in Windsor. The former prince was stripped of his titles after intense pressure over his links to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.     The appearance of Beatrice and Eugenie leads the Sun, which says the former's \"last-minute\" decision to join her sister with the rest of the Royal Family in Norfolk \"delighted well-wishers\". The paper says their \"show of support\" for the King comes almost a week after the US Department of Justice started releasing hundreds of thousands of documents related to the Epstein case, with Andrew appearing in some of the files. Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. A poll for the Independent suggests that more than a third of Labour supporters say the party would have a better chance of winning the next general election if Sir Keir Starmer were replaced. The paper says 19% of Labour supporters backed Andy Burnham, when asked who should replace the prime minister. The i Paper is leading with analysis of this year's polls by Sir John Curtice, who says Britain is entering \"uncharted territory\" as Labour faces a threat from Nigel Farage's Reform UK and the Green Party under Zack Polanski. The leading polling expert tells the paper that the vote of the two main parties is at a \"record low\", meaning the UK's political landscape has never before \"looked so fragmented\". The Daily Express is celebrating its Christmas appeal on its front page, saying its readers raised more than £100,000 for the children's wheelchair charity Whizz Kidz. The money raised will help buy 20 personalised wheelchairs or other life-changing aids that will give children more freedom, according to the paper. Also featured on the front page is the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte as they attended the Christmas Day church service.  And finally, the Daily Star decided to feature football royalty on its front page, leading with David Beckham's \"family fracas\". It says that Brooklyn Beckham stayed away while David, Victoria and the rest of the family celebrated Christmas by singing a Spice Girls hit. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Cold health alert as parts of UK set to freeze on Christmas Day12 hours agoThomas MackintoshandJonathan Josephs,Hyde ParkWatch: Swimmers brave the Serpentine for chilly Christmas dipA cold health alert and weather warnings have been issued for parts of the UK on Christmas Day, as forecasters dashed hopes of a white Christmas.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued the yellow alert for south-west England from 18:00 on 25 December to midday on 27 December.A Met Office yellow warning for wind covers south-west England, Somerset and a large swathe of Wales, stretching from Cardiff and Swansea up to Bangor. Gusts hit 68mph (109 km/h) early on Thursday at Berry Head, Torbay.Organisers of some Christmas and Boxing Day swims in Devon and Cornwall have had to cancel events.Other swimming events still took place.Around 400 swimmers entered the chilly water at The Serpentine in London's Hyde Park, with around 100 competing in the annual Peter Pan Cup race.Dave Bill, who took the trophy home this year, told the BBC it was a \"real honour\" to win, adding: \"Swimming in the cold water is one of the most rewarding things. It calms my nervous system.\"Mr Bill said it was a \"real honour\" to win a race that traces its roots back to 1864Meanwhile, the Met Office warning covers 18 of Wales' 22 council areas.In south-west England, temperatures on Christmas morning were between 1C and 4C (34F and 39F) for most, said BBC Weather's Matt Taylor, but it was \"feeling below freezing due to the wind chill\".Winds around coasts and on moors have exceeded 40mph at times, hitting 43mph at Plymouth and 49mph at Liscombe, Exmoor, he added.Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said it was \"highly unlikely\" the UK would see a white Christmas.\"We've got a very dry picture across the UK over the next few days,\" he added.Although not an official part of the UK, the crown dependency of Jersey experienced snow on Thursday morning.The Jersey Met Section said it was only the third time since records began that snow was observed on the island on Christmas Day and the first time since 1970.PA MediaNot every Christmas Day dip was cancelled and brave swimmers took to the water in Blackroot Pool in Sutton Park, Birmingham Nadezna / BBC Weather WatchersPeople gather to watch the Christmas Day sunrise in PenarthAccording to UKHSA, low temperatures are likely to have minor impacts on health and social care services including \"increased use of healthcare services by vulnerable people\" and a \"greater risk to life of vulnerable people\".The Met Office said east to north-easterly winds would become particularly strong and gusty during Christmas Day.Gusts are expected to peak fairly widely at 45-55mph, with 55-65mph possible along some exposed coasts and to the west of prominent hills.It added that \"given the more unusual wind direction, this may lead to some disruption to transport and power supplies\" and that \"large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts\".The highest temperatures on Christmas Day were forecast to be around 7C (45F) in north-east England and 6C in south or south-east England.The Met Office added that frost and freezing temperatures were likely in western rural areas overnight on Christmas Day into Boxing Day, with -6C possible in rural parts of Scotland and -4C in rural Wales.Organisers of the Coverack swim in Cornwall said with the weather forecast it would be \"too dangerous\" for the event to go ahead and postponed the event until New Year's Day.Start Bay Inn, in Devon, said it was \"really sad\" to announce its Boxing Day swim had been cancelled, while the RNLI Teignmouth took a similar decision, insisting \"safety considerations must come first\".",

Powerball did not identify the winner.The largest single-ticket prize remains the $2.04bn jackpot won in 2022 by a player in Altadena, California.In order to win the jackpot, a lottery ticket holder must match all five white balls and the red Powerball selected during a drawing.Tickets for the lottery cost $2 each - and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, according to game organisers. A winner has an option to choose a lump-sum payment or receive the full amount in an annuity paid over 29 years, but most winners opt for the upfront cash option.The game, which began in 1992, is played in 45 of the 50 US states, the capital city of Washington, and in the US territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.The winnings are subject to federal taxes of between 24% and 37%, and, in most cases, state taxes.",

    "body": "The jailed ex-president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a successful surgery for a double hernia, his wife Michelle says. The former leader is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazil's Supreme Court granted permission for the 70-year-old to be transferred from the room in the federal police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to a hospital in the capital, Brasília, for the procedure. Ahead of the surgery, Jair Bolsonaro endorsed the candidacy of his eldest son, Flávio, for the 2026 presidential race. The former president made his decision known in handwritten letter that was read out by Flávio Bolsonaro outside the hospital were his father is being treated.\"During my life, I have fought tough battles, paying a high price with both my health and my family, to defend what I think is best for our country,\" Bolsonaro wrote.\"I hand over what is most important in the life of a father - my own son for the mission of rescuing our country, Brazil.\"Flávio Bolsonaro, a 44-year-old senator, had already announced his decision to run for president for his father's Liberal Party.Ealier this month, he said his father had entrusted him \"with the mission of continuing our national project\". But Jair Bolsonaro's letter, which has been published by Brazilian media, is confirmation the senator has his father's backing.The incumbent, President Lula, has already announced he plans to run again in the presidential election scheduled for October 2026. In 2022, the presidential election went into a run-off, which saw the older Bolsonaro take on ex-President Lula. When Lula narrowly won, Jair Bolsonaro refused to accept the result and plotted with top military leaders to prevent Lula from taking up office. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023.Bolsonaro was found guilty of coup-plotting and sentenced in September this year. Despite the guilty verdict, the older Bolsonaro still wields considerable political influence.Brazil's Congress passed a bill last week to significantly shorten Bolsonaro's sentence but President Lula said he would veto it.  Jair Bolsonaro is expected to be transferred back to federal police headquarters as soon as doctors give the go-ahead. ",

    "body": "Heavy rain storms across large parts of California triggered floods and mudslides and left three dead as of Christmas night, according to local officials. The storms - which were expected to continue through Friday - brought 11 inches (27 cms) of rainfall to some parts of Los Angeles County, prompted evacuations and shut down major roads. Emergency responders have had to perform several rescues,  including people stuck in vehicles as flood waters rise.  California's Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Wednesday in Los Angeles and other southern California counties. About 100,000 people in the state were without power as of Thursday evening. The US Weather Prediction Center said on Thursday that \"Numerous flash flooding events are possible\". \"In addition, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.\" A 64-year-old man from San Diego, California, was killed on Wedesday morning by a fallen tree, the police department told US media. Another person, a 74-year-old, died from flood waters over the weekend as police tried to rescue him from inside a vehicle in Redding, California, the town's mayor told local news. And on Monday, a woman in her 70s died after she \"was knocked off a rock by a large wave and swept into the ocean\" at MacKerricher State Park in Mendocino County, California, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Evacuation warnings were in effect for some residents of San Bernardino County in southern California, and flash food warnings were issued for those in the San Francisco Bay area on Thursday morning. Wind speeds in the Bay Area topped 100 mph (161kmh) at one observatory near San Jose, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.In Altadena, near Los Angeles, residents experienced a mudslide from flooding in a burn scar area that was less able to absorb water due to the wildfires that scorched the neighbourhood in January of this year, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has also declared an emergency from the storms and warned residents to be cautious on roads during a time of busy holiday travel. \"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"The storms came from multiple atmospheric rivers that carried large plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, CBS News reported.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAnnabel RackhamCulture reporterLionsgateSydney Sweeney plays housemaid Millie Calloway in The HousemaidSydney Sweeney wants to make films that will \"impact and hopefully save people's lives\", she has told the BBC.The 28-year-old US actor has this year appeared in psychological thriller The Housemaid and boxing biopic Christy, which both address issues around domestic violence.Sweeney calls the topic \"prevalent\" and says she takes a \"lot of care\" when playing these types of roles.\"Being able to have a film that's on a more commercial level talk about a very difficult topic is important,\" she adds.LionsgateSweeney and Amanda Seyfried were cast in The Housemaid due to their physical similarities Sweeney is currently starring as Millie Calloway in The Housemaid, which is based on the 2022 novel of the same name by Freida McFadden.The novel is an international bestseller and has generated a large following, especially among the reading community on TikTok. Sweeney says she is \"a huge fan of the book\" and that she \"loved all the characters\".\"I love complex, juicy, crazy, twisted stories. This is a dream project,\" she adds.The film also features Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar, as Nina and Andrew Winchester, who employ Sweeney's character in their home.Seyfried and Sweeney were chosen to play the two female leads in The Housemaid because of their physical resemblances, but Seyfried says the similarities do not end there.\"There's a similarity between us that is uncanny, and it's really fun to work with people [who] are doing life in a similar way, have similar ideals about the job and life,\" she tells the BBC.Sweeney also says the pair have developed a \"dynamic\" where they \"can enjoy being around\" each other - and their relationship means they can \"go to these crazy places and discover so much more within your character\".LionsgateAmanda Seyfried plays Nina Winchester, a housewife who appears to have complex mental health issues'Getting the tone right'Seyfried's character Nina grapples with complex mental health issues throughout the film, which at times make it a difficult watch.\"You have to play it as realistic as possible because it needs to reflect real life,\" she says.The Housemaid has been compared to domestic thrillers of the 1990s, like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct. But it has a markedly modern twist with the physical and mental abuse plot lines in the film.Seyfried, who is known for her roles in Mamma Mia! and Mean Girls, believes the cast \"nailed getting the tone right\" and hopes that despite the movie being entertainment, that people \"come out with a better understanding of domestic violence\" and \"broaden their horizons\".She adds that this is \"especially\" true for \"people who haven't thankfully had to deal with it\".This is echoed by director Paul Feig, who admits he was \"nervous\" about handling the subject sensitively.\"I made sure there wasn't any physical abuse, that it was more psychological abuse,\" he says.Domestic abuse in film has become a hot topic for Hollywood, sparked by the promotional tour for 2024 film It Ends With Us, which was criticised by some for packaging it as a romantic story rather than one of abuse.Sklenar, who appears in both The Housemaid and It Ends With Us, says it is \"challenging\" to take on the role of an abuser.He describes his characters - Andrew Winchester in The Housemaid and Atlas Corrigan in It Ends With Us - as \"polar opposites\".\"When it comes to acting, you can try all you want, but ultimately sometimes it just affects you,\" he says.\"It's intense and it's ultimately going to affect you in certain ways.\"LionsgateBrandon Sklenar also appeared in It Ends With Us, a film adaptation of the Colleen Hoover novel of the same nameThe film has received mostly positive reviews, including four stars from the Guardian, which said Feig and his cast \"deliver with terrific gusto; this is an innocent holiday treat\".The reception will be welcome for Sweeney after being at the centre of much drama and discussion in 2025.Her American Eagle jeans ads drew criticism for raising issues over race and beauty standards. Sweeney told People Magazine earlier this month she was \"against hate and divisiveness\" and had been surprised by reaction to the campaign.And her career was under scrutiny after a string of box office flops - but The Housemaid opened with a healthy $19m (£14m) in North America last weekend.That's no surprise given that the original novel was a huge hit, selling more than 1.6 million copies worldwide.Two sequels have also been published, meaning further film adaptations could be on the cards.Feig, whose previous films include Bridesmaids and The Heat, believes novels will become an even more fertile source of material for Hollywood because \"studios always want something that is a known quality\" to \"justify their ability to put a lot of money\" into the project.But he says he tries not to let books with a huge audience and fanbase dictate what projects he makes, because \"there are plenty of books that are really popular that just don't work as movies\".Feig adds that it has been \"fun\" to work with Rebecca Sonnenshine's adapted screenplay for The Housemaid, but that he has \"restored\" some parts of the book that \"readers really would miss if they weren't in there\".There is also an \"extra ending that's not in the book\", he says, \"so readers can get something new that they didn't expect\".The Housemaid is now showing in UK cinemas.",

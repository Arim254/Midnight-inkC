    "body": "9 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondent andKathryn ArmstrongFar-right activist Tommy Robinson has said that he refused to give police his mobile phone Pin when he was stopped at the entry to the Channel Tunnel because it had \"journalist material\" on it, a court has heard.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was charged under the Terrorism Act after allegedly failing to comply with the counter-terrorism powers in Folkestone in July 2024.He is on trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court and has pleaded not guilty.A person who is detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act is legally obliged to provide the password or Pin for electronic devices. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to three months and/or receive a £2,500 fine.Robinson's trial began on Monday and is expected to last two days. He is charged under his real name and is being referred to as Mr Lennon in court.Before the hearing, the former English Defence League (EDL) leader addressed his X followers in a video taken while en route to court.He said the social media platform's billionaire owner Elon Musk - who has previously championed Mr Lennon - had \"picked up the legal bill\" for the case against him, which Mr Lennon described as \"state persecution\". Musk has not publicly confirmed this.In court, the 42-year-old sat in the dock wearing a navy waistcoat and tie.PC Mitchell Thorogood, a counter-terrorism officer with Kent Police, told the court that he was on duty policing vehicles travelling to France at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel near Folkestone on 28 July 2024.He described seeing a silver Bentley, an \"unusual car to come through\", with a lone occupant - Mr Lennon.PS Farmer, who was supervising the officers at the Channel Tunnel entrance that day, told the court that Mr Lennon had said he was delivering a friend's \"extremely high value\" Bentley Bentayga to Benidorm.Both he and PC Thorogood told the court they were suspicious of the account Mr Lennon gave them.\"He was travelling a far distance with a vehicle that wasn't his,\" PC Thorogood said.He added that Mr Lennon did not make eye contact with him during the exchange and had told him that he had not bought a ticket in advance, which the officer described as \"unusual\".PC Thorogood also described detaining Mr Lennon under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. He said Mr Lennon started filming him, and the officers took away his mobile phone.\"He refused to provide the Pin number, saying there was journalist material in his phone,\" PC Thorogood said.Mr Lennon's barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC, suggested the stop may have been \"discriminatory\" against his political beliefs.Prosecutor Jo Morris said that Mr Lennon had used an expletive at officers and had told them that his phone contained information about \"vulnerable girls\".\"The process by which journalistic material would be protected was explained to him,\" Ms Morris said.She told the court the officers had also found a small bag in the Bentley containing £13,370 and €1,910 (£1,660).District Judge Sam Goozee said the defendant's address should not be published, after his barrister said there were \"credible threats against Mr Lennon's life\".Mr Williamson told the judge that he did not expect his client to give evidence in his defence.The public gallery at the back of court was packed with more than 30 of his supporters, who had queued from early morning. One was wearing a red Mega (Make England Great Again) baseball cap.The trial continues.",

    "body": "35 minutes agoEvery paper on Tuesday focuses on the release of Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of a US-brokered plan to end the war in Gaza, which also saw Palestinian prisoners and detainees freed. A number of fronts feature full-page picture spreads - a photograph of hostage Alon Ohel smiling with his family leads the Daily Express, paired with the headline \"The long, painful nightmare is over\".\"Two years of torment over\" declares the Times, picturing hostages Alon Ohel, Evyatar David and Avinatan Or reuniting with their respective loved ones. The paper says US President Donald Trump hailed an \"end of an age of terror and death\" in his speech following the hostage release, and urged members of the Israeli parliament not to resume hostilities.Monday was a \"rare moment of joy among both Israelis and Palestinians\", according to the Guardian, which carries a photograph of people rejoicing in Tel Aviv and another photo of a released Palestinian hugging his son. The paper reports that large crowds also gathered in Khan Younis for the return of nearly 1,700 Palestinians who had been detained during the war, while the West Bank capital Ramallah received 88 detainees who were serving life sentences in Israel. \"We did not give up faith, we did not lose hope\" reads the headline of the i Paper, detailing the \"jubilation and relief\" for Israeli families after the release of the 20 remaining living hostages.The Financial Times leads on Trump's speech to the Israeli parliament, and reports that the president received multiple standing ovations as he \"set out a grand postwar vision\". The paper hones in on the second phase of the ceasefire, which it says diplomats believe will be \"far more complicated\", and notes that it has not been formally agreed to by Israel and Hamas.Trump also used his speech to touch on other peace deals he hopes to broker, and the Telegraph says he told the Knesset that he plans to \"focus on Russia first\". The paper reports that the Ukrainian prime minister and his top aide flew to Washington DC on Monday to begin \"high level talks to strengthen Ukraine's defense\", amid \"mounting\" speculation over the US president's decision to ship Tomohawk weapons to the nation. \"Home and now it's time for peace\" reads the headline of the Metro, alongside a photo of the moment twin Israeli hostages Ziv and Gali Berman reunited.The front page of the Star also focuses on the twins, featuring a full-page photograph of the brothers embracing with the headline \"Hug of love\".All 20 Israeli hostages have been pictured on the front page of the Sun, with the paper declaring they have been \"freed from hell\" after 737 days in captivity.\"Noa's hero is home\" says the Daily Mail, reporting on hostage Avinatan Or being reunited with his girlfriend and former hostage Noa Argamani, who was rescued in 2024. And the Mirror features a poignant image of Mr Or holding his hands up in a heart, calling it a \"message of love for the world\". Its headline is: \"Day we thought we'd never see.\" Related Internet Links",

    "body": "9 hours agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondent, AmmanBBCKing Abdullah II of Jordan has warned that the Middle East is doomed unless there is a peace process leading to a Palestinian state.The king was speaking in an exclusive interview for BBC Panorama, as he prepared to attend a summit in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh on President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan for the region.The summit is taking place on the day Hamas released the last living Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel.\"If we don't solve this problem,\" King Abdullah said, \"if we don't find a future for Israelis and Palestinians and a relationship between the Arab and Muslim worlds and Israel, we're doomed.\"King Abdullah said the region had seen many failed attempts at peace and that the implementation of a two-state solution - the creation of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, alongside Israel - was the only answer.\"I hope we can move things back, but with a political horizon, because if we don't solve this problem, we're going to be at it again,\" the king said.What we know about Gaza ceasefire agreement'Long and painful nightmare finally over,' Trump saysWho are the released hostages?The current Israeli government has repeatedly rejected a two-state solution. At the United Nations General Assembly last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was emphatic in his opposition.\"In fact, they effectively had a Palestinian state - in Gaza. What did they do with that state? Peace? Co-existence?\"\"No, they attacked us time and time again, totally unprovoked, they fired rockets into our cities, they murdered our children, they turned Gaza into a terror base from which they committed the October 7 massacre,\" he added, referring to the Hamas-led attacks two years ago that triggered this Gaza conflict.However, it was at the same UN assembly that President Trump called King Abdullah and other regional leaders to a meeting to outline his peace plan.\"The message he gave all of us was that, 'This has to stop. It has to stop now.' And we said, 'You know, Mr President, if anybody can do it, it's you,'\" King Abdullah said.Referring to the violence of the last two years, including Israel's war with Iran and the Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar last month, King Abdullah asked: \"How close have we come to regional, if not a southern-northern divide conflict that would have encompassed the whole world?\"Speaking of Netanyahu, the Jordanian leader said he did not \"trust a thing he says\". But he believed there were Israelis with whom Arab leaders could work to build peace.As for Hamas and its acceptance to hand over governance of Gaza to an independent Palestinian body under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, the king said he had been assured by those \"that are working extremely close to them, Qatar and Egypt, [who] feel very, very optimistic that they will abide by that.\"But the king warned that the \"devil was in the detail\" of the Trump mediated agreement, and that once a ceasefire had been achieved in Gaza it was vital that the US president remained engaged with the process.\"In our discussions with President Trump, he knows that it's not just Gaza, it's not just a particular political horizon. I mean he's looking at bringing peace to the whole region. That doesn't happen unless the Palestinians have a future.\"AFP via Getty ImagesKing Abdullah and Trump met at the peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday afternoonJordan has had a peace treaty with Israel since 1994, despite opposition from many in the country. More than 50% of the country's population is of Palestinian descent. The two countries co-operate on some security issues.The peace was agreed by the current monarch's late father, King Hussein, with the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist the following year. I asked King Abdullah if he believed he would see a final peace agreement including a Palestinian state within his own lifetime?\"I have to, because the alternative would mean probably the end of the region. My father, I remember towards the end of his life, used to say, 'I want peace for my children and their children.' I have two grandchildren; they deserve that peace. How awful would it be for them to grow up to say the same thing that my father said years ago?\"\"And I think that's what galvanises me and many of us in the region, that peace is the only option. Because if it doesn't come about, how often is the West, America in particular, dragged into this? It's been 80 years. And I think it's time for all of us to say enough is enough.\"More than 67,000 people have been killed by Israel's military in Gaza since 7 October 2023, according to health ministry officials in the Hamas-run territory.History does not offer much reason for hope, but King Abdullah believes this is a moment of genuine possibility.With additional reporting by Alice Doyard, Suha Kawar and David McIlveenMore on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spiesThe government is facing questions after a case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed, just weeks before the trial was due to go ahead.In September, prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the charges, sparking a political row over who was to blame.The background to the case is complicated - so here we try and walk you through how we got here and the political impact.What was the case about?Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry - who have both consistently maintained their innocence - were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Why did it collapse?Last week, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.In a rare intervention, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, who is the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales, said the CPS had tried to obtain further evidence from the government \"over many months\" but witness statements did not meet the threshold to prosecute.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.However, some legal experts have questioned whether the CPS would have needed this evidence to go ahead with the prosecution.What was the political fallout?Downing Street has insisted the decision to drop charges was made by the CPS, with no ministers or members of the government involved. The government has maintained that it is frustrated the trial collapsed.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also sought to shift the focus to the previous Conservative government, which was in power when the alleged offences took place.He argued the prosecution could only be based on the Tory government's position at that time, when he says China was not designated a \"threat to national security\".Current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected this claim, pointing out that a number of former senior security and legal officials have also questioned the government's argument.Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat.However, they claim there are hundreds of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence.The Tories have suggested that the PM's national security adviser Jonathan Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it needed to secure convictions.Ministers have insisted Powell had no involvement in the substance or evidence of the case.Why is this a problem for the government?Badenoch has accused the government of deliberately collapsing the trial because \"the prime minister wants to suck up to Beijing\" - something it has denied.Since last year's general election, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China to help achieve its aim of growing the economy.Then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Powell have all visited the country over the past year.The government has insisted its approach to China is rooted in the UK's national interests.However, Badenoch has claimed that following the collapse of the case it seems the PM has been \"too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security\".",

    "body": "The government's national security adviser Jonathan Powell made no decisions about the content of any evidence provided in the collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China, a minister has said.Prosecutors unexpectedly dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who deny the allegations - in September.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed the case collapsed because the government had refused to give the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) \"vital information\" as it wanted to \"curry favour\" with China.Security Minister Jarvis dismissed claims the government deliberately collapsed the case as \"baseless\".Mr Powell, who is one of the prime minister's most senior advisers and political allies, is facing pressure over whether he played a role in the collapse of the trial, with the Conservatives saying he has \"questions to answer\". Sir Keir Starmer has insisted he has \"full confidence\" in his national security adviser, telling broadcasters: \"He is doing an excellent job.\"Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.But last week the head of the CPS said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.Giving a statement to MPs in the Commons, Jarvis denied reports Mr Powell had ruled China could not be defined as a national security threat at a meeting of Whitehall officials in September, shortly before the charges were dropped.\"Of course, [the national security adviser] takes part in discussions about national security and diplomatic relations. That is literally his job,\" he said.\"But any discussions were on the basis that the case would be going ahead and how to handle the implications. \"The national security adviser was not involved in any decisions about the substance of the evidence.\"Jarvis said it was deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins who provided a witness statement in December 2023 under the previous Conservative government, with further witness statements requested and provided in February and July this year.He said Mr Collins was given \"full freedom to provide evidence without interference\", adding: \"Ministers and special advisers did not take decisions about that evidence and they were not cited on the contents.\"Jarvis said all the evidence provided was based on the law and the Tory government's position on China at the time of the alleged offences.He added that the decision about whether to proceed with the prosecution was taken by the CPS, \"who were hamstrung by antiquated legislation\".The Official Secrets Act of 1911 has since been replaced by the 2023 National Security Act, which Jarvis said closed \"the loopholes that have been exposed by this particular case\".\"Suggestions that the government concealed evidence, withdrew witnesses, or restricted the ability of witnesses to draw on particular bits of evidence are all untrue,\" he said.\"The [deputy national security adviser] did not materially change his evidence and was under no pressure from anyone to do so...\"What has changed is the CPS's assessment of the case law.\"Jarvis sought to blame the previous Tory government for not classifying China as a threat to national security and being too \"slow\" to update national security laws.Defending her party's record, Badenoch pointed to a number of examples where Tory ministers and government documents had described China as a \"threat\".\"The trial has collapsed because for months and months, the government has been refusing to give the CPS vital information,\" she said.\"This wasn't a mistake. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This looks like a deliberate decision to collapse the case and curry favour with the regime in China.\"She added: \"I suspect that [ministers] have decided that closer economic ties with China were more important than due process and our national security.\"The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to \"come clean on why this case fell apart\" and publish all correspondence between the deputy national security adviser and the CPS.The party's foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said: \"The government's attempts to duck scrutiny and scapegoat a single official simply won't wash.\"It's inconceivable that neither Keir Starmer nor his national security adviser knew what evidence was being submitted in such an important case. \"The buck for this fiasco ultimately stops with the prime minister.\"Meanwhile, Jarvis confirmed that MI5's National Protective Security Authority had published new advice for politicians on how to protect themselves from espionage and foreign interference.The guidance warns MPs they are a potential target for foreign spies, with China, Russia and Iran identified as particular risks to British institutions.",

    "body": "'He just kept growing': Life with a 13-stone Arctic dog20 hours agoSarah-May BuccieriBourneAmy SharpMal, a 13-stone Alaskan Malamute, has become a 'local celebrity' according to his ownersFluffy ears, tiny paws and adorable eyes. Picking an Alaskan Malamute puppy was not hard for owner Amy Sharp. But as her four-legged friend grew tremendously in size, so did the responsibility.\"His collar is as big as someone's belt. We didn't think he'd get this big,\" says Amy, laughing.Mal is five years old and now fully grown, weighing in at 13 stone (82 kg). He is strikingly similar in size to a Shetland pony but large dogs have always been part of 27-year-old Amy's life.When her family's 13-year-old husky passed away they decided to get an Alaskan Malamute puppy - a breed originally used as sled dogs and relied upon for endurance and strength.Mal lives a much slower life than that. But Amy, from Bourne, says his strength can still be very much witnessed, often when she is walking him.\"I'm always being asked, who's walking who?\" she says. \"We get a lot of head turnings, if people are driving by, you can tell by their eyes they're just like, what?\"Amy Sharp's pet is more than twice the average size of a dog of his breedAlaskan Malamutes take their name from an Inuit tribe that settled along the shores of Kotzebue Sound in north-western Alaska, according to the American Kennel Club.The PDSA says they typically grow to between five or six stone (34-39kg) and have a special \"double coat\" which helps keep them warm in Arctic temperatures.Amy says she \"didn't really notice\" how big her dog had grown until he started to grow quickly out of harnesses and collars.\"He just got bigger and bigger,\" she says.One of the challenges has been finding someone to groom Mal's coat. She recently had to make an appeal on social media to ask for help brushing him because previous groomers were not able to do it anymore.The post was met with hundreds of likes and comments with people marvelling at Mal's size and wanting to help.Later, while waiting for an appointment in a salon, someone asked if she'd seen the post of \"the big dog on Facebook\".\"I said, he's mine!\" she laughs.According to Amy, Mal's favourite treat is a cube of cheeseAmy's plea was successful and she quickly found a groomer eager to work on Mal simply because of his breed.It's considered the \"four by four\" version of the Arctic dog class because they're used to pulling heavy weights for long distances, according to Joan Sheehan from The Alaskan Malamute Club of the UK.Though she described the breed as \"stunning\", she warned that owning one comes with challenges.\"You've got to have strength in mind and body [and] be mindful that if you go for a lovely looking fluffy one, then you've got to be prepared to work with the coat,\" she says.\"Because you will be living with it in your bed, in your food, on your clothes and everywhere else.\"Amy has been on the receiving end of Mal's strength and accompanying stubbornness countless times - often he sits down at the end of his walks and refuses to come inside.\"You can't move him, so the neighbours come out and they'll try and get him to move,\" says Amy.\"He'll just lay there and be like, I'm not ready to go home yet.\"Though he can also be \"very loud\" with his \"back-chatting\", Amy has no regrets about her choice of dog.She would encourage people to do their research before buying a large breed but says her life has become entwined with her furry friend.\"He's a gentle giant. It's Mal's world and we're all just living in it.\"Listen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Two in court accused of killing jailed singer Watkins15 hours agoDavid Spereall andSteve JonesYorkshireWest Yorkshire PoliceIan Watkins was sentenced to 29 years in prison in 2013Two men have appeared in court charged with the murder of paedophile singer Ian Watkins, who was killed in Wakefield Prison. The former Lostprophets frontman, who was serving a 29-year jail sentence, was fatally injured in an incident at the prison just after 09:30 BST on Saturday.Rashid Gedel, 25, and Samuel Dodsworth, 43, both appeared at Leeds Magistrates' Court on Monday morning.Watkins, 48, was jailed in 2013 for a string of child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby.Appearing separately during consecutive hearings at the court, both Mr Dodsworth and Mr Gedel spoke only to confirm their names and dates of birth.Both defendants were told they would appear before Leeds Crown Court on Tuesday, with no pleas entered during the short hearings.Watkins, who also faced a further six years on licence if he was ever released, admitted the attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13 but pleaded not guilty to rape.He also admitted conspiring to rape a child, three counts of sexual assault involving children, seven involving taking, making or possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal.During sentencing, Mr Justice Royce said the case broke \"new ground\" and \"plunged into new depths of depravity\".Watkins was previously attacked at Wakefield Prison in 2023, although his injuries were not life-threatening on that occasion.Derbyshire Police/Metropolitan PoliceSamuel Dodsworth and Rashid Gedel appeared at Leeds Magistrates' Court on MondayFormed in Pontypridd in 1997, Lostprophets became one of the UK's biggest bands,  securing 11 top 40 hits and a number one album between 2002 and 2010. In a statement released after his conviction, the band's remaining members said they were \"heartbroken, angry, and disgusted\" at his crimes, adding that their \"hearts go out\" to his victims. A high-security prison housing some of the UK's most notorious offenders, Wakefield Prison currently holds more than 600 inmates. A report on conditions within the facility, which was published last month, said violence had \"increased markedly\" since a previous inspection in 2022. It also said the prison's \"infrastructure was in a poor state\", citing \"repeated breakdowns of essential equipment\" and \"some significant elements of the prison's perimeter security systems\". Among those currently serving time at the prison are believed to be Roy Whiting, who murdered eight year-old Sarah Payne in 2000, and Reynhard Sinaga, who was convicted of 159 sexual offences against 48 men in 2020. Both men have reportedly been attacked at the jail in recent years. Harold Shipman, Ian Huntley and Piran Ditta Khan are also among the former inmates to have served time in Wakefield. Getty ImagesWatkins achieved a string of top 40 hits with Lostprophets during the 2000sWho was Ian Watkins?Watkins was once one of Wales' most recognisable musicians - the frontman of the rock band Lostprophets.At the height of their fame, the group sold millions of albums around the world.But the group disbanded immediately after Watkins was convicted in 2013.Prosecutors described Watkins as a man corrupted by fame, drugs, and power - one who committed crimes \"beyond imagination.\"His trial heard Watkins had used his fame to manipulate and control others, often under the influence of hard drugs, including crystal meth.After Watkins was sentenced, Des Mannion, NSPCC national head of service for Wales, said: \"Watkins used his status and global fame as a means to manipulate people and sexually abuse children.\"But we must nevertheless remember that this case isn't about celebrity, it's about victims. And those victims are children.\"Related internet links ",

    "body": "Palestinians celebrate return of detainees freed by Israel12 hours agoTom BennettRamallah, occupied West BankWatch: Palestinian prisoners released in West Bank to rapturous crowdsHundreds of freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been welcomed with tears and screams of joy as they were released by Israel to be reunited with their families in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.The release involved about 250 prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge. As prisoners exited a Red Cross bus in Ramallah, many draped in traditional Keffiyeh scarves, they looked pale and gaunt, with some struggling to walk.They were freed as part of an exchange in which 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of four deceased hostages were released by Hamas. \"He is ready to embrace freedom,\" said Amro Abdullah, 24, who was waiting for his cousin Rashid Omar, 48, who was arrested in July 2005 and sentenced to life in prison by an Israeli court after being found guilty of murder and other crimes.\"I want peace,\" Mr Abudullah said. \"I want to live a happy life, safe and peaceful, without occupation and without restrictions.\"It is thought about 100 prisoners were released into the West Bank, with many others set to be deported and a small number freed into East Jerusalem.ReutersIsrael made clear before the release process that it wanted to avoid the jubilant scenes that surrounded prisoners arriving in Ramallah during previous hostage deals, when large crowds waved Hamas flags.Many families were reluctant to speak to the media, saying they had been warned against doing so by the Israeli military.In Gaza, families gathered at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the hope of being reunited with their loved ones. A field hospital adjacent to the main hospital building was set up to receive them.\"This is a very beautiful feeling - happy, a day of joy,\" said Muhammad Hasan Saeed Dawood, 50, who told the BBC he was there to collect his son who he says was arrested by Israeli forces at a checkpoint.\"We call it a national holiday, that our detainees are being released despite the cost of the war, the martyrs, the injured, and the destruction in Gaza.\"Khalil Muhammad Abdulrahman Al-Qatrous was also there to collect his son who he said had been detained for about three months.\"There is joy, and there is pain, and there is happiness, and there is sorrow,\" he said. \"We came here waiting for their release. We came here expecting them to arrive at 10:00, and now it is past 12:00, and we are still waiting, on edge.\"AFP via Getty ImagesBuses of freed Palestinian detainees arrived in Khan Younis, southern Gaza to cheers from gathered crowdsAhead of the release in Ramallah, ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society set up in preparation to treat any injured prisoners.\"The crying and the silence, this shows you how the families are feeling,\" said Ibrahim Ifani, 23, a volunteer nurse for the organisation.\"For all the people in Palestine, it's a deep, deep emotion,\" he said.Multiple medics and family members said the prisoners who were released in Ramallah had faced beatings in recent days prior to their release.The BBC cannot verify claims of mistreatment in Israeli prisons. But Israel's top court said last month that Palestinian prisoners were not being given adequate food.The BBC has also previously reported on Palestinians being tortured in Israeli detention.Aya Shreiteh, 26, from the Palestinian Prisoners Club said \"their rights were violated in the most serious ways\". \"Most of the prisoners in the past year were subjected to deliberate starvation and exposure to illness,\" she told the BBC.\"Their bodies are frail from starvation, and they've suffered from beatings.\"\"But today gives us hope that there will always be an inevitable freedom, no matter the circumstances,\" she added. The hostage and prisoner exchange formed part of phase one of Donald Trump's peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Israel launched a retaliatory military offensive which saw more than 67,682 Palestinians killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire took hold on Friday - and negotiations are now expected to follow over the latter phases of Trump's peace plan. More on this story",

    "body": "'We must catch up soon!' How to stop ghosting your friends1 day agoAlex TaylorBBC News reporterGetty Images/BBCThe time pressures of adult life can make it difficult to maintain the friendships we hold close\"We must catch up soon!\"It's a phrase near universal in adult friendships - a text we've likely both sent and received.We mean it in the moment, with the best of intentions. But between work, family and endless to-do lists, a simple catch-up can become a logistical nightmare.Yes, we must. But we rarely do.It explains why research finds we lose around half of our friends every seven years.It's not that we're suddenly \"fundamentally incompatible\", says psychologist Dr Marisa Franco, but because relationships shift as life stages change.Be it moving in with partners, getting married, focusing on our careers or starting a family, friendships become \"the easiest place for collateral damage\" for both men and women explains author Dolly Alderton.The question becomes how to maintain the same closeness with less time together.Relationship expert Claire Cohen, author of BFF? The Truth About Female Friendship, who recently had a son is experiencing this first hand.She's found herself in \"identity limbo\" between her old friends and the new group of mums she's met through antenatal classes.Claire says she wants a fully rounded group, not just people who know the \"new me\".To fix this, she's become more transparent, vulnerable, and creative in her approach to friendships during this challenging life transition.When Claire recently discovered she hadn't been invited to a social event, for example, she gently reached out and explained she would still love invites despite being busy with motherhood.Getty ImagesResearch shows platonic bonds are needed for healthy human connectionHer honesty opened up the conversation. Claire says the friend was \"reassuring\", explaining that she thought she was \"being kind\" by giving space, unaware of the hurt caused.Friendship reaffirmed, they then made time to hang out, even through the \"mundane connection\" of tidying together.Claire's experience shows how communicating honestly is key. Science underlines the importance of friendships.  A broad social circle is thought to have the same impact on your life span, as diet and exercise combined.It combats what Dr Franco calls \"relational loneliness\" -  the loss of deeper platonic bonds needed for healthy human connection.\"Even if you're around one person and you really like that person, you can still feel lonely without having friends,\" Dr Franco says.Embrace messMaking space for friendships as our life changes requires us to accept our changing circumstances and feel the discomfort.This means welcoming our friends into our messy lives, rather than waiting for perfect moments, says psychologist Julia Samuels.Going to the gym, running errands or doing a food shop with a new baby? Take a friend along.For friendships to exist, we need to give them space, however short or unusual the setting. \"If they can't do it, they can't do it. But have it in the diary,\" adds Samuels.Doing so allows us to meet in person, which experts agree should be the priority - even more so in our age of instant messaging.Other stories you may enjoyClaire agrees, particularly since giving birth. While Whatsapp messages undoubtedly help us touch base and tell people we're thinking of them, she's found them a wholly \"unsatisfactory\" catch-up replacement during maternity leave.It's a trap more of us have fallen into since the pandemic, says Dr Franco. Lockdowns normalised \"learned loneliness\" - seeing isolation as an acceptable default - alongside an over reliance on virtual communication.To avoid this, she says we need to remember that socialising is like a muscle - the more we do it, the easier it becomes.For those having to push themselves out the door, Dr Franco advises trying to reframe toward thinking about how happy our future selves will be, rather than pre-meet fears.\"When it comes to social connection, we underestimate just how happy it makes us, just how much value it brings,\" she explains.Best friends forever?So, what should you do if you want to rekindle a relationship?Dr Franco suggests a text message or voice note as an initial olive branch, perhaps highlighting a specific memory to revive the connection.When doing so, she says it's important to remember the \"liking gap\"  -  the negative disconnect between how we think others perceive us and their actual opinion.We need to think of friendships as \"flexible and not fragile\" and trust that feelings do not diminish in busy or challenging times.As for meetings themselves, Claire says \"organised fun\" such as book clubs or pottery classes can alleviate the stress of hosting and make it a communal occasion.Ultimately, we need to trust that friends really will be there for us. Or, as Samuels puts it:\"Trust that you're more liked than you think you are and take a risk\".

    "body": "4 hours agoJames FitzGerald andBrandon DrenonUS President Donald Trump and the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey have signed a declaration for bringing peace to Gaza at a summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el- Sheikh.\"A new and beautiful day is rising and now the rebuilding begins,\" said Trump, praising regional leaders who helped cement the truce between Israel and Hamas.Earlier, in his address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, the president told cheering lawmakers that \"the long and painful nightmare is finally over\". Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,700 other Palestinians detained during the two-year military operations in Gaza in exchange for the last 20 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas.The exchange, the first phase of Trump's peace plan, is also due to include the return of the bodies of 28 dead Israeli hostages.In Egypt, Trump was all smiles in the company of Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and more than 20 other leaders from around the world.\"Everybody's happy,\" Trump said, adding that he had done \"big deals before\" but \"this has taken off like a rocket ship\". \"This took 3,000 years to get to this point, can you believe it? And it's going to hold up too,\" he said. After the ceremony, President al-Sisi awarded Trump the Order of the Nile, a necklace made of pure gold considered to be Egypt's highest honour.The Egyptian president called the day a \"historic milestone that ends an agonising chapter\".Among the many world leaders at the summit who stood for a photo opportunity with Trump was Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who less than a week ago was blocked by the US from attending the UN General Assembly in New York.Although the first phase of the ceasefire agreement has been enacted, there is a lingering question over what role the Palestinian Authority might eventually play in Gaza.Trump said the second phase of negotiations on a peace agreement were under way.During his address to the Knesset, the American president suggested the region was experiencing \"the historic dawn of a new Middle East\". His words echoed the phrasing he used when Israel signed landmark deals with several Arab states during his first presidency.\"At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,\" Trump told the Israeli parliament.Adding to the jubilant atmosphere in the room were politicians' chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump\". The ceasefire that he helped to broker was \"the most challenging breakthrough of them all, the most challenging breakthrough maybe ever\", the US leader reflected. He indicated that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be his next focus.Trump gave an insight into some of his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he felt the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was becoming \"bad\" and \"heated\".\"I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this far more than if you kept this thing going, going, going, kill, kill, kill',\" Trump recalled.Introducing Trump to parliament, Netanyahu called the US president the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White House. \"Everything changed\" in the American attitude to Israel's military campaign in Gaza when Trump was re-elected as US president last year, he said.The Israeli prime minister thanked Trump for his \"unremitting help\" in securing the return of the remaining hostages - part of a group of 251 people seized during the 7 October 2023 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas.Trump went on to offer a tribute of his own to his counterpart, saying: \"He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"Also welcomed to the Knesset alongside Trump were other key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. The names of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received particularly loud cheers from Israeli MPs, for their own roles in brokering the ceasefire. Kushner was accompanied by his wife Ivanka Trump.Members of Trump's audience wore red caps. Instead of Trump's signature slogan \"Make America Great Again\", they read \"Trump the Peace President\".Trump was told by the parliamentary speaker that there was \"no-one\" more deserving of next year's Nobel Peace Prize.Some Israeli lawmakers who want the war in Gaza to continue did not attend.Trump's speech was briefly interrupted as an opposition parliament member held up a piece of paper that said \"Recognise Palestine\". At least one person was escorted out of the room.The ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan. The next phases are still to be negotiated.Trump has said the ceasefire will hold, and that a \"board of peace\" he is due to head would quickly be set up to administer the territory.",

My hero. Come, come.\"Matan was one of 20 living hostages remaining in Gaza after being taken during the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, who were freed on Monday after two years in captivity.His mother, Einav, has campaigned fiercely for Matan's return. She became among the best-known faces of the movement, and demanded the Israeli government agree a hostage exchange with Hamas.Last week, she and her daughter lit fireworks in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv to celebrate the ceasefire deal that had been agreed between Israel and Hamas as part of Donald Trump's peace plan.On Monday, crowds gathered and cheered in the same square as they watched footage on big screens of Matan and the other 19 freed hostages returning to Israel and reuniting with their families.People waved the Israeli and US flags and held up photos of the hostages and signs saying \"they're coming home\".Matan was taken with his partner Ilana Gritzewsky from Nir Oz, but Ilana was released during a ceasefire the following month.In December 2024, Hamas released a video showing Matan in captivity in which he said he and his fellow hostages were suffering from skin ailments and shortages of food, water and medicine.Israel Defense ForcesReleased Israeli hostage, Matan Zanguaker, greets his mother in a video clip shared by the IDFIn a video call with Matan on Monday shortly after his release, Einav told him: \"Thank God, the war is over. The war is over.\"In a later statement, the family said that \"after two years of hell, today we begin a new chapter of our lives - one of healing and rehabilitation\".Who are the released hostages?Palestinians celebrate return of prisoners freed by IsraelThat sentiment was shared by several of the families who were reunited with their loved ones.The family of Eitan Horn, who was also taken from Nir Oz, and whose brother Yair was released during a ceasefire in February, said they would have \"hugs and lots of love and we will accompany him through the entire recovery process\".ReutersRelatives of Israeli hostage Eitan Horn pictured as they awaited his releaseRelatives of 24-year-old Evyatar David, who was taken from the Nova music festival and was seen emaciated in a tunnel in a video published by Hamas in August, said they always \"knew he would return\".\"After two years of suffering, he is here. Now a new journey of healing will begin for Evyatar and us,\" they said in a statement.ReutersReleased hostage Evyatar David grins as he arrives at a medical centre in the outskirts of Tel AvivThe living hostages were collected from meeting points in Gaza by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has acted as a neutral intermediary in the handovers.They were then reunited with loved ones at reception points near the Gaza border, before being airlifted to hospitals to begin the process of physical and psychological treatment.ReutersMatan stands with his mother and waves as he arrives at a medical centre in Tel Aviv by helicopterThere were celebrations across Israel as the 20 hostages returned. People waved at the sky and cheered when they were flown overhead in military helicopters on their way to hospitals.Inbar Goldstein, whose own relatives were released in the November 2023 ceasefire, told the BBC she was feeling \"happy and thankful\".\"I know that sad days are still ahead but I want to separate between what I know and what I feel,\" she said.Elsewhere in the square, teenager Yarden told the BBC: \"We're here for the hostages, their release and to celebrate them. Today all Israelis are together - it's not about left or right, it's about all being together to celebrate the hostages.\"EPAIsraelis celebrated in Hostage Square in Tel AvivBut while the living hostages have now been returned, many families of those killed in captivity are still waiting, with Hamas saying only four bodies out of 28 would be released on Monday. The Israeli military said it would carry out forensic tests before confirming their identities and informing their families.A copy of the ceasefire agreement published by Israeli media had stated that the remains of all of the deceased hostages should be handed over by 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday. However, it also appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not be able to locate all of them within that timeframe.The deal also involved the release of about 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) urged Hamas to \"uphold its end of the deal\" by returning all of the bodies.Matan's family said there could be no closure until this happened.\"We will continue to stand beside the bereaved families and to fight until the last hostage is brought home,\" they said.More on this story: ",

    "body": "Your nose gets colder when you're stressed. These thermal images show the change1 day agoVictoria GillScience correspondent, BBC NewsWatch science correspondent Victoria Gill put herself through a thermal imaging stress testWhen I was asked to give an impromptu five-minute speech and then to count backwards in intervals of 17 - all in front of a panel of three strangers - the acute stress was written on my face.That is because psychologists from the University of Sussex were filming this somewhat terrifying experience for a research project that is studying stress using thermal cameras.Stress alters the blood flow in the face, and scientists have discovered that the drop in temperature of a person's nose can be used as a measure of stress levels, and to monitor recovery.Thermal imaging, according to the psychologists behind the study could be a \"game changer\" in stress research.Kevin Church/BBCThe temperature drop in the nose, seen in the thermal image on the right, happens because stress affects our blood flow.   The experimental stress test that I subjected myself to is carefully controlled and  deliberately designed to be an unpleasant surprise. I arrived at the university with no idea what I was in for. First, I was asked to sit, relax and listen to white noise through a set of headphones. So far, so calming. Then, the researcher who was running the test invited a panel of three strangers into the room. They all stared at me silently as the researcher informed that I now had three minutes to prepare a five minute speech about my \"dream job\". As I felt the heat rise around my neck, the scientists captured my face changing colour through their thermal camera. My nose quickly dropped in temperature - turning blue on the thermal image -  as I considered how to bluster my way through this unplanned presentation. (I decided I would take the opportunity to make my pitch to join the astronaut training programme!)The Sussex researchers have carried out this same stress test on 29 volunteers. In each, they saw their nose dip in temperature by between three and six degrees. My nose dropped in temperature by two degrees, as my nervous system pushed blood flow away from my nose and to my eyes and ears - a physical reaction to help me to look and listen for danger.   Most participants, like me, recovered quickly; their noses warmed to pre-stressed levels within a few minutes. Lead researcher, Prof Gillian Forrester explained that being a reporter and broadcaster has probably made me \"quite habituated to being put in stressful positions\".  \"You are used to the camera and talking with strangers, so you're probably quite resilient to social stressors,\" she explained. \"But even someone like you, trained to be in stressful situations, shows a biological blood flow shift, so that suggests this 'nasal dip' is a robust marker of a changing stress state.\"Kevin Church/BBC NewsThe 'nasal dip' happens in just a few minutes when we are acutely stressedStress is part of life. But this discovery, the scientists say, could be used to help manage harmful levels of stress.\"The length of time it takes someone to recover from this nasal dip could be an objective measure of how well somebody regulates their stress,\" said Prof Forrester.\"If they bounce back unusually slowly, could that be a risk marker of anxiety or depression? Is it something that we can do anything about?\"Because this technique is non-invasive and measures a physical response, it could also be useful to monitor stress in babies or in people who can't communicate. The second task in my stress assessment was, in my view, even worse than the first. I was asked to count backwards from 2023 in intervals of 17. Someone on the panel of three impassive strangers stopped me every time I made a mistake and asked me to start again. I admit, I am bad at mental arithmetic. As I spent an embarrassing length of time trying to force my brain to perform subtraction, all I could think was that I wanted to flee the increasingly stuffy room. During the research, only one of the 29 volunteers for the stress test did actually ask to leave. The rest, like me, completed their tasks - presumably feeling varying degrees of humiliation - and were rewarded with another calming session of white noise through headphones at the end. Anxious apesProf Forrester will demonstrate this new thermal stress-measuring method in front of an audience at the New Scientist Live event in London on 18 October. Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of the approach is that, because thermal cameras measure a physical stress response that is innate in many primates, it can also be used in non-human apes. The researchers are currently developing its use in sanctuaries for great apes, including chimpanzees and gorillas. They want to work out how to reduce stress and improve the wellbeing of animals that may have been rescued from traumatic circumstances.The team has already found that showing adult chimpanzees video footage of baby chimpanzees has a calming effect. When the researchers set up a video screen close to the rescued chimps' enclosure, they saw the noses of animals that watched the footage warm up. So, in terms of stress, watching baby animals playing is the opposite of a surprise job interview or an on-the-spot subtraction task.   Gilly Forrester/University of SussexChimpanzees and gorillas in sanctuaries may have been rescued from traumatic circumstances Using thermal cameras in ape sanctuaries could prove to be valuable in helping rescued animals to adjust and settle in to a new social group and strange surroundings. \"They can't say how they're feeling and they can be quite good at masking how they're feeling,\" explained Marianne Paisley, a researcher from the University of Sussex who is studying great ape wellbeing. \"We've [studied] primates for the last 100 years or so to help us understand ourselves.\"Now we know so much about human mental health, so maybe we can use that and give back to them.\"So perhaps my own minor scientific ordeal could contribute, in a small way, to alleviating distress in some of our primate cousins.

    "body": "England defender Bright retires from internationalsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Millie Bright captained England at the Women's World Cup in 2023ByEmily SalleyBBC Sport journalistEngland defender Millie Bright has announced her retirement from international football.The 32-year-old, who was part of England's European Championship-winning team in 2022, made her senior debut in September 2016 and went on to win 88 caps.\"I've been weighing this up for a long time,\" Chelsea captain Bright said on Monday's 'The Rest is Football: Daly Brightness' podcast.\"It's one of those decisions no-one can make for you. It's a feeling and I'm at peace with it.\"Bright missed out as England defended their Euros title in Switzerland in July after ruling herself out of the tournament because she would be unable to \"give 100% mentally or physically\".Over the summer she had successful knee surgery and started counselling sessions, while she said the decision to withdraw from Sarina Wiegman's squad was \"by far the best decision I have ever made\".\"Having the summer to reflect, fix my knee and get my head straight really put things into perspective. As you get older your priorities change. I've been craving family time, time with friends and time for myself,\" Bright said.Bright started every game as England won their first major women's trophy at Euro 2022, and captained them to the World Cup final a year later, which they lost to Spain.\"I'm incredibly proud and honoured to have played for England for so long. Every single cap has been special and the memories I've made - especially with this one sat opposite me - have been some of the best of my life,\" Bright said on the podcast, which she co-hosts with her friend and former England team-mate Rachel Daly.\"But yeah, it's time. It's the right time for me to call it a day with England.\"Bright's final game for the Lionesses was a 3-2 defeat by Belgium in April.England manager Wiegman said: \"Millie will forever be an England legend for what she has given to her country, and I could never have enough words to praise her impact during my time.\"Wiegman is likely to be asked further questions about Bright's retirement on Tuesday after she names her first England squad since the Lionesses retained their title.'I'm at that crossroads' - why is Bright retiring?Media caption, Bright, speaking in August, said missing the Euros was the 'best decision I ever made'Before ruling herself out of Euro 2025, Bright's England future was uncertain when she withdrew from June's Nations League fixtures - just a month before Wiegman's side started their title defence.The centre-back later cited burnout as the reason for her decision, after a season in which she made 36 appearances as Chelsea won the domestic treble of the Women's Super League (WSL), FA Cup and League Cup.Chelsea said Bright had knee surgery the day after she made herself unavailable for the Euros.\"Physically I'm at that crossroads,\" Bright said on Monday's podcast.\"Can I be 50% for each - for England and for Chelsea? I want to be all in. To give myself the best chance of doing that and be the best for my club, I probably need to rein it in a little bit.\"Because of her knee injury, Bright said she \"had not given a single thought\" about going to this year's Euros.\"I wasn't even thinking about football in the summer,\" she added. \"I got surgery on my knee and that was honestly my priority. I just said 'listen, I can't' - I couldn't physically go.\"'A true leader' - Bright's England careerImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bright (left, with Leah Williamson) scored six goals for EnglandIn her 88 caps for England, Bright has showed her qualities as a \"no‑nonsense\" defender who was - and still is for Chelsea - powerful, and dominant in the air.She first tasted major-tournament football 10 months after her debut at Euro 2017, where she was the only England player to start every match as they reached the semi-finals, falling to eventual winners the Netherlands.Two years later, she was once again ever-present in England's backline as they reached the last four of the 2019 World Cup, but Bright's tournament was to end in heartbreak as she was sent off in the Lionesses' defeat by the United States.She was named vice-captain to Leah Williamson for Euro 2022 on home soil, and it was only natural she took the captaincy when Williamson was ruled out of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand through injury the following year.Bright played all seven games as England reached the final, where they lost to Spain - in what would be Bright's last appearance at a major tournament.Wiegman added: \"Whether she had the armband or not, she is a true leader. I know how much respect there is for Millie within the game - not just because she has won so many trophies but because of the way she conducts herself.\"She has made such a big contribution to English football both on and off the pitch and we all have a lot to thank her for. Even though her playing time with the Lionesses may be over, I know she has so much more to give the game.\"Analysis - Bright's longevity and leadership stand outByEmma SandersBBC Sport women’s football news reporterBright's retirement is a mark of the changing of the guard with competition flooding into the England squad.At the age of 32, and having withdrawn from Euro 2025 selection, her decision does not come as a surprise, though it will be an emotional farewell to her England career.Bright's longevity - an ever-present in a nine-year international career - is a testament to her professionalism and her ability to play at the highest level consistently.She is still captaining ruthless WSL champions Chelsea and has started all their league games this season, but juggling international football and a gruelling domestic schedule has no doubt taken its toll on her.Leah Williamson, Jess Carter, Esme Morgan and Alex Greenwood proved to be strong centre-back combinations at Euro 2025 in Bright's absence, and there are young players such as Manchester United's Maya le Tissier wanting to break into Wiegman's team.With Bright's position in the side a growing doubt, it felt like the right time for her to step away from England duty and focus on domestic matters.She will go down as one of England's most influential players in modern history, having played an instrumental role in their Euro 2022 success and run to the 2023 World Cup final.",

Lindsay Rimer left her home in Hebden Bridge, near Halifax, on 7 November to buy cornflakes from a nearby shop but never returned. In April 1995, her body was found in the Rochdale Canal, about a mile from the town, weighted down with a stone.West Yorkshire Police said a man was arrested on Monday at an unnamed UK prison where he was serving a sentence for other offences.A force spokesperson said officers were \"keeping Lindsay's family updated\", adding that the arrest was \"as a result of our continued focus on progressing the investigation\".The arrested man would be interviewed by police on Monday and Tuesday and was expected to be bailed and returned to prison while inquiries continued, the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, officers were approaching \"a number of specific potential witnesses, mainly in the Hebden Bridge and wider Halifax area\", who had been identified by the investigation.West Yorkshire Police confirmed that Monday's arrest was the first in the investigation into Lindsay's murder since 2017.West Yorkshire PoliceCCTV images show Lindsay buying cornflakes shortly before she disappearedOn the night Lindsay went missing in November 1994, she had left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 GMT before calling in to see her mother at the Trades Club, a members club and music venue in Hebden Bridge.She was captured on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes from the Spar shop on Crown Street.Lindsay Rimer: The girl who went to buy cornflakes and never came homeThe last confirmed sighting of Lindsay was not long after this, as she was seen leaning against a wall near the Memorial Garden.Her body was found by two canal workers the following spring.The search for the schoolgirl was one of the largest carried out by West Yorkshire Police. Lindsay's family has described not knowing what happened to her as \"like living a life sentence\".Alex Moss/BBCDet Ch Insp James Entwistle said police remained committed to the investigation into Lindsay's murderConfirming the new arrest, Det Ch Insp James Entwistle, senior investigating officer, said: \"We remain very firmly committed to doing everything we can to get justice for Lindsay, and to give her family the answers they still so desperately need after all these years.\"While we appreciate the understandable public interest that today's arrest will bring, we do not anticipate any immediate developments at this stage.\"Det Ch Insp Entwistle added: \"Although it is now more than 30 years since Lindsay was murdered, we remain convinced there is someone out there who has vital information that could finally help to ease her family's pain.\"We urge them do the right thing and tell us what they know.\"Anyone with information that could help the investigation was asked to contact West Yorkshire Police.More on this storyRelated internet links ",

    "body": "Baroness Helen Newlove, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales, has died aged 63 following a short illness, her office has said.The Conservative peer was appointed to the role twice after becoming a campaigner and activist following the death of her husband Garry who was killed when he confronted a group of youths outside the couple's home.\"Helen was a committed and passionate advocate for victims,\" her office said in a statement, adding that she was a \"dear friend and a respected colleague\" who \"transformed\" the role of commissioner.Tributes were paid in the House of Lords, while Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy praised her \"unparalleled experience and dedication\" to her role.She was most recently appointed to the role in 2023, and was due to serve until the end of this year. She previously served as commissioner from 2012 to 2019.Calling her an \"extraordinary public servant\", Lammy said: \"Her leadership shaped the Victims' Code, strengthened victims' voices in the criminal justice system, and ensured that the Victims and Prisoners Act progressed with victims' interests at its heart.\"She championed the rights of victims and witnesses and held agencies to account.\" Her office said Baroness Newlove \"consistently led by example\", and that she \"reshaped the office into a trusted voice and genuine force for victims\".It added that she was driven by her own experience of the criminal justice system.In August 2007, her 47-year-old husband was killed when he confronted a gang of youths who had vandalised their car, in Warrington, Cheshire.At the time, the court heard that he was kicked \"like a football\" in front of his daughters during the attack. Three teenagers were convicted of his murder in January 2008, and Lady Newlove was made a life peer for her work on youth crime in 2010.\"She was determined that all victims should be treated with compassion, decency and respect - and she consistently led by example,\" her office said.Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Barker said her dedication to defend victims regardless of who was in government at the time, \"a very laudable thing to witness\".Conservative frontbencher Lord Kamall remembered her as a \"fierce campaigner\", while independent crossbencher Baroness O'Loan, hailed her as a \"very lovely person\".The former police ombudsman for Northern Ireland added that she was \"so brave and effective in all that she did\".He added: \"She will be sorely missed, not only by her family, to whom I'm sure we all send great sympathy, but also by so many of us in this House and in the world beyond\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterFoster's beer drinkers in the UK will soon find their lager's alcohol strength cut to 3.4%.Heineken UK, which brews Foster's, said cutting the alcohol strength from the current 3.7% would make the lager eligible for lower rates of alcohol duty.The brewer hinted at cheaper pints saying \"customers benefit from more competitive pricing\" because of the lower tax charge.The change is set to go into effect by February, marking the second time in three years that Foster's alcohol percentage, or ABV, has been diluted. Heineken UK said it was responding to changes in UK government policy, which have encouraged brewers to offer lower alcohol options.The government introduced a new system of alcohol duties based on strength in August 2023, which made less alcoholic beers and ciders relatively cheaper compared to more powerful alternatives.Since then, rival brews Carlsberg Pilsner, Sol, Coors Light and Grolsch have also been reformulated to an ABV below 3.4% to qualify for the lower rate of tax in the UK.It insisted punters would not notice the difference, after \"extensive\" consumer testing.\"Our master brewers have spent many months refining the recipe to ensure the taste remains unmistakably Foster's - crisp, balanced, and refreshing,\" the brewing giant saidHeineken said there had been a \"continued shift\" in beer-drinking trends, toward lower-ABV options \"as part of a balanced and health-conscious lifestyle\".Heineken last month said its global beer sales would fall next year as drinkers cut back because of pressure on their household budgets.In its third quarter results, the global brewer said the UK had bucked the  global trend of falling beer volume sales, which it blamed on squeezed consumer budgets.Alongside making beers such Birra Moretti, Sol, Strongbow cider and the eponymous Heineken, the company also operates close to 2,400 pubs in the UK under its Star Group subsidiary.",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 16 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "Ukraine's energy and justice ministers have resigned in the wake of a major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko's removal on Wednesday. On Monday anti-corruption bodies accused several people of orchestrating a embezzlement scheme in the energy sector worth about $100m (£76m), including at the national nuclear operator Enerhoatom.Some of those implicated in the scandal are - or have been - close associates of Zelensky's.The allegation is that Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and other key ministers and officials received payments from contractors building fortifications against Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Among those alleged to be involved are former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95. He has since reportedly fled the country. Halushchenko said he would defend himself against the accusations, while Grynchuk said on social media: \"Within the scope of my professional activities there were no violations of the law.\"The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the investigation - which was 15 months in the making and involved 1,000 hours of audio recordings - uncovered the participation of several members of the Ukrainian government. According to Nabu, the people involved systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Prosecutors alleged that the scheme's proceeds were laundered through an office in Kyiv linked to the family of former Ukrainian lawmaker and current Russian senator Andriy Derkach.Nabu has been releasing new snippets of its investigation and wiretaps every day and on Tuesday it promised more would come.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants. It will also shine a spotlight on corruption in Ukraine, which continues to be endemic despite work by Nabu and Sap in the 10 years since they were created. In July, nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing the independence of Nabu and Sap. Ukrainians feared the nation could lose the coveted status of EU candidate country which it was granted on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption. Kyiv's European partners also expressed severe alarm at the decision, with ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressing the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.The backlash was the most severe to hit the Ukrainian government since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate the freedom of the two anti-corruption bodies.Yet for some that crisis brought into question Zelensky's dedication to anti-corruption reforms. The latest scandal threatens to lead to more awkward questions for the Ukrainian president. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesPennies, which are worth one cent, cost nearly four cents to make.The US is set to make its final penny.The Philadelphia Mint will strike its last batch of one-cent coins on Wednesday, after more than 230 years of production.The coins will remain in circulation but the phase-out has already prompted businesses to start adjusting prices, as they say pennies are becoming harder to find.The government says the move will save money, or as President Donald Trump put it in February when he first announced the plans: \"Rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time\".Pennies, which honour Civil War president Abraham Lincoln and are made of copper-plated zinc, today cost nearly four cents each to make — more than twice the cost of a decade ago, according to the Treasury Department. It estimates the decision to end production will save about $56m a year.Officials have argued that the rise of electronic transactions is making the penny, which first went into production in 1793, increasingly moot. The Treasury Department estimates that about 300 billion of the coins will remain in circulation, \"far exceeding the amount needed for commerce\".Many pennies end up falling out of use. About 60% of all coins in circulation in the US - or about $60-$90 for the typical household - sits stashed at home in piggy banks, deemed not worth trading in, according to a 2022 government analysis.But penny-pinchers beware: as businesses start rounding up prices, the move is expected to raise costs for shoppers. One study by researchers at the Richmond Federal Reserve estimated that could cost consumers $6m annually.Other countries have also phased out their lowest value coins. Canada, for example, made its last batch of one cent coins in 2012.Australia and New Zealand retired one and two cent coins in the 1990s, and New Zealand stopped production of five cent coins in 2006.The UK floated a plan to scrap 1p coins in 2018, though the proposal was later withdrawn. But the rise of electronic transactions did prompt the UK to halt production of coins in 2024, after officials decided there were sufficient 1p and 2p coins in circulation.In the US attention has now turned to the nickel, which has a face value of five cents but costs nearly 14 cents to produce. Retiring that coin would have a far bigger impact on shoppers, costing consumers some $55m per year, according to the Richmond Fed study.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKate Whannel,Political reporter and Brian Wheeler,Political reporterSir Keir Starmer has insisted he has \"never authorised\" attacks on his cabinet ministers, calling briefings against them \"unacceptable\".The PM was speaking at Prime Minister's Questions after some of his allies told numerous media outlets he could face a leadership challenge from another cabinet minister such as Health Secretary Wes Streeting.There has been speculation about the extent to which Sir Keir was aware of the anonymous briefings, which had been aimed at shoring up his position, or had encouraged them in some way.Streeting has denied he was lining up a leadership bid, and called on those behind the briefings to be sacked.Asked at an NHS conference in Manchester if he would fight alongside Sir Keir if there were any plots to oust him as PM, Streeting said: \"Yes.\"\"The bizarre thing about some juvenile briefing overnight is it's people in No 10 who've said the PM is fighting for his job.\"I don't think that's a helpful or constructive thing to say, I also don't think it's true,\" he added.Streeting has attacked the \"toxic culture\" inside No 10, but has said he does not think the PM is behind the briefings.Asked whether he thought Sir Keir's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney was responsible for the culture in Downing Street, he said:  \"I am not going to add to the toxic culture by contributing to the toxic culture and going after individuals.\"I don't think that is a constructive or positive thing to do.\"One thing I would say for Morgan McSweeney is there wouldn't be a Labour government without him.\" At PMQs, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the PM had \"lost control of his government... and lost the trust of the British people\".She said McSweeney was responsible for the culture in No 10 and asked if the prime minister still had confidence in him. Sir Keir replied: \"Morgan McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focused on delivering for the country. \"Let me be clear, of course, I've never authorised attacks on cabinet members, I appointed them to their post because they're the best people to carry out their jobs.\"Sir Keir told MPs \"any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable\".He said Streeting - who missed PMQs to deliver a speech at the NHS conference - was doing a \"great job\" cutting waiting lists and boosting the number of doctors.Speaking after PMQs, the prime minister's press secretary told reporters the briefings against Streeting had come \"from outside No 10\" and that the prime minister had full confidence in McSweeney.The spokesperson refused to say whether there was a leak inquiry, but did say leaks would be \"dealt with\".Briefings of this nature are often part of reporting on politics in Westminster, when people speak to journalists \"off the record\".This means they say things that they are not prepared to say on camera, which the BBC reports in order to give the full story.On Tuesday evening, supporters of the prime minister told journalists he would fight a challenge to his leadership, which they believed could come as soon as after the Budget on 26 November.They argued that removing the PM could create chaos, destabilise the international markets and damage the relationship he has built with US President Donald Trump.The names being discussed by Labour MPs as potential candidates to replace Sir Keir include Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. There is also speculation Energy Secretary Ed Miliband could stand. Despite winning a landslide majority in the July 2024 general election, Sir Keir has had a rocky time in Downing Street and opinion polls suggest he is unpopular.Both the Budget in two weeks' time, and elections in Scotland and Wales and local elections in England next year, are crunch points for the government.Supporters of the prime minister have argued a leadership contest would plunge the party into the chaos associated with the last years of the previous Conservative administration.In order to trigger a leadership contest against the prime minister, challengers would need the support of 20% of Labour MPs, which currently means 81 nominations would be required.Some Labour MPs and ministers have publicly and privately condemned the briefings. Appearing on BBC Politics Live, Business Minister Sir Chris Bryant said he thought they were \"plain daft\".Labour MP for Bassetlaw Jo White said: \"This is a group of people who think they're much cleverer than the rest of us, who spend their time selectively briefing journalists and stirring the pot.\"I want to simply say: we're not having it.\"But some Labour MPs who are usually supportive of the prime minister described the timing and substance of the briefing as \"badly handled\" and \"baffling\".One senior Labour figure questioned why Sir Keir's allies had \"legitimised what was a taboo\" by publicly entertaining the prospect of a leadership challenge.",

    "body": "City's overnight visitors could face £1.30 per night tax7 hours agoJames McCarthyBBC WalesGetty ImagesCardiff wants to introduce a tourism taxCardiff could become the first place in Wales to introduce a tourism tax on paid overnight stays.The fee would be £1.30 per person per night for most types of accommodation and 75p a night for campsites and shared rooms, and is estimated to raise £3.5m a year.The money would go to the Welsh Revenue Authority, which would pay it to local authorities.If the council's cabinet grants approval, a 12-week public consultation will start on 1 December.Legislation was passed in September which allows Welsh councils to charge a small fee to overnight visitors from April 2027.It would apply to paid overnight stays of 31 nights or fewer in hotels, hostels, guesthouses, Airbnbs, campsites and temporary event accommodation.Some visitors would be exempt, including:Children under 18 in campsites or shared roomsPeople staying more than 31 nights in a single bookingThose in emergency or temporary housing arranged by the councilThere was a mixed reaction from some in the business community, with one saying if done correctly it could help boost the city's tourism industry.Councillor Russell Goodway, cabinet member for investment and development, said: \"The proposed visitor levy in Cardiff would be used to improve the visitor experience for everyone coming to Cardiff, by funding marketing campaigns, or by supporting a broader range of events in the city.\"Not only do we want people to enjoy their experience coming to Cardiff, but we also want people to stay longer, so we need to increase our offer though investment.\"The proposed charge, he said, was lower than that typical in Europe.Federation of Small Businesses Wales chief Joshua Miles said: \"FSB has been and remains of the view that this is not the time to introduce a new tax on tourism in Wales, and that there is a risk of damage done to local economies by its implementation.\"The small business sector has experienced a prolonged period of difficult economic conditions.\"With low consumer spending and disproportionately high costs still affecting some tourism businesses' viability, they still need support to recover.\"He urged Cardiff to explore alternatives that \"do not burden small business and... customers.\"Executive director of business group For Cardiff, Carolyn Brownell, said: \"The introduction of [a] visitor levy by Cardiff Council presents a valuable opportunity to strengthen the city's visitor economy, provided it is implemented in a way that ensures the fund provides additionality and is invested to support Cardiff's tourism sector.\"Nick Saunders, founder and director of events organisers Depot Live, said: \"I don't think it's a terrible idea, the council need to raise money for services.\"At those low levels I don't think it is going to impact on people and a nominal amount like that could really benefit the council.\"There may be some negative response with the ongoing cost of living crisis, he said.\"Even though it is a nominal charge people will have a grumble,\" he said.Related links",

    "body": "5 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Eastern and Southern Europe correspondent and Guy Delauney,Balkans correspondentAP Photo/Jerome DelayCivilians risked their lives to cross Sarajevo's main boulevard during the Bosnian warThe public prosecutor's office in Milan has opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on \"sniper safaris\" during the war in the early 1990s.Italians and others are alleged to have paid large sums to shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo.The Milan complaint was filed by journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, who describes a \"manhunt\" by \"very wealthy people\" with a passion for weapons who \"paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians\" from Serb positions in the hills around Sarajevo.Different rates were charged to kill men, women or children, according to some reports.More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo.Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years, but the evidence gathered by Gavazzeni, which includes the testimony of a Bosnian military intelligence officer, is now being examined by Italian counter terrorism prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis.The charge is murder.CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFPMore than 11,000 civilians died in the three-year siege of SarajevoThe Bosnian officer apparently revealed that his Bosnian colleagues found out about the so-called safaris in late 1993 and then passed on the information to Italy's Sismi military intelligence in early 1994.The response from Sismi came a couple of months later, he said. They found out that \"safari\" tourists would fly from the northern Italian border city of Trieste and then travel to the hills above Sarajevo.\"We've put a stop to it and there won't be any more safaris,\" the officer was told, according to Ansa news agency. Within two to three months the trips had stopped.Ezio Gavazzeni, who usually writes about terrorism and the mafia, first read about the sniper tours to Sarajevo three decades ago when Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the story, but without firm evidence.He returned to the topic after seeing \"Sarajevo Safari\", a documentary film from 2022 by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic which alleges that those involved in the killings came from several countries, including the US and Russia as well as Italy.Gavazzeni began to dig further and in February handed prosecutors his findings, said to amount to a 17-page file including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.MICHAEL EVSTAFIEV/AFPSnipers would shoot at civilians from areas controlled by the Bosnian Serbs overlooking SarajevoAn investigation in Bosnia itself appears to have stalled.Speaking to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, Gavazzeni alleges that \"many\" took part in the practice, \"at least a hundred\" in all, with Italians paying \"a lot of money\" to do so, up to €100,000 (£88,000) in today's terms.In 1992, late Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov was filmed firing multiple rounds into Sarajevo from a heavy machine gun. He was being given a tour of hillside positions by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide by an international tribunal in the Hague. Limonov didn't pay for his war tourism, though. He was there as an admirer of Karadzic, telling him: \"We Russians should take example from you.\"Italian prosecutors and police are said to have identified a list of witnesses as they try to establish who might have been involved.However, members of the British forces who served in Sarajevo in the 1990s have told the BBC that they never heard of any so-called \"sniper tourism\" during  the Bosnian conflict.They indicated that any attempts to bring in people from third countries who had paid to shoot at civilians in Sarajevo would have been \"logistically difficult to accomplish\", due to the proliferation of checkpoints.British forces served both inside Sarajevo and in the areas surrounding the city, where Serb forces were stationed and they saw nothing at the time to suggest that \"sniper tourism\" was taking place.One soldier described the allegations that foreigners had paid to shoot at civilians as an \"urban myth\".",

    "body": "What we know about new Epstein emails that mention Trump2 hours agoNadine YousifGetty ImagesJeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump (pictured here in 1997) were friends for years, though the US president says he had a falling out with him in the early 2000sUS lawmakers have released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some that mention President Donald Trump.Early on Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email exchanges, including correspondence between Epstein, who died in 2019 in prison, and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.They also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump.Within hours, House Republicans then released a massive tranche of documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents. They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.'Dog that hasn't barked is Trump'The first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell. In it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\". Epstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".Maxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"The victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"virignia\". The White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\". Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.Asked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.Epstein seeks Wolff's opinion on TrumpIn exchanges with Wolff, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office. In a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".Epstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"Wolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"He adds, \"of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"Reuters\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" Wolff said on WednesdayIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump. \"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.A third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.  In it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\". Epstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\". Responding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.'I can't take any more of this' - Andrew emailed Epstein in 2011As well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.He responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.Andrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"Maxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and the then-Prince Andrew.The right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.On 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.White House says Epstein story \"a manufactured hoax\"Mandelson in contact with Epstein in 2016, emails showLord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.They show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016, according to the documents.The latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.An email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2015, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".Lord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".Epstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.Epstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondentGetty ImagesTrump has floated the idea of payments for Americans based on tariff revenueFacing growing public pessimism about his handling of the economy, US President Donald Trump has fired off a flurry of proposals to address consumer concerns.Trump previously downplayed concerns about cost of living, insisting the outlook had improved during his nine months in office. He said affordability was a \"new word\", and a \"con job\" by Democrats.But he has focused on the issue with some urgency since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's off-year elections across a handful of states.He is again proposing an idea to give most Americans a $2,000 (£1,500) \"subsidy\". In reality the payments would operate more like a rebate for federal revenue generated by his tariffs on foreign imports.The rest of the tariff revenue, he has said, would go to reducing the federal budget deficit.According to economists, however, the tariff revenue isn't nearly enough to cover the $2,000 rebate plan, even with the most generous assumptions and a narrow definition of those with incomes to qualify.\"If we take something like a cut-off of $100,000 a year in income, the minimum cost would be about $300bn, which would absorb all of the tariff revenue that's been taken in so far and would require some deficit financing,\" says Erica York, vice-president of tax policy at the non-partisan Tax Foundation.What's more, according to Ms York, the tariff refunds might end up being counterproductive by driving up prices as more money is pushed into the American economy. Covid-era stimulus payments may have created a similar dynamic, albeit in a larger scale.\"It would give large sums of money to households who are more likely to consume that than save it,\" she said. \"So we would have more dollars chasing goods in the economy.\"On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent seemed to downplay the possibility of such payments, saying that the revenue gains from the tariffs would be reflected in lower tax rates paid by Americas next year under the provisions of Trump's 2025 \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" spending package, which Congress passed in July.In last week's elections, when Democrats notched up a string of victories, exit polls indicated the economy once again led all issues as the subject of concern for American voters.Zohran Mamdani made affordability the key to his successful campaign for New York City mayor, as did Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey with their winning runs for governor.The exit poll results match recent opinion surveys that have suggested the public is souring on Trump's handling of the economy and his inability, in their view, to follow through on campaign promises to lower costs for American consumers.Another of Trump's ideas involves promoting 50-year mortgages – an alternative to the 30-year mortgages that are standard for American home purchases. The president has touted the extended payment schedule as a way to make home ownership easier for Americans. Many in his own party, however, view it as a boon for lenders who will collect bigger fees and more interest.\"I don't like 50-year mortgages as the solution to the housing affordability crisis,\" Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on X. \"It will ultimately reward banks, mortgage lenders and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home.\"Trump appears to have floated this idea without consulting senior White House advisers – a reflection of his willingness to move quickly on new ideas, but with the risk of giving his advisers little time to offer input.Trump has also suggested taking government health insurance subsidies that will expire at the end of the year – which Democrats have unsuccessfully fought to extend during the 43-day government shutdown – and turning them into direct cash payments to consumers. During an interview with Fox News, the president said this would allow American consumers to be more like \"entrepreneurs\" and \"go out and negotiate their own insurance\".All of these proposals would likely require congressional implementation, which is far from guaranteed with narrow Republican majorities in both chambers.Trump has broached other, more modest proposals for reducing costs, such as ordering a federal investigation into beef prices and reaching an agreement with pharmaceutical manufacturers to lower the price of obesity drugs for uninsured buyers.\"It feels right now they're just throwing all sorts of ideas out there to test them to see if they sound good,\" says Ms York.Trump's electoral success – his ability to challenge long-held conservative orthodoxy and overcome seemingly formidable public concerns - demonstrate his well-tuned political instincts. When he has sensed vulnerability in the past, he's frequently used his political rallies and public appearances to sound out new ideas and gauge popular support. But this is harder to do from the confines of the Oval Office, which is why the White House is discussing whether he should travel the country to give speeches on the economy, according to CNN.Some of Trump's other actions risk undermining his attempts at recalibrating his policies to reflect a darkening public mood.For instance, Trump continues to insist that prices are dropping. In some cases – such as eggs and dairy products – he's right. But in others – those aforementioned beef, as well as coffee and electricity – costs are on the rise. The president has repeatedly noted that the price of a Thanksgiving meal at Walmart is less than last year. But he doesn't mention that the retail chain's dinner package this season contains half as many items and a smaller turkey.All the while, his administration has fought in court to end food aid during the government shutdown, and the president has relentlessly touted the multi-billion-dollar renovations he's overseeing to the White House.Four years ago, Joe Biden's White House was insisting that the economy was strong even as post-Covid consumer costs spiralled higher. For the next three years of his administration, the Democratic president and his aides pointed to economic indicators and data in vain, as the public's mood remained dark. At 3%, inflation under Trump is still way below the 9.1% rate it peaked at under Biden, which was the worst cost-of-living crunch for decades.Trump effectively exploited this disconnect between the Democratic leadership in Washington and American voters' sentiment during his 2024 presidential campaign.Now, however, Trump finds himself facing similar circumstances, as Republicans seek to avoid a similar fate in the elections to come.Additional reporting by Tom Edgington, BBC VerifyFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "19 hours agoKaty McCloskeySenior producer, Scottish educationBBCRod McCready says he needs extra time to plan lessons betterScotland's teachers are readying themselves to vote on industrial action over their workload and the amount of time they actually spend in front of a class.They say it is almost five years since the SNP's election manifesto promise to cut class contact time by 90 minutes a week to give teachers more time for activities such as lesson preparation and marking.Union bosses say teachers are under unprecedented pressure, suffering from snowballing demands, ever increasing workloads and, in many cases, burnout.The situation is not new but teachers have told the BBC it is getting worse, particularly due to an increase in children with additional support needs.Scotland's largest union, the EIS, begins its postal ballot on Wednesday, while the NASUWT will begin its vote from 19 November. The SSTA is expected to ballot members soon.What would teachers do with an extra 90 minutes?Most teachers will not speak to the media on the record over concerns that their contracts won't allow it.However, the BBC has spoken to a number of teachers who are also union reps.Rod McCready is an NASUWT rep and physics teacher in Glasgow who has been teaching more than 20 years.He says that, for his subject, marking is easier than for others but he needs extra time to plan lessons better.\"Physics can be a complicated topic,\" he says.\"You need half a dozen ways to help explain something and you are waiting for one of those ways to click with a kid, to pursue that.\"He says not everyone is suited to the classroom.\"There was a teacher last year who chucked it after three weeks, it was too difficult,\" he says.\"I was lucky I landed in a good school. In my job as a union rep, I hear about violence and aggression in the classroom, the pressure it's causing is unbelievable.\"If you get pushed against a wall, that's 20 minutes to 40 minutes just to fill in the paperwork.\"Derrick Roberts says he finds himself doing work at home most eveningsDerrick Roberts, who teaches history in the Lochaber area, says he would spend the extra hour-and-a-half from cutting contact time on adapting lessons for children with additional needs.He says he currently finds himself doing work at home most evenings.\"Sometimes I'm rushing lessons in the evening and at the weekends trying to get things done,\" he says.\"The 90 minutes would allow me to adapt materials – changing the resources so they fit in the right place. \"I've got my bank of resources but I don't have sufficient time to adapt them.\"Mr Roberts says he felt less pressured when he first came to Scotland 13 years ago.\"We were expected to do less of the non-teaching stuff,\" he says. \"We weren't being chased for every piece of data, we didn't need to know three or four things about every pupil.\"He says that when he came to Scotland teachers would not normally be hitting the 22.5 hour limit for contact time and would often have one or two periods a week where they could catch up.Now he says there is a recruitment and retention crisis, not enough supply teachers, more posts unfilled and more \"please takes\", where teachers are asked to fill in for colleague.He says more staff are now teaching up to the current limit of 22.5 hours.\"An extra 90 minutes a week would allow a wee buffer zone,\" he says.Carol Wood says she would use her extra time to get on top of paperworkCarol Wood is an ASN (additional support needs) teacher in a specialised unit within a mainstream secondary school in Moray. She says she would use her extra time to get on top of the paperwork which comes with the job.\"There is a lot of admin in ASN,\" she says. \"There's learning support plans, learner plans, individual education plans.\"You need to go and observe kids, then write a STAR report. \"The extra time would support much more effective understanding of these pupils which would help mainstream colleagues understand them better.\"Ms Wood says she would also like to do more training.\"I'd go look at webinars to see the latest research,\" she says. \"It's all moving so fast at the moment with the neurodivergent discovery journey and just having that time to digest the new materials and processes would be great.\"According to Ms Wood, she has children in secondary school whose development is similar to primary level. She says she can take hours tailoring worksheets to their needs only for it to occupy a pupil for 20 minutes.\"Every child in my class, every single one is different, has a different need or take,\" she says. Alison Beattie says she would use the extra time for paperwork and talking to colleagues about support needsAlison Beattie works in \"support for learning\" within a mainstream primary school in Glasgow.She takes children out of the classroom to help them with their learning, either one- to-one or in groups.\"If I got the extra time, I'd spend it on paperwork and talking to colleagues about support needs,\" she says.Alison says the number of children in her primary school with additional support needs has rocketed from 11% two years ago to 60% in May this year.She says she can see that figure reflected in how things have changed.\"That figure is realistic,\" she says.\"That's my experience, that's the needs that are presenting in front of us.\"Maybe a few years ago it perhaps wasn't as urgent, it would have been nice to have 90 minutes then, but it's urgent now.\"Alison says there is a range of needs within her school.\"We've got kids with dyslexia, dyscalculia, autism, ADHD, attachment needs,\" she says.\"There's also children with a large range of ability. In one classroom you could be teaching different levels. \"In P5, P6 and P7, you'll now be teaching kids at P1 level as well as P5 level and you are expected to have lessons that meet all of those needs.\"Teacher numbers down on 2021In 2021, the SNP pledged to increase teacher numbers by 3,500 over the course of the parliamentary term, which unions said was vital in meeting the commitment to deliver an extra 90 minutes of non-teaching time per week.Back then, there were 54,285 teachers in Scotland. Last year, the figure stood at 53,412.First Minister John Swinney has pledged to get numbers back to 2023 levels – 54,033 – so all eyes will be on the annual teacher census statistics when they are released next month.Education experts point out that schools need more staff but they also need to be in the right place in order to provide cover for colleagues using their additional non-contact time.There are also long-standing challenges with filling teaching posts in some rural areas and in some secondary specialisms.Teachers are currently allocated seven-and-a-half hours a week of preparation time.In the end, it is councils who employ teachers and therefore control the numbers.The Scottish government only has so many levers it can apply to force councils to hire more staff.Additional funding requiredA spokesperson for Cosla, the group that represents local authorities, said it was disappointed that the teaching unions were progressing their consultative ballots.They said there were practical issues with the delivery of the reduction in class contact time and it would require additional funding to support such a major change. A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Ministers have been clear that reducing class contact will help support the time and space necessary for teachers, to allow them to drive improvement and reform in our schools and improve outcomes for their pupils.\"We are committed to working with teaching unions and Cosla to agree our approach to delivering a reduction in class contact time at pace.\"Ministers respect union members' right to withdraw their labour, but are disappointed that the EIS has taken this action while these constructive discussions are ongoing.\"",

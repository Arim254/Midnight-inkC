From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

As a result, no-one will be eliminated in a dance-off on this week's show, with the votes being carried over. La Voix is the alter ego of Chris Dennis, who said ahead of the series that he wanted viewers to get to know the man behind the drag act.The character became a fan favourite last year while finishing as a finalist on RuPaul's Drag Race UK.Exact details of the injury were not revealed. \"My spirit wanted to keep dancing but my foot has other ideas,\" La Voix said in her Instagram post. She added: \"Due to an injury, I've been advised that I'm unable to perform.\"In recent weeks, Strictly viewers have seen La Voix and Škorjanec jive, waltz and foxtrot around the Strictly dancefloor.Last month, actor and Neighbours star Stefan Dennis withdrew from Strictly because of injury while in September, TV personality Dani Dyer pulled out before the show got under way after breaking her ankle. She was replaced by actress Amber Davies.",

    "body": "6 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondent Rail fares in England next year are to be frozen for the first time in 30 years, the government has announced.The freeze until March 2027 will apply to regulated fares, which includes season tickets and off-peak returns.The most recent fare rise, in March 2025, was 4.6%.Rail fares traditionally have gone up in January, based on the July rate of the retail price index (RPI) + 1% -  although this formula has not always been followed.The announcement comes days before the chancellor sets out the government's financial plans in the Budget, amid a focus on the cost of living.  The government also said the move is intended to \"directly limit inflation\" by holding down \"a major component of everyday costs\".Since 2021, the annual increase has come in March instead of January.A government source acknowledged it was possible unregulated fares would still rise, but insisted they usually followed regulated fares.Unregulated fares increased by 5.5% in the year to March 2025, 1.1% above regulated fares - with a total increase in rail fares of 5.1% in that period. The Rail Delivery Group, a representative body made up of the UK's rail operators, said the freeze would be \"good news for customers\".\"We want our railways to thrive, that's why we're committed to working with government to ensure upcoming railway reforms deliver real benefits for customers,\" a spokesperson said. Since 1996, the government has regulated some train fares following the privatisation of British Rail. The freeze marks the first point since then that fares will have been frozen, although there have been periods where price increases were below RPI, and a dip in prices following the financial crash in 2010. About 45% of rail fares are regulated by the government in England, Wales and Scotland - but the freeze only relates to travel in England. The announcement also only applies to services run by England-based train operating companies.Regulated fares include season tickets covering most commuter routes, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and flexible tickets for travel in and around major cities.Train operators are free to set prices for unregulated fares, but they typically rise by similar amounts.The government estimates that the move will save commuters on more expensive routes more than £300.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the freeze was being put in place to help ease cost of living pressures, and make \"travelling to work, school or to visit friends and family that bit easier\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said it was part of \"wider plans to rebuild Great British Railways\".Great British Railways is a public body which is in the process of being set up, and is part of the government's plans to bring parts of the railway system into public ownership. The government has said it will take over the running and management of the tracks and trains, \"ending years of fragmentation, driving up standards for passengers, and making journey easier and better value for money\".The government has said part of its plans for the new body is to \"gradually move away from annual blanket increases\".Labour said passengers had faced \"relentless\" fare increases every year under the previous Tory government. However, shadow transport secretary Richard Holden said: \"In government, the Conservatives kept fares on the right track with below-inflation rises and consistently called for no further hikes to protect hard-working commuters.\"",

    "body": "5 days agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesUS film superstar Tom Cruise has received his first ever Oscar statuette.Cruise, 63, accepted an honorary Oscar at the annual Governors Awards in Hollywood alongside singer-philanthropist Dolly Parton, choreographer Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas.\"Making films is not what I do, it is who I am,\" the four-fold Oscar nominee said on Sunday, accompanying his long-awaited Academy Awards honour with an acceptance speech about his love of cinema.The Top Gun and Mission: Impossible actor paid tribute to film-makers in front of and behind the lens, those he has worked with during his 45-year career, as well as the power of the movies.Upon taking the stage, Cruise received a minutes-long standing ovation and raucous round of applause from film luminaries in the audience, including Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jerry Bruckheimer.Film-maker Alejandro G Iñárritu, who is directing an upcoming Cruise film, presented the actor with the Governors Award. \"The cinema, it takes me around the world,\" Cruise said in his speech. \"It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "3 days agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

    "body": "Mum of two left penniless by Tinder scammer3 hours agoCatriona MacPheeBBC DisclosurePolice ScotlandChristopher Harkins was jailed for 12 yearsA mother of two says she was left penniless after giving her savings to Tinder predator Christopher Harkins in a fake investment scam.The pair matched on the dating app in London in 2020. Caitlyn - not her real name - told how the fraudster and rapist initially tried to talk her into going on holiday with him - a regular ruse of Harkins, now 38.When she said she couldn't afford a holiday, he offered to \"help\" by doubling what money she had via his foreign currency exchange business.She's one of four women the BBC is aware of who were targeted by Harkins in the capital - where he fled to after his crimes were exposed in Scotland.Caitlyn is one of half a dozen women who shared their traumatic, and often bizarre, experiences with one of Scotland's most prolific romance fraudsters in new BBC Disclosure podcast: Matched with a Predator.Introducing Matched With A PredatorShe said: \"At the start I thought he was very gentlemanly. He was being flash with money.\"He was telling me his business was doing very well and making lots of money. He said he could help me to raise money.\"Harkins used the fake name Christopher Telfer when speaking to Caitlyn, who had recently split from the father of her two young children.She sent him £3,132 in total. \"This money was so precious to me,\" she said.\"I felt very vulnerable at the time because of my situation and he kept offering to invest my money and make more from it. I was naïve. He said to me that whatever money I had, I could send it to him. He wanted to help me.\"When Caitlyn began asking for the money back, Harkins told her his bank account had been frozen. He insisted she had to give him more, in order to get the initial investment back.Caitlyn said: \"I was getting very nervous by now. I had given him all the money I had. \"I was very stressed and worried. He was constantly asking for more money but I didn't have any. He kept saying I could take out bank loans and overdrafts.\"Over text message, Caitlyn asked Harkins to prove the investment wasn't a scam. This suggestion seemed to trigger him.\"He got super angry. He said, 'Don't speak to me like that, you're going to regret speaking to me like that'.\"I was very scared of him at that point. After I refused to send any more, he got very aggressive.\"InstagramHarkins was jailed in in July 2024At one point, Caitlyn's home situation became very difficult. \"I was desperate,\" she said.\"I said to him, 'I'm begging you, I'm really having a difficult time, I have two children, I'm not working'. I was saying, 'Even £200, even £300, just a little bit', but he didn't reply. He completely ignored me.\"Harkins blocked Caitlyn's number. She says she was too scared to report him to the police. She never got a penny back.\"Afterwards I just felt so stupid,\" she said.\"I couldn't even tell anyone for a while. I was so embarrassed. It was a nightmare. Only one friend knew. It was a very horrible time in my life.\"Harkins was first arrested and appeared in court in January 2020This pattern of behaviour was typical of Harkins, who the BBC understands targeted at least 30 women in a raft of crimes spanning almost a decade. He used dating sites such as Tinder to seek new victims.Harkins is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for crimes against 10 women in Scotland, including rape, assaults, recording intimate videos without consent and defrauding more than £214,000 from women he met online.On his dating profile, Harkins presented himself as a jet-setting, business-owning \"gym rat\", but in reality he was a prolific and predatory fraudster.His scams included pretending to book romantic holidays and asking for money for his business because his bank account was frozen.In other cases he pressured women to take out loans of up to £12,000 to give to him. He also used their identities to take out loans himself. One woman was forced into bankruptcy while others spent years paying off debts, suffering mental health issues as a result.Many of the women targeted by Harkin were too ashamed to tell family and friends of their ordeals.After being exposed in a newspaper and arrested in Scotland in early 2020, Harkins fled to London and began using a fake name.The BBC understands Harkins spent time in London throughout his life as his father lived there.Despite the legal threat hanging over him, Harkins continued his scams in England.In January 2023 he was jailed at Isleworth Crown Court for a separate fraud after conning £16,700 from another woman.The BBC's investigation uncovered further alleged frauds by Harkins of almost £70,000. The BBC wrote to Harkins in prison to ask about these allegations. He did not reply.Caitlyn learned about Harkins' other crimes after reading a BBC article in January. It was an emotional moment, realising for the first time that he had targeted other women too.She added: \"I shared it with my friend group and finally told them all what had happened.\"I've decided to report him to the police.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article you can find details of support on the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBen ChuPolicy and analysis correspondent, BBC VerifyGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget is expected to justify tax increases as a vital measure to keep the UK's national debt under control.Some have argued keeping the national debt down protects the financial interests of younger people. That's because if the country's debt went up drastically, it is younger people who would have to foot the bill to pay for the interest on it. And it would be taken directly from their payslips through higher taxes.Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, have been hit in the pocket over the past 15 years by benefit cuts and dramatic increases in university tuition fees. Meanwhile, the homeownership rate of those born since the 1990s is well below that of earlier generations, due to the relative difficulty they have faced in getting on the housing ladder.However, most politicians, including the chancellor, are also committing to keep paying for the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees it rises each year by the highest of average wages, inflation or 2.5%.There's growing concern that current tax and spending policies help pensioners but are unfair on younger generations, and that the triple lock in particular will push up public spending and the national debt in the long term.So will this budget really help younger generations? Or could it help saddle them with higher taxes and more debt?BBC Verify has been looking at the numbers.Why is the national debt a concern?The UK's national debt currently stands at just under 100% of UK GDP, which is the value of all the goods and services produced by the economy in a year.The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned it could rise above 250% over the next 50 years unless taxes are raised or public spending is reduced.Some economists doubt such a steep and sustained debt surge would actually materialise, arguing it would likely trigger a bond market crisis long before then and see UK government borrowing costs pushed to extreme levels by private investors, which would instead force a change in tax policy or spending.Yet the OBR says the purpose of its long-term projection is to highlight that the UK's public finances are currently on what it calls an \"unsustainable\" trajectory.The biggest driver of rising long-term spending, and therefore the increase in the national debt according to the OBR, is our ageing population, which means the government needs to spend more money on the NHS, social care and the state pension each year.The number of people over 65 is projected to rise from 13 million to 22 million over the next five decades. That would push up the old age dependency ratio - the proportion of older people over the age of 65 relative to people aged 16 to 64 - from around 30% today to almost 50% by 2070.Today the state pension age is 66, but for people born after 1990 it's likely to be pushed higher to keep people working longer and reduce the old-age dependancy ratio.Even so, the national debt would still likely increase significantly from today's level because of these old age spending pressures.Do younger people lose out on public spending decisions?Since 2010, government policy on benefits has tended to help older generations and to take money away from younger generations.Over the past 15 years, the over 65s have received on average an extra £900 a year, while those under 65 have lost an average of £1,400 a year, according to calculations by the Resolution Foundation think tank.The driving force behind this has been the value of the state pension increasing faster than average wages since 2010 because of the triple lock, alongside government cuts to working-age benefits, including housing benefits, unemployment benefits and universal credit.The OBR projects that the triple lock will continue to push up state pension spending further in the coming decades.If the state pension were only tied to increases in average wages then its share of GDP would only rise from 5% today to 6% in 2070, according to the OBR. But instead it projects the cost of the triple lock will push government spending on the state pension to nearly 8% over the next 45 years.That might only be two extra percentage points, but it equates to around £60bn in today's money, and it would be younger working age people who would have to pay for it through their taxes.Which generations will benefit and lose from the Budget?The impact on different age groups will depend on which taxes increase and which benefits are protected.For instance, if high value homes were to face extra taxes, it would affect older people more as they tend to have greater property wealth.If you look at earnings, pensioners still have to pay income tax but are no longer subject to employee National Insurance.And younger people are deemed to have been hit harder by the increase in employer National Insurance contributions Rachel Reeves introduced in her first budget in October 2024, which appears to have slowed down job hiring rates.All taxpayers have a shared interest in seeing the debt burden brought under control as a share of the size of the economy. Though one of the reasons the government borrows is to pay for investment in infrastructure such as roads and housing. Some economists warn that if ministers reduced that kind of spending and borrowing out of concern over the national debt it could prove counterproductive and ultimately damaging to younger people.As for the triple lock, younger people could benefit from its continuation when they eventually retire themselves - and polling shows that 18-49 year olds are broadly in favour of keeping the policy.Nevertheless, in the context of the past 15 years, many economists argue younger people also have an interest in seeing a rebalancing of the treatment of older and younger generations through the tax and benefit system.",

    "body": "6 hours agoGeorgia Roberts,Political correspondent and Patrick JacksonThe government is expected to announce an extra £1.3bn in funding for a scheme encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) at next week's Budget. The Electric Car Grant scheme started in July as part of the move to zero emission vehicles. The government says it has helped 35,000 switch to EVs.However, early research suggests there is little indication the scheme has attracted entirely new buyers. There will also be money to create more charging points, and a consultation on helping people without driveways to charge their cars. It is also possible EV owners could face a new tax elsewhere in Wednesday's Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge in future.All new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force.The Electric Car Grant scheme, which provides a discount of up to £3,750 on eligible vehicles, was launched with an initial fund of £650m.New AutoMotive, a non-profit organisation supporting the UK's transition to electric vehicles, found in a recent study that the scheme had yet to expand the market for EVs.EVs covered by the scheme made up 23.8% of new registrations in September, the same as their share before the Electric Car Grant was announced, New Automotive said.\"It isn't yet clear that it's prompting consumers to consider buying cars that they wouldn't have gone ahead and bought anyway,\" David Farrar, policy manager for New AutoMotive, said at the time.The Budget is also expected to announce a further £200m for speeding up the rollout of chargepoints across the UK.Data from Zapmap shows almost 87,000 points across the UK, in about 44,000 locations. Those include places like supermarket car parks and lamppost chargers.\"The proposed funding will support the creation of thousands of chargepoints and provide extra resources for local authorities to ramp up charging infrastructure on local streets - making it easier for everyone to access reliable charging, including those without off-street parking,\" the government said.Chancellor Rachel Reeves, it added, was \"expected to publish a consultation on Permitted Development Rights to make it easier and cheaper for people without a driveway to charge\".However, it is also possible that EV owners could face a new tax in the Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge from 2028. A government spokesperson told the BBC earlier this month: \"Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there's no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers.\"Reeves is being urged not to raise taxes on drivers overall, with campaigners preparing to deliver a petition to Downing Street early next week which calls for fuel duty, long frozen, not to be increased.Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said that \"handing out £1.5 billion in EV subsidies while hard-working taxpayers are squeezed dry\" was \"madness\".\"Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the Government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,\" the Conservative MP said.  Reeves is expected to increase some taxes in the Budget after saying she means to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.",

    "body": "8 hours agoPamela BilalovaNorth East and CumbriaPA MediaThe first sapling was planted at The Tree Sanctuary in CoventryThe first saplings grown from the illegally felled Sycamore Gap tree have been planted.Two saplings were installed in Coventry and Staffordshire, with others set to be planted in Berkshire, Cambridge and Strabane, County Tyrone, the National Trust said.More plantings will take place in Hexham, Leeds and Sunderland next week.It is part of the charity's Trees of Hope initiative, which received nearly 500 applications for the 49 saplings grown from seeds rescued from the tree, which stood in a dip next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland until two men cut it down in September 2023.Daniel Michael Graham 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, both from Cumbria, were jailed for four years and three months in July after being convicted of criminal damage.Hilary McGrady, director general of the National Trust, said the saplings would become an inspiration and home for nature, but also a reminder that \"there are always good things worth fighting for, even after something so senseless\".Where will the saplings go?There are 49 saplings in total, one for each foot of the old tree's height.More than half of those will be planted over the course of National Tree Week between 22 and 30 November. The first places to plant their trees were The Tree Sanctuary in Coventry, where three teenagers set up a project to rescue their city's trees, and a site commemorating the Minnie Pit mining disaster in Staffordshire.Saplings will also go to Greenham Common in Berkshire, Lisnafin Community Centre in Strabane and Coton Loves Pollinators in Cambridge.First Sycamore Gap Tree saplings plantedAhead of the event, co-founder of The Tree Sanctuary, Martina Irwin, said planting the sapling would be really special.\"We've chosen to plant it among some other 'saved' trees that we have planted on Sowe Common, serving as a beacon to inspire respect, understanding and a sense of responsibility toward all trees,\" she said.The second sapling was installed at a site commemorating the Minnie Pit mining disaster in Staffordshire'First shoots'Next week, saplings will take root at The Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease at Seacroft Hospital in Leeds, Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland and the charity Veterans in Crisis in Sunderland.Early in December, an additional sapling which was given to the school closest to the Sycamore Gap, Henshaw Church of England Primary, will be planted in its grounds. Another 15 saplings will be housed in each of the UK's National Parks, including Northumberland National Park where the tree stood, in early 2026.John MillarThe Sycamore Gap tree was illegally felled in 2023Andrew Poad, general manager for the National Trust's Hadrian Wall properties, said: \"It's incredible to think that this weekend the first 'offspring' of this very famous tree will be planted.\"It feels like just yesterday that those tentative first shoots appeared.\"He added he hoped the saplings would touch many people's lives \"just like the original tree\".The very first sapling grown from the Sycamore Gap tree was gifted to King Charles III last summer and this will be planted for the nation at a later date, the National Trust said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "4 hours agoOlga Prosvirova & Zlata OnufrievaBBC News RussianAishat Baimuradova/Getty/BBCAishat told her friends she had been raised in a strictly religious familyWhen 23-year-old Aishat Baimuradova fled her home last year, she believed she finally had a chance to live the way she wanted.Coming from Chechnya, a conservative Muslim republic in Russia, she cut her hair short, stopped covering her head, shaved off part of her eyebrow and posted quirky selfies on Instagram.She told her new friends she could finally breathe.In October, Aishat was found dead in a rented flat in neighbouring Armenia. Police say she was murdered.Two people were seen leaving the building where she was found, including a woman Aishat had befriended not long before her death. Both reportedly left for Russia soon afterwards.Russians do not need a passport to enter Armenia; their internal ID is enough. That also makes it an easy route for anyone trying to flee.Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus, is often described by rights groups as a state within a state - a place where power is highly personalised and loyalty to long-standing leader Ramzan Kadyrov often over-rides laws and formal institutions.For years, human rights organisations have documented enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings in the republic, as well as systematic persecution of those who dissent.Chechen officials have consistently denied these allegations, complaining of fabrications aimed at discrediting the region.Aishat Baimuradova/InstagramHer friends say Aishat was a very open person seeking connection with peopleSeveral high-profile critics of Chechen authorities have been killed abroad.In 2009, Umar Israilov, a former bodyguard of Ramzan Kadyrov, was shot dead in Vienna, where he had sought asylum. Austrian authorities called the assassination politically motivated and linked the killers to Chechnya.Former Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, in an attack blamed on Russian security services.But Aishat Baimuradova is the first known Chechen woman to have died in suspicious circumstances, not long after fleeing Russia.Like many other women who escape the region, she had complained of being controlled by her family. She said she was forced into a marriage, monitored, and barred from leaving home or using her phone. The BBC was not able to reach her family for a comment.Aishat arrived in Armenia at the end of 2024 with the help of SK-SOS, a crisis group that helps people facing danger in the North Caucasus. She had complained openly of conservative gender rules and the suffocating control women face in Chechnya.At first, she worked in a small town, then moved to the capital, Yerevan, hoping for a better job and more opportunities.To many who flee, such visibility is unthinkable. Most use false names, avoid showing their faces, and refuse to meet new people. Aishat chose a different path. \"She really wanted a normal life,\" her friend who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC. \"And she wanted to trust people.\"ReutersRamzan Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya since 2007. Critics accuse him of turning the Russian republic into a state within a stateHer family tried to persuade her to come back, but when nothing came of it they disowned her, according to SK SOS.\"They said to her: 'You are no longer our daughter or our wife. We won't touch you - just don't touch us,\" Alexandra Miroshnikova, spokesperson for SK SOS, told the BBC.Her uncle told local media the family had no involvement in her death.On the night of her death, Aishat was with a woman she had recently met online, who claimed to come from Dagestan, another Russian republic in the North Caucasus.People who knew Aishat told the BBC it was the woman who had first made contact with her on social media, later coming to Armenia and inviting her to parties.A man captured with her on CCTV as they left the building where Aishat's body was found was reported by a popular Russian Telegram channel to be of Chechen origin. Investigative outlet Agentstvo identified him as a relative of a businessman close to Ramzan Kadyrov.Chechen authorities deny any connection to Baimuradova's death, condemning such suggestions as a \"terrorist information attack\". Officials have also criticised groups assisting women who flee, accusing them of \"destroying family traditions\".VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty ImagesChechen women who have sought refuge in Europe often avoid communicating with the diasporaArmenian authorities say they are investigating two unnamed people in connection with Aishat Baimuradova's murder, but they have released no further details about them.Ramzan Kadyrov is sensitive to people criticising Chechnya from abroad, says Michael Dennis, an expert on Chechen politics at the University of Texas.\"The very existence of a diaspora is a clear signal to the entire world that something is wrong in Chechnya. It's a matter of personal pride and political image,\" Mr Dennis told the BBC.Since the early 2000s, asylum seekers from Chechnya have been coming to Europe - fleeing first the war and later Kadyrov's repressive rule.But changes to EU migration policy, followed by visa restrictions for Russians because of the war in Ukraine, have all but closed that route.That leaves the South Caucasus, where Russians can travel visa-free, as the easiest escape route, but far from the safest.In July, another escapee, 24-year-old Laura Avtorkhanova, was found in a shelter in Georgia by a group of male relatives who reportedly tried to coerce her into returning to Russia. After being questioned by police she was able to stay safely in Georgia.For other Chechen women who have fled, Aishat's death has reinvigorated a fear that has haunted them since they left Russia.Several have told the BBC how even before her murder they had steered clear of community events, avoided speaking Chechen in public and restricted their social media presence. Now they worry it may not be enough to hide from those who may want to punish them.\"The fear I've lived with all my life - embedded in my DNA - has reawakened with renewed vigour,\" said one escapee living in Western Europe, who asked to hide her name and precise location.\"It's like sleep paralysis: a monster appears, and I lie there frozen, staring into its eyes. It's the fear of being killed.\"\"You can escape,\" she said, \"but you never really feel free.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoA majority of Sunday's papers feature comments from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer about US politicians wanting to question Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor over his links to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Sir Keir's suggestion that Andrew should give evidence echoes one he made earlier this month, it nonetheless \"adds to pressure on the disgraced royal\", Sunday People reports.  The Sun on Sunday's story adds that Metropolitan Police officers are searching for emails related to claims Andrew asked royal protection officers to find information on Virginia Giuffre. The prominent accuser of Epstein alleged Andrew had sex with her as a teenager - something the former prince denied. Sir Keir has \"heaped pressure\" on Andrew to testify in the US, is the Daily Mail's assessment. Sir Keir - who was asked about the former prince while attending the G20 summit - told reporters it was \"a decision for him\". But, he added, \"my general position is if you have relevant information you should be prepared to share it\". The prime minister's comments about Andrew also feature on the front page of the Sunday Times, but the paper leads with preparations by the chancellor to \"end the two-child benefit cap\" in her upcoming Budget. Writing in the paper, Rachel Reeves says \"fiscal restraint is a Labour value and necessary to curb inflation\". An exclusive interview with Reeves is the lead for the Sunday Mirror, in which she says \"helping families is her top priority\" at Wednesday's Budget. In the interview, Reeves promises to \"tackle the cost-of-living crisis\", \"cut NHS waiting lists\" and \"reduce the national debt\". Green Party leader Zack Polanski's \"hopes for Britain\" lead this week's Observer. Polanski tells the paper in his vision for a \"green land\", the UK would \"leave Nato\", \"tax the rich\" and \"welcome migrants\". The Sunday Telegraph reports on US President Donald Trump saying a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, after Ukrainian allies voiced concerns over proposals. A large image, alongside the article, shows Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife Olena outside a cathedral in the Ukrainian capital.In other news, defence chiefs are considering a greater use of \"fat jabs\" in the military, the Sunday Express reports. Fighter pilots face strict weight limits so they can safely eject from aircraft - and obesity is becoming \"common\", according to RAF medical professionals. The Daily Star's main story is about crime - specifically, the number of people sent to jail for shoplifting being \"at its highest level in years\". \"More must be done to end the epidemic\", according to experts cited in the paper, which notes that more than 12,000 thieves were jailed last year. Finally, the Independent reports that the prime minister backs the paper's campaign to raise money for the SafeCall service to help missing children. Related Internet Links",

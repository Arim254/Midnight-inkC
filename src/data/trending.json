    "body": "17 minutes agoDearbail JordanState Emergency Service of UkraineRussia launched drone and missile attacks on Ukraine overnight, killing one person and injuring 23 others despite taking part in talks with the US aimed at ending the war.The mayor of Ukrainian capital Kyiv said one person had died and four had been wounded following a \"massive enemy attack\", while Kharkiv's mayor reported that 19 people had been hurt during a sustained assault on the city.Delegations from Russia, Ukraine and the US have been meeting in Abu Dhabi in the first trilateral talks since the Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022. A source has told the BBC that some progress had been made but the key issue of territory remains unresolved.Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over large areas of the territory. Ukraine has ruled this out.As the three-way talks in Abu Dhabi enter a second day, Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three of the four people who had been injured had been hospitalised.He added that the capital's critical infrastructure had been damaged which had left 6,000 buildings without heating.Temperatures in Ukraine are at sub-zero levels and in a statement following the assaults, President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \"The main target of the Russians was the energy infrastructure.\"In Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said 19 people had been injured during the strikes in the early hours of Saturday morning. A maternity hospital and a hostel for displaced people were damaged.More from the BBC",

So we were in a little convoy of blown tyres.\"It was actually a moment when I thought we're not going to make it to the finish,\" she said.Luckily, the Germans had large equipment so they could change the Land Rover's tyres and helped make sure Kirk and Tait-Wright were on the final stretch to the finish line.A.S.O./Aurélien VialatteKirk and Tait-Wright had to drive through a range of terrains, including sand dunes\"They helped us get back on our way, we set off but we still had 80 kilometres to do without any spares.\"The worry was then if we blew another tyre, that was it. That was our Dakar over,\" Kirk said.However, the pair managed to get to the end without further issues despite not having spare tyres and the \"steering being out\".\"A lot of people thought we wouldn't get here. \"It's been awesome, all the support has just been out of this world. \"All the messages kept us going and it gave us a big push to the end,\" said Kirk.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Home bakery helps mum cope with 'timebomb illness'5 days agoJim Scottin Hetton-le-HoleBBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson said she had been inundated with support for her cake shedA mother who described her inoperable brain condition as a \"ticking timebomb\" said opening an \"honest\" bakery in a shed at her home was helping her to cope.Megan Jackson, from Hetton-le-Hole, Sunderland, bakes and displays her own treats with an honesty box, which trusts customers to pay the correct amount of money while unattended.The registered nurse, who is on maternity leave after having her son Albie, was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm - a swollen blood vessel - after suffering extreme headaches.She said baking was her \"coping mechanism\" and she was touched that hundreds of people had visited her shed. Megan was warned by doctors that stress can increase the risk of stroke, which prompted her to take up baking.\"I started making little boxes [of food] for people, which went crazy, started making a little bit more, and it hasn't stopped,\" she said.While being unable to work, she came up with the idea as a way to potentially support her family if she cannot return to her job.Since then, hundreds of people have visited the shed. Megan said she was working round the clock to bake and had been surprised by the support.BBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson has been supported by husband Liam with the project She said the venture was a needed distraction after suffering poor mental health following her diagnosis in March, last year.As well as severe headaches, medics noticed one pupil was larger than the other, prompting a brain scan which revealed a 5mm-wide aneurysm.It poses a risk of rupturing and she has been told that, because of its size, it is too risky to operate.Megan said she and her husband Liam had cried when she got the diagnosis and her first thought had been who would look after her toddler \"if I die\". She manages the condition through baking and daily prescription medications, but is often left with confusion and fatigue.Baking brings her \"total peace\" and she said she spent time in the kitchen \"cracking on\". \"It just feels I haven't got the worry of the stress of the aneurysm. I totally shut off and my mind is focused,\" she added. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCFor the Guardian and several of today's papers, US President Donald Trump's \"insult\" to Nato troops is in the lead. British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has rebuked the president's comments that Nato troops stayed off the front lines in Afghanistan as \"frankly appalling\". But now, his comment \"risks a further diplomatic rupture with the White House\", the paper writes.The Daily Mirror demands an apology from Trump with \"say sorry\" for the headline after his \"insult to fallen Brit heroes\". Both injured veterans and Prince Harry \"slam\" the president, it says.The Independent echoes the Miror with Starmer's call for Trump to apologise for the \"appalling slur on our war dead\". The paper honours the personnel killed in the fighting with photos of some of the 457.The Daily Express calls Donald Trump a \"bloody cheek\" after his Nato comments. \"Donald, there are 457 tragic reasons why you are so wrong\", it says with its front splashed with a convoy of hearses that carried the coffins of British troops killed in Afghanistan.\"Now Trump delays Chagos surrender\" headlines the Daily Mail. The legislation, which was due to be debated in the House of Lords on Monday, would see the archipelago handed to Mauritius, with the UK leasing a military base for £101m a year. But the debate has been pulled \"just days\" after the president \"blasted the UK for 'an act of great stupidity',\" it writes, saying the move raises \"hope of 15th U-turn\".The Daily Telegraph says UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been \"forced\" to pull the Chagos Islands bill following \"US backlash over the deal\". Also on its front, \"genetic tests for cancer coming on the NHS\".The Sun has the latest on Brooklyn Beckham and his famous family. In an exclusive, the paper says his wife Nicola Peltz told him \"it's me or her, you can't have both\" after \"feeling upstaged by his mum Victoria at their wedding\".Young people with \"normal\" mental health conditions are being \"written off\", the author of a review into Neets - young people not in education, employment or training -  has said. Former Labour cabinet minister Alan Milburn told the Times the UK is facing a \"lost generation\" of 16-24 year olds as a result.The price of gold has surged after \"Trump's Greenland moves batter dollar\", writes the Financial Times. Closer to home, a \"handful of super-rich patrons\" have been buying Britain's \"struggling\" village pubs - including the Rothschild family.The Daily Star hints at a big reveal for the Traitors season finale with \"Claudia's Traitors secret\". But instead reveals the \"tv host's behind-the-scenes tan trick\". A plot against Starmer and Streeting tops The i Paper, as it says \"key figures\" in the Labour party support Andy Burnham's return to the House of Commons as expectation mounts that he will challenge the PM for leadership. Those on the left of the party \"fear a 'Wes Streeting coronation',\" it writes.The Daily Telegraph leads on the delayed House of Lords debate on the Chagos deal. The paper notes the Conservatives' warning that the deal would violate a 60-year treaty with the US, and that both countries have been in talks since late last year about updating the agreement. The Daily Mail also leads on the story; it says the decision raises hope of the government's fifteenth U-turn.The reaction to US President Donald Trump claiming Nato troops stayed away from the front line in Afghanistan is the main story in The Daily Mirror. \"Say sorry\" reads its headline. The Daily Express says there are \"457 tragic reasons\" why Trump is wrong, in reference to the number of British military personnel killed in the conflict.The Times's front page carries a warning from the government's work tsar, Alan Milburn, who says a generation of young people with what he calls \"normal\" mental health conditions are being written off work for a life on benefits. Speaking to the paper, Milburn said the nearly one million young people out of work, education or training was a \"moral crisis\".The i Paper leads on the potential return of Labour's Andy Burnham to Parliament. The paper describes the Greater Manchester mayor as the prime minister's \"rival\" because he's expected to launch a leadership challenge if he were to become an MP by winning the Gorton and Denton by-election. The report notes that Labour's far left fears the Health Secretary Wes Streeting, would be most likely to challenge Sir Keir Starmer's leadership if Burnham doesn't return to Parliament.Confusion about the future of Greenland led to a surge in gold prices, according to the Financial Times. Its report says the metal is set for its best week in almost two decades, after investors rushed to safe alternatives to the dollar because of concerns over what it calls \"erratic US policymaking\".The Sun says Brooklyn Beckham's wife Nicola Peltz gave him an ultimatum after feeling upstaged by his mother, Victoria, at their wedding. \"It's her or me\" reads its headline.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "3 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandHarry SekulichA young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.\"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away,\" his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.\"Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,\" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.",

    "body": "Every police officer in England and Wales will be required to hold a licence to be able to continue working, the Home Office has said. They will have to prove they have the right skills in issues such as tackling violence against women and girls or face being removed from their job, under the terms of a phased scheme similar to ones for lawyers or doctors. Under separate proposals announced on Friday, ministers will be granted new powers to dismiss chief constables and intervene in forces deemed to be failing. The plans are part of a raft of reforms expected from Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who is promising to oversee the biggest shake-up of policing in decades. Officers will have to renew what the Home Office calls a 'licence to practice' throughout their career by keeping up to date with latest methods and guidance. Training will be rolled out in phases. The aim is that the new standardised programme will be clearer to follow across all 43 police forces in England and Wales. \"Every police officer needs to remain match fit to protect their communities. As crime evolves, we expect police to evolve more quickly\", Crime and Policing Minister Sarah Jones said. \"The licence to practise will equip every officer with the skills and capabilities to do the job – whether new to the force or a policing veteran.\" Last week it was announced the home secretary will be given new powers to sack police chiefs. On Friday, additional statutory powers were extended to ministers, who will be able to force the \"retirement, resignation, or suspension\" of police chief constables if they are performing poorly. Currently, only police and crime commissioners hold that power. Ministers will also be able to send in \"specialist teams\" to turn around forces if crime solving rates or police response times are poor.The government said that new targets on policing will also be introduced, and made available to the public. \"It is essential that the people can determine what they expect from their forces,\" Mahmood said in a statement. It comes after Mahmood last week said she had lost confidence in West Midlands Police's chief constable Craig Guildford after Israeli football fans were banned from a match against Aston Villa. He later retired from the force. Sir Andy Cooke, who leads His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), welcomed the plans. The body independently assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of police forces. \"Where a police force is failing the public, there must be a clear, fair system to make sure concerns are acted upon. The inspectorate is a vital part of that system,\" he said. \"These reforms will help make sure under-performance is more quickly addressed whilst supporting forces to respond to our recommendations more effectively, so that every community gets the policing it deserves.\"On Monday, as part of her reforms plan, the home secretary will pledge to \"significantly\" cut the number of forces from its current level of 43, and tell them to focus on serious and organised crime.However, the Police Federation of England and Wales said: \"Policing's current structure has entrenched a postcode lottery in what the public see but also how officers are led, supported and treated.\"Fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities. Skills, capabilities and equipment need significant investment if the public and officers are going to see reform deliver in the real world.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoThomas MackintoshandLeila Nathoo,Political correspondentGetty ImagesA bill aimed at enshrining in law the government's Chagos deal will not be debated in the Lords as previously planned. The legislation, which would see the archipelago in the Indian Ocean handed to Mauritius with the UK leasing back a key military base for £101m a year, was due to be debated in the Lords on Monday. But late on Friday, the Conservatives - who have long opposed the deal - tabled an amendment calling for a pause \"in light of the changing geopolitical circumstances\".The government has now decided not to go ahead with the upcoming debate and said the bill will return to the Lords at an unspecified later date.\"The government remains fully committed to the deal to secure the joint UK-US base on Diego Garcia, which is vital for our national security,\" a government spokesperson said.\"This is irresponsible and reckless behaviour by peers, whose roles is to check legislation, not interfere with our national security priorities.\"Government sources said they are considering how to respond but do believe there are ways to stop a similar tactic being deployed in the future.The Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill is currently in the later stages of parliamentary scrutiny known as \"ping pong\", where it bounces back and forth between the House of Commons and House of Lords as they attempt to amend elements of it.The Tories claim passing the bill would put the UK in contravention of a 1966 Treaty agreed with the US over the islands and therefore in breach of international law.Article 1 of the 1966 Treaty says \"the territory shall remain under UK sovereignty\".The Tories have called on ministers to ensure agreement is reached with the US over the 1966 Treaty, before the bill returns to the House of Lords.Under the terms of the proposed new Chagos deal with Mauritius, the UK will lease back Diego Garcia, the largest of the islands and home to a shared UK-US military base.The deal sets a 24-mile buffer around Diego Garcia, where nothing can be built without UK consent.Under the terms of the agreement - which was signed by Sir Keir Starmer last May - Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a military base on one of the islands, Diego Garcia, for an initial period of 99 years.The government said it would pay Mauritius an average of £101m a year for 99 years, which Sir Keir said amounted to a \"net cost\" of £3.4bn after adjusting for factors including inflation.Last May, the prime minister said the UK had to \"act now\" or face Mauritian legal action that could interfere with the Diego Garcia base.He said: \"If we did not agree this deal the legal situation would mean that we would not be able to prevent China or any other nation setting up their own bases on the outer islands or carrying out joint exercises near our base.\"No responsible government could let that happen.\"The delay to the Bill's parliamentary journey comes in the same week US President Donald Trump appeared to have a change of heart over the agreement.On Tuesday, Trump described the agreement as a  \"great act of stupidity\" - despite his administration having previously been content with the terms.Before signing the deal in May last year, the UK offered Trump an effective veto, because of its implications for US security.Allies of the president had criticised the plan, but during a meeting with Starmer in the Oval Office last February, Trump said \"I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country\". After the agreement was signed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington \"welcomed\" the deal.Rubio said it secured the \"long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia\", which he described as a \"critical asset for regional and global security.\"",

    "body": "19 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterGetty ImagesSir David Beckham, Lady Victoria Beckham, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham and Nicola Peltz Beckham, pictured in 2023Brooklyn Peltz Beckham's wedding DJ has given his account of what happened during what he describes as an \"awkward\" dance between the groom and his mother Victoria.On Monday, Brooklyn almost broke the internet by posting a series of claims about his famous parents, Sir David and Lady Beckham, including that his mother hijacked his first dance with actress and hedge fund heiress Nicola Peltz.He claimed his mum, formerly one of the Spice Girls, had \"danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone\", leaving him feeling \"uncomfortable\" and \"humiliated\".DJ Fat Tony said \"the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room\".After rampant speculation over Brooklyn's comment about his mother's dancing, the DJ said: \"There was no slutdropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action.\"Pop star Marc Anthony performed at the wedding reception and called Brooklyn on to the stage, the DJ, whose real name is Tony Marnoch, told ITV's This Morning on Friday.\"The next minute, everyone was expecting it to be Nicola to go up and do the first dance,\" he said.The US singer then called for \"the most beautiful woman in the room\" to join Brooklyn - before saying Victoria's name instead of Nicola's,\" Marnoch claimed.This led to the bride running out of the room in tears, he added.'Crying her eyes out'\"Victoria is by the stage, she goes onto the stage, and of course at that point Brooklyn is suddenly, literally, devastated because he thought he was going to do his first dance with his wife.\"Then Nicola leaves the room crying her eyes out. Brooklyn is stuck there on stage.\"And then they do this dance and Marc Anthony's going, 'Put your hands on your mother's hips'. It was a Latin thing.\"The whole situation was very awkward for everyone in the room.\"However, his account differs from other reports, some of which have said the first dance took place between Brooklyn and Nicola earlier, before Anthony's performance began.British Vogue, who were at the wedding, said Anthony appeared at 11pm and that it was Brooklyn who \"invited his mother on stage for a dance\".BBC News has contacted Anthony, who is a singer-songwriter and friend of the Beckhams, for a comment.Sir David and Lady Beckham have not directly responded to Brooklyn's post or given their side of the story.Getty ImagesDJ Fat Tony, whose real name is Tony Marnoch, is known for his work on the celebrity-packed London club scene in the 1980s and 90sMarnoch has DJ'd at \"an awful lot of Beckham parties in the past\", and they are a \"close-knit family\" who \"love to dance\", he said.Whether that dance was \"inappropriate\" is down to how Brooklyn feels, he said.\"This is all about how Brooklyn feels. If he feels that it was inappropriate and awkward, it was inappropriate and awkward.\"The following day's brunch was \"the most awkward part of it all\" because \"everything that had gone on at the wedding night was discussed amongst the guests the next morning\", the DJ said.He added that the newlyweds left \"devastated\", but said the dance \"is a very small part of a bigger problem\" for the feuding family.It's \"sad\" that many people have focused on that part of Brooklyn's statement, Marnoch said.Mock-ups and memes of Lady Beckham's supposed wedding dance have been flooding the internet all week.\"It's taken a lot for someone to go to social media to post it,\" he added.\"He wanted to change the narrative. For all of his life he's been called a nepo baby, and 'He should be grateful that he's got the family name'.\"That's what he was born into. I think what we're all missing here is the fact that parents have lost their child, and a son's lost his parents and the rest of his family.\"In his explosive Instagram post on Monday, Brooklyn said he did not want to \"reconcile\" with his family, citing further wedding dress drama and an accusation that his parents put \"brand Beckham\" first.",

    "body": "14 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterFormer deputy prime minister Angela Rayner does not want Andy Burnham to be blocked from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election, the BBC understands.As first reported in The Times, Rayner is expected to publicly make her announcement at Labour's north west regional conference on Saturday. If Burnham did contest and win the by-election in Greater Manchester, it would enable him to mount a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer. The BBC has been told that some of Sir Keir's supporters on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) will seek to block him from standing. The Greater Manchester mayor has until 5pm on Saturday to let the NEC know if he wants to stand or not - and he will find out on Sunday whether he will be allowed to.Under Labour rules, elected mayors must get permission from the NEC before seeking nomination as Labour Parliamentary candidates.The by-election could happen as early as next month after ex-Labour minister Andrew Gwynne formally resigned from the House of Commons, saying he had been advised by his GP not to return to work.Burnham has not said if he will go for the seat, telling reporters on Thursday that he was \"focused\" on his role as Manchester mayor and that people shouldn't \"rush to conclusions\". He has since refused requests for interviews. The tight timetable puts pressure on Burnham to make a quick decision which could make or break his political career.Rayner was forced to resign as deputy prime minister and housing secretary last year after the PM's ethics adviser concluded she had breached the ministerial code. However, she retains strong support among backbench MPs and party members and her backing for Burnham could make it harder for the NEC to block his progress. Several Labour sources have said they expect the committee to object to Burnham's candidacy on the grounds that it would trigger an election for the Greater Manchester mayoralty, which would be seen as a drain on party funds as well as politically risky.The NEC could also insist that there should be an all-women shortlist of possible Labour candidates for a by-election because the majority of the party's MPs are currently men.Opinion among Labour MPs is divided over whether Burnham should come back to the Commons.In a social media post appearing to back Burnham, Jo White, MP and leader of the Red Wall group said: \"A London stitch up will be a disaster for Labour.\"However, Graham Stringer, the MP for Blackley and Middleton South in Greater Manchester, said Burnham was \"entitled to be ambitious but this isn't the right opportunity\".\"I think it's very high-risk. By-elections are a nightmare for any candidates standing on behalf of a sitting government. I don't think Andy should take that risk.\"Labour won the Gorton and Denton seat at the 2024 election with a 13,000 majority. Reform UK came second with 5,000 votes, narrowly beating the Greens candidate into third place.The area has traditionally been considered a safe seat, but Labour's drop in popularity since the general election means the party are not guaranteed a win. As the prime minister's popularity has declined, speculation has grown that he could face a leadership challenge after the local elections in May, at which Labour is expected to perform poorly. Alongside Burnham, Rayner and Health Secretary Wes Streeting have also been touted as possible challengers. Speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said: \"I don't know if Andy really wants to get back into Westminster politics.\"He may do, and there's much merit to him. \"But I would caution those often around that start to destabilise the ship and say that we can have a new leader. \"No, we can't. Because immediately you'd be forced to have an election.\"",

US officials had said they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.The head of Canada's federal police force, which assisted in the investigation, spoke alongside Patel on Friday to praise the law enforcement operation.\"No single agency or nation can combat transnational organised crime alone,\" said Mike Duheme, Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). \"We can finally say that our communities, our countries, are much safer with the arrest of Ryan Wedding,\" he added.Wedding is expected to make his first court appearance in Los Angeles on Monday.FBIWedding, seen in an undated photo released by the FBIWedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tonnes of cocaine a year.The organisation operated across North America, as well as several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year. Before he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him. Officials say he has also ordered the murders of several others.Wedding is now facing a slew of felony charges, including witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.The FBI had previously placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest. Patel declined to comment on whether anyone would be claiming the reward money.US officials have released limited details regarding how Wedding was captured, except to say that his arrest took place on Thursday night in Mexico City. Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, said in a post on X that Patel had visited Mexico City on Thursday, and departed with two fugitives on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. He did not name the men arrested, but said one was a \"Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered\" at the US embassy in Mexico. Watch: FBI director calls Ryan Wedding \"a modern day Pablo Escobar\"The Associated Press, citing an unnamed Mexican Security Cabinet member,  reported that Wedding is the Canadian who turned himself in at the US embassy. In his remarks at a news conference, Patel described Wedding as a \"modern-day Pablo Escobar\", referring to the Colombian cartel leader. US officials have also compared him to Mexican drug dealer Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán.\"When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,\" Patel said, thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.Patel also thanked the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, who participated in taking Wedding into custody.In an interview with Vanity Fair, Patel praised the team, which had also been involved in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro weeks earlier.\"This was a complex, high-stakes operation with zero margin for error,\" Patel told the magazine. \"I was on the ground with our team in Mexico and witnessed extraordinary teamwork, precision, and trust between our agents and partners in Mexico.\"Wedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI said. He has reportedly had plastic surgery to change his appearance while on the run.Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.Authorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.Getty ImagesThe FBI had offered a $15m reward for Ryan WeddingOfficials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico. In December, Mexican authorities announced that they had seized $40m in racing motorcycles owned by Wedding. They also seized other valuable items, including luxury paintings, artworks, drugs and two Olympic gold medals.It is unclear to whom the medals belong. Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, but did not win any medals. He came in 24th place in the men's giant parallel slalom ski event.In November, the FBI seized his rare 2002 Mercedes CLK-GTR, which had been valued at $13m.Patel also spoke about the recent arrest of another man in Mexico who had been on the FBI's most wanted list. American man Alejandro Castillo was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. According to the FBI, he has been in hiding in Mexico for nearly 10 years, and will now be extradited back to North Carolina for trial. ",

Mark Stevens from Ludlow, Shropshire, collects the candles from churches and shops and uses the candle wax to make temporary stoves for the military and civilians.He said many communities in the country had electricity and heating cut off so the candles played an important role and could be used in shelters. \"It's the idea of being in a cold dark space with no light, no heat and it's something very simple,\" he said.Stevens uses the candles to make temporary stoves which are then distributed to Ukraine\"People are throwing away candles every day so it's good recycling.\"Stevens has collected an estimated thousand kilos of used candles from cathedrals, churches and charity shops, so he can personally deliver them to the frontline.He has travelled to Ukraine four times so far and also sends the candles and cookers to the country via a charity. \"This would heat a room,\" he said of one of the candles. \"It could be used in a shelter somewhere.\"The candles are collected from charity shops, cathedrals and churchesStephens also supplies generators and even vehicles to the Ukrainians.\"It's easy to ignore what's going on on our doorstep and the destruction and the waste and the environmental hazard that is being created by a war,\" he said.Church warden Lesley Harling said: \"I think it's amazing. Apart from anything else, the sheer amount of work that goes into it.\"Many Ukrainian refugees live in Ludlow, with three of them working at the cafe at St Laurence's Church.\"I really appreciate his work,\" said Yuliia Shapoval.\"People need to feel like... somebody wants to help them.\"Yuliia Shapoval said she appreciated Mark Stevens' workMore on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorThe prime minister's condemnation of Donald Trump's remarks about the war in Afghanistan are his strongest public criticisms of the president yet.They come in a week where circumstances have led Sir Keir Starmer to conclude three times that it was necessary to publicly rebuke a man he has ploughed so much effort into building a strong relationship with.I am told Sir Keir, on returning to Downing Street on Friday afternoon, saw it as essential to make his views clear in the most direct terms.His tone and body language conveyed his anger, as did his words, in which he said what President Trump had said was \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The president had claimed that the Nato defence alliance, of which the UK is a member, had sent \"some troops\" to Afghanistan, but they \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"The comments, which are factually inaccurate, have been widely seen as crass and deeply offensive.Four hundred and fifty-seven British service personnel died in the conflict and many more suffered life changing injuries.The prime minister's team tell me Sir Keir sees standing up for and defending the armed forces as a first order duty of his role, as both those serving and those killed in conflict can't speak publicly for themselves.Incidentally, it is not the first time the Prime Minister has felt the need to stand up for the British military after remarks from the Trump administration.In March of last year, Sir Keir pointedly paid tribute to UK troops in the Commons after the US Vice-President JD Vance was accused of disrespecting them.But on that occasion, he made no reference to the vice-president by name.Sir Keir's response to the president is the third time in five days he has had to reach a quick judgement on how to calibrate a public response in defending what he sees as first principles under attack from the White House.The first came on Monday morning, with his case for the sanctity of the sovereignty of Greenland and a plea for \"calm discussion\".Within 24 hours, the president was lobbing around insults about the government's deal over the Chagos Islands.Little wonder, perhaps, that No 10 approached Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday with a sense that what he planned to say there wasn't without risk.His language and tone on the president's then ambitions for Greenland hardened, as he said the UK \"will not yield\" to pressure from Washington.While the prime minister's interventions on Monday and Wednesday were seen by officials through the prism of diplomacy and the reaction they might provoke, his remarks on Friday were approached with a different mindset. I'm told the judgement was more simple: it was categorically the right thing to do, the prime minister concluded, given the gravity of offence the president had caused.If Sir Keir manages a moment over the weekend to reflect on the last seven days, you have to wonder if he may judge it was a turning point in his relationship with President Trump.It is a relationship he prizes and cherishes. Plenty have praised him for pulling it off, others have criticised him for hugging a deeply controversial President too close.His argument has long been a close relationship is in the national interest.The question now is how typical weeks like the last one might become, if the president's penchant for what many see as outrage, insult and provocation becomes ingrained.",

Ukraine has not commented.Investigators have been sent to the scene, in a car park near an apartment block in the south of Russia's capital.Images from the area show a badly damaged white car with the doors blown out, surrounded by other vehicles in a parking lot. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of military officials have been targeted in the Russian capital.Gen Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in a car bomb attack in Moscow in April, while Gen Igor Kirillov died in December 2024 when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely.A Ukrainian source later told the BBC that Kirillov was killed by Ukraine's security service, though this was never confirmed on the record. As a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.",

The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria.

    "body": "5 hours agoBen Wright,BBC political correspondentandGeorge WrightSir Keir Starmer does not have a \"coherent approach to social mobility\", a top government adviser has said.Social mobility commissioner Alun Francis told the Guardian there was no \"overarching narrative\" to pull different policies together and called on the prime minister to set out a clearer strategy.A report by the commission released last week warned that \"extreme regional disparities\" existed in the UK, with many former industrial and mining areas worst affected.\"We have a government that talks quite a lot about social mobility, but mainly about individuals – often about [the] social mobility of themselves or their colleagues,\" Francis said.\"But what we don't have is a coherent approach to social mobility as a useful concept that you can build a strategy around.\"While praising individual policies on housing and skills, he said other proposals had been \"stop-start\", while almost one million young people are now outside education, work or training.\"We've got other policies like growth, educational improvement where we're just not sure where we're going,\" Francis said.Without an overall strategy, he said, the government would \"struggle to address some of those issues and have a clear-headed view about what we might do to improve things\".Among the conclusions of week's report were that a child's family background still heavily shapes their education level and future life chances in the UK. It also said there were \"extreme regional disparities\" within the country. A government spokesperson called the number of young people outside education, work or training a crisis that couldn't be ignored and said a review by Alan Milburn would help build a system that ensured every young person had an opportunity to make something of their lives.The report listed North East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the West Midlands as facing \"enduring disadvantages\", while former mining areas in Wales and Scotland are also \"notably disadvantaged\".However, new areas outside London with \"favourable conditions for innovation and growth\" include Aberdeen, Brighton, Bristol, Chester, Edinburgh, Oxfordshire, Reading and West Berkshire, the report said.It also noted that almost half of young people aged 25 to 29 years were in professional occupations between 2022 and 2024 - up from 36% between 2014 and 2016.But people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds \"don't benefit as much from these opportunities as their peers\", it said.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKate McGoughEducation reporterDan Nelson / BBCMany children find themselves singing at school in the run up to Christmas - at a nativity play or carol concert, often with parents watching proudly on.But new data suggests singing is a much less common occurrence throughout the rest of the school year, especially after pupils leave primary school.Now, an association of music teachers says every school should have a choir, to help pupils embrace music after a years-long decline in its popularity as a GCSE subject.The government says it is investing in high quality music teaching and that a \"renewed curriculum\" will encourage more people to study it.In a recent survey, Teacher Tapp asked just under 10,000 teachers in England how often their whole school sang together in assembly. Over half of state secondary school teachers (57%) said their pupils never sang together in assembly, while just 13% of private secondary school teachers and only 4% of primary teachers said the same. Teachers were separately asked whether their schools had a choir. Just over a third (36%) of teachers at state secondaries reported having no choir at their school, compared to just 8% of private school secondary teachers.Having access to multiple school choirs was much more common at private schools, with three quarters (77%) of private secondary teachers saying their school had more than one choir, compared to 27% of state secondary teachers.Jackie Bowen, head teacher at The East Manchester Academy, says secondary school pupils can feel \"embarrassed - or that maybe it's not cool to sing like it was in primary school\".But she says singing and music are priorities at the school.Dan Nelson / BBCJackie Bowen says music is part of the fabric of school life for her pupils\"We know the intrinsic value of music, but also what it does for students' development, mental health, its impact on academic achievements,\" she says. \"So we've run lots of initiatives to try and break down barriers to music.\" The school offers a music hub at the school once a week, offering pupils time with specialist teachers from the Royal Northern College of Music. At lesson changeover, students hear classical music instead of the traditional bell. The school has also established its first gospel choir. Year 11 student Mercy, who's part of the choir, says she always wanted to continue singing at secondary school.\"In primary they say you have to sing, but when you come to secondary it's a choice, so most people don't do it,\" she says. \"I feel like we should all release our voices to the world. Whether you're good or not, just sing.\"Kate McGough / BBCMercy is part of her school's gospel choir and says she enjoys singingThere has been a 25% drop in pupils studying GCSE music at schools in England over the last fifteen years, despite an uptick in the most recent stats. That is partly down to the introduction of a progress measure for schools called the English Baccalaureate in 2010, which assessed schools based on how many pupils took English, maths, sciences, geography or history and a language - and how well they performed.The government recently announced that it would be changing the school curriculum in England to make it easier for more schools to offer arts subjects like music.There has been some improvement in recruiting new music teachers this year, but the levels still fall 35% short of government's target for trainee music teachers in the most recent stats.James Manwaring, president of the Music Teachers Association - which represents music teachers across both state and private schools - says every school should have a choir.\"All you need is a room and you need someone to lead it and you need students,\" says James, who is also the director of music at Windsor Learning Partnership - a multi-academy trust of six state schools.\"It's a shame to think some state schools aren't capitalising on that.\"He says changes to the school curriculum in England are \"very exciting\" for boosting music in schools, but says more funding and resources will be needed -  \"as well as retaining the wonderful music teachers we have out there\".Dan Nelson / BBCMusic teacher Rob Hatton set up the gospel choir for students at The East Manchester AcademyA Department for Education spokesperson said the government was committed to ensuring art, music and drama \"are no longer the preserve of a privileged few\".Ministers are \"investing millions\" to help schools invest in musical instruments and equipment, and \"supporting high quality music teaching through our Music Hubs\", they said. \"Our renewed curriculum will also give every young person the skills, knowledge and experiences needed to achieve and thrive, including encouraging more people to study music and other creative subjects.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoSharon BarbourHealth correspondentA shortage of epidural kits in the UK is expected to last until at least March, the government's medicines regulator has warned.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told healthcare providers in a patient safety alert earlier this month that the shortage followed manufacturing issues concerning epidural bags.Hospitals are being sent substitutes bags for the pain relief drug given to women in labour, while the Royal College of Anaesthetists is working with the NHS to advise hospitals on how to manage the situation.Medical staff have expressed concern about these plans, the BBC understands, though the NHS said women \"should come forward for care as usual\".The shortage arose after a major supplier stopped making epidural infusion bags, it is understood.The MHRA alert on 2 December said there was a \"range of alternative\" bags available during the \"affected period\", which will require a \"trust-wide approach to ensure safe implementation\".Hospitals are being sent substitutes - but these have higher drug doses and so need very careful managing.All trusts have been asked to create teams that ensure mother-and-baby safety.But hospital staff, pharmacists and anaesthetists - who administer epidurals to women during labour - have expressed concerns over the plans.The head of the Birth Trauma Association, Dr Kim Thomas, argued that \"there hasn't been enough communication\" on how to put together these teams.\"Leaving trusts to manage a situation like this is very unfair, because you're going to get different responses in different trusts,\" she explained. \"It's going to mean added stress and added work for staff who are already overworked particularly at this time of year.\"An NHS spokesperson said: \"The safety of women in the care of NHS maternity services remains a top priority.\"They added: \"There are a range of alternatives available and trusts are also sharing supplies with other nearby trusts where appropriate.\"Additional reporting by Hafsa Khalil",

    "body": "5 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Fulham midfielder will represent his home country Nigeria in the competitionHe's played on some of the biggest stages in the world in the Premier League, but Alex Iwobi believes the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) is a \"special\" experience. The tournament will see 24 teams battling for the continental crown across the next couple of weeks. Fulham midfielder Iwobi will represent his home country of Nigeria in the competition, where they will be hoping to clinch the title after missing out in a 2-1 loss to Ivory Coast in 2023's final.\"With Afcon, you get to celebrate Africa through football,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. \"You get to see different cultures, you get to see how different people dress, how people from Nigeria, the way we walk into the changing rooms.\"When some of the other countries walk into the changing rooms, we play music, so we're celebrating our music through that as well.\"Nigeria will be hoping to redeem themselves after failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup. Iwobi says it was a \"big disappointment\", but the team will be using it to fuel them in the Afcon tournament.\"We owe it to ourselves to make it right, and there's no better way from the last Afcon to improve (than) just to win this one,\" the 29-year-old says. Afcon is typically held every two years and this time Morocco is hosting. Nigeria have won the competition three times over the years, the last being back in 2013. Their most recent loss to Ivory Coast is still prominent in Iwobi's mind as he says it \"shattered\" their dreams. However, he feels the moment was \"written\" for striker Sébastien Haller, who scored the winning goal after overcoming testicular cancer. \"It was a tough loss, but you give credit when credit due, they deserved it,\" Iwobi says.\"But it's also fuelled us and we've been working hard to get into the Afcon again and, hopefully, this is our story.\"Getty ImagesAlex Iwobi made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015The Fulham midfielder was born in Lagos, but moved to London as a child. His talent was spotted early and he was selected to represent England up to under-18 level.After many years with the Three Lions, he made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015 as he says he felt more \"at home\" with the team.\"England treated me with a lot of respect and they loved me,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I felt more of a connection with my roots in Nigeria.\"He has since made 91 appearances, making him the fourth most capped player for the Nigerian Super Eagles. Iwobi says he never thought he would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria growing up, but he is \"honoured and grateful\" for his achievements. Ademola Lookman, Calvin Bassey and Iwobi's school friend Ola Aina are also among the players on the Nigerian national team who were not raised in the country.They have been affectionately nicknamed the \"innit boys\", and Iwobi hopes they have helped open the door for others to represent their home country. \"You're Nigerian at the end of the day and you will get loved regardless,\" he says.Getty ImagesIwobi says he never thought we would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria in his careerThere has been debate over whether Afcon gets the respect it deserves.Earlier this year, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher caused a stir when he suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\", when discussing Mohamed Salah's chances of winning the coveted Ballon d'Or.Iwobi feels there is still more work to be done.\"It's obviously getting recognised a lot more,\" he says. \"There's a lot of great talents, great nations representing.\"In the Premier League there's a lot of players in each team that are going to be represented so the awareness is growing, but it definitely deserves a lot more respect, in my opinion.\"If he wins the tournament, the Fulham player says he will be on the phone to his parents and sister straight away, while his extended family will be dancing.\"I've heard from previous people that when they win it, it's like everything just stops, you become like a king, you're just royalty,\" he says. \"Just going to the final we got treated like royalty anyway, so I can't imagine winning it.\"It would just be crazy, but I want to experience that.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "7 hours agoThe Guardian leads with an interview with the government's social mobility commissioner, Alun Francis, in which he says that the government lacks an \"overarching narrative\" to pull various social mobility policy strands together and urges Sir Keir Starmer to set out a clearer strategy. It also features a photo of people celebrating the winter solstice at Stonehenge.The Times also features a photo from the winter solstice, above a story reporting that Health Secretary Wes Streeting has suggested that the UK should join a customs union with Europe, despite Prime Minister Keir Starmer ruling out a change in policy. The Daily Mirror leads with a story on how a poll shows that ex-Strictly Come Dancing contestant Thomas Skinner's \"legal threat\" over his Strictly exit has \"taken a hit\" after a new poll suggests he was the least-popular dancer. It follows reports Skinner is suing the BBC over claims the vote was rigged against him. The BBC has rejected the allegation, saying Strictly's public vote was \"independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy\".The Daily Mail leads with an investigation on how \"criminal migrants\" are reportedly avoiding justice by being smuggled out of the UK in lorries. It focuses on an Albanian man who the paper reports has been running a network helping people flee for £2,500.The i leads with a story on how almost 7,000 care home residents in England were told their contracts were being terminated with just 28 days notice last year.The Financial Times leads with a story on how UK firms attracted interest from international buyers eager to capitalise on cheap valuations this year. Overseas bidders agreed $142bn in takeovers of UK companies, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group - a 74% rise from 2024.The Sun reports that Princess Beatrice will not join her \"scandal-hit dad\", Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, for Christmas this year and will go skiing with friends instead. Andrew has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Daily Telegraph leads with a story on how the new head of the equalities watchdog has criticised people who describe migration as a risk to the UK. It also has a story on how trail hunting will be banned in what the paper calls Labour's \"war on the countryside\". The Daily Express speaks to a woman who is calling for child abuse \"monsters\" to be named on a national register. Paula Hudgell's adopted son, Tony, was \"horrifically injured\" by his birth parents, the paper reports.And the Daily Star says it has \"teamed up\" with Kenyan darts star David Munyua. The paper has sponsored his shirt for his next clash in World Darts Championship.The Times reports concerns from the National Farmers' Union that higher animal welfare standards, being proposed by the government, may mean that higher standards are applied to UK meat producers than to foreign imports. The NFU says it would be wrong for British farmers to compete with those in countries which continue the caged farming practices which the government here wants to end. The Telegraph attacks the proposed ban on trail hunting as \"class warfare\" against rural England. The Sun's editorial welcomes the plan to ban puppy farms, lamenting that \"It's just a shame that we can't lock the cruel breeders up in their own kennels\". The Mirror calls the plans \"justice for voiceless creatures\".The i newspaper says 7,000 care home residents in England had their contracts terminated this year. According to the paper, that was an increase of 200% since 2018. The government says local authorities have a duty to arrange and fund support for people who can't afford it.The Daily Express is one of a number of papers which focus on data showing incidents of shoplifting have increased by 65% in five years, with an average of more than 800 unsolved cases each day.

    "body": "US and Ukrainian envoys say \"productive and constructive\" talks have taken place in Miami, but there still appears to be no major breakthrough in efforts to end Ukraine's war with Russia.Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, issued a joint statement with the top Ukrainian negotiator, Rustem Umerov, after three days of meetings with European allies.The pair said the meeting focused on aligning positions on a 20-point plan, a \"multilateral security guarantee framework\", a \"US Security guarantee framework for Ukraine\" and an \"economic & prosperity plan\". Separate talks have been taking place in Miami between the US and the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine's recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity,\" Witkoff and Umerov said in a statement.The meetings are the latest step in weeks of diplomatic activity, sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan which shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.Witkoff said representatives from Russia had met himself and other US officials in southern Florida, including Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Witkoff said the meetings with Russian envoy Dmitriev were also \"productive and constructive\" and that \"Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine\". Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the war, but so far the two countries have been unable to agree on major issues, including Moscow's demand to keep land it has already seized.US intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to capture all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire, six sources familiar with US intelligence told the Reuters news agency.This comes says after Putin told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that there will be no more wars after Ukraine, if Russia is treated with respect.\"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours,\" he said.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged two vessels and two piers in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russian officials said on Monday. The damage led to a big fire, but Russian authorities say all crew were safely evacuated.  Some reports say oil infrastructure was targeted.",

    "body": "In rebel-held Myanmar, civilians face devastating air strikes and a sham election10 hours agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent in MyanmarAamir Peerzada/BBCIang Za Kim had to flee her home after the junta launched air strikes nearbyLate one night last month Iang Za Kim heard explosions in a neighbouring village, then fighter jets flying overhead. She ran out of her home to see smoke rising from a distance.\"We were terrified. We thought the junta's planes would bomb us too. So we grabbed what we could – some food and clothes and ran into the jungles surrounding our village.\"Iang's face quivers as she recounts the story of what happened on 26 November in K-Haimual, her village in Myanmar's western Chin State, and then she breaks down.She's among thousands of civilians who've fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a fierce campaign of air strikes, and a ground offensive in rebel-held areas across the country, to recapture territory ahead of elections starting on 28 December.Four other women sitting around her on straw mats also start crying. The trauma of what they've gone through to make it to safety is clearly visible.While the air strikes were the immediate cause for Iang to flee, she also doesn't want to be forced to participate in the election.\"If we are caught and refuse to vote, they will put us in jail and torture us. We've run away so that we don't have to vote,\" she says.Aamir Peerzada/BBCMany civilians have crossed into India to escape the violence in MyanmarSome from Chin state have described the junta's latest offensive as the fiercest it has launched in more than three years.Many of the displaced have sought refuge in other parts of the state. Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.It isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students –Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming – that this election is free and fair – this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCBawi Nei Lian (left) says the scheduled elections are a shamThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including  Suu Kyi are in jail.\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.At the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"He points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCAbel lost his right leg and his hands were severely wounded fighting against the juntaAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.Sui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.Many of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.Abel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.In a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"The impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.Yet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.Some like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada, Sanjay Ganguly and Aakriti Thapar",

Earlier this month Duncan-Glancy stood down as the party's education spokeswoman after admitting an \"serious error of judgement\" over her links to Sean Morton.The Glasgow region MSP submitted her resignation after the Daily Record newspaper said she had maintained contact with Morton, a former Labour councillor who admitted having indecent images of children and extreme pornography in 2017.At the time Labour said she had done the right thing and it considered the matter closed.Duncan-Glancy, who was elected to Holyrood in 2021, had been selected to contest a Glasgow seat.But in statement, issued on Sunday, the MSP confirmed that she had withdrawn her candidacy.Duncan-Glancy said: \"While this has obviously been a very difficult decision - and it is the greatest honour of my life to represent Glasgow - I do not wish for a personal friendship to become a distraction.\"I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve, and I remain committed to returning a Scottish Labour government next year.\"Morton, a former councillor for Fochabers Lhanbryde, was ordered to carry out unpaid work and put on the sex offenders register after he pled guilty to possessing two indecent child image offences.He had claimed the images were sent to him anonymously.A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \"Pam Duncan-Glancy has withdrawn as a parliamentary candidate for the Glasgow Kelvin and Maryhill constituency.\"She has taken the decision to step aside as she does not wish recent stories to become a distraction from the work of the party or its priorities.\"The selection process will now be reopened so that a replacement candidate can be chosen.\"",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByChris Fawkes Lead Weather Presenter and Ben RichLead Weather PresenterUpdated 3 hours agoThe festivities are fast approaching – but if you're dreaming of a white Christmas you may end up disappointed.Temperatures will drop this week as easterly winds develop, bringing cold air from eastern Europe.However, high pressure will also be building which will mean a lack of widespread precipitation - and hence little chance of widespread snow.It is possible that a few wintry showers could drift into southern parts of the UK - or that thick cloud in north-eastern areas could produce the odd flake of snow - so in technical terms a white Christmas is still possible.Turning chillyDecember has so far mostly been dominated by low pressure, bringing outbreaks of heavy rain and mild westerly or southerly winds.This is now starting to change, thanks to high pressure, which is going to build strongly across Scandinavia before drifting across the northern half of the UK - just in time for Christmas.Combined with low pressure which will be centred over southern Europe or north Africa, this will mean a feed of chilly easterly winds.Image caption, Easterly winds will be strongest in southern parts of the UK on Christmas DayInitially there will be a lot of cloud, which could produce some spots of drizzle or even the odd flake of snow over high ground.However, by Christmas Day more sunshine is expected, albeit with windy conditions in southern areas.Overnight frost and fog are also possible.Will it be a White Christmas?Join BBC Weather’s Carol Kirkwood, Matt Taylor and Barra Best, along with famous faces Jeremy Vine and Lucy Porter, to explore where our fascination with a white Christmas comes from.Could it be a white Christmas?Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult.Partly it will depend upon exactly how cold the air moving across the UK is, but the other necessary ingredient is precipitation - something falling from the sky.At the moment it looks like most places will be dry on Christmas Day, which will be welcomed in areas which have recently seen heavy rain such as Cumbria and south Wales.However, a few computer weather models do hint at a little wet weather pushing across the Channel Islands and possibly fringing into the far south of England.If this was to happen it could mean a little sleet or snow mixing in, especially over high ground.It is also possible that thick cloud rolling into the east of Scotland could give a few flakes of light snow over the hills and mountains.So the chances of a white Christmas are low - but not zero - and you can keep up to date with any changes in the forecast on the BBC Weather website and app.What is a white Christmas?The definition of a white Christmas is just a single snowflake recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 weather observing stations.Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day does not count.An \"official white Christmas\" has happened more often than not since 1960, but new analysis of Met Office data by the BBC shows that snow falling on Christmas Day is rare for most of us - and getting rarer.The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations and, very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.",

    "body": "10 hours agoMalcolm Prior,Rural affairs producerandDuncan Kennedy,CorrespondentAn end to puppy farming and a possible ban on the use of electric shock dog collars are promised as part of a new animal welfare strategy being launched by the government on Monday. The strategy - which packages together new laws with legislative reforms and proposals - will also progress Labour's manifesto pledge to ban trail hunting in the countryside. The RSPCA has welcomed the plans to outlaw puppy farming but the Countryside Alliance has condemned the ban on trail hunting as \"another attack on the countryside\".Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds told the BBC there would be consultation on the trail-hunting ban, which was \"sometimes used as a smokescreen\" for illegal fox hunting. Critics say puppy farming prioritises profit over animal health and welfare, often by keeping large numbers of dogs in small pens and using them to produce multiple litters a year.Current dog breeding practices will be reformed to tackle puppy farming as part of what the government calls \"the biggest animal welfare reforms in a generation\". However, the whole strategy will not be delivered until the end of 2030.David Bowles, head of public affairs at the RSPCA, said the animal welfare charity was \"delighted\" at the strategy and added that the plans to ban puppy farming \"could be a real game-changer\".\"Puppy farming is one of the most insidious problems that the RSPCA faces.\"The government will need to write the legislation on that in this coming year and the RSPCA will work with them to make sure that there are no loopholes,\" he said.The government is also looking to ban the use of snare traps in the countryside and on Sunday confirmed it is to carry out a consultation on the proposed ban on trail hunting in the New Year.Trail hunting involves using a rag with a natural scent on to lay a trail ahead of a hunt, which is then followed by the hounds but live animal scents could be picked up by the pack instead.The secretary of state told the BBC that while Labour had previously banned fox hunting in 2004 \"we have seen that people are trying to get around that ban by using trail hunting in some cases\". \"Obviously that's also a problem of enforcement, it's not just the legislation, but we are determined to go further, which is why banning trail hunting is in the animal welfare strategy,\" she said.\"We know sometimes it is used as a smokescreen for fox hunting.\"But Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said it was \"unbelievable\" that the government would be spending more parliamentary time on hunting.He said: \"Revisiting this pointless and divisive issue is completely unnecessary.\"People across the countryside will be shocked that after Labour's attack on family farms and its neglect of rural communities it thinks banning trail hunting and snares used for fox control are a political priority.\"Conservative chairman Kevin Hollinrake called the ban an \"attack on rural Britain and British culture\", accusing the government of \"punishing the law-abiding majority who support legal trail hunting\".The government is also looking at ending the use of \"confinement systems\" in farming including caged hens and pig farrowing crates, which are used to contain sows during birth and nursing.The use of slow-growing chickens will be promoted over the use of controversial so-called \"Frankenchickens\", a term used by animal welfare campaigners to describe fast-growing breeds.Anthony Field, head of Compassion in World Farming UK, said the government was \"raising the bar for farmed animal welfare\".The National Pig Association said it would be \"following the next steps closely\" on farrowing crates and was itself looking towards more flexible systems.The British Poultry Council have been approached by the BBC for comment.",

    "body": "Civil rights groups and pro-gun advocates in Australia have raised concerns that new fast-tracked laws will place undue restrictions on firearms and protests in the wake of the Bondi shootings.On Monday, the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) recalled its parliament to debate a raft of new laws such as banning the phrase \"globalise the intifada\", limiting the number of guns one person can own, and greater police powers for protests.NSW Premier Chris Minns said some may feel the changes had \"gone too far\" but they were needed to keep the community safe.A pro-gun politician said the laws unfairly target law-abiding gun owners while civil libertarians said restrictions on protests were an affront to democracy.On banning the \"intifada\" phrase, Minns said its use at protests in Australia and around the world \"are a call to a global intifada. That is what it means. Not in the Middle East, not in Israel or Gaza but here in Sydney\".\"I do believe it leads to a culture and environment of heightened disunity,\" he said, and \"an invitation to violence\".The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.In the aftermath of the Bondi attacks, in which 15 people were killed, the Jewish community accused the government of not doing enough to protect it from rising antisemitism.The new protest laws will also allow police to restrict demonstrations at places of worship, with stronger penalties for breaches.Timothy Roberts, president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said the new law ignores a recent decision by the state's supreme court which found the so-called \"move-on power\" at religious locations went against Australia's implied constitutional freedom of political communication.Religious institutions exercise significant and overt political power in Australian politics and this makes them a legitimate site of protest in a democratic society, Mr Roberts said. \"The laws introduced today are an affront to our right to assemble and communicate with each other,\" he said, adding they \"damage our democracy\".He said Minns wants social cohesion but he does not know the meaning of the term. \"He thinks silence is peace, and does not seem to realise it can also reflect oppression. Passing laws that oppress some parts of our community in the wake of an attack like we saw, does not bring us closer - it drives us further apart and stops us from healing well in this time of grief.\"Police will also be able to remove face coverings from protesters who are suspected of committing an offence - including low-level offences - during a protest. Previously, police could only do so if someone is arrested or suspected of committing an indictable offence. On gun reform, the new laws will mean licence holders in NSW cannot own more than four firearms with exceptions for farmers and sport shooters who can have up to ten. The move follows similar laws introduced in Western Australia earlier this year to cap gun ownership. Elsewhere across the country, there are no limits.One of the gunmen in the Bondi shooting, Sajid Akram, had six registered firearms. Other gun law changes include more regular renewals for gun licence holders from every five years to every two years, and a review of the types of firearms available to most gun owners.Mark Banasiak from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party - which lobbies for more relaxed gun laws - said the state's 260,000 gun licence holders were being \"punished\" and \"made a scapegoat for agency failings\".\"We're diverting away from what the real problem is,\" he said, referring to \"a climate of hate and division that's been allowed to fester for two and a half years because government haven't done enough to stop that.\"Walter Mikac, whose wife and two young daughters were among the 35 people shot dead in Tasmania by a lone gunman in 1996 in what is Australia's deadliest mass shooting, welcomed the reforms.The changes will \"close critical gaps in our gun laws\" and put community safety first, he said. The government also aims to crackdown on hate speech and symbols, as well as enabling police to ban protests for up to three months after a terrorist attack.Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees said the new laws were \"incredibly draconian\".\"Australia is seen as a safe country,\" he said, \"where freedom of speech is very important\" but the Bondi shooting was \"perhaps changing the dynamics of that democracy and that freedom\".David Ossip, president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said moves to ban \"intifada\" chants was a \"watershed moment\" in confronting hate and incitement. He also welcomed greater police powers during protests.\"The right to protest is a core Australian value and a fundamental tenet of a democratic society,\" he said.\"But it has never included the right to hide your face and shout slogans calling for violence against one's fellow Australians or waving the flags of groups devoted to murder and destruction.\"Additional reporting by Katy Watson",

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

    "body": "21 minutes agoMany of the papers have headlined on Iran, with the Mail declaring: \"Countdown to conflagration\". It says US President Donald Trump has issued a \"chilling threat\" to the Middle Eastern nation, demanding that the Ayatollah make a nuclear deal or \"face an overwhelming military onslaught\". Tehran says that any attack on Iran would be considered an \"act of war\", the Mail reports.The Guardian writes that a US armada \"heads towards Iran\", and notes that it is \"prepared to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence if necessary\" as per Trump's post to Truth Social. The \"decline of Britain's high streets\" also features prominently on the front page, with new research from the University of Southhampton indicating that the Labour Party must address the problem or risk being \"washed away in a tide of discontent\". \"Trump's war threat to Iran\" says the Mirror, alongside a photo of the USS Abraham Lincoln, which reportedly leads the armada currently en route to the Gulf.The unfolding situation in Iran has been labelled a \"nuclear ultimatum\" by the i Paper, which reports that people are fleeing Tehran in anticipation of an imminent attack. Iran's foreign minister has said that armed forces are ready \"with fingers on the trigger\" to \"powerfully respond\" to aggression.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is the focus of the Daily Telegraph's leading story, which says he called for European human rights laws to be invoked in order to investigate British soldiers in Iraq, in a book published by \"disgraced lawyer\" Phil Shiner. The piece follows on from the paper's front page yesterday, which revealed Sir Keir's involvement in a landmark legal case in 2007. A No 10 spokesperson said that the prime minister assisted the court on points of law, but did not advocate for either side. \"The prime minister was not involved in the subsequent case heard in the European Court of Human Rights,\" the spokesperson said, and added that allegations were a \"desperate and deliberate misrepresentation\".\"PM shelves fresh plan to overhaul benefits\" reads the Times, which says that Sir Keir has vetoed plans for a new attempt to reform the UK's welfare system. Two reviews of the welfare state are due to report this year, it reports, but both are expected to require legislation. This latest decision by the prime minister makes welfare reform before the next election unlikely, according to the paper.The Express quotes Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch on its front page, following a speech where she addressed recent defections to Reform UK. \"My party is for serious people and not drama queens,\" said Badenoch, and claimed those joining Nigel Farage were having a \"tantrum dressed up as politics\".The world's biggest mining companies have added almost half a trillion dollars to their valuations this year, according to the Financial Times. The paper notes that the \"biggest winners\" included Rio Tinto and Glencore, as well as Sydney-listed BHP and China's Zijin Mining.A retired police official has told the Sun that he believes nurse Lucy Letby is innocent, and that her conviction could be \"the greatest miscarriage of justice this century\". Letby is currently serving 15 life sentences in jail for the murder of seven babies, and the attempted murder of seven more.The Metro reports that a British lotto winner has been jailed for building a \"drug empire\" worth £228m. The paper says the man, 80, won £2.4m in 2010.\"Spend it like Beckham\" says the Star, pricing a wine featured in Brooklyn Beckham's Instagram post at £80,000.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoJessica RawnsleyEPA/ShutterstockSeveral cars were damaged in one coastal area after the roof of a university collapsedAt least five people have died after Storm Kristin tore through central and northern Portugal, causing flooding, landslides and widespread damage.The storm, which the government described as an \"extreme climactic event\", left schools shuttered, buildings damaged and travel severely disrupted. In the coastal city of Figueira da Foz, a Ferris wheel overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a building.Portugal has been hit by a succession of storms in recent days, including one over the weekend in which a man died after his car was swept away in floods.Heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 150km (95 miles) per hour caused more than 3,000 weather-related incidents across the country, civil protection authorities said. Several people were struck by falling trees or debris. The strongest winds were recorded at the Monte Real air base in Leiria, where gusts of 178km were recorded before the monitoring equipment was destroyed. Officials said the location was likely the storm's entry point to mainland Portugal.More than 850,000 people lost power on Wednesday, according to electricity distributor E-Redes. EPAA ferris wheel was overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a buildingThe civil protection agency (ANEPC) reported that three people had died in the central district of Leiria - one of the worst affected areas.In Leira, one person was hit by a metal sheet, and another was trapped in the structure of a house, according to officials. Local media said a man in Vila Franca de Xira died when a tree struck his car, local media said. There were also reports of a death in the Marinha Grande area.Transport across Portugal has been severely disrupted, with roads - including the main motorway connecting Lisbon to the north - and railways blocked by debris.Ten coastal areas were placed under a red weather warning on Wednesday due to dangerous sea conditions, with waves forecast to reach up to 14m (45ft,11in), according to the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA).The PSP (Public Security Police) urged people in Coimbra and Leira to stay inside, while Portugal's Secretary of State for Civil Protection said the country remained on maximum alert.Prime Minister Luis Montenegro expressed condolences to the victims' families. He said authorities were assessing the damage and would take \"whatever measures are necessary\".Meanwhile, Leiria's mayor, Goncalo Lopes, urged the government to declare a state of emergency.\"We have public spaces turned upside down,\" he told reporters. \"It's something that will require a very large recovery effort in the coming months. The impact is similar to what a bomb could mean in our city, with massive destruction.\"After crossing Portugal, Storm Kristin moved east into Spain - bringing with it snow, rain and strong winds. The storm caused widespread disruption across the country, with schools, roads and train lines closed and hundreds of thousands without power.In Andalusia, emergency services reported some 2,000 weather-related incidents.Spain's national weather agency, AEMET, warned of very strong winds in some areas, with gusts expected to reach hurricane force. A red weather alert has been issued for parts of Almeria in the south-east due to the strength of the wind.",

    "body": "An exceptionally wet January across the UKImage source, BBC Weather Watchers / LesleyJaneByStav DanaosLead Weather PresenterAs the last few days of January approach, conditions across the country are set to remain unsettled for many of us with more wind and rain in the forecast.Although January 2026 may have begun with a harsh Arctic blast, bringing biting temperatures and widespread snow, this quickly gave way to a volatile period of heavy rain and flooding as milder Atlantic air took over.Exceptionally wet weather, marked by a series of high-impact storms and persistent rainfall, has saturated the ground and triggered widespread flooding, external. Large parts of the UK have had well above-average January rainfall, with some regions seeing close to double the average and the wettest areas more than triple.Image caption, Some parts of the UK have seen over 300% or three times their average amount of rain for the month with still a few days leftHow a soggy month unfoldedAfter a cold start to January, the latter half of the month saw a dramatic spike in rainfall thanks to the arrival in quick succession of Storms Ingrid and Goretti.Storm Goretti was one of the most impactful storms to hit Cornwall in over 30 years  causing flooding, power cuts and travel disruption.Then the arrival of Storm Chandra on Tuesday exacerbated an already soggy situation prompting the Met Office to issue amber weather warnings, external.It's estimated 60–80mm of rain fall on saturated ground in south-west England and Wales. Some higher ground in Dartmoor recorded over 100mm in 24 hours. In Northern Ireland, Katesbridge recorded its wettest January day ever with 100.8mm of rain, while peak wind gusts hit 80mph at Orlock Head.Image caption, Parts of Northern Ireland and the north-east and south-west of the UK saw the wettest conditions from Storm ChandraWhy has it been so wet?An unusual and persistent mix of cold and wet conditions has dominated the month. Strong high pressure over eastern Europe and Scandinavia has locked in a very cold air mass, while an active jet stream has steered a succession of Atlantic low-pressure systems towards the UK. These systems have repeatedly slowed or stalled as they encountered the blocking high to the east, leading to prolonged spells of unsettled weather and elevated rainfall totals. At times, colder air has attempted to feed back into northern parts of the UK from the east, allowing any precipitation to turn wintry over higher ground in the north.With this pressure pattern in place, winds have predominantly come from the south-east, bringing some of the wettest conditions to parts of north-east Scotland, south-west England, and eastern areas of Northern Ireland.Image caption, High pressure and very cold air to the north-east and low pressure with milder air to the south-west as brought predominately south-easterly winds to the UK this monthThe 'Wet Winter' requirementDespite the recent misery from flooding and disruption caused, frequent and heavy rainfall is essential for long-term water security. Prior to this recent wet spell, the Environment Agency warned that England in particular, was at risk of a widespread drought in 2026 after experiencing a record-dry 2025. To fully recover from drought conditions by spring 2026, most of England needs to receive at least average winter rainfall levels.While recent rains have helped replenish some reservoirs, experts caution that rainfall must remain average to above average through to the end of March to prevent water restrictions later in the year.How long will it continue to rain for?The forecast for the remainder of January and into early February suggests that conditions will remain generally unsettled. Further spells of rain are likely, at times heavy, accompanied by periods of strong and occasionally gusty winds. At present, there is little indication of any prolonged drier or more settled weather on the horizon.For a more detailed forecast, you can check the weather where you live. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoJack FenwickPolitical correspondentReutersThe prime minister has said that discussions are ongoing with the United States over a controversial deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, amid concerns the US could withdraw support for the agreement.Under the deal, which the US backed last year, the UK would transfer sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius and lease back a joint UK-US military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.Ministers insist the deal is necessary to protect the base from \"malign interests\", but last week President Trump called it \"an act of great stupidity\".The Conservatives have accused the government of undermining national security because of Mauritius's close ties to China.Speaking to reporters while travelling to Beijing, Sir Keir Starmer said he had discussed it with Donald Trump \"a number of times\" and said the issue had been \"raised with the White House at the tail end of last week, over the weekend and into the early part of this week\".The prime minister said the Trump administration had been given three months to look at the deal last year and had concluded it \"was a deal they wanted to support, did support and did so in very clear terms\", after a review by US intelligence agencies.US support was thrown into doubt last week when Trump said on social media that he was \"against\" the deal.Hours later, Downing Street said it believed the US still supported the deal, despite the president's comments.Those around Sir Keir believed that the president was simply using the issue to put pressure on the UK over the Greenland row, and did not think that Trump had actually changed his mind on Chagos.But the following morning, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also criticised the deal and accused the UK of \"letting us down\" by handing sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius.Officials inside the Foreign Office are thought to be more concerned about Bessent's comments than they were about Trump's social media post – and Downing Street has since declined to repeat its claim that the US still supports the deal.It's understood there has not been an official approach from the US to the UK about a change of position on the Chagos deal, but there is some concern in Whitehall that such an approach could happen in the future.The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814 and became formally established as an overseas territory in 1965, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away.In 2021 a United Nations court ruled that the UK had no sovereignty over the islands, a decision which eventually led to negotiations over this deal.The deal would see the UK lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years, at an average cost of £101m a year.The US initially agreed to the deal in May 2025, but one source involved in those negotiations says the Trump administration was \"never enthusiastic\" and \"just decided then to go along with it\".Last year, the then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy said: \"If President Trump doesn't like the deal, the deal will not go forward.\"Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs on Monday that UK officials \"remain engaged with the United States on a daily basis\".It has also emerged that a 1966 treaty signed by the US and the UK would have to be updated for the deal to be completed.Those inside government are refusing to share details of how that treaty could be updated, but the Conservatives believe it would effectively give the US an opportunity to veto the entire deal.Foreign Office officials do not believe that is the case, but Doughty declined to answer when asked in the House of Commons whether that treaty could be updated unilaterally by the UK.The source involved in negotiations between the UK and US said the 1966 treaty had not been discussed during those talks.They said: \"To have overlooked it and not realised its importance is the most monumental piece of incompetence.\"A government source said they wanted it to return to Parliament as quickly as possible, but said it wasn't yet known when that would be.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the deal wasn't in the interests of the UK or the US and said she had spoken to the US ambassador Warren Stephens and the speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.Reform UK is also against the deal and party sources say Nigel Farage has personally discussed the issue with President Trump, Scott Bessent, JD Vance and other members of the administration.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSoroush PakzadBBC PersianBBCX-rays showed birdshot embedded in the legs of a wounded protester\"People helped us and we got into a car... I said, 'Don't take us to a hospital.'\"Tara and her friend were attending a protest in the central Iranian city of Isfahan when security forces arrived on motorcycles and began shouting at the crowd.\"My friend told an armed member of the security forces, 'Just don't shoot us,' and he immediately fired several shots at us. We fell to the ground. All our clothes were covered in blood,\" she said.They were bundled into a stranger's car, but Tara said they were too frightened to be taken to the hospital because of the risk of being arrested. \"All the alleyways were full of security forces, so I asked a couple standing at their front door to let us in.\"They stayed at the couple's home until it was almost dawn and then managed to find a doctor they knew, who cleaned the birdshot wounds on their legs, according to Tara.She said a surgeon was later able to remove some of the birdshot at home but warned them: \"They cannot all be removed and will remain in your bodies.\"All names in this article have been changed for their safety.Warning: This story contains details and images which some readers might find distressing.The full scale of the bloodshed resulting from the crackdown by security forces on the anti-government protests that swept across Iran this month is still not known because of an internet shutdown and a ban on reporting by most international news organisations.But the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, 112 children, 50 bystanders and 214 affiliated with the government. It is also investigating reports of 17,091 more deaths.At least another 11,000 protesters were seriously wounded, according to HRANA.Some of them have told the BBC that they have avoided seeking treatment for their injuries at hospitals because they fear being arrested.That has left them reliant on doctors, nurses and other volunteers willing to risk their own safety by treating them secretly at their homes.Healthcare workers have also told the BBC that security forces are present in hospitals and that they are constantly monitoring patients' medical records to identify injured protesters.Tara was able to find doctors willing to treat her wounds at their homesNima, a surgeon in Tehran, said he witnessed many young people being injured in the streets on his way to work on 8 January, when authorities responded to the escalating protests with lethal force.\"I put one of the wounded in the boot of my car to take him to hospital, as I was worried that we would get in trouble if we were stopped by the police,\" he told the BBC.Nima said armed officers stopped him but allowed him to go after seeing his hospital identification card.\"For almost 96 hours straight - without interruption, without sleep, without even closing our eyes for a moment - we were operating. We were crying and operating. Nobody complained.\"\"All our clothes and hospital gowns were covered in blood - our outer clothes, our underwear, everything was soaked in the blood of these young people.\"Nima described operating on one man who had been shot in the leg and face at a protest.\"A bullet had entered through his chin, ripped through his mouth and exited through his upper jaw,\" he recalled.Nima also said many of the young people treated at his hospital suffered gunshot wounds to their vital organs and limbs that required amputation and left them with permanent disabilities.Blood was seen on the floor of a hospital in TehranIranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people have been killed during the unrest, but that majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Health ministry spokesman Hossein Shokri was also quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying that around 13,000 operations had been carried out during the unrest.\"Fortunately, people trust the ministry of health and hospitals, and confidence that all injured individuals are treated impartially in medical centres has led around 3,000 people who had been treating themselves at home over the past six days to seek care at hospitals,\" he added.The head of the Farabi Eye Hospital in Tehran, Dr Qasem Fakhrai, told Isna, another semi-official news agency, that it had treated a total of 700 patients with severe eye injuries requiring emergency surgery as of 10 January, and referred almost 200 to other hospitals. He said almost all of the patients were admitted after 8 January.Imanemunmusic/XVideo footage from a street in eastern Tehran showed wounded people fleeing the sound of gunfire at a protestSaeed told the BBC that his friend's eyes were hit by birdshot fired by security forces during a protest in the central city of Arak.Local doctors told him to go to a specialist eye hospital in Tehran, he said.Upon arrival, nurses took protesters with eye injuries to operating theatres through the back by using staff lifts.According to Saeed's friend, around 200 people with eye injuries from different cities were being treated at that hospital.\"He had two operations, but the surgeon did not charge him,\" Saeed said.A healthcare worker in Tehran also said that doctors were trying to avoid mentioning gunshot wounds in medical records because they were being constantly monitored by security forces.Vahid OnlineVideo footage from early January showed security forces storming a hospital in Ilam where activists said wounded protesters were being treatedSina took his brother to a hospital after he was shot in the legs during protests in Tehran.\"It was like a battlefield hospital - there were so many wounded that there were no blankets or medical kits,\" Sina told the BBC.\"When I asked a nurse for a blanket for my brother, she told me to bring one from home because there were too many injured and not enough supplies.\"Sina said they had no choice but to give their actual ID number in order to use their health insurance. \"At any moment, the security forces could raid our home,\" he added.In smaller cities, the situation is believed to be even more dire.Reports received by the BBC said security forces had abducted patients from hospitals and that they had not been seen again.HRANADr Alireza Golchini, a surgeon in Qazvin, has reportedly been arrested for treating injured protestersHuman rights groups have also said that medics and others who have treated injured protesters are now themselves being targeted by security forces.Iran Human Rights (IHR) said last week its sources on the ground in Iran had reported the arrest of at least five doctors and a volunteer first responder. \"Security agencies appear to be aiming to intimidate the public and obstruct treatment for injured protesters by arresting doctors and raiding makeshift medical shelters,\" the Norway-based organisation warned.And this week, sources close to Dr Alireza Golchini, a surgeon from the northern city of Qazvin, said he had been beaten up at his home by security forces when they arrested him for treating injured protesters.They added that he had been accused of \"moharebeh\" (enmity against God) - an offence that can carry the death penalty under Iranian law.Additional reporting by Faren Taghizadeh and Maryam Afshang, BBC Persian",

    "body": "6 hours agoErica Witherington,Disability reporterandMaia DaviesBBCMore people with learning disabilities and autism in England suffered deaths classed as avoidable in 2023 than initially thought, corrected figures show.An annual mortality review, commissioned by NHS England and released in 2025, had found that 39% of deaths with a known cause had been avoidable. The figure has now been revised to 40%.The original report was withdrawn in December, with an updated version being released on Tuesday. The NHS said a \"technical issue\" caused the errors in the report, and it \"cannot happen again\".Learning disability charity Mencap called the situation \"deeply upsetting\" while a campaigner said it had left her feeling \"frustrated\".The Learning Disabilities Mortality Review (LeDeR) was established in 2015 as people with a learning disability were known to be dying much younger than the wider population, often from illnesses that should have been treated or prevented.It examines what happened in the lives of people with learning disabilities and autism who died in England, and looks at what healthcare they received, why they died, and whether anything could have been done differently.The review has shown almost the same thing each year - that people with a learning disability die around 20 years younger than others. It has also found that many people die due to issues such as missed diagnoses, delays in care, or treatable conditions that were not acted on in time.The updated research, led by a team at King's College London, found that 963 of the 2,397 deaths of adults with a learning disability reviewed in 2023 - and which had a known cause - were classed as avoidable.At 40%, this is almost twice as high as the general population.It also found circulatory diseases to be the most common cause of death at 17.6%, compared with respiratory conditions in the original report.Among autistic adults without a learning disability, small changes appeared: deaths from suicide, misadventure or accidental death rose from 29.1% to 31.5%, representing a two‑person change.The error has renewed concern from families, campaigners and charities about alleged failings in care for those with learning disabilities and autism.Amanda Cresswell, 54, is part of Staying Alive and Well, a group of people with learning disabilities who helped to create an accessible version of the report.Amanda CresswellAmanda Cresswell said the situation showed people with learning disabilities were not being taken seriouslyShe said she often feels \"very scared\" in hospital, especially when medics use language she \"can't understand\".\"It makes me feel so frustrated,\" she said, adding that she sometimes had to ask people to \"slow down\" and say things \"in a language I can understand\".Asked about the corrected figures, Cresswell said she was \"angry\" and worried about how she herself will be cared for in the future. \"I just feel very upset and frustrated because the people that should be taking us seriously aren't taking us seriously.\"Mencap said it understood around 200 deaths had been reported incorrectly in the initial report, and that the error had a profound impact on families.The charity's chief executive Jon Sparkes said: \"It's deeply worrying the 2023 report was significantly delayed, then published with serious errors and withdrawn.\"This is deeply upsetting for families impacted and must not happen again.\"He added there was \"no excuse\" for failing to support people with a learning disability to access \"life-saving cancer screening and timely diagnosis\".He queried why the report still recorded some people with Down Syndrome as having suffered an \"unavoidable\" cause of death, pointing out: \"You simply cannot die from Down Syndrome.\"This hides the real reasons people died, such as missed screening, late diagnosis or failures in basic care.\"In a written statement to the House of Commons, Dr Zubir Ahmed, the parliamentary under-secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care, acknowledged \"how concerning the retraction will have been for bereaved families and stakeholders who place great trust in the LeDeR process\".\"The updated analysis reaffirms that people with a learning disability continue to experience significant health inequalities: on average, they die 19.5 years younger than the general population and are almost twice as likely to die from an avoidable cause of death,\" he continued.\"This remains unacceptable, and tackling these disparities continues to be a priority for this government.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoJemma CrewBusiness reporterGetty ImagesStarbucks chief executive Brian NiccolStarbucks has scrapped a $250,000 (£181,000) cap on its chief executive's use of the coffee chain's company jet for personal travel because of concerns about his safety.Brian Niccol uses the jet to commute almost 1,000 miles (1,600km) from his family home in Newport Beach, California, to the firm's headquarters in Seattle.Until September, his personal use of the plane was limited to an annual cap, after which he was required to reimburse the company.But Starbucks said it had been lifted after a security review recommended he use it for all air travel due to increased media attention and \"credible threat actors\". The arrangement will now be reviewed every three months.The decision comes as many US companies have been beefing up security for executives, after the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson last year.   Starbucks said a study carried out by an independent third party had \"determined that enhanced personal security measures were necessary for Mr. Niccol's personal safety\".It said: \"Given Mr Niccol's chief executive role, the enhanced media attention to which Mr Niccol and Starbucks are subject, and the current threat landscape, the security study for Mr Niccol also recommended that Mr Niccol use private aviation for all air travel, whether for personal, commuting, or business purposes.\"Starbucks' compensation committee recommended in September that the cap be replaced by a quarterly review of his personal flights, which was approved by board members.When Niccol was announced as Starbuck's new chief executive in summer 2024, replacing Laxman Narasimhan, he came under fire when it was revealed he would be commuting almost 1,0000 miles on the company plane.Critics said there was a discrepancy between Starbucks' public stance on green issues and the lifestyles of its top executives.Niccol's job offer said he would \"not be required to relocate to the company's headquarters\", but added: \"You agree to commute from your residence to the company's headquarters... as is required to perform your duties and responsibilities\".The document stated that he would be eligible to use the company's aircraft for \"business related travel\" and for \"travel between [his] city of residence and the company's headquarters\".Under a time-share agreement, he would reimburse Starbucks for personal use of the jet above a $250,000 annual cap. Given the profile of Niccol and Starbucks in Seattle, the third party review also recommended a \"dedicated car and driver service for ground transportation\" when he travels to the Washington state city where he also has a residence.Niccol received a compensation package of almost $31m in 2025, and more than $95m the previous year.His total security expenses were $1.1m in 2025, a company filing said, plus $997,000 in expenses relating to his use of the Starbucks jet for commuting and personal travel.Niccol was recruited from Chipotle Mexican Grill, where he helped the brand recover from a crisis after food poisoning outbreaks. His task at Starbucks was to stop a sales slump at the coffee chain.His \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy included speeding up service, simplifying its \"overly complex menu\" and reviewing its pricing.Niccol also announced a deal to sell a major stake of Starbucks' China business, cut 2,000 jobs and closed underperforming coffee shops.On Wednesday, Starbucks announced that it had recorded its first sales growth at established stores in the US for two years.US like-for-like sales, which includes stores open at least a year, rose by 4% during the three months to 28 December, 2025, compared with the same period in 2024. Overall, global comparable sales also grew by 4% year-on-year. Total turnover increased 6% to $9.9bn from $9.3bn for the same period in 2024.However, pre-tax profit fell to $764.8m from $1bn. Starbucks said profits had been impacted by \"labor investments\" in support of its turnaround strategy.It also pointed to \"inflationary pressures, primarily driven by tariffs and elevated coffee pricing\".",

The wreckage has now been located in a mountainous area.The official passenger list includes lawmaker Diogenes Quintero Amaya and Carlos Salcedo, a candidate in upcoming congressional elections.Satena earlier said contact with the plane was lost 11 minutes before it had been scheduled to land in the city of Ocaña, near the Venezuelan border, at 12:05 local time (17:05 GMT) on Wednesday.According to the airline, Flight NSE 8849 took off from the city of Cúcuta, about 100km (62 miles) north-east from Ocaña, carrying 13 passengers and two crew members. A search operation was immediately launched in the mountainous area, and a hotline was set up for the relatives of those who were on the plane.

    "body": "1 hour agoEmily HoltOlivia PetterJournalist and author Olivia Petter examines modern dating dilemmas in her book Millenial LoveBreak-ups are tough - you suddenly lose the person you shared everything with. But staying friends with an ex can be equally as painful.\"I don't have many friends who are friends with their exes, actually,\" says Olivia Petter, author of dating handbook Millenial Love. But she has managed it in a couple of cases.Here are the four questions you should ask before deciding whether to stay friends or go no contact.1. How serious was it?\"There are one or two men I've had brief, casual romantic relationships with that have evolved into friendships,\" Olivia told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.\"The fact that we've 'gone there', so to speak, makes it easier for us to have close friendships without any lingering tensions or question marks,\" she says.But when it comes to serious relationships, she says while she's on good terms with them they're not close friends.Dating and relationship coach Kate Mansfield says casual relationships often have less serious life stuff to untangle, so the transition into friendship can be smoother.But occasionally, casual relationships can trigger bigger emotions because they are \"often much more intense,\" she says.\"It depends really on the way it ended, and who ended it, was it a mutual fizzle, or did one person decide it was over? This has more of an impact than time invested in itself,\" says Kate.2. Are you over them?One of the biggest obstacles is whether you are able to separate the romance from the person. \"You need to have processed the break-up, not just moved on logistically, but emotionally,\" Kate says.Consider whether you have enough in common outside of a relationship, such as genuine interests that existed independently of romance, she says. If the  relationship was built entirely on attraction, it will be much harder to continue it. It's also important to be honest about why you want to remain friends. \"If you're still hoping they'll change their mind, or if you're staying connected to monitor their dating life, that's attachment masquerading as friendship,\" says Kate.In the end, staying friends only works if both people have truly accepted the end of the relationship, and neither has an ulterior motive, she adds.3. How much time has passed?Rosie WilbyRosie is also the author of the book 'The Breakup Monologues' about relationships. It can be tricky to transition immediately from lovers to friends.\"It's important to have a little reset and to take some space away to reflect,\" Olivia says. Comedian and author Rosie Wilby says she's been able to maintain successful friendships with her ex-girlfriends.She and her ex Donna broke up just after Rosie's mother had died and they lost all their possessions in a house fire.She says they only ever went no contact for about three weeks.\"That was probably about all we managed, because we had this close bond and we needed each other,\" she says.Now 25 years later: \"Donna feels like a sister to me,\" she says. 4. Is your new partner ok with it?If you do decide to stay friends, then Kate says you need to talk openly about what you are both going to do if the other gets into a new relationship.And if a new partner is uncomfortable with the friendship, Kate stresses you should take their concerns seriously. \"It's not always insecurity; sometimes it's a legitimate concern,\" she says.You may need to have a conversation with your ex to adjust the friendship which could be \"less frequent contact, more group settings, or being more transparent about what you're doing together,\" she says.Olivia says women are conditioned to see male partners' exes as threats.But Rosie says in LGBT communities, it's more common to stay friends with an ex.\"There's a completely different code of conduct,\" she says.When to go no contactKate says there are cases when a friendship isn't possible; if the situation is abusive, emotionally or physically, there has been broken trust or one person is still romantically involved. \"Sometimes the kindest thing you can do for both of you is to accept that this chapter is closed,\" she says.Olivia says: \"The only people I've cut off complete contact with are those who've caused me more serious harm in one way or another.\" She says most of her friends are not in touch with exes.\"I think there's an attitude of leaving the past in the past.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "8 hours agoAbdujalil Abdurasulov,KyivandLaura GozziSoldier describes rescue effort after train drone attackA Ukrainian soldier has described the moment a passenger train was targeted by Russian drones, killing five people.When a carriage on the train was hit in northeastern Ukraine, passengers threw themselves on the floor in panic and the military officer told them to get out immediately. Without his instruction, issued moments before the carriage burst into flames, many more passengers could have died.The officer, whose army call-sign is Omar, is part of Ukraine's 93rd brigade. He was among the passengers travelling on a route from Chop, on the border with Slovakia, to Barvinkove, the last stop before the front line in eastern Ukraine.The first of three Russian drones landed near the train, forcing it to come to a halt. \"Then we heard the rumble of another drone, and then an explosion,\" Omar tells the BBC. \"The blast was so strong that parts of the carriage shattered into splinters.\"As the commander of a drone unit, he quickly realised he and the other passengers had to get out as the train could get hit again. In all, 291 people were on the train at the time, officials say.Omar/93rd brigadeFive people were killed in the attack, which President Zelensky said was \"terrorism\"\"After the second hit, I understood that the drone operator was observing what kind of target it was hitting,\" Omar says, and a stationary train was an easy target.The carriage that suffered a direct hit quickly became engulfed in flames. \"I am in the military and I am prepared for such attacks,\" says Omar. \"But for others it was a shock to be so close to death.\"Many passengers evacuated the train in a state of deep distress, and videos from the scene show people screaming and crying as they move away from the smouldering wreck. It was too dangerous for such a large number of people to stay near the burning carriages, so he urged them to start moving towards a nearby motorway.Omar/93rd brigadeOmar said he realised that the drone operator was keeping an eye on the kind of target he had hitHe then went back to the train with some of the other passengers to check if anyone had been left behind. Inspecting the carriages, he saw a body and continued to look for survivors. Five people lost their lives in the attack.In the final carriage, Omar found a young woman with a baby.\"She was very scared and had no idea what to do but thank God she was alive,\" he says. She barely had time to put on warm clothes, and screamed she needed to go back to the carriage to retrieve her suitcase and documents, the officer says.\"I came here to bring my son,\" she told Omar as she was getting off the train. Later, Omar understood she had been travelling to the front line so that her soldier husband could see their child.The attack on the passenger train in Kharkiv region was condemned by President Volodymyr Zelensky as terrorism.It hit the heart of the railway system - a symbol of resilience in a country where the airspace has been closed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Millions of Ukrainians rely on the 21,000km-long (13,000-mile) railway network to travel around the country and to cross the border into neighbouring countries, from which they can then catch flights.Although the railways have been targeted in the past, by and large Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia rail company has been able to keep people moving on its vast network - although escalating attacks on infrastructure and severe weather have led to increasingly long delays. Trains to the frontline city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region were eventually suspended last autumn, once the area became too dangerous due to sustained aerial Russian attacks. On Wednesday, flags flew at half-mast in railway stations across Ukraine. The daily minute of silence observed across the country was dedicated to the victims of the drone strike on the train.Hours after the attack had taken place, services were running again on the Barvinkove-Chop line.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKaba familyChris Kaba was shot after trying to ram his way past police cars in Streatham, south-east London, in September 2022The family of a man who was shot dead by a police marksman have said they are \"devastated\" misconduct proceedings against the officer have been paused.The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it would wait to issue gross misconduct papers against Metropolitan Police officer Martyn Blake, who shot Chris Kaba in September 2022.A legal change is expected to come into force in the spring over the tests used to bring criminal charges and misconduct proceedings against officers over use of force.The IOPC said it was important its decision took into account impending changes but Kaba's family said it was \"quite correct\" that the officer was facing disciplinary proceedings.Kaba's car was being followed by police in south London as the car had been linked to a previous shooting Brixton, south London, when it was stopped by Blake and his colleagues. After being boxed in by police cars during the stop, Kaba drove backwards and forwards trying to ram his way free.At his trial, Blake said he had feared he or his colleagues could have been killed or injured by the way the car was being driven.In a statement issued through the charity Inquest, Kaba's family said: \"Martyn Blake fatally shot Chris when he was unarmed and without knowing who he was.\"Until today, Martyn Blake was quite correctly facing imminent disciplinary proceedings for that use of force.\"We cannot understand why we, as Chris's family, only learned for the first time today that the Met invited the IOPC to drop proceedings against Martyn Blake back in November.\"We are devastated that the IOPC has decided under this kind of police pressure to put on hold the preparations for Martyn Blake's gross misconduct proceedings.\"PA MediaAbout 150 people gathered in support of Kaba outside the Old Bailey following the verdict of the criminal trialBlake was cleared of murder after an Old Bailey trial, but is still due to face gross misconduct proceedings over the shooting, a decision branded \"nonsensical\" by officers' group the Metropolitan Police Federation and opposed by force bosses.The IOPC ruled in April last year he should face a hearing, a decision welcomed by Kaba's family and Inquest.On Wednesday, it emerged the Met had invited the IOPC to drop the proceedings in November in light of the impending legal change.After Blake's acquittal, then home secretary Yvette Cooper vowed to raise the legal test used by prosecutors to determine whether to bring charges against police officers over use of force, into line with the standard used for members of the public.The test used by the IOPC over whether to bring misconduct proceedings would also be raised to the level used in criminal law, she said.The IOPC said: \"We have decided it is not appropriate to make a decision on whether, in all the circumstances, it's fair and reasonable that Sergeant Blake should continue to face disciplinary proceedings, until we understand the impact of amendments to the use of force standard and any Home Office guidance.\"IOPC director Amanda Rowe added: \"We recognise the impact of this case on everyone affected and it isn't our intention to delay matters any more than necessary, however it's important that our decision takes account of impending changes to the use of force standard.\"'Prolongs the stress'The Met's deputy assistant commissioner James Harman - referring to the officer as NX121 - said the force had made \"strong representations\" to the IOPC that he should not face gross misconduct proceedings.\"The facts have already been fully tested during a criminal trial, which resulted in a jury returning a unanimous not guilty verdict,\" he said.\"In our view, that should have brought this matter to a clear and definitive conclusion.\"We acknowledge the IOPC's decision to pause proceedings, however, this pause must be as short as possible.\"NX121's life has been effectively on hold for more than three years, and every additional delay prolongs the stress and uncertainty that he and his family are living with.\"We also recognise that this delay will be felt deeply by Mr Kaba's family, who continue to grieve their loss.\"He added complex legal frameworks \"serve neither officers nor families\" and delays add to their distress.Matt Cane, general secretary of the Metropolitan Police Federation that represents rank and file officers, said it was the right decision.\"Police officers should not face losing their liberty or livelihoods for doing the job that society expects of them and it has been pleasing to see government acknowledgment of this.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoBrendon WilliamsBBC WalesGetty ImagesAs of 2023, owners of holiday lets must let properties for 182 days a year to qualify for cheaper business ratesChanges to council tax rules are like a \"disease\" that risk \"wiping out tourism in Wales\", an industry body has claimed.As of 2023, owners of holiday lets must let properties for 182 days a year to qualify for cheaper business rates.But the measures, which were introduced in a bid to improve locals' access to properties in holiday hotspots, are often unachievable and forcing owners to sell up, the Professional Association of Self Caterers (PASC) said.The Welsh government, which previously announced plans for \"small changes\" to the rules, said it recognised the \"strength of feeling\" but added 60% of self-catering businesses had met the target.Prior to the changes, properties made available for let at least 140 days of the year - and actually let for 70 - qualified for lower business rates rather than council tax.That system still operates in England. However, changes in Wales mean properties now need to be made available for at least 252 days and actually let for 182.If not, they can be classed as second homes and liable for council tax, which in some areas also means paying an additional premium. In Gwynedd, for example, second-home owners pay the standard council tax rate, plus an additional 150%.Nicky Williamson, of PASC for Wales, described the 182 figure as a \"disease\". \"It has the potential of wiping out tourism in Wales. It is decimating some of our sector and what we continue to do is not recognise that 182 is the problem.\"We're not tackling the root cause of the issue, we're tinkering around with symptoms, we're playing with sticky plasters, and if we don't address the issue - that 182 is too high - it will continue to have a detrimental impact on tourism, possibly to the point of no return.\"'It can't go on'Gwyndaf Pritchard, who runs two holiday lets in Dwygyfylchi, Conwy, said that while some owners failed to meet the 182-day threshold, others only achieved it by reducing nightly rates and profit.He added: \"I was out of my business for six weeks [with] stress-related illnesses because of trying to achieve the 182 nights. \"There is no give in it. You're constantly on the phone looking for that next booking, looking at spreadsheets, trying to achieve the 182 nights.\"It's a 24/7 job and it just can't go on like this.\"Already paying a premium on top of council tax, Pritchard said if things didn't change, he would have to look at selling the business and leaving tourism altogether.'Gun against your head'The Welsh government announced last year it wanted to make what it described as \"small changes\" to the rules by April 2027.These include allowing people to average 182 days per annum, spread over three years. People who missed 182 by a \"narrow margin\" one year would escape high premiums as long as the average over the three years was 182 days or higher.Businesses would be allowed to give away 14 days per year to charity and those days would count as being let.The government said it also wanted local authorities to \"support self-catering operators\" who did not meet the 182-day target by allowing them to pay the standard rate of council tax for a year before higher premiums kicked in.But PASC said giving away 14 nights for free was not viable for many operators, while averaging 182 days across three years would be like having \"a gun against your head for year two and year three\" if operators failed to meet the target in the first year.It has called on all major parties to include a pledge to reduce the 182-day requirement in their Senedd election manifestos.Plaid Cymru's spokesperson for housing, Sian Gwenllian MP, said the party had \"always\" called for a \"proportionate approach\" to implementing the 182-day rule, including where properties would not be eligible as full-time residences.Welsh Conservative shadow cabinet secretary for culture, tourism and sport, Gareth Davies MS, said they would reduce the 182-day occupancy threshold to 105 days in line with the HMRC definition of self-catering accommodation.A Reform UK Wales spokesperson said the party would get rid of the \"tourist tax and the 182-day rule\".In a written statement last week, Welsh Labour finance secretary Mark Drakeford outlined his proposed changes to the rules and said he recognised the \"strength of feeling\" on the issue.But he added: \"Recognising that 60% of self-catering properties have already met the letting criteria, we remain of the view that, for a property to be classified as non-domestic for local tax purposes, it should be let for the majority of the year.\"More top stories",

From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

As a result, no-one will be eliminated in a dance-off on this week's show, with the votes being carried over. La Voix is the alter ego of Chris Dennis, who said ahead of the series that he wanted viewers to get to know the man behind the drag act.The character became a fan favourite last year while finishing as a finalist on RuPaul's Drag Race UK.Exact details of the injury were not revealed. \"My spirit wanted to keep dancing but my foot has other ideas,\" La Voix said in her Instagram post. She added: \"Due to an injury, I've been advised that I'm unable to perform.\"In recent weeks, Strictly viewers have seen La Voix and Škorjanec jive, waltz and foxtrot around the Strictly dancefloor.Last month, actor and Neighbours star Stefan Dennis withdrew from Strictly because of injury while in September, TV personality Dani Dyer pulled out before the show got under way after breaking her ankle. She was replaced by actress Amber Davies.",

    "body": "At least 90 people have died and another 12 are missing after days of heavy rain in Vietnam led to flooding and landslides.The Vietnamese government says 186,000 homes have been damaged across the country, with more than three million livestock swept away. Officials estimate there has been hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage.The mountainous province of Dak Lak has been severely impacted, recording more than 60 deaths since 16 November, according to news agency AFP.The floods are the latest extreme weather event to hit Vietnam in recent months, after typhoons Kalmaegi and Bualoi hit the country within weeks of each other.Some 258,000 people were without power on Sunday morning and sections of major motorways and train tracks were blocked, officials said.Military and police resources have been mobilised to assist in the hardest hit areas.The government said the most severe impacts had been observed in five provinces - Quang Ngai, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Khanh Hoa, and Lam Dong - clustered in south and south-central Vietnam.Mach Van Si, a farmer in Dak Lak, told AFP: \"Our neighbourhood was completely destroyed. Nothing was left. Everything was covered in mud.\"Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính chaired a virtual emergency meeting on Sunday morning from South Africa, where he had been attending the G20 summit. Rainfall had exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas leading up to Friday, with some areas surpassing a 5.2m level not seen since 1993. The rain is forecast to ease in the coming days.Scientists say that Vietnam has been left more exposed to extreme weather events by human-driven climate change, which has made typhoons stronger and more frequent.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondent Rail fares in England next year are to be frozen for the first time in 30 years, the government has announced.The freeze until March 2027 will apply to regulated fares, which includes season tickets and off-peak returns.The most recent fare rise, in March 2025, was 4.6%.Rail fares traditionally have gone up in January, based on the July rate of the retail price index (RPI) + 1% -  although this formula has not always been followed.The announcement comes days before the chancellor sets out the government's financial plans in the Budget, amid a focus on the cost of living.  The government also said the move is intended to \"directly limit inflation\" by holding down \"a major component of everyday costs\".Since 2021, the annual increase has come in March instead of January.A government source acknowledged it was possible unregulated fares would still rise, but insisted they usually followed regulated fares.Unregulated fares increased by 5.5% in the year to March 2025, 1.1% above regulated fares - with a total increase in rail fares of 5.1% in that period. The Rail Delivery Group, a representative body made up of the UK's rail operators, said the freeze would be \"good news for customers\".\"We want our railways to thrive, that's why we're committed to working with government to ensure upcoming railway reforms deliver real benefits for customers,\" a spokesperson said. Since 1996, the government has regulated some train fares following the privatisation of British Rail. The freeze marks the first point since then that fares will have been frozen, although there have been periods where price increases were below RPI, and a dip in prices following the financial crash in 2010. About 45% of rail fares are regulated by the government in England, Wales and Scotland - but the freeze only relates to travel in England. The announcement also only applies to services run by England-based train operating companies.Regulated fares include season tickets covering most commuter routes, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and flexible tickets for travel in and around major cities.Train operators are free to set prices for unregulated fares, but they typically rise by similar amounts.The government estimates that the move will save commuters on more expensive routes more than £300.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the freeze was being put in place to help ease cost of living pressures, and make \"travelling to work, school or to visit friends and family that bit easier\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said it was part of \"wider plans to rebuild Great British Railways\".Great British Railways is a public body which is in the process of being set up, and is part of the government's plans to bring parts of the railway system into public ownership. The government has said it will take over the running and management of the tracks and trains, \"ending years of fragmentation, driving up standards for passengers, and making journey easier and better value for money\".The government has said part of its plans for the new body is to \"gradually move away from annual blanket increases\".Labour said passengers had faced \"relentless\" fare increases every year under the previous Tory government. However, shadow transport secretary Richard Holden said: \"In government, the Conservatives kept fares on the right track with below-inflation rises and consistently called for no further hikes to protect hard-working commuters.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoA majority of Sunday's papers feature comments from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer about US politicians wanting to question Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor over his links to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Sir Keir's suggestion that Andrew should give evidence echoes one he made earlier this month, it nonetheless \"adds to pressure on the disgraced royal\", Sunday People reports.  The Sun on Sunday's story adds that Metropolitan Police officers are searching for emails related to claims Andrew asked royal protection officers to find information on Virginia Giuffre. The prominent accuser of Epstein alleged Andrew had sex with her as a teenager - something the former prince denied. Sir Keir has \"heaped pressure\" on Andrew to testify in the US, is the Daily Mail's assessment. Sir Keir - who was asked about the former prince while attending the G20 summit - told reporters it was \"a decision for him\". But, he added, \"my general position is if you have relevant information you should be prepared to share it\". The prime minister's comments about Andrew also feature on the front page of the Sunday Times, but the paper leads with preparations by the chancellor to \"end the two-child benefit cap\" in her upcoming Budget. Writing in the paper, Rachel Reeves says \"fiscal restraint is a Labour value and necessary to curb inflation\". An exclusive interview with Reeves is the lead for the Sunday Mirror, in which she says \"helping families is her top priority\" at Wednesday's Budget. In the interview, Reeves promises to \"tackle the cost-of-living crisis\", \"cut NHS waiting lists\" and \"reduce the national debt\". Green Party leader Zack Polanski's \"hopes for Britain\" lead this week's Observer. Polanski tells the paper in his vision for a \"green land\", the UK would \"leave Nato\", \"tax the rich\" and \"welcome migrants\". The Sunday Telegraph reports on US President Donald Trump saying a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, after Ukrainian allies voiced concerns over proposals. A large image, alongside the article, shows Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife Olena outside a cathedral in the Ukrainian capital.In other news, defence chiefs are considering a greater use of \"fat jabs\" in the military, the Sunday Express reports. Fighter pilots face strict weight limits so they can safely eject from aircraft - and obesity is becoming \"common\", according to RAF medical professionals. The Daily Star's main story is about crime - specifically, the number of people sent to jail for shoplifting being \"at its highest level in years\". \"More must be done to end the epidemic\", according to experts cited in the paper, which notes that more than 12,000 thieves were jailed last year. Finally, the Independent reports that the prime minister backs the paper's campaign to raise money for the SafeCall service to help missing children. Many of Sunday's papers focus on comments the prime minister made at the G20 summit about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The Mail on Sunday says Sir Keir Starmer has \"piled pressure\" on the former prince to testify to US Congress over what he knew about Jeffrey Epstein. The former Duke of York has so far ignored requests by American politicians to come forward with any information. Sir Keir said it was ultimately up to Andrew but that anybody with information about what he called \"these kind of cases\" should give evidence.The Sunday People says Sir Keir refused to comment on the case of the former prince directly, but said: \"If you have relevant information you should be prepared to share it\". The Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph both point out that Congress cannot force foreign nationals to appear before its committees.England's dramatic loss - from a position of strength - in cricket's first Ashes Test in Australia dominates the sports pages. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the former England batsman Sir Geoffrey Boycott says: \"I can't take stupid England seriously\", highlighting what he calls reckless batting, and a refusal to listen to criticism. In the Sunday Times - which devotes six pages to the defeat - the former England captain Mike Atherton says the loss was one of the most discouraging under the current leadership of Ben Stokes and the coach Brendon McCullum. The Observer describes the England players as having to \"peel themselves off the pitch in a state of disbelief\", after they \"surrendered such a strong position.\"Ahead of her Budget on Wednesday, the Sunday Times says the chancellor is preparing to spend £3bn to end the two-child benefit cap. But it reports she has also insisted that the government will make another attempt to reform welfare. The Sunday Telegraph says Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Rachel Reeves of cowardice for refusing to admit she will raise taxes, by freezing thresholds for another two years. The paper's editorial says all the signs are pointing to \"a brutal assault on Middle England\" in the Budget, squeezing people in work to pay for those on benefits. The chancellor herself tells the Sunday Mirror that she is going to tackle the cost of living crisis. She says working families will be at the front of her mind on Wednesday.The Sunday Telegraph says a move by a Chinese company to take over Thames Water could be blocked. It reports that the government has been urged not to let CK Infrastructure take a controlling stake in the huge water company, which services 16 million customers across London and the south-east - and is more than £20bn in debt. One human rights campaigner warns such a takeover could literally allow China to \"switch off the taps\".And the Daily Express reports that the RAF is considering allowing overweight pilots to use weight loss drugs. The paper notes fighter pilots face strict limits on their weight so they can safely eject from aircraft.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "5 days agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesUS film superstar Tom Cruise has received his first ever Oscar statuette.Cruise, 63, accepted an honorary Oscar at the annual Governors Awards in Hollywood alongside singer-philanthropist Dolly Parton, choreographer Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas.\"Making films is not what I do, it is who I am,\" the four-fold Oscar nominee said on Sunday, accompanying his long-awaited Academy Awards honour with an acceptance speech about his love of cinema.The Top Gun and Mission: Impossible actor paid tribute to film-makers in front of and behind the lens, those he has worked with during his 45-year career, as well as the power of the movies.Upon taking the stage, Cruise received a minutes-long standing ovation and raucous round of applause from film luminaries in the audience, including Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jerry Bruckheimer.Film-maker Alejandro G Iñárritu, who is directing an upcoming Cruise film, presented the actor with the Governors Award. \"The cinema, it takes me around the world,\" Cruise said in his speech. \"It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "5 hours agoBen ChuPolicy and analysis correspondent, BBC VerifyGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget is expected to justify tax increases as a vital measure to keep the UK's national debt under control.Some have argued keeping the national debt down protects the financial interests of younger people. That's because if the country's debt went up drastically, it is younger people who would have to foot the bill to pay for the interest on it. And it would be taken directly from their payslips through higher taxes.Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, have been hit in the pocket over the past 15 years by benefit cuts and dramatic increases in university tuition fees. Meanwhile, the homeownership rate of those born since the 1990s is well below that of earlier generations, due to the relative difficulty they have faced in getting on the housing ladder.However, most politicians, including the chancellor, are also committing to keep paying for the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees it rises each year by the highest of average wages, inflation or 2.5%.There's growing concern that current tax and spending policies help pensioners but are unfair on younger generations, and that the triple lock in particular will push up public spending and the national debt in the long term.So will this budget really help younger generations? Or could it help saddle them with higher taxes and more debt?BBC Verify has been looking at the numbers.Why is the national debt a concern?The UK's national debt currently stands at just under 100% of UK GDP, which is the value of all the goods and services produced by the economy in a year.The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned it could rise above 250% over the next 50 years unless taxes are raised or public spending is reduced.Some economists doubt such a steep and sustained debt surge would actually materialise, arguing it would likely trigger a bond market crisis long before then and see UK government borrowing costs pushed to extreme levels by private investors, which would instead force a change in tax policy or spending.Yet the OBR says the purpose of its long-term projection is to highlight that the UK's public finances are currently on what it calls an \"unsustainable\" trajectory.The biggest driver of rising long-term spending, and therefore the increase in the national debt according to the OBR, is our ageing population, which means the government needs to spend more money on the NHS, social care and the state pension each year.The number of people over 65 is projected to rise from 13 million to 22 million over the next five decades. That would push up the old age dependency ratio - the proportion of older people over the age of 65 relative to people aged 16 to 64 - from around 30% today to almost 50% by 2070.Today the state pension age is 66, but for people born after 1990 it's likely to be pushed higher to keep people working longer and reduce the old-age dependancy ratio.Even so, the national debt would still likely increase significantly from today's level because of these old age spending pressures.Do younger people lose out on public spending decisions?Since 2010, government policy on benefits has tended to help older generations and to take money away from younger generations.Over the past 15 years, the over 65s have received on average an extra £900 a year, while those under 65 have lost an average of £1,400 a year, according to calculations by the Resolution Foundation think tank.The driving force behind this has been the value of the state pension increasing faster than average wages since 2010 because of the triple lock, alongside government cuts to working-age benefits, including housing benefits, unemployment benefits and universal credit.The OBR projects that the triple lock will continue to push up state pension spending further in the coming decades.If the state pension were only tied to increases in average wages then its share of GDP would only rise from 5% today to 6% in 2070, according to the OBR. But instead it projects the cost of the triple lock will push government spending on the state pension to nearly 8% over the next 45 years.That might only be two extra percentage points, but it equates to around £60bn in today's money, and it would be younger working age people who would have to pay for it through their taxes.Which generations will benefit and lose from the Budget?The impact on different age groups will depend on which taxes increase and which benefits are protected.For instance, if high value homes were to face extra taxes, it would affect older people more as they tend to have greater property wealth.If you look at earnings, pensioners still have to pay income tax but are no longer subject to employee National Insurance.And younger people are deemed to have been hit harder by the increase in employer National Insurance contributions Rachel Reeves introduced in her first budget in October 2024, which appears to have slowed down job hiring rates.All taxpayers have a shared interest in seeing the debt burden brought under control as a share of the size of the economy. Though one of the reasons the government borrows is to pay for investment in infrastructure such as roads and housing. Some economists warn that if ministers reduced that kind of spending and borrowing out of concern over the national debt it could prove counterproductive and ultimately damaging to younger people.As for the triple lock, younger people could benefit from its continuation when they eventually retire themselves - and polling shows that 18-49 year olds are broadly in favour of keeping the policy.Nevertheless, in the context of the past 15 years, many economists argue younger people also have an interest in seeing a rebalancing of the treatment of older and younger generations through the tax and benefit system.",

    "body": "Mum of two left penniless by Tinder scammer6 hours agoCatriona MacPheeBBC DisclosurePolice ScotlandChristopher Harkins was jailed for 12 yearsA mother of two says she was left penniless after giving her savings to Tinder predator Christopher Harkins in a fake investment scam.The pair matched on the dating app in London in 2020. Caitlyn - not her real name - told how the fraudster and rapist initially tried to talk her into going on holiday with him - a regular ruse of Harkins, now 38.When she said she couldn't afford a holiday, he offered to \"help\" by doubling what money she had via his foreign currency exchange business.She's one of four women the BBC is aware of who were targeted by Harkins in the capital - where he fled to after his crimes were exposed in Scotland.Caitlyn is one of half a dozen women who shared their traumatic, and often bizarre, experiences with one of Scotland's most prolific romance fraudsters in new BBC Disclosure podcast: Matched with a Predator.Introducing Matched With A PredatorShe said: \"At the start I thought he was very gentlemanly. He was being flash with money.\"He was telling me his business was doing very well and making lots of money. He said he could help me to raise money.\"Harkins used the fake name Christopher Telfer when speaking to Caitlyn, who had recently split from the father of her two young children.She sent him £3,132 in total. \"This money was so precious to me,\" she said.\"I felt very vulnerable at the time because of my situation and he kept offering to invest my money and make more from it. I was naïve. He said to me that whatever money I had, I could send it to him. He wanted to help me.\"When Caitlyn began asking for the money back, Harkins told her his bank account had been frozen. He insisted she had to give him more, in order to get the initial investment back.Caitlyn said: \"I was getting very nervous by now. I had given him all the money I had. \"I was very stressed and worried. He was constantly asking for more money but I didn't have any. He kept saying I could take out bank loans and overdrafts.\"Over text message, Caitlyn asked Harkins to prove the investment wasn't a scam. This suggestion seemed to trigger him.\"He got super angry. He said, 'Don't speak to me like that, you're going to regret speaking to me like that'.\"I was very scared of him at that point. After I refused to send any more, he got very aggressive.\"InstagramHarkins was jailed in in July 2024At one point, Caitlyn's home situation became very difficult. \"I was desperate,\" she said.\"I said to him, 'I'm begging you, I'm really having a difficult time, I have two children, I'm not working'. I was saying, 'Even £200, even £300, just a little bit', but he didn't reply. He completely ignored me.\"Harkins blocked Caitlyn's number. She says she was too scared to report him to the police. She never got a penny back.\"Afterwards I just felt so stupid,\" she said.\"I couldn't even tell anyone for a while. I was so embarrassed. It was a nightmare. Only one friend knew. It was a very horrible time in my life.\"Harkins was first arrested and appeared in court in January 2020This pattern of behaviour was typical of Harkins, who the BBC understands targeted at least 30 women in a raft of crimes spanning almost a decade. He used dating sites such as Tinder to seek new victims.Harkins is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for crimes against 10 women in Scotland, including rape, assaults, recording intimate videos without consent and defrauding more than £214,000 from women he met online.On his dating profile, Harkins presented himself as a jet-setting, business-owning \"gym rat\", but in reality he was a prolific and predatory fraudster.His scams included pretending to book romantic holidays and asking for money for his business because his bank account was frozen.In other cases he pressured women to take out loans of up to £12,000 to give to him. He also used their identities to take out loans himself. One woman was forced into bankruptcy while others spent years paying off debts, suffering mental health issues as a result.Many of the women targeted by Harkins were too ashamed to tell family and friends of their ordeals.After being exposed in a newspaper and arrested in Scotland in early 2020, Harkins fled to London and began using a fake name.The BBC understands Harkins spent time in London throughout his life as his father lived there.Despite the legal threat hanging over him, Harkins continued his scams in England.In January 2023 he was jailed at Isleworth Crown Court for a separate fraud after conning £16,700 from another woman.The BBC's investigation uncovered further alleged frauds by Harkins of almost £70,000. The BBC wrote to Harkins in prison to ask about these allegations. He did not reply.Caitlyn learned about Harkins' other crimes after reading a BBC article in January. It was an emotional moment, realising for the first time that he had targeted other women too.She added: \"I shared it with my friend group and finally told them all what had happened.\"I've decided to report him to the police.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article you can find details of support on the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "10 hours agoGeorgia Roberts,Political correspondent and Patrick JacksonThe government is expected to announce an extra £1.3bn in funding for a scheme encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) at next week's Budget. The Electric Car Grant scheme started in July as part of the move to zero emission vehicles. The government says it has helped 35,000 switch to EVs.However, early research suggests there is little indication the scheme has attracted entirely new buyers. There will also be money to create more charging points, and a consultation on helping people without driveways to charge their cars. It is also possible EV owners could face a new tax elsewhere in Wednesday's Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge in future.All new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force.The Electric Car Grant scheme, which provides a discount of up to £3,750 on eligible vehicles, was launched with an initial fund of £650m.New AutoMotive, a non-profit organisation supporting the UK's transition to electric vehicles, found in a recent study that the scheme had yet to expand the market for EVs.EVs covered by the scheme made up 23.8% of new registrations in September, the same as their share before the Electric Car Grant was announced, New Automotive said.\"It isn't yet clear that it's prompting consumers to consider buying cars that they wouldn't have gone ahead and bought anyway,\" David Farrar, policy manager for New AutoMotive, said at the time.The Budget is also expected to announce a further £200m for speeding up the rollout of chargepoints across the UK.Data from Zapmap shows almost 87,000 points across the UK, in about 44,000 locations. Those include places like supermarket car parks and lamppost chargers.\"The proposed funding will support the creation of thousands of chargepoints and provide extra resources for local authorities to ramp up charging infrastructure on local streets - making it easier for everyone to access reliable charging, including those without off-street parking,\" the government said.Chancellor Rachel Reeves, it added, was \"expected to publish a consultation on Permitted Development Rights to make it easier and cheaper for people without a driveway to charge\".However, it is also possible that EV owners could face a new tax in the Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge from 2028. A government spokesperson told the BBC earlier this month: \"Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there's no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers.\"Reeves is being urged not to raise taxes on drivers overall, with campaigners preparing to deliver a petition to Downing Street early next week which calls for fuel duty, long frozen, not to be increased.Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said that \"handing out £1.5 billion in EV subsidies while hard-working taxpayers are squeezed dry\" was \"madness\".\"Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the Government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,\" the Conservative MP said.  Reeves is expected to increase some taxes in the Budget after saying she means to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.",

    "body": "56 minutes agoJames Chater and Jaroslav LukivUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has insisted that a proposed 28-point plan to end the Ukraine war, which has been widely viewed as favourable to Russia, was \"authored by the US\".It comes after a group of senators said they had been told by Rubio that the draft - which one said he described as a Russian \"wish list\" - did not reflect Washington's position.Rubio later distanced himself from those claims and said the plan came from the US, and was \"based on input\" from both Russia and Ukraine.His intervention came as he flew to Geneva in Switzerland for talks with Ukrainian and European security officials on the plan, which US President Donald Trump has called for Kyiv to agree to swiftly.Ukraine's allies in Europe have pushed back on major provisions in the draft, which has not been made public but details of which have been widely leaked.It includes Ukraine agreeing to withdraw troops from eastern areas which Russia has been unable to take by force, and to limit the size of its armed forces.On Saturday, Republican Senator Mike Rounds said Rubio had told a group of lawmakers that the draft plan was not US policy.He told the Halifax Security Forum: \"What [Rubio] told us was that this was not the American proposal.\"Rounds said he had been assured that the plan was presented to Steve Witkoff, who acts as Trump's overseas diplomatic envoy, by \"someone... representing Russia\". The senator continued: \"It is not our recommendation. It is not our peace plan.\"Shortly after, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Rounds's account of his conversation with Rubio was \"blatantly false\".He wrote on X: \"As Secretary Rubio and the entire administration has consistently maintained, this plan was authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.\"Rubio then posted on social media himself, saying: \"The peace proposal was authored by the US. It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\"On Saturday, Trump - who has made securing a deal to end the conflict a central foreign policy goal during his second term - said the plan did not represent a \"final offer\" for Ukraine, having previously said President Volodymyr Zelensky \"will have to\" approve it.In a post on X on Saturday, Vice President JD Vance said criticism of the proposed peace plan \"either misunderstands the framework or misstates some critical reality on the ground\".  \"There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,\" he said, adding that peace will not be made by \"politicians living in a fantasy land\". When details of the 28-point plan first emerged, Zelensky warned that his country faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over US pressure to accept it, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said it could form the \"basis\" of an agreement.Trump previously gave Ukraine until Thursday to approve the proposal, though said that deadline could be extended if talks progress. Both Rubio and Witkoff will attend the Geneva meeting on Sunday alongside security officials from the UK, France and Germany, as well as Ukraine.Ukraine's allies have already publicly pushed back against the plan, saying in a joint statement issued at the G20 summit in South Africa that it \"would leave Ukraine vulnerable to attack\".It said the plan had elements \"essential for a just and lasting peace\" but would \"require additional work\", citing concerns over border changes and caps on Ukraine's army.The statement was signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two senior EU officials were also among the signatories.Speaking at the gathering in Johannesburg, French President Emmanuel Macron said the plan \"cannot simply be an American proposal\", adding that any agreement had to also guarantee security for \"all Europeans\". German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said \"we are still quite a long way from a good outcome for everyone\".Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer spoke to both Zelensky and Trump on Saturday. No 10 said he briefed the US president on European talks about the plan.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after which Ukraine became heavily dependent on US-manufactured weapons.In its current form, the plan would see Ukrainian troops withdraw from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand further.On Saturday, Zelensky announced that his head of office Andriy Yermak would lead Ukraine's negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal, including any that may involve Russia.\"Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine's national interests and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion, another strike against Ukraine,\" the president said in a video statement posted on social media.",

    "body": "3 days agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

    "body": "'I'm trying to forgive undertaker who kept my dead baby'8 hours agoLinsey SmithEast Yorkshire and LincolnshireBBC/Joe BiltonJasmine Beverley with one of the few keepsakes she treasures from her stillborn son's time in hospitalA mother whose stillborn baby was discovered in a Hull undertakers almost two years after his funeral says she is trying to forgive the man responsible.Jasmine Beverley gave birth to her son, Sunny Beverley-Conlin, prematurely in May 2022. They held a funeral and were given ashes.But two years later they discovered the ashes were not his - and police later found their son's body, still at the funeral home.On Wednesday, former undertaker Robert Bush appeared at Hull Crown Court after an investigation into human remains found at his premises. He pleaded guilty to 35 counts of fraud by false representation, one of which related to Mrs Beverley. He faces a trial on other charges in October 2026.\"I am trying to forgive him,\" said Mrs Beverley, \"but I am finding it hard, there must be some reason why he did this.\"She described Sunny's original funeral service in June 2022 as \"beautiful\". It was held in an on-site chapel at Legacy's headquarters.Following the ceremony, her family were presented with an urn of ashes. They were informed by police in March 2024 they were the remains of an unidentified stranger.Jasmine and her husband Ben Conlin returned those ashes to police. She said she had polished the urn daily and \"whoever was in there, was loved like they were my own baby.\"Mr Bush also admitted deceiving three other women into thinking ashes he gave them were those of their unborn babies.PA MediaRobert Bush denied 30 counts of preventing lawful and decent burials and one charge of stealing money from charity collection boxesHumberside Police began investigating Legacy Independent Funeral Directors in March 2024 after they received a \"call of concern for the deceased\". They announced at the time 35 bodies and the ashes of at least 163 people were recovered from the firm's headquarters.Sunny was the only stillborn baby found at the premises. Mrs Beverley received the call that Sunny had been found whilst she was pregnant with her fifth child. She said it \"ruined\" the final months of her pregnancy and plunged her into a depression. At times she said she had suicidal thoughts.Mrs Beverley said it had highlighted to her how pregnancy loss was still a taboo subject and reliving Sunny's birth had added \"further distress\".If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the can be found at the BBC's Action Line website.BBC/Joe WeirJasmine and her husband keep Sunny's sleeping bag with other keepsakes in a memory boxThe family held a second funeral before Sunny was buried alongside his great-grandparents, Mrs Beverley said she was \"happy that he is finally home\".Reflecting on Mr Bush's guilty plea in relation to her family, she said she felt \"mixed emotions\" because other families were \"playing a waiting game\" for next year's trial.Mr Bush denied 30 counts of preventing lawful and decent burials and one charge of stealing money from charity collection boxes, during Wednesday's hearing at Hull Crown Court.He was bailed until his next court appearance and will be sentenced after the conclusion of his trial.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices",

    "body": "3 hours agoFergus WalshMedical editorA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis according to a new study.Results of a trial in north America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three quarters don't have any form of screening programme.More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood.The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year.  Nearly one in a 100 of those tested had a positive result and in 62% of these cancer was later confirmed.  The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  When combined with breast, bowel and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  Crucially, three quarters of cancers detected were for those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach bladder and pancreas.The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in 9 out of 10 cases.These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.Scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.The topline results are to be released at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Berlin, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer reviewed journal.Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.The lead researcher, Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, Associate Professor of Radiation Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University said the latest data show that the test could \"fundamentally change our approach to cancer screening, helping to detect many types of cancer earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".But Clare Turnbull, Professor of Translational Cancer Genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"Sir Harpal Kumar, President of Biopharma at Grail, told the BBC: \"We think these results are very compelling.  The opportunity in front of us is that we can find many more cancers - and many of the more aggressive cancers - at a much earlier stage when we have more effective and potentially curative treatments.\"Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK said: \"Further research is needed to avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm. The UK National Screening Committee will play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS.\"",

    "body": "How and when to see the Orionids meteor showerImage source, Getty ImagesByShireen Jordan BBC WeatherPrepare yourself for a fireworks spectacle this coming week as the Orionids grace our night sky with the peak of their annual display.The Orionid meteor shower happens 60 miles up in space and is thought to be one of the most impressive displays of the celestial calendar. They are known for being bright and fast and will be visible between until 7 November, peaking for about seven days around the 22 October.The best viewing conditions will be between midnight and dawn.What are the Orionids?Image source, Chris HornbyImage caption, Meteors are often referred to as shooting starsThe Orionids are fast-moving meteors travelling at a speed of around 41 miles per second.They have long streaks of light and originate from the well- known Halley's Comet as it follows its orbit around the Sun. The comet itself only passes by Earth roughly every 75 years, with the next date expected to be the summer of 2061.As Earth passes through debris left by the comet, tiny particles the size of a grain of sand burn up in our atmosphere and leave a streak of light through the sky.  They can appear faint but they leave a distinctive light trail. Larger meteors will produce bright trails. Sometimes meteors can even appear brighter than the planet Venus – these are called fireballs, external.How can I watch the Orionids?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Meteor showers are usually named after a star or constellation that is close to where the meteors appear to originate in the skyThe radiant is the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate, and for the Orionids this is the constellation of Orion.Orion rises in the east after midnight, just to the north of its red-tinged star Betelgeuse. To track down Orion, external, look out for a line of three bright stars, close together, known as Orion's Belt.The quality of the display is measured by how many meteors are visible every hour - known as the zenithal hourly rate. There could be around 15 meteors an hour during the peak of the Orionids around the 22 October travelling at speeds of 148,000mph (238,000km/h).For the best viewing conditions, find a dark spot, away from city lights after midnight with an unobstructed wide, open sky. Let your eyes adjust to the dark and look towards the constellation of Orion. You will not need binoculars or a telescope as the shower will be visible to the naked eye.Will the skies be clear?The arrival of low cloud this week means that opportunities for viewing the shower may be limited.Expect areas of fog, showers interspersed with brighter spells and some thunderstorms. As areas of low pressure continue to sweep in from the Atlantic, there is the potential for the arrival of stormy weather mid-week, which may make it too dangerous to spend any length of time outdoors.But as the peak is just after the new Moon on 21 October, a viewing window may be possible for some when the cloud breaks with no moonlight pollution.Keep across your local forecast on the BBC Weather website or app.",

    "body": "8 hours agoEsme StallardClimate and science reporterA landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks.More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.But US President Donald Trump had called the plan a \"green scam\" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they voted in favour of it.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a \"huge win\" for Trump.But reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a \"plea\" for this not to be repeated.In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year.The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised.The motion passed by just a handful of votes. Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was \"unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change\".\"We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,\" he said.The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards. Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : \"We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.\"\"Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,\" he added.The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain.The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers.Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings. Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position. The deal was first agreed in April after ten years of negotiations and was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.The agreement had meant that from 2028 ship owners would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea. Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive.\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment, told the BBC during the last IMO negotiations.This means without intervention the International Maritime Organisation previously estimated that by 2050 emissions could grow by between 10% and 150%.The meeting this week in London between nations had been to make the final approval and finalise the next steps. But since April the US has been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan which they are concerned could raise prices for goods for its consumers.Posting on Truth Social on Thursday night President Trump wrote: \"The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers.\"With talks now delayed the carefully planned timeline to get the regulations in place for 2028 does not appear feasible. \"A delay in action may require changes to the text of agreement that undermine the planned timeline, and could revert years of work to date,\" said Blánaid Sheeran, an observer to the talks and policy officer at environmental NGO Opportunity Green.

    "body": "6 hours agoEuan O Byrne MulliganJACK GUEZ/AFP via GettyThe government has said it is \"doing everything in our power\" to overturn a ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans attending a football match in Birmingham and is exploring what additional resources could be required.On Thursday, Aston Villa said the city's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) decided that fans of the Israeli club should not be permitted to attend the Europa League fixture on 6 November over safety concerns.Facing mounting pressure to resolve the situation, the government said it was working with police and exploring what additional resources are required.A meeting of the SAG to discuss the match is expected next week, the Home Office said.\"No one should be stopped from watching a football game simply because of who they are,\" a government spokesperson said.They added the government was working with police and other bodies to ensure the game could \"safely go ahead with all fans present\".After it was announced on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer called the move to block fans attending \"wrong\", adding \"we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets\". There has also been criticism from other party leaders.The SAG, which advises the council on whether to issue safety certificates, will review the decision if West Midlands Police changes its risk assessment for the match, Birmingham City Council said.On Thursday, West Midlands Police said it had classified the fixture as \"high risk\" based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including \"violent clashes and hate crime offences\" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam in November 2024.More than 60 people were arrested over the violence, which city officials described as a \"toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger\" over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East.The Home Office was briefed that restrictions on visiting fans might be imposed last week, but the BBC understands officials were not informed about the final decision until Thursday.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the revelation left the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, with \"serious questions to answer\" about why her department did \"nothing\" to avert the ban.She said: \"This is a weak government that fails to act when required.\"A source close to Mahmood told the BBC that \"this is categorically untrue\".\"The first time the home secretary knew that the fans were being banned was last night,\" they added.Getty ImagesMaccabi Tel Aviv fans gathered ahead of last year's match with Ajax in AmsterdamThe decision has also been criticised by the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK, as well as Israeli government officials.But the Green Party backed the decision, saying it was \"irresponsible\" for Starmer to question a local authority's safety decision.Ayoub Khan, an independent MP for Birmingham Perry Barr who campaigned on a pro-Gaza platform in last year's general election, said the decision to ban fans was a \"moral question\" and not just about public safety.Speaking on BBC's Politics Midlands, Khan said the rules applied to \"Russian football teams which have been banned from European competitions because of their atrocities in Ukraine\" should also \"apply with Israeli football teams\".Khan, who has also raised concerns about safety and public order, said that even if additional resources were provided to West Midlands Police, the fans should not be allowed to attend, citing last year's violence in Amsterdam.Emily Damari, a British-Israeli citizen who was held hostage in Gaza and released in January, said she was \"shocked to my core with this outrageous decision\".Ms Damari, who described herself as a \"die-hard fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv\", said: \"Football is a way of bringing people together irrespective of their faith, colour or religion and this disgusting decision does the exact opposite.\"Several sporting events have seen protests over the war in Gaza, including in recent World Cup qualifiers.Earlier this month, 22 people were arrested near the Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo when  Israel's national team played Norway. Reports said tear gas was used after several demonstrators broke through police barriers.A few days later, Israel's national team played its next qualifier against Italy in the northern city of Udine, where around 5,000 protesters took part in a march ahead of the game. Clashes with police broke out, with a number of people arrested.In Spain on Wednesday, a protest over Euroleague's basketball game between Valencia and Hapoel Tel Aviv saw several people arrested.",

    "body": "Buying more, wearing less - why India's Diwali gold rush is different1 hour agoAnahita SachdevDelhi andNikhil InamdarMumbaiGetty ImagesMore Indians are choosing buying gold for investment purposes this festive seasonAhead of the Hindu festival of Diwali, the jewellery market in Indian capital Delhi's vibrant Lajpat Nagar neighbourhood is teeming with crowds.Shops have stayed open even on holidays, and at dusk, dozens of cars line up the streets as a string of flashy signboards beckon shoppers into the flower-adorned stores.Soaring gold prices - which have topped $1,440 (£1,081) for 10g - may have slightly dented demand for jewellery in the world's second largest market for the yellow metal this year, but Indians are not willing to entirely give up on their penchant for gold yet.Diwali, along with Dhanteras -  a smaller festival that falls on Saturday this year - are believed to be auspicious occasions to buy precious metal, with hundreds of thousands of Indians flocking the markets to buy gold and silver coins, bars and jewellery, which they believe bring wealth and luck.Skyrocketing prices have created FOMO - or the fear of missing out - in the minds of buyers, who are worried prices might rise even further, Prakash Pahlajani, who runs Kumar Jewels, a family-owned business, told the BBC on a busy evening at his shop.\"As a result, I have more customers this year,\" Mr Pahlajani said.But with prices - gold is up 60% and silver 70% - shooting through the roof, jewellers are having to change tack to counter stagnant customer budgets.\"People are not saying 'I don't want to buy'. Instead, they are saying, 'I'll buy a little less,\" said Tanishq Gupta, another jeweller down the road from Mr Pahlajani's shop. He said he's had to be innovative and design pieces that look elaborate but have a reduced quantity of gold in them. A coin made of 250mg gold, which he sells for as low as $35, is now thinner but made to look as big as the heavier ones.Coins weighing a tenth of that, at 25mg, are also on offer in the market.Pushpinder Chauhan, another retailer in the area, said higher prices had also exacerbated the growing preference for lighter jewellery this year, \"especially among younger buyers\" who want pieces for everyday wear and not just special occasions.Retailers are selling gold coins weighing as low as 250mg to keep the demand goingSeveral jewellers the BBC spoke to pointed to another clear trend - more customers were buying gold and silver for investment rather than jewellery this year, something that is also reflected in bullion market data.While gold jewellery continues to account for the largest share of India's overall gold demand, the proportion driven by investment - primarily bars and coins - has been rising steadily, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).\"Jewellery's share declined to 64% in the second quarter of this year, from 80% in the same period in 2023, while investment demand increased from 19% to 35% over the same period,\" Kavita Chacko, the council's research head, told the BBC.A lot of that demand is also being fed by investment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or digital gold, where September marked record high inflows.ETF assets under management have surged by over 70% this year.Besides retail demand, gold prices are also being significantly influenced by India's central bank, with the metal's share in its foreign exchange reserves rising from 9% to 14% in 2025, according to WGC.In fact, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been \"a major pillar of global gold demand over the past three years\", said Kaynat Chainwala who tracks commodities at Kotak Securities, a broking house.She said the RBI has been stocking up on gold in a bid to diversify its foreign exchange holdings, reduce its dependence on the dollar and provide stability during geopolitical stress.Those in the business say there's a clear shift in demand from heavier to lighter jewelleryGoing forward, with the festive and the wedding season under way, retail demand for gold and silver is expected to continue to hold up despite record-high prices, say experts.\"The affluent classes will continue to buy, though it is a setback for lower income families,\" said Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at the state-run Bank of Baroda. \"Demand will hold up in value terms, even though volumes will fall.\"But some families have been totally priced out of the market. \"I am now having to think a lot while buying - about whether to even get something,\" Bhavna, who's getting married in February, told the BBC outside Mr Pahlajani's jewellery store.For the moment, she's held off her purchases and is waiting for prices to fall a bit so that she can come back to finish her wedding shopping. NurPhoto via Getty ImagesMany Hindus purchase gold and silver during Diwali for good luck and prosperity Such strong cultural affinity for physical gold, particularly jewellery, means the appetite for the noble metal is unlikely to be dented in the long term, despite the short-term moderation, say experts.This is especially true for a country where high gold holdings have given solid long-term returns, making many Indians affluent at a time when growth is stumbling and jobs are hard to come by.According to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held a staggering $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's GDP.\"This implies a positive wealth effect on the household balance sheet, given the uptrend in gold prices,\" Economists Upasana Chachra and Bani Gambhir wrote in a recent note, adding that Indian families are also benefitting from \"cyclical factors of lower interest payments with monetary policy easing, and the positive impact on disposable income through direct and indirect tax cuts\".That's not a bad start to the festive season, even though record prices may have taken some glitter off the precious metal.

    "body": "2 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPrince Andrew is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, he has announced in a personal statement.He has been under increasing pressure over his links with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with calls for Buckingham Palace to take action against him.That now seems to have resulted in the prince deciding to voluntarily hand back his titles and to give up membership of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.In his statement he said he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".\"In discussion with the King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" said a statement from Prince Andrew.\"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.\"I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"Andrew's decision to stop using his titles was made in consultation with the Prince of Wales as well as the King.Prince Andrew has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including a court case he settled with Virginia Giuffre, questions about his finances and his involvement with an alleged Chinese spy.He will remain a prince - but will cease to be the Duke of York, a title received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth.Andrew had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.His ex-wife will be known as Sarah Ferguson and no longer Duchess of York, but their daughters will continue to have the title of princess. He is expected to stay in his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, on which he has his own private lease which runs until 2078.Prince Andrew has faced intense scrutiny over his links with disgraced financier Epstein, more recently including questions about when he had really cut off contact.In his BBC Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew had said that he had severed all links with Epstein after they had been photographed together in New York in December 2010.But emails sent in February 2011 later emerged suggesting that Andrew had privately stayed in touch with Epstein, including swapping a message: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\"There had been growing frustration in Buckingham Palace at the scandals that continued to surround the prince.Next week a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year, will be published, which is likely to cast further attention on Prince Andrew's involvement with Ms Giuffre and Epstein.Ms Giuffre claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.She alleged that Andrew had sex with her at his friend Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London in 2001, when Ms Giuffre was aged 17.Her memoir describes two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.Prince Andrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him. He denies all the accusations made against him.Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Sky Roberts, the brother of Ms Giuffre, said Prince Andrew's announcement had brought mixed emotions, but that his late sister \"would be very proud\" of the development.\"We have shed a lot of happy and sad tears today. I think happy because in a lot of ways this vindicates Virginia,\" Mr Roberts said.\"All the years of work that she put in is now coming to some sort of justice,\" he added.Sky also called on the King to \"potentially go ahead and take out the 'Prince' in the Andrew.\"Also speaking to BBC Newsnight, Epstein accuser Haley Robson said it was a \"bittersweet\" moment.Ms Robson said Ms Giuffre \"started this fight and we're going to see it through\", adding that \"I really wish that she could have been here to see all of what she started\".\"Having him [Prince Andrew] step down and be stripped of his titles is something that is long delayed, and it is very appropriate, and kudos to King Charles,\" Ms Robson said.Andrew withdrew from Royal Family events last Christmas after an alleged Chinese spy who he was linked to was named in a High Court judgement.His office said nothing sensitive had ever been discussed with Yang Tengbo, also known as Chris Yang, who became a close advisor on Andrew's business ventures.In 2022, Andrew was repeatedly named in a court dispute between a Turkish millionaire and her former business adviser.There were no suggestions of wrongdoing by the prince, but the court case highlighted the prince as receiving payments in a complex set of financial deals. A gift of £750,000 was returned to the Turkish millionaire by the prince.",

    "body": "Zelensky guarded on Tomahawk missile talks with Trump after White House meeting2 hours agoBernd Debusmannat the White House andJohn SudworthKyivGetty ImagesPresident Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have come away empty-handed from a White House meeting after US President Donald Trump indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Zelensky said after the cordial bilateral that he and Trump had talked about long-range missiles, but decided not to make statements on the issue \"because the United States does not want an escalation\".Following the meeting, Trump took to social media to call for Kyiv and Moscow to \"stop where they are\" and end the war.The Trump-Zelensky meeting came a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone, and agreed to meet him in Hungary soon.Zelensky believes using Tomahawks to strike at Russian oil and energy facilities would severely weaken Putin's war economy. While Trump did not rule it out, his tone at the White House on Friday was non-committal. \"Hopefully they won't need it, hopefully we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks,\" the US president said, adding that America needed the weapons.Trump said sending the missiles would be \"an escalation, but we'll be talking about it\".Asked by the BBC if the Tomahawks had prompted Putin to meet Trump, the US president said: \"The threat of that [the missiles] is good, but the threat of that is always there.\"Trump tells BBC Putin 'wants to make a deal', cites threat of TomahawksThe Ukrainian leader suggested his country could offer drones in exchange for the Tomahawks, prompting smiles and nodding from Trump.Zelensky also complimented Trump on his role in securing the first phase of a peace deal in the Middle East, suggesting the US leader could build on that momentum to help end Russia's war in Ukraine. Outside afterwards, Zelensky was asked by a reporter if he thought Putin wanted a deal or was just buying time with the planned meeting with Trump in Budapest. \"I don't know,\" he said, adding that the prospect of Ukraine having Tomahawks had caused Russia to be \"afraid because it is a strong weapon\".Asked if he was leaving Washington more optimistic that Ukraine would get the Tomahawks, he said: \"I am realistic.\"In a post on X, Zelensky said he had called European leaders to share details of the meeting with Trump, adding that the \"main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe.\"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the call with European leaders was \"productive\" and promised that \"the UK will continue to send humanitarian aid and military support\".In recent days, Trump had shown an openness to the idea of selling the Tomahawks, although Putin warned that such a move would further strain the US-Russian relationship.On Thursday, Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks soon in Hungary.Asked whether Zelensky would be involved in those talks, Trump said before his meeting sitting alongside the Ukrainian president that there was \"bad blood\" between Putin and Zelenksy.\"We want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" he said. \"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated.\" He added that the three leaders \"have to get together\". Watch: BBC Ukrainian asks Trump about upcoming meeting with PutinTrump said his call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow would meet next week.Trump had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war, but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough.They spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Back in Ukraine, the BBC spoke on Friday to a couple repairing the small store they own in a suburb of Kyiv, after it was obliterated by Russian missiles last month.When the store-owner, Volodymyr, was asked about Trump's forthcoming summit meeting with Putin, he began to say: \"We appreciate all support\".But he stepped away as tears welled up in his eyes. After a long pause, he composed himself and started again.\"Truth and democracy will win, and all the terrorism and evil will disappear,\" he said. \"We just want to live, we don't want to give up, we just want them to leave us alone.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPA MediaPrince Andrew faced growing questions over his links to Jeffrey EpsteinAfter so many scandals, Prince Andrew has given up the use of his titles and honours.He can no longer sign off as the Duke of York, or put \"KG\", a Knight of the Garter, after his name, with a flourish of medieval chivalry. The Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh are also scratched off his list of titles, with \"Andrew Inverness\" a name he'd sometimes used in his business dealings.But what's caused this sudden announcement? Particularly as this dramatic move, removing the remaining vestiges of his royal life, comes with an assertion of his innocence and that he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".PA MediaPrince Andrew will no longer be at the Order of the Garter ceremoniesPrince Andrew has voluntarily given up the use of his titles - but he was clearly under pressure to jump before he was pushed.This way, the changes in his status are kept in-house and there doesn't have to be the intervention of Parliament, which would have needed to legislate to take away his title as Duke of York.That would have been messy, but the Palace was already sending signals it was prepared to take action, and it was confident that Parliament, and popular opinion, would have supported such a change.Allowing Andrew to voluntarily give up his titles, which theoretically remain in place, gave him a way out, still holding on to a little of the disappearing vapour trail of his pride.But it's no secret that Buckingham Palace was exasperated with the scandals surrounding Prince Andrew and what a royal source calls the \"constant parade of headlines\". He was one of their \"Dukes of Hazard\" that kept making news for all the wrong reasons.Questions about Andrew's links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were drowning out the work of the rest of the Royal Family. That was on top of unanswered questions about Andrew's finances and his connections to an alleged Chinese spy.ReutersPrince Andrew and King Charles at the funeral of the Duchess of Kent last monthNext week will see an historic state visit by the King and Queen to meet Pope Leo at the Vatican, and there was a deep irritation that such a solemn occasion was going to be overshadowed by lurid stories about Andrew and Epstein.According to royal sources, a \"tipping point\" had been reached and something had to be done. Arguably that should have happened earlier. But that would also have meant the Palace publicly accepting that it had a responsibility for Prince Andrew, when it had so long argued that as a \"non-working royal\", his problems were his own to resolve.But this latest move shows a recognition that even if Andrew isn't a royal responsibility, it's still their reputation he's been damaging.What added to the sense of this no longer being a tenable position was an email published last weekend that showed Prince Andrew had stayed in touch with Epstein longer than he had claimed in his BBC Newsnight interview.A royal source said this was a significantly different moment when there were such clear \"fault lines\" exposed in Prince Andrew's version of events.Curiously, the same email had been partially published in January - again showing that Andrew had not cut ties to Epstein when he had claimed - but this time in October the impact has been like the pebble that has started an avalanche.It followed a similar awkwardness for Sarah Ferguson, where a private email contradicted her own public claims to have cut links with Epstein.And it added to the pressure from extracts published from a posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, the Epstein victim who had reached a financial settlement with Prince Andrew, and had earlier this year taken her own life.Getty ImagesVirginia Giuffre's memoir raises more questions about Andrew and EpsteinMs Giuffre's memoir, to be published next week, once again casts Andrew into toxic associations with Epstein.And the book's accusation that Prince Andrew was \"entitled\" echoed the title of a recent biography of Prince Andrew, by Andrew Lownie, that took another wrecking ball to his reputation.It's been a landslide of bad news, month after month, that showed no sign of losing momentum. He'd become the disastrous football manager, or the damaged political leader, who had no obvious way of being removed. Particularly when it was like a football manager whose brother was the chairman.There's always a tension between protecting an institution and a reluctance to remove the individuals within it. Even more so when the institution is also a family. It's where the Godfather movies meet the Crown.But something had to be done, and in the end, Andrew has handed back the keys to his royal life and walked away. More could still emerge in the United States in the trawling of documents related to Epstein.Ominously for Prince Andrew, among those quick to respond on Friday evening was the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee that has been pushing for the release of Epstein material.Robert Garcia, whose colleagues recently revealed documents showing an \"Andrew\" getting massages on Epstein's private jet, said: \"His decision to give up his royal titles is long overdue.\"\"We know rich and powerful men used their money and power to abuse girls and young women, and to shield themselves from justice. Prince Andrew's decision is just the beginning in the committee's work to deliver justice for the survivors.\"Prince Andrew has always denied wrongdoing but this has become a global story.When US President Trump arrived for his state visit, it was a picture of Andrew and Epstein that protesters projected on to the walls of Windsor Castle.Prince Andrew's decision to step away from his remaining titles will also mean he stays in step with his ex-wife, who is no longer the Duchess of York. They are back to where they began when they first met - as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.They still live together and as Prince Andrew has his own long lease on Royal Lodge, they'll carry on there as before. The King had already financially cut off Prince Andrew, so there isn't any change there, he'll have to find his own funding.But by voluntarily stepping back, rather than being stripped of their honours, it means that their daughters will carry on with the titles of princess.Prince Andrew won't be at the royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham this year. And the guessing game about seeing him at the Order of the Garter parade won't happen again.But are the questions about his conduct really over?",

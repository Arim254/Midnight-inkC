    "body": "Lewis Hamilton has warned McLaren's title contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's \"cut-throat\" character as the three head into the final five races of the season.Piastri leads the championship by 14 points from Norris, while Verstappen is 40 points off the lead after three wins and a second place in the past four races.Hamilton, who fought an intense and bitter championship battle with Verstappen in 2021, said: \"In that scenario it's challenging, the pressure is high. It is a time when you have to put your blinkers up and block everything from the outside.\"You have to be cut-throat and that is what Max is, he is going to take this from them if they don't do the same.\"You have to dig deep to hold off someone like Max and the car he is in. But also for either of them to come out ahead, consistency is key, and you've seen that from Max in the last few races.\"The seven-time champion said that Verstappen had the easiest job as the driver coming from behind - he was 104 points adrift of Piastri after the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August.\"You have three incredibly talented drivers and I can't predict how they're going to behave,\" added Hamilton.\"Max has won it four times so he knows what it's like and being the hunter is much easier than being the defender.\"When you're in the lead and someone is chopping away at your lead, that plays on you more than if you're chasing and you have nothing to lose. In the lead you have everything to lose.\"Mercedes driver George Russell, who won in Singapore two races ago, said: \"The McLaren guys have the fastest car so it's theirs to lose. But Max and Red Bull are doing an amazing job so you can never discount them.\"They showed signs of great pace at the start of the year but it was pretty inconsistent, whereas now week in, week out they are smashing it.\"The McLaren drivers go into the final five races free to race with each other and with no internal team rules hanging over them - other than not to crash with one another.Norris had been facing undefined \"repercussions\" after colliding with Piastri while taking third place from him at the first sequence of corners in Singapore.Following the crash between the two at the start of the sprint at the US Grand Prix last weekend, these have now been removed.\"There is a degree of responsibility from my side in the sprint and we are starting this weekend within a clean slate for both of us, just going out and going racing,\" said Piastri.The Australian, who won at Zandvoort, has seen his lead erode after being beaten by Norris in each of the past four races, but he said he had also been surprised Verstappen had come into the equation so quicky.\"The run of form he's had since Monza has been a bit of a surprise,\" said Piastri.\"There were flashes earlier in the season but there were also some pretty big dips. We know they have been throwing a lot of things at their car trying to improve it but he has come to the fight quicker than I expected.\"However, when asked if he was concerned about Verstappen, Piastri said: \"It's not really something I think about. He has been consistent and strong the last few weekends but there is no benefit in worrying about or focusing on that.\"The thing that's going to help me win the championship is get the most out of myself, the car, the team. He's there, he's in the fight but ultimately it doesn't change how I go about my racing.\"Norris added: \"Max has had very good form the last month or so. They have been performing better than we have.\"He has won a good amount of races and he's Max Verstappen. You'd be silly if you didn't want to give Max a chance.\"At the minute, they are in better form, a lot of races they have been quicker. But we still have chances. We have a better car from now until the end of the season and we just have to make use of that.\"Verstappen said: \"It's clear we had a good run, definitely been enjoying it a lot more like that and we will try to carry that momentum forward. We know we need to be perfect to the end to have a chance, but we just try to maximise everything and see where we end up.\"Red Bull were fined 50,000 euros (£43,500) after the US Grand Prix, when one of their team members was on the grid after it was supposed to be cleared because he was trying to remove the tape McLaren had put on the pit wall to help Norris park his car in the right place.Norris said he found the situation \"very amusing, especially because I didn't even use the tape, so even better\".He added: \"I used it for back up. I didn't need to use it in Austin. We already knew that they were doing it. They tried to take tape off and failed - they failed and got a penalty. Pretty funny.\"Piastri described Red Bull's actions as \"gamesmanship\", adding: \"They're within their rights to do it. They were on the grid too late doing it. Everyone will have their own opinion on whether it's necessary or not.\"Verstappen said: \"We didn't get fined because of the tape. It is just a little silly thing that has been going on for a while and it is not something I pay a lot of attention to because I focus on my own parking in the box.\"",

    "body": "From 300 sit-ups a day to 6,000 calories - inside Aspinall's fight campMedia caption, What UFC heavyweight champion Aspinall eats in a dayByPaul Battison in Abu DhabiBBC Sport JournalistEach morning Tom Aspinall drops his kids off at school - the same school he used to go to when he was younger - before turning up at his father Andy's house which is just round the corner.It is here in the Greater Manchester town of Atherton, on a 20-minute car journey to the gym, where the magic happens.Andy has been 32-year-old Aspinall's head coach since the age of eight, providing the perfect platform for his son to flourish in becoming Britain's first UFC heavyweight champion.The pair's conversation in the car can cover a range of topics, but for the past three months they have had one focus - the best way to defeat Ciryl Gane on Saturday at UFC 321 in his first defence of his belt.\"We've had millions of hours in the car all our lives and we chat. We just construct a training session. He'll say 'I need to work on my left hand today' and I'll say 'I don't think you do',\" Andy tells BBC Sport.Andy laughs in a warm, joking manner as he tells the anecdote about Tom's left hand, suggesting they don't always agree at first on what to work on in the gym that day.But this dynamic is healthy, and constructive criticism amid an enjoyment of the sport and drive to get better is key to the Aspinalls' philosophy.It is this philosophy which has formed the bedrock of the camp to prepare for former interim champion Gane, who is likely to provide the biggest test of Aspinall's 18-fight career to date.From doing 300 sit-ups a day to eating 6,000 calories, BBC Sport takes a look at Aspinall's intense training camp.Why cardio is king in camp AspinallIn preparation to face Gane, Aspinall and his team have made one major change compared with previous fight camps - they have prioritised cardio.\"My opponent moves really well, so I'm gonna have to keep up with him moving,\" Aspinall tells BBC Sport.\"He's very athletic. He's got great cardio so I obviously want to be able to match that or get as close to it as possible.\"Aspinall is not used to long fights in the UFC. In nine bouts eight have finished in the first round, with Aspinall having the shortest average fight length in UFC history at two minutes, two seconds.Gane's average fight length on the other hand is 14 minutes, 15 seconds, with only two of his 12 fights finishing in the first round.Masterminded by Andy, Aspinall has his own gym now, where he trains with a select group of heavyweights and light-heavyweights, including the UFC's Modestas Bukauskas and Ante Delija.There are only four to eight fighters in the gym on a given day and only two people spar at once, so Andy's attention can be focused on Aspinall.\"I've always been there in his corner,\" says Andy.\"The past four years I've done every day with him so I don't miss anything. I see everything.\"To improve Aspinall's cardio, he has been prioritising body work, which can include around 200 burpees a day, 300 sit-ups a day and numerous sets of 10 press-ups.\"It's not about moving a weight or pulling something or throwing something, it's about moving yourself, so this camp he's done a lot of that,\" explains Andy.Despite the improvements in Aspinall's cardio he would still prefer to end the contest early.\"I'd much prefer a short fight, but if I have to do a long fight, that's fine,\" says Aspinall.From 6000 calories to 10 litres of waterTo supplement the extra cardio work, Aspinall has been eating over 6,000 calories a day and drinking between eight to 10 litres of water.\"This is boring - are you ready for this?\" Aspinall warns BBC Sport, before describing his strict diet.Aspinall usually eats porridge for breakfast, alongside a couple of protein shakes which include peanut butter and blueberries, which can top 1,000 calories.Before morning training he drinks eloctrolytes, and refuels afterwards with a banana and another protein shake.Lunch involves chicken, rice, yoghurt and fruit, before loading up with more protein, carbs and electrolytes in preparation for his late afternoon training session.Aspinall finishes the day with a large portion of steak, eggs and rice and polishes it off with a final protein shake.Of the 6,000 calories, Aspinall says around 2000 a day get burned off during his \"heavy\" training sessions.Tape, reactions and realityAspinall prioritises sleep when he gets home after training but for Andy, this is the time when he often watches fight footage of Gane.\"Tom watches him too but he doesn't have any say in what we're going to do for eight to 12 weeks,\" says Andy.Aspinall and his team respect Gane and they know the nature of heavyweight MMA, where the tide of the fight can turn in an instant, means preparation can sometimes be thrown out of the window.\"You never know what you're doing outside of fight training, if it's working or not, until you get in the fight, and then you don't know what's going to happen in the fight,\" says Andy.\"I just think Tom's got to be trained as good as he can be and his body's got to be able to react.\"Aspinall spent 19 months as interim champion waiting for an undisputed title fight with Jon Jones to materialise before the American retired.In that time, Aspinall defended the interim title once against Curtis Blaydes, 15 months ago.Aspinall ends the interview by revealing his desire to get the heavyweight division moving again.\"I just want to be active. I think one of the things about the heavyweight champ is, they've not been very active,\" said Aspinall.\"So I would like to fight regular. Twice, three times a year, and keep the division moving.\"",

    "body": "Media caption, BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Mariona CaldenteyByAdam MillingtonBBC Sport journalist and Sophia HartleyBBC World ServiceAge: 29 Position: Midfielder Teams: Arsenal and SpainMariona Caldentey joined Arsenal last summer and helped deliver the club a second Champions League crown.She hit the ground running, adding a creative nous and cutting edge to an already strong squad.Her performances were so impressive following her move from Barcelona that she was named the WSL's player of the year.She made history for her country, too, as Spain reached the Euro 2025 final, where she netted against England, albeit missing out on the title after her country's defeat in the penalty shootout. Caldentey was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or and was also named in Uefa's Champions League and the Professional Football Association's teams of the year.'Winning Champions League was meant to be'Caldentey on moving from Barcelona to Arsenal:\"It was sad but exciting at the same time. I just felt it was the moment for me for a new challenge. I had spent a really lovely 10 years in Barca, in football, out on the pitch as well. \"It felt like it was maybe a bit of a crazy decision because I was in a really good place and really comfy there but I think now it's easy to say it was the right decision. From the first moment I arrived at Arsenal, everybody made it really easy for me so I enjoy it a lot and I'm really happy to be here.\"On what has worked so well at Arsenal: \"I feel so confident playing here. The coaches listen to me, they want the best of me so they just help me in that sense. It's the same with the team-mates: I can make them better and they can make me better. It's a win-win. It's always about the team performance. I think it needed a bit of time in the beginning but I think when I figured it out a bit - my position as well, my team-mates a bit more - it was fantastic.\"On her emotions during the Champions League final:\"Playing in the final, it was really hard and weird for me. I'm normally not nervous for playing games. It was a special day but I was a bit nervous as well, of course because it was a final but also because it was against my friends, my ex-team-mates, the staff. Everything I've just left behind and the same year you play against them in a final. It was just meant to be and it was a really special journey during the whole Champions League. We are so happy that Arsenal could win it again after 18 years.\"On reaching the Euro 2025 final with Spain:\"It still hurts a bit when I think about the final. We need to remember that we made history because we have never played even in a semi-final. It was a big step in the Euros for us as a team. It's good that we continued making history but of course the main goal was to win. England were better than us so we have to congratulate them. I think we have a really strong national team, we are a brilliant generation and we're just going to keep going.\"WSL's standout creative talent - analysisByChris CollinsonBBC Sport statisticianWhile three players provided more assists from open play in the Women's Super League last season, Caldentey was arguably the most creative player overall.She both created the most chances (43) and had the highest expected assists from open play (6.9) in the league, with only her team-mates' finishing preventing her from adding more assists to her name.The Arsenal midfielder didn't just impress with what she did on the ball though, as she worked tirelessly to win it back too.Only Tottenham's Ashleigh Neville made more tackles and interceptions than her in the Women's Super League last season and no player won possession back in the final third more often.'One of the most complete footballers in the world' - analysisByFootball tactics correspondentCaldentey's positional versatility has led to her playing on both wings, number 10 and in midfield throughout her career. But last season she impressed in a slightly different role, as part of a midfield duo.Despite starting in central midfield, it was her work moving up the pitch and into wide areas that allowed her to interpret the position in a unique way.Rigid positional systems can become predictable to defend against but Caldentey often floated towards the left flank.Her ability to play out wide with ease allowed her team to build-up around opponents' press, finding her wider at times. Chance creation from the flanks was also a hallmark of the teams she played for and by interacting closely with her left winger, she was able to help get the ball into the final third.Out of possession, Caldentey's ability to win the ball back high up the pitch was unrivalled last season, winning the ball in the opponent's third more than anybody in the WSL. This was while creating the most chances from open play in the league too.Caldentey's industry and duelling, paired with her technical quality both centrally and out wide, made her one of the most complete footballers in the world last season.Last season's achievements",

    "body": "Gold and tech purchases drive strong retail sales41 minutes agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThere was strong demand for gold jewellery among shoppers over the summerRetail sales volumes have risen for the fourth month in a row, driven by consumers buying gold online and new tech gadgets. Monthly sales rose by 0.5% in September 2025, new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show, defying an expected decrease of -0.2%. \"Although food stores saw very little growth, good weather in July and August boosted sales of clothing, while online retailing also did well,\" said ONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach. Tech sales were boosted over the summer by the launch of Nintendo's long-awaited Switch 2 gaming console and Apple's iPhone 17.Within non-store retailing, online jewellers reported strong demand for gold.Between July and September, retail sales were 0.9% higher than the previous three months.Retail sales volume are a measure of the quantity of goods sold during a certain period. Non-store retailers - primarily online shops - saw a 3.8% rise in sales in the same period.The amount spent online between July and September was 3.5% higher than the previous quarter and 5% higher than the same period last year.ONS statistics are used in deciding government policy, which affects millions, and are also used by the Bank of England to make key financial decisions, such as setting interest rates.But a recent review of the ONS was highly critical of the agency, calling into question the quality of the economic data it produces.The ONS has struggled, as have many statistical bodies, with tight budgets and with the problem of getting people to fill in the questionnaires needed for their data.The figures are a positive sign amid ongoing concerns that the British economy is slowing down.Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, said consumers were starting to feel a bit more confident about spending.\"Interest rate cuts and above inflation pay increases have meant many workers have had a bit more cash to play with, even if pressures on household budgets have remained high.\"Despite this, recent results from the UK's longest-running consumer confidence survey, conducted by GfK, indicate that shoppers are holding back on spending before Black Friday.Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the month on month rise in retail sales volumes was better than expected.\"But against a backdrop of weak employment, high inflation and with tax rises on the horizon, we doubt the retail sector will be able to sustain this strength,\" he said.Mr Kerr said that a strong demand for gold jewellery from online retailers could be a result of surging gold prices. The ONS gathers its figures from all of Great Britain's large retailers and a representative sample of smaller ones. Monthly figures for retail sales are generally more volatile than quarterly.",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump has announced an immediate end to all trade negotiations with Canada over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation.The advert, sponsored by the government of Canada's province of Ontario, quoted Trump's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, an icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".Trump wrote on social media that the advert was \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\", adding that trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".His administration has imposed a 35% levy on many Canadian imports, as well as individual tariffs targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing. Ontario has been particularly hard-hit by these.Trump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that he negotiated during his first term.But Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has since his election earlier this year attempted to strike a deal that would ease the US tariffs.This has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products.In the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags.The video excerpts a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.\"When someone says 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\"But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"The Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.The foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".Trump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nation's products are legal.  The court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.The advert was run as part of a campaign worth $75m Canadian dollars (£40m; $54m) on mainstream TV channels in the US.In the post accompanying the advert, Ford wrote that \"we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada\".China's embassy in Washington also used a similar Reagan clip in a post on X to cast doubt on Trump's global tariffs earlier this year.Ontario is Canada's most populous province and its largest regional economy, and has suffered the most as a result of the US tariffs. Ford hit back at Trump's earlier tariff threat against Canada by saying he was willing to cut off power supply to the US.He had also described Washington's trade policies against Canada as having pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\", and called on US lawmakers to put pressure on Trump.Trump's sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.The White House's global tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminium and cars - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and putting pressure on businesses.Carney and Ford have not yet commented on Trump's announcement.It is the second time Trump has said he was ceasing trade talks with Canada, after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms earlier this year.When Canada rescinded the tax, the White House said Carney had \"caved\" to pressure from Trump.",

    "body": "1 hour agoChris MasonPolitical editorPA MediaPlaid Cymru's Lindsay Whittle (left) won the by-election, giving Labour its first defeat in the area for 100 yearsAmid the blizzard of nocturnal numbers any by-election generates, three stand out in Caerphilly this morning.Labour, so long the victor of so many a south Wales political contest, humbled, pummelled, crushed - attracting just 11% of voters.The Conservatives, so often the victor of many a UK-wide election - 2%.Yes, you read that right - the two big beasts of Westminster politics managed just 13% of the vote between them.Just one in seven voters backed either Labour or the Conservatives, which is extraordinary.This contest, for weeks, was instead a race between an outfit, Reform UK, which barely existed a few years back and another, Plaid Cymru - until now the perpetual bridesmaid in contests in Caerphilly.Between them, Plaid and Reform attracted 83% of the vote – and Plaid beat Nigel Farage's party easily.Follow our live updatesAs so often in election contests, there is a striking human story that illustrates the wider picture.Today's victor, Lindsay Whittle, a Plaid Cymru councillor for nearly half a century, told me he remembers standing in the crowds in Caerphilly in 1968 as a 15-year-old new recruit to the party.The party, then, came pretty close to toppling Labour in a Westminster by election.But here is the thing: they didn't, they were second.Defeat at Labour's hands was something Whittle was to get very used to - he has stood for election to Westminster ten times, and stood repeatedly for election to Cardiff Bay too. He had always lost - until now. Now in his 70s, he tastes victory for the first time.Speaking to senior Plaid figures, they detect - and have for some time - a sense that the tide may finally be going out for Labour in Wales.They are determined to capitalise and allow themselves to dream of governing Wales, at least as the main party, after next May's Senedd elections across the nation.PA MediaThe  Caerphilly contest was, for weeks, a race between Reform UK and Plaid CymruSo, what next for Reform? A solid second place with 36% of the vote, is a solid performance for an upstart, but insurgencies remain insurgent by winning – and they were easily beaten. It is clearly not easy for them to be the first choice \"none of the above\" alternative to Labour and the Conservatives when there is another party also claiming that mantle.That is a challenge for them in Wales, as it is in Scotland with the SNP, in a way that it isn't in England.And then there are the consequences for Labour.Labour's heritage in these parts includes some of the most consequential names in its long history: founding father Keir Hardie, NHS founder Nye Bevan, former leaders Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock.This morning, the prospect for Labour of heavy defeat across Wales next May - ending 27 years of continuous devolved power - looks more likely than ever.And the questions for the Prime Minister pile up higher.",

    "body": "A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. \"When you need to move fast,\" reads a banner under the image. \"The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper.\"Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.Speaking to the AFP news agency on Wednesday, the company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, said when it became clear no one was injured in the heist they used \"a touch of humour\" to draw attention to the family-run business.\"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\" How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Reaction to Böcker's new campaign have been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including \"marketing genius\" and \"excellent, that is German quality\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one commenter quipped.Mr Böcker told AFP he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold \"a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area\".The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he added.The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors and visitors had started to file through its corridors.Within eight minutes, they made off with some of France's most valuable treasure belonging to former royalty or imperial rulers.Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that the Louvre failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and \"aging\".\"We failed these jewels,\" Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she added.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "X-ray tables, high-tech glasses, NBA players: How a poker scheme allegedly stole millions9 hours agoNardine SaadBBCCelebrities, professional sports stars and wealthy gamblers sat at a table hoping to win big in a game of Texas Hold 'Em.But they didn't know it was nearly impossible. They were \"fishes\" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand. In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these \"unwitting\" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m.The scheme, which US prosecutors described as \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie\", was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Costra Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones. FBI director Kash Patel called it a \"mind-boggling\" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities. Arrests in the scheme were announced on Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, in which professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds. The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Luchesse and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise. Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as \"face cards\", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing. Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, \"unwitting victim\" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege. Unbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a \"fish\" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment. Sophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold 'Em.What we know about gambling arrestsUS Department of JusticeA rigged card-shuffling machine was also used in the plot, prosecutors sayThe technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands. Secretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say. Then there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege. Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an \"operator\" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - who prosecutors call a \"quarterback\" or \"driver\". US Department of JusticeProsecutors say an X-ray poker machine was employed to read facedown cardsThat person would then secretly signal to others, prosecutors allege, effectively stealing money and making it impossible for victims to win. Authorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Prosecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies. A cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise. \"This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families,\" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.Billups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. The Portland Trail Blazers said in a statement that they were aware of the allegations involving their head coach and were \"fully co-operating with the investigation\".Jones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme. He is charged with two counts each of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterThe five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) factories following a cyber-attack drove car production down by more than a quarter in September.JLR facilities did not produce a single vehicle last month, after the cyber-attack forced the car maker to shut down its IT systems and halt its global manufacturing operations, including at its three UK plants.Overall UK car production fell by 27%  with just over 51,000 made last month, data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed.It is the lowest number of cars made in any September in the UK since 1952, including the pandemic, the SMMT said.The JLR cyber-attack was largely responsible for the slump in UK car production, the SMMT said, because other manufacturers reported stable figures for the month.The attack is also estimated to cost £1.9bn and be the most economically damaging cyber event in UK history, according to research published on Tuesday.The Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC) found 5,000 businesses have been affected by the event and a full recovery will not occur until January 2026.JLR said production across sites in Solihull, Wolverhampton and Halewood was returning in a phased approach.The maker of the Jaguar I-Pace and Range Rover Sport is the second-largest car producer by volume in the UK after Nissan.Overall, total vehicle production slumped by 35.9% in September compared to a year ago to about 54,300 vehicles.The SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: \"September's performance comes as no surprise given the total loss of production at Britain's biggest automotive employer following a cyber incident. \"While the situation has improved, the sector remains under immense pressure,\" he added.The majority of vehicles made in the UK are shipped overseas, and exports in September also slumped - down 24.5% - with the EU, US, Turkey, Japan and South Korea the top five destinations. This year so far UK car and van factories have made 582,250 vehicles, which is 15.2% lower than at the same point in 2024.The five-week JLR shutdown was a \"severe, but short-term issue\" for the overall industry, Autotrader's chief commercial officer Ian Plummer said.\"It'll be a bit like Covid, where after the shutdown and delays end, there's a surge in demand and sales,\" he said.Mr Plummer said JLR brands had risen to have the highest number of monthly sales leads on Autotrader, \"so there is demand out there, even as the pipeline is currently stuck\".The SMMT's Mr Hawes also said a recent ambition from the UK government to help foster a resurgence in domestic car production to 1.3m vehicles a year is in doubt if the chancellor Rachel Reeves ends tax breaks offered to Employee Car Ownership Schemes (ECOS).\"The industry is calling for rapid interventions to shore up its competitiveness,\" he said.Keeping manufacturers' ECOS schemes would be \"an immediate relief\", he said, and bringing forward other interventions including programmes to bolster supply chain resilience \"would further boost the sector\".",

    "body": "UK defence secretary warns Putin: 'We're watching you'6 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondent, LossiemouthBBC / Dave BullJohn Healey says there has been a rise in Russian vessels threatening UK watersDefence Secretary John Healey has a message for Russian President Vladimir Putin: \"We're hunting your submarines.\"There has been a \"30% rise in Russian vessels threatening UK waters\", he says.This, according to Healey, is evidence of increased \"Russian aggression right across the board\" which he says is impacting Europe, not just Ukraine.The Ministry of Defence says Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic is now back to the same levels as the Cold War era.The RAF and Royal Navy have been stepping up their watch of the North Atlantic, where Russian submarines are most active. The RAF is flying missions most days, sometimes around the clock and often reinforced by other Nato allies. BBC News joined the defence secretary on a flight on one of the RAF's new P-8 aircraft - the first media to be allowed to observe an active mission.Members of the nine-strong crew face banks of monitors – showing them what's happening both on and under the surface of the water.It is, in effect, a high-tech spy plane, which is one reason why we're not allowed to film or photograph any of the screens. From the outside the P-8 may look like an airliner, just painted grey and with fewer windows. It is in fact the airframe of a Boeing 737, but inside it's fitted out with sophisticated cameras and sensors and listening devices.BBC / Dave BullObserving the crews at work, Healey tells me: \"Russia is challenging us; it's testing us; it's watching us. But these planes allow us to say to Putin – we're watching you; we're hunting your subs.\"At first, the crew track a number of surface vessels, using the aircraft's cameras to look for any suspicious equipment or activity. At times they're flying just a few hundred metres above the waves. Last year, with help from the Royal Navy, an RAF P-8 monitored the Russian spy ship, Yantar, which was reported to be hovering over undersea cables in the Irish Sea. Western nations are increasingly concerned that Russia might try to sever critical undersea cables as part of its hybrid warfare – causing chaos and disruption to internet communications.Later, they switch the mission to hunt for submarines. At the back of the aircraft are stored 129 active and passive sonar buoys which can detect underwater sounds. There's a loud pop as the buoys are fired automatically. One of the cameras on board shows them falling by parachute into the water. There's no sign of the torpedoes the aircraft can carry to destroy submarines.One of the crew admits that finding a submarine is not always that easy. But they know the signature sound of Russian submarines and are helped by a wider network of underwater sensors. In August the RAF, working with US and Norwegian P-8s, tracked a Russian submarine shadowing an American aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, on exercise in the North Atlantic.BBC / Dave Bull'Time to get more aware'It is a team sport – and the team is about to get even bigger, as Germany has ordered eight of its own P-8 aircraft. For this flight, Healey has been joined by his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius. German military personnel have already been training alongside their UK colleagues and for part of this mission there's a German navy pilot in the cockpit.Germany plans to frequently fly its own maritime patrols from RAF Lossiemouth - Pistorius tells me why. \"The North Atlantic is crucial, and it's threatened by Russian nuclear submarines,\" he says. \"Therefore, we need to know what's going on here in the deep sea.\"The German defence minister's presence underlines the deepening defence relationship with the UK. There's much closer co-operation following the signing of the Trinity House Agreement on defence last year. Germany is already investing in the UK to build new tanks and armoured vehicles for the British Army. On this visit, Pistorius announced that Germany would be buying UK-made Sting Ray torpedoes for its P-8 aircraft. The two countries are also promising to work together on cyber-security.Pistorius and Healey have already been leading Europe's efforts to supply weapons to Ukraine. Now they're turning their attention closer to home. Pistorius says every day there is evidence of Russia's hybrid warfare – \"fake news, disinformation, hybrid attacks, the threat to undersea infrastructure\". He says: \"It's time to get more aware of what's going on.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorIt's a mess. And it is extraordinarily difficult.To give you a sense of that, one of the candidates to rule themselves out of chairing the grooming gangs inquiry is Jim Gamble.Gamble's career goes like this: he worked in policing in Northern Ireland during The Troubles.And then he spent years working to protect children from exploitation.Neither are roles for the faint hearted, to put it lightly. And yet not even he wanted to take on chairing this inquiry.So who on Earth would want to do it?There is a reluctant acceptance in government that finding someone who is willing to do it, will last the course and will be universally accepted among the victims as the right person for the job is almost certainly impossible.Little wonder then that those in government are making it known they are willing to spend months finding the right person to do it.The best they can hope for, in all likelihood, is someone backed enthusiastically by some and tolerated by others.\"There is no such thing as a clean skin. Anyone with the necessary expertise and clout will likely come with what some will perceive as baggage,\" one Whitehall source told me.And the personnel issues don't end there.There has been a row over the last few days about whether the Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips should stay in her job – after some of those victims involved in setting up the inquiry said she should be replaced.When we first reported that news, I was reminded of a thing reporters like me should always keep in mind. Journalists, inevitably, lean towards the outspoken, who generate headlines.Rightly so – choosing to be outspoken, to go public with deeply held concerns, is often brave and noble. But reporters also shouldn't forget those who have chosen to remain quiet.The vast majority of the 30 victims recruited to the panel being consulted in setting up the inquiry have not spoken out publicly.Multiple sources in government are making it clear there is a widespread determination – from No10 to the Home Office - to keep Phillips in post.And the latest twist is five other abuse survivors have written to the prime minister to say they will only continue to work with the inquiry if Phillips keeps her job.It is another impossible bind the government finds itself in.The central truth here is the victims of sexual abuse have been repeatedly and profoundly let down by multiple agencies of the state, over years, even decades.Little wonder establishing, let alone maintaining trust is incredibly difficult.\"Upset and vulnerable people hit out when they are in pain, and that is entirely understandable,\" is how one senior government figure put it to me.The panel members, I am told, are of a range of views and instincts – on their willingness or not to speak out, on their views on those who chose to do so or not, on who should chair the inquiry, how it should be run and on Jess Phillips.Merely setting up this inquiry, let alone conducting it and then implementing the conclusions it comes to and the recommendations it makes, is already proving to be a huge headache.",

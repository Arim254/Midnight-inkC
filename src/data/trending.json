    "body": "Have Formula 1's new rules this year damaged its status as the ultimate challenge for a racing driver?Listen to the sport's top drivers, and it would be easy to get that impression.\"Not Formula 1,\" says Max Verstappen of the need to manage energy in the new cars. \"Ridiculously complex,\" says Lewis Hamilton. \"The chef could drive the car at that speed,\" says Fernando Alonso. \"Not the purest form of driving,\" says Lando Norris.When the sport's four active world champions make comments like that, it would be foolish not to listen.But before jumping to a conclusion that F1 has been ruined by what amounts to the biggest rule change in the sport's history, it's important to establish a frame of reference.What, in essence, is the job of a racing driver? It is to get a car around a race track in the shortest possible time.In its purest form, this means braking as late as possible for a corner, driving around it at the highest achievable speed, exiting it as fast as one can and reaching the highest speed on the straight before doing the same again, lap after lap.But that's not what a racing driver does all the time. It can't be. The way they drive on a qualifying lap, for example, is not the same as over a 200-mile grand prix distance.Tyres and fuel need to be managed, there might be problems with the car to take into account, and so on. That's still getting the car around the track as fast as possible, but it's doing so within the constraints presented at the time. Flat out in motorsport is only sometimes.So when Verstappen, Alonso and co talk about the degree of energy management required with this year's new hybrid engines, are they saying that they are no longer ever driving on the limit of grip in the corners?At last week's pre-season test in Bahrain, I asked that question to all of the above drivers, as well as Mercedes' George Russell and Kimi Antonelli, and Haas' Oliver Bearman. They all said they were still on the limit of the grip the vast majority of the time, that skill still mattered, that a faster driver would still beat a slower one.The new cars have less downforce than last year, so they have less grip, but the drivers are still on the limit of that grip in the corners.Bearman said: \"Some corners on this track, which were last year limitations or places that you have to be aware of, are not really corners any more, they're more power-limited. Like Turn 12 and Turn Seven.\"So you do change the way that you approach those corners. And where last year Turn 12 you were 40km/h faster this year, it's not really a corner any more. And that is a bit strange.\"But for the rest, you're still pushing to the limit even if the limit is a bit lower at the moment. But it's not feeling out of this world. Once we get used to the differences in some corners, you just adapt your driving style. And then it feels like normal.\"McLaren team principal Andrea Stella has an intimate knowledge of what it takes to be a top driver, having worked as a race engineer with Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Alonso. He is also interested in this topic for the good of the sport.He says: \"What we've seen in Bahrain definitely confirms that it's the ultimate challenge.\"Probably this is because Bahrain is a harvest-rich circuit, so you drive in a very normal way. And if anything with these regulations the cars slide quite a lot more and the role of the driver if anything is even more involved in extracting the most out of the car.\"Barcelona was a slightly different situation because, being a relatively harvest-poor circuit, there were some special manoeuvres that needed to be made, like not being flat-out in high-speed (corners) in order to balance the level of harvesting and produce the fastest lap time. That meant that in Barcelona not necessarily you could be at the fastest speed in high-speed corners.\"Stella's remarks refer to the drivers' need to perform what McLaren's Oscar Piastri has described as \"counter-intuitive\" driving techniques.The combination of a near 50-50 split between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and electrical components, three times the amount of electrical power compared with last year's engines and a battery about the same size means the new engines are energy starved.With the battery emptying itself within about 11 seconds of full power, it is emptying and being recharged constantly around a lap. The engineers have to work out how best to deploy whatever energy they can recover through a lap for the optimum performance.This has led to unnatural techniques, such as not accelerating at full speed out of a corner before starting a qualifying lap until some way down the straight, choosing not to deploy energy for maximum speed in some high-speed corners, even not deploying on the straight at the end of a qualifying lap because the energy was better used exiting a corner elsewhere on the lap.Other energy-recovery tasks include:Lift and coast, a feature for many years, where drivers lift off for a short time before applying the brakes for a cornerUsing a lower gear than would be optimum for performance in corners so the turbo can be kept spooling fast to recharge the battery'Super clip', where the electric motor is run against the engine at full speed on the straights to recovery energyBut how much of a difference is this really making?BBC Sport has seen a telemetry data overlay of a quick lap from Bahrain with last year's cars compared with one from this year.There are differences. The slow corners are now taken slightly faster, the quick ones slightly slower. Acceleration is initially much faster, but so is the rate at which it tails off later on the straights. The lap time is a couple of seconds slower overall - as is always intended in the case of an F1 rules reset. But fundamentally, the traces look very similar.And on track? Well, they still look like F1 cars, is the bottom line. It takes a very well trained eye to notice the differences.Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate in F1 as to whether the new cars have moved the sport too far away from the purity of the driving challenge, and some think changes could be made to reduce the levels of energy management.At the moment, the rate of energy recovery with the 'super clip' - frankly, jargon that would be better kept away from public consumption because of the potential for confusion - can be a maximum of 250kw.But the engines are capable of recovering energy at 350kw, and do so when a driver has lifted off the throttle. So why not let them do that when flat out?Another proposal is to reduce the output of the electrical part of the engine, currently limited to 350kw (470bhp), to about 300kw (402bhp) or even 250kw (335bhp). The idea being to cut overall power but allow it to be applied for longer, to make driving feel more natural.Going even further, some would wish to increase the amount of fuel the engine is allowed to use, and rebalance the ratio between the ICE and electrical, perhaps to 65:35 or 70:30.The opposing view is that these last two would require wholesale changes to the engine design and other aspects of the car such as gear ratios. Opponents also argue it would not have the effect required.A related problem is the new 'overtake' button. This replaces the drag reduction system (DRS) overtaking aid, which no longer exists because both front and rear wings open on the straights, part of a series of tweaks made as a consequence of the new engine formula.'Overtake' mode provides the drivers with electrical energy for longer. It does not create more power or, as DRS used to, more speed. As a result, overtaking is expected to be difficult.Herein lies another argument for reducing the electrical output to 300kw - then, the remaining 50kw could be used for overtake mode.An added complication is that the circuits all require different levels of energy management.In Bahrain, the above techniques were not really needed because there are a lot of braking phases into slow corners to recover energy in the standard way.But Albert Park, which hosts the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on 8 March, is an energy-starved circuit, and lift and coast and super clip are expected to be needed extensively, even in qualifying.Melbourne joins Saudi Arabia, Austria, Silverstone, Monza, Azerbaijan and Las Vegas among the worst circuits for energy - tracks with long straights but not much facility to recover in braking zones.The teams are in ongoing discussions about whether to take action, and if so, what form it should take, with governing body the FIA and F1.Stella says: \"Definitely there could still be cases in which the driver needs to approach driving in what is not a common way - (where) we just drive as flat as possible, brake as late as possible, go as fast as possible in every corner.\"When it comes to improving the balance between the regulations in their current format, and some other driving challenges, there is time to fix this.\"For instance, there is a way of changing the way in which we deploy the electrical engine such that this requirement to do these special manoeuvres is reduced.\"So there are things that can be done in the future, but I think we should monitor a little bit more in some other circuits (before deciding what to do).\"",

Lawyers for the peer said he intends to co-operate with police to \"clear his name\".Lord Mandelson was taken to Wandsworth police station in London for interview, before later being released on bail pending further investigation. It is understood he surrendered his passport as one of his bail conditions.Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025.He was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson emerged after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.

Kial Garth Robinson, 29, of Littlehampton, was sentenced to 11 years in prison, while Piran Ezra Wilkinson, 48, from Chichester, was jailed for nine years.Both were also ordered to pay a fine of around £45,000 or serve an extra 190 days in prison.Robinson was arrested last September when customs officers at Ngurah Rai International Airport found two packages containing 1.3kg of cocaine in his backpack.He told police that he was ordered by a man to transport the drugs from Barcelona, Spain, to Bali and deliver them to Wilkinson - who had arrived a few days earlier, Reuters news agency reported on Thursday.Wilkinson was arrested in Canggu, on the south coast of Bali, the following day.Prosecutors said Robinson and Wilkinson were friends who lived in Thailand and had met in Barcelona a week before their arrests.ReutersKial Robinson sits with his lawyer inside the Denpasar District Court in BaliOn Thursday, Robinson's lawyer Robert Khuana said: \"These items were brought from Barcelona to Bali, but they aren't meant for distribution. \"My client was purely a courier, but he knew he was trapped in a syndicate scenario and was persuaded with $5,000 and another $5,000 for debt repayment and he was therefore willing to bring the drugs to Bali.\"What made the sentence harsher was that his actions threatened the security against drug distributions in Indonesia. \"Although he didn't know the contents of the package, he knew the contents were dangerous. If he had known, he wouldn't have done what he did.\"Indonesia has some of the world's strictest anti-narcotics laws and drug trafficking can be punishable by death.Although Indonesia has executed foreigners in the past, it has upheld a temporary halt on the death sentence since 2017.Lisa Stocker, 39, and her husband Jon Collyer, 38, were arrested at Bali's international airport in February 2025 after being caught with 994g of the Class A drug. Phineas Float, 31, was due to receive the packages and was arrested a few days later.All three, from Hastings and St Leonards, East Sussex, were told by the judge that they would only serve a 12-month sentence and would be eligible for release in early 2026.",

It is designed to bring clarity to Gibraltar's future, nearly a decade after the Brexit vote threw the status of the British overseas territory into doubt.Pressure to reach a deal had been mounting ahead of the full application of new checks on passengers entering the passport-free Schengen zone in April.Under the deal, Gibraltar will not officially join the zone, made up of 29 mainly EU countries, but Schengen-style border checks will instead be carried out on travellers arriving at the territory's port and airport.Gibraltarian officials will carry out initial checks on arrivals, with Spanish authorities then conducting \"second line\" checks in a special zone. The system is designed to remove checks at Gibraltar's land border with Spain, which is crossed every day by around half of the Rock's workforce.The UK government is likening it to the system in operation at London's St Pancras station, where Eurostar passengers are checked by both British and French officials before boarding trains for the continent.The government also says a majority of goods destined for Gibraltar will be cleared by EU customs offices in Spain, in a deal designed to avoid the need for customs checks at the land border.Gibraltar was not covered by the UK's 2021 trade deal with the EU, and the UK has previously described it as the \"last piece of the EU exit jigsaw\". The treaty implements a political deal agreed between the UK and EU in June last year, and confirms key details of how the new arrangements will work in practice. It has been published in draft form whilst legal teams complete final reviews and translation of the text. It will have to be ratified by both the UK and European Parliaments. ",

    "body": "7 minutes agoAmmar Ebrahim,Jersey political reporter andFergus Walsh,Medical editorBBCAssisted dying campaigners celebrated the decision outside the States Chamber in Jersey on ThursdayA law to allow terminally ill adults the right to choose to end their own lives has been approved in Jersey.It marks the final legislative stage for the landmark proposals before they get Royal Assent in the UK - and once approved the first legal assisted deaths could happen as early as next summer.Those eligible are people with terminal illnesses causing unbearable suffering where they are expected to die within six months, or 12 months for those with neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and motor neurone disease (MND).It means Jersey is now the second part of the British Isles where assisted dying has been fully approved - the Isle of Man was the first.Westminster and Scotland are debating assisted dying, with the draft law in England and Wales making slow progress in the House of Lords.A UK government spokesperson said the length of processing time \"depends on the complexities and sensitivities of a bill, as well as any legal and constitutional issues\".The various proposals across the UK have generated huge controversy, with passionate arguments for and against the changes.While Jersey passes its legislation, the bill for England and Wales remains blockedBoth Crown dependencies have set residency requirements for eligibility - 12 months for Jersey and five years for the Isle of Man.It means Jersey is now the second part of the British Isles where assisted dying has been fully approvedThirty-two politicians voted in favour of the law with 16 voting against it. The bill will be sent for Royal Assent, which should be a formality.How could assisted dying laws change across the British Isles?Jersey Minister for Health and Social Services, Tom Binet, said: \"Jersey would have one of the safest and most transparent assisted dying laws in the world.\"Lorna Pirozzolo, from Jersey, who has terminal breast cancer, said the reform to law was \"badly needed\". \"Like so many terminally ill people I've spoken with, I'm not scared of dying, but I am terrified of suffering as I go. That's why this law is so badly needed.\"Today brings enormous relief, not just for me, but for future generations of islanders who deserve compassion, choice and dignity at the end of life.\"Humanists UK chief executive Andrew Copson said it was a \"momentous vote of confidence for compassion, dignity, and choice at the end of life\". \"For far too long, terminally ill people were denied the right to decide the manner and timing of their own deaths. Today, Jersey has changed that,\" he said. \"The proposals contain strong safeguards and reflect the clear wishes of the public, who have spoken through citizens' juries and repeated surveys.\"'Very deep ethical issues'Jersey politician, Deputy Sir Philip Bailhache voted against the law and said he was \"disappointed\" by the result. \"I'm all in favour of compassion, I'm in favour of people having deaths which are good deaths, but I'm not in favour of the law which has just been passed.\"Life is a precious thing and I don't think really that it's for people to remove life in the way in which the assisted dying law is now going to authorise. \"I think there are very deep ethical issues involved in this subject and I'm not sure what the outcome is going to be.\"I fear that it will change the community of Jersey in a way in which we may not yet be able to foresee.\"More on this story",

    "body": "21 minutes agoElla KiplingGetty ImagesThe number of small boat arrivals increased in the past yearThe number of people claiming asylum in the UK fell by 4% in 2025, according to new Home Office figures - as the number of people arriving on small boats rose by 13%.Some 100,625 people claimed asylum in the year to December and about 40% of these arrived by small boats, the figures show. But while the number of small boat arrivals increased to 41,262, the figure still remains lower than the peak of 45,774 in 2022.Small boats made up the majority (89%) of those who came to the UK via illegal routes, with other methods including lorries and shipping containers.Meanwhile, the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has fallen by 19% to 30,657, as more people are moved into longer-term accommodation.In the past year, more than 72,000 asylum seekers were housed in longer-term accommodation, which includes houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), as opposed to hotels.The government had previously expressed its commitment to closing all asylum hotels by the end of this Parliament, which would be in 2029, explaining that this would see a move to the use of 'larger sites' such as military sites.According to the figures, the most common nationalities of asylum seekers arriving by small boat were Eritrea (19%), Afghanistan (12%), Iran (11%), Sudan (11%), and Somalia (9%).The figures show there have been falls in claims from people arriving via all other routes.Slightly fewer people came via other illegal routes last year, such as in lorries or shipping containers.There were also falls in the number of people claiming asylum after having previously come into the UK with a visa. Some people arrive in the UK on work, study or visitor visas and then claim asylum while they're here.That accounts for nearly as many asylum claims as small boats - this figure had been rising steadily since the end of 2021.However, over the last 18 months that number has started to fall, mainly because of fewer students claiming asylum. This, in turn, has contributed to the drop we are now seeing in asylum claims.The Home Office figures also show that the number of sponsored study visas granted to foreign students increased by 3% in the past year, to 426,471. However, this is still down 35% from its peak in the year ending June 2023.In the year to December 2025, the top three nationalities for students getting sponsored study visas were Indian, Chinese and Pakistani.There has been a 10% decrease in the number of visas issued to dependants of students, with 19,647 reported. This follows policy changes restricting students' ability to bring dependants to the UK.According to the Home Office data, there has been less people arriving on work-related visas. There were 261,112 people granted access through the visas in the past year – including applicants and dependents – which is almost 30% lower than the previous year, where the figure stood at 368,139.The backlog of people waiting for a decision on their asylum claim has fallen to 64,426 - the lowest level since 2020. Of the 108,000 applications processed in the past year, 42% were granted refugee or protection status and 58% were refused. Refused applicants can appeal their decision.There were 9,914 enforced returns for people who did not have the legal right to remain in the UK in the year ending December 2025 - a 21% increase from the previous year. Factors driving this increase include asylum-related returns, agreements with countries outside the UK, schemes to remove foreign offenders, and schemes to return small boat arrivals, the Home Office said.Albanian nationals have been consistently the most common nationality of enforced returns over the last five years, according to the Home Office.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoStar McFarlaneBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe UK unemployment rate among 16 to 24-year-olds is at the highest it's been in more than a decade.Careers experts say there are some specific things younger people can do to find work.Whether you're looking for a Saturday job or your first full-time role, here are some tips to get you started.1. Focus on skills, not the jobIt does not matter what your first job is - the transferable skills you learn are more valuable for your future career than the job itself, experts say.For example, many senior roles require strong interpersonal and communication skills, and there are plenty of entry-level jobs that offer the opportunity to develop these, says Ghislaine Dell, head of careers at Bath University.\"Your client might be a customer coming into the local shop you work in or they might be a client that wants you to develop a new piece of software for them,\" she says. \"Either way, being able to show your ability to communicate well and deliver what they're asking for is really important.\"You shouldn't overthink your first job, agrees Charlotte Bosworth, chief executive of apprenticeship provider Lifetime Training, which works with brands like Nando's and B&Q as well as the Department for International Trade.\"Just hit the market - you're more employable when you're employed,\" she says.2. Use AI to prepare Employers are increasingly looking to recruit the next generation of staff with AI skills, and there are ways to use it to help prepare your job applications too.Put the job description and company website into an AI system and ask specific questions like \"What are the top five things this employer is looking for?\" suggests Ghislaine Dell.You can use these points to help draft your application, create structure and showcase your skills in the best way, she says.If you are invited for an interview, AI can also help you prepare by generating questions you might be asked based on the industry, company and the role you're applying for, Dell says.However, she warns against using AI to write your application for you.\"Employers want you to sound like you. They don't want you to sound like the people 10 years older than you that programmed the AI,\" she says.\"It's better to sound like you with a few mistakes than a perfect clone.\"3. Introduce yourself in personFor smaller or independent businesses – local cafes, shops or pubs, for example – introducing yourself in person can help show your confidence and willingness to learn more about the business, says Charlotte Bosworth.It's also useful for you to take a look at a range of different workplaces to get an idea of what kind of environment you might want to work in.\"Even if you have already put in an application online, going in and introducing yourself in person... asking questions about the role and showing an interest in the company… might just be the thing that puts your [CV] to the top of the pile,\" she says.It's even worth visiting places that haven't got a job advertised to register your interest so they think of you if any future roles do come up.4. Let your personality shine in cover letterA cover letter can be a great opportunity to tell prospective employers who you are and what you're passionate about.It is also a \"signal\" that you've taken time to do the application, says Baz Ramaiah, research and policy director at social enterprise Youth Employment UK.\"It's an opportunity to let your personality shine,\" he says.There are many reasons employers want to hire young people and your cover letter can spell out what you bring, adds Bosworth.\"Don't underestimate the unique fresh ideas, energy and eyes you will bring to a role, regardless of how much experience you have,\" she says.5. Find resources aimed at young peopleSearch for free online resources and groups aimed at helping young people into work.\"There are lots of accessible local groups, charities and organisations that help young people who are struggling to find work. The problem is a lot of people don't know they're there,\" says Ramaiah.There are also lots of free online courses which is another way to help you skill up for applications, he says.One organisation offering such courses is the King's Trust. For people aged 16 to 30, it provides free courses including work placement programmes in a range of industries, personal development programmes, and short courses on important interviewing and CV writing skills.Youth Employment UK also offers assistance to young people including career guidance and free online courses to help build confidence and skills, and the UK government offers tips and advice to help young people build experience and confidence, and find the right career.",

    "body": "2 hours agoChris EwokorBBC Africa, AbujaGetty ImagesChimamanda Ngozi Adichie had twin boys, via a surrogate, in 2024An inquest into the death of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son will formally begin on 14 April.The date was set during a preliminary hearing at the Yaba Magistrate Court in Lagos, roughly seven weeks after Nkanu Nnamdi Esege died at a Euracare hospital.Adiche and her family have accused Euracare of negligence, saying medics denied Nkanu oxygen and gave him too much sedation, causing a cardiac arrest.The hospital expressed its \"deepest sympathies\" over the death but denied wrongdoing, saying its care had been in line with international standards.During the preliminary hearing on Wednesday, Magistrate Atinuke Adetunji directed all parties to file witness statements ahead of the inquest.The court is expected to hear evidence from medical experts and hospital representatives as the coroner seeks to establish the circumstances and cause of Nkanu's death.According to submissions made to the court by Adichie's legal team, Nkanu had initially been admitted to Atlantis Hospital in Lagos with what was described as a worsening but mild illness. Plans had been made to transfer him to the United States for further treatment at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital.But first, Atlantis Hospital referred the toddler to Euracare for pre-flight investigations, including an MRI and a spinal tap, or lumbar puncture. He died on 7 January after undergoing these procedures.In a legal notice three days later, lawyers for Adichie and her husband, Dr Ivara Esege, accused Euracare of breaching the duty of care owed to the child. The hospital denied this allegation.Adichie, 48, is an award-winning writer known for a string of internationally successful novels, such as Half of a Yellow Sun and Americanah.She was born and raised in Nigeria but is now based in the US.Adichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Nkanu was one of twin boys born in 2024, using a surrogate.More about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 hour agoAdam EleyBBC NewsPA MediaThe number of people sleeping rough in England is at its highest level since records began in 2010.Some 4,793 people were estimated to be sleeping on the streets on a single night last autumn, according to the latest snapshot figures released by the government on Thursday - a 3% increase from 2024.The number of female rough sleepers rose by 8% to 733, while there were 3,938 men and another 122 cases where the gender was not recorded.The government said £50m of funding, provided over three years, would be provided to councils and frontline homelessness services.London has the highest number of rough sleepers -1,277 - but the rate of rough sleeping rose steepest year-on-year in the north east of England, where numbers increased by 31% to 162.For the past seven years in Leeds, the Homeless Street Angels charity has been providing food, shoes, sleeping bags and blankets for rough sleepers.Each Thursday, dozens of people queue for support awaiting their arrival - and the charity says that demand is rising.\"It's getting worse and worse, week in, week out,\" the organisation's co-founder Becky Joyce says in the cold February air.\"[There are] a lot of new faces tonight, which is quite upsetting because the more people we think we get off the streets, the more people are coming on the streets.\"They currently make 240 food boxes each week, double the amount produced three years ago, handing them out as they make their way through the city's streets. Less than half way round their usual route, they run out of meals.Becky Joyce says demand for their support has risen sharplyJosh has been homeless for more than a year after losing his rented home.\"I have to walk two hours a day to come into town to get food,\" he says, preferring to find shelter outside of the city centre where he feels safer, sleeping in a one-man tent under a bridge.Josh says he has the \"determination\" to turn things around and is trying to apply for social housing. But without a phone, it can be difficult contacting his social worker and he struggles with the process.\"I'm going to keep sticking at it until I get a home,\" he says.Josh walks two hours into the city centre for a food parcelNot all the individuals the charity supports are rough sleepers - some will be sofa surfing, others may have recently moved into accommodation. Gareth, 31, was helped into accommodation six months ago.\"One day I just woke up and after a year-and-a-half on the streets I thought, 'I need to do something',\" he says, remembering how he approached a local charity for support.Most people Gareth encountered while he was sleeping on the streets were kind, but he says some made critical comments and stole his possessions in the night. Having a place to stay has been transformational.\"It makes you feel a better person,\" he says. Charities believe finding people accommodation is only half the battle. The next step is stopping people returning to the streets, and Gareth has come along as much for the mental health boost of seeing familiar faces as for the food parcel.But Homeless Street Angels says there is only so much it can do. It is regularly contacted by probation services requesting free sleeping bags and food parcels for those released from prison with nowhere to go.Over the past three years the number of people sleeping rough in Leeds has risen 75% - from 37 to 65 -according to the snapshot data, although the 2025 figure is down slightly on the 69 rough sleepers recorded in 2024.\"It's only me and my twin sister,\" says Becky Joyce. \"How long can we keep going when the need is getting bigger and bigger?\"Gareth says his quality of life has been transformed since he was helped into accommodationThe figures for 2025 are the highest since records began in 2010. The previous peak was in 2017.There was a 5% rise year-on-year on the number of people born in the UK sleeping rough. Charities say the figures are likely to underestimate the true scale of the issue, as only those sleeping rough on one single night in the autumn are counted.Separate data published on Thursday showed the number of families living in temporary accommodation has also reached a new high. Between July and September 2025, 134,760 households were living in hotels, B&Bs and flats – an increase of 6.9% on the same period in 2024.Of these households, 85,730 include children.The government has pledged to halve \"long-term rough sleeping\" by 2030 and prevent more households from becoming homeless in the first place.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoVanessa Buschschlüter,Latin America online editor,Bernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporter,andMax MatzaWatch: \"I'm not going to speculate\", says Marco Rubio on Cuba boat shootingCuba has accused 10 people aboard a US-registered speedboat it intercepted off its coast on Wednesday of planning \"an infiltration with terrorist aims\".Border guards shot dead four people and injured the other six on the boat, the Cuban interior ministry said, alleging that those aboard the Florida-registered vessel had fired first.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident.The deadly shooting comes at a time of increased tension between the two countries, less than two months after US forces seized Cuba's close ally, Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, and stopped his successor from supplying it with oil.   Cuba's interior ministry said in an online statement that the speedboat had entered Cuban territorial waters and was \"one nautical mile off Cayo Falcones\", on Cuba's northern coast, when it was intercepted.It added that the commander of the Cuban boat was injured in the firefight that ensued.Cuban officials have so far named one of the men killed in the clash, as well as the six survivors, who they said were evacuated and given medical assistance. The Cuban authorities said they had established that all 10 of those on board the speedboat were Cuban nationals residing in the US. They also identified an 11th person they said had been arrested and had confessed to being part of the alleged plot.The Cuban authorities added that most of them had \"prior records involving criminal and violent activity\".Handguns, assault rifles and improvised explosive devices were recovered from the speedboat, along with other tactical gear, according to the statement.BBC Verify checked the speedboat's registration details provided by the Cuban embassy in US (FL7726SH, Florida registered) but they yielded no ownership details or tracking history on any of the platforms the BBC relies on.Cuba's interior ministry has in the past denounced other incursions into its territorial waters by privately owned US boats it said were engaged in smuggling Cubans from the Caribbean island to the US. The incident also comes almost 30 years to the day since Cuban defence forces shot down two small civilian planes belonging to Brothers to the Rescue, a US-based group that searched for rafts carrying migrants from Cuba to the US. Four people aboard were killed in the 1996 incident, triggering outrage in the US.Before the Cuban government released some of the passengers' identities, Rubio had said that the speedboat intercepted by the Cubans had not been carrying US government personnel.The US secretary of state said Washington would not rely on information provided by the Cuban government, and would instead independently verify the facts of the case and what those on board were doing in the area.He spoke from Saint Kitts and Nevis, where he had travelled to meet Caribbean leaders amid the Trump administration's push to ramp up pressure on Cuba's government, as well as other regional issues. Rubio, whose parents emigrated to the US from Cuba in the 1950s, has been a harsh critic of the Communist-run government in Havana. He said on Wednesday that \"Cuba's status quo is unacceptable\" and \"needs to change\".\"They need to make dramatic reforms,\" he said, urging its Communist leadership to \"open the space for both economic, and eventually political, freedom for the people of Cuba\".Last month, following the seizure of Venezuela's Maduro in a US military operation, Donald Trump told Cuba to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.The US president also said at the time that there would be \"no more oil going to Cuba\". His administration has blocked shipments from Venezuela and threatened tariffs on other nations delivering oil to the island.The move has further exacerbated the already crippling oil and fuel shortages Cuba has been suffering for years.On Wednesday, however, the US Treasury said it would ease some small private sector transactions, including oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people, for commercial and humanitarian use\".The first Cuban interior ministry statement alluded to these tensions, saying that \"in the face of current challenges, Cuba reaffirms its determination to protect it territorial waters\" and safeguard its sovereignty.

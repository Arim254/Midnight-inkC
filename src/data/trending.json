    "body": "6 hours agoKaty WatsonAustralia correspondentThe identity of a key person of interest in the disappearance of a British girl more than 50 years ago has been revealed by an Australian politician.A member of New South Wales Legislative Council used parliamentary privilege to name the man known as Mercury, who the BBC cannot identify for legal reasons.Authorities believe three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer was abducted from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in 1970. Despite extensive searches, there were no leads.Then in 2017, Mercury was charged with Cheryl's abduction and murder after officers discovered a confession made by a teenager in 1971. But a judge ruled it was inadmissible and the case was dropped. Mercury says he is innocent.In parliament on Thursday, Jeremy Buckingham read out Mercury's real name - still legally protected because he was a minor at the time - and his teenage confession, calling for a new investigation into Cheryl's murder.\"The family of Cheryl Grimmer have been through so much anguish over such a long period of time,\" he said.\"[Mercury] is a free man living with his identity suppressed from his neighbours and no one has been punished for Cheryl Grimmer's abduction and murder.\"Cheryl's family - some of whom were in the public gallery on Thursday as Mercury was named - has been pushing for a fresh inquiry since the trial fell over six years ago. Last week they gave Mercury an ultimatum, urging him to explain to the family how he knew information contained in his confession or be publicly identified.\"He has been given the opportunity to declare his innocence or guilt, yet he has chosen to remain silent,\" Linda Grimmer, wife of Cheryl's brother Paul, told reporters after the name was revealed in parliament. She said the family was not \"seeking to harm Mercury or his family\" with this move.\"What we want is now the truth. We hope that by speaking out today, members of the public who may hold information will come forward so that Mercury can be questioned in a court of law and justice for Cheryl can finally be served.\"Cheryl was last seen running into a changing room block on 12 January 1970, after a day at the beach with her family, who had only recently migrated to Australia from Bristol as so-called Ten Pound Poms.Last week, the family released a lengthy document detailing the missteps they say were made by authorities in NSW in the search for Cheryl.The family was recently told that a four-year-long review of the case found there was no new evidence that could lead to a conviction - even though the BBC's Fairy Meadow true crime podcast in 2022 unearthed three new potential witnesses.NSW Police have defended their investigations, reiterating that homicide detectives are still looking into Cheryl's disappearance - and that a A$1m ($649,000, £486,000) reward for information remains on offer.The family, alongside a volunteer team using cadaver detection dogs, has recently been searching an \"area of interest\" they hoped would be a breakthrough in the case. But police said that a subsequent inspection of the area only found animal bones.Earlier this month, the NSW parliament announced an inquiry into long-term missing persons cases in the state - including Cheryl's. It will look into how investigations have been carried out and ways to improve outcomes.",

    "body": "9 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterTHOIP (a SANRIO company)/Agatha Christie LtdMiss Marple and Mr Poirot have been given the Little Miss and Mr Men treatmentIn a first for Agatha Christie, four of the crime novelist's famous mysteries are being adapted for children – with the help of the Mr Men and Little Misses.The illustrated books, aimed at pre-school and primary age children, will feature Christie detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple working alongside Roger Hargreaves's much-loved children's characters.Two of the books will be published on Thursday - Little Miss Marple: Muddle at the Vicarage and Mr Poirot: Mischief on the Nile – with two more to follow in February.James Prichard, Agatha Christie's great grandson, said it was a \"dream collaboration\".Prichard, who is also the chair and CEO of Agatha Christie's estate, added: \"These clever and very funny re-imaginings of my great grandmother's stories, which include some of my favourite characters (in rather suspicious circumstances!), are bound to delight fans of both authors.\"Little Miss Marple: Muddle at the Vicarage will see the super-sleuth get involved when Reverend Muddle suspects there's been a theft at the vicarage. The amateur detective is determined to uncover the truth with the help of Inspector Nonsense and Constable Silly.In Mr. Poirot: Mischief on the Nile, the Belgian investigator meets Colonel Rush while cruising on the Nile. The pair soon find themselves uncovering a mischievous mystery with the help of Mr Tickle and his extraordinarily long arms.The two stories are loosely inspired by Christie's Death on the Nile and Murder at the Vicarage, but with a charming and humorous twist for younger mystery fans (and thankfully, not a murder in sight).Adam Hargreaves, whose father created the Mr Men in 1971, and who has written and illustrated for the series himself since 1998, said: \"It has been a real pleasure and an intriguing challenge to bring together the timeless mysteries of Agatha Christie with the playful world of the Mr Men and Little Miss. \"Agatha Christie's iconic stories now have a new twist that neither she nor my father might have imagined!\"The partnership will form part of Agatha Christie Limited's anniversary programme next year, which will mark 50 years since the celebrated author's death, 100 years since the publication of Poirot novel, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, and 50 years since the release of Sleeping Murder. Although not the last book she wrote, the latter was the final novel to be published by Christie, posthumously in 1976, and featured Miss Marple.",

    "body": "6 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesA British surfer and his friend drowned in wild weather at Frankston Beach near MelbourneA British man has drowned after his surfboard snapped during wild weather in the Australian state of Victoria while the friend who tried to save him also died.Police were called to Frankston Beach, about 45km (28 miles) south-east of Melbourne, on Wednesday afternoon after receiving reports two men were in trouble in the water.A police helicopter arrived within 15 minutes and the two men were winched back to shore but neither could be revived. The officer who retrieved the men was treated in hospital after swallowing water and later released.Neither man has been formally identified as police are yet to notify their families. A report for each man will be prepared for the coroner.Police said they had alerted the public to stay out of the water on Wednesday due to high winds, with the state experiencing wind gusts of up to 130km.Detective Inspector Melissa Nixon said the surfer, 36, had \"minimal experience\" and \"it appears he may have only been learning to surf\".\"The weather conditions yesterday were obviously not appropriate to be in the water surfing, whether you're experienced or not,\" she said.The other man, aged 43, saw his friend was in distress and struggling in the water after his surfboard broke.\"They've actually jumped into the water to help and conditions were that bad, he's obviously succumbed to the conditions of the waves and the water,\" Nixon said.She described the scenes of the two men being retrieved from the water as confronting and said the two deaths had been preventable.She urged the public to not go surfing or swimming under treacherous conditions.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHarry SekulichWatch: Weather forecast as Storm Benjamin hits England and WalesRain and wind warnings have come into force across parts of the UK as Storm Benjamin bears down on the country.Commuters have been warned of heavy rain and winds of up to 70mph (112km/h)  on Thursday.Power cuts, localised flooding, building damage, and travel disruptions are possible, according to the Met Office.The four yellow weather warnings cover large swathes of southern and eastern England and Wales as Storm Benjamin, named by the French weather service Météo France, moves from the English Channel to the North Sea throughout the day.A yellow warning for rain covering most of southern England, the East Midlands, parts of Wales and Yorkshire is in place until 18:00 BST, with some places expected to see up to 30-50mm.In the 24 hours leading up to 03:00, the south-east coast had experienced the most rain, with Pevensey in East Sussex recording 40mm. A yellow warning for rain for most of East Anglia and Lincolnshire is in effect until 21:00, with a yellow wind warning also in force for those areas and much of south-east England until midnight.AFP via Getty ImagesGale-force winds batter Plobannalec-Lesconil port, western France, on WednesdayStrong winds were expected to develop across Kent and Sussex, with 65-70mph gusts \"possible near coasts\", the Met Office said.Late-morning or early afternoon wind gusts above 70mph could develop for a small period of time along the North Sea coast.A yellow wind warning was also in place for the south-west, including Cornwall and Devon, and west Wales from 06:00 BST until 15:00 BST.North-westerly winds gusting up to 55mph in both areas are possible, while some coastal areas could be hit with 60mph gusts.More severe rain and winds are set to batter western Europe, including France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.The Europa League has confirmed two matches scheduled for Thursday have had their kick-off times brought forward.Dutch side Feyenoord will play Greece's Panathinaikos in Rotterdam two hours and 15 minutes earlier than scheduled at 16:30 local time (15:30 BST), it said. Uefa also announced Thursday's Conference League match between Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and ŠK Slovan Bratislava had been brought forward from 21:00 to 18:45 local time.Why is this a named storm?The storm was not expected to be severe enough for the Met Office to name this weather system.However, large parts of northern and western France were forecast to bear the brunt of the severe weather, prompting Météo France - the equivalent of the Met Office - to name this Storm Benjamin, warning of some damage and travel disruption.Orange warnings - the next stage up from a yellow - were issued for seven areas along the Atlantic coast and English Channel.Once a meteorological agency takes the decision to name a storm, there is agreement that all nations use the same name to allow consistency and clearer communication of the impacts.Benjamin will not replace Bram in the list of UK's named storms.

    "body": "London Stock Exchange bouncing back, says metals magnate9 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorAFP via Getty ImagesThe Metlen founder's comments come amid uncertainty as some British companies list elsewhere (file photo)The UK is ahead of rival financial centres as a place to list shares, according to the founder and CEO of global energy and metals company Metlen.Evangelos Mytilineos told the BBC that \"the tide was turning\" after a rocky period after Brexit when the London Stock Exchange looked unattractive.His comments are in contrast to recent widespread concern about the steady outflow of some big name companies from UK markets, particularly to the US.However, Mr Mytilineos said high energy costs were an obstacle to European and UK customers and he believed politicians had failed to be honest about the costs of the energy transition.Metlen employs nearly 10,000 people in 40 countries and moved its primary listing from Athens to London in August this year. With a total value of more than £5bn, Metlen went from being listed in London to being included in the FTSE 100 list of the UK's most valuable listed firms in the fastest ever time.The move comes after some big UK companies quit the London Stock Exchange to sell their shares on foreign markets. Tech giant ARM Holdings is now listed in New York. Paddy Power's parent company Flutter is betting on the US, and mining giant BHP headed down under to Australia. Rumours also remain over the future of London stalwarts Shell, and UK's most valuable company, AstraZeneca.Mr Mytilineos said that while he had been attracted to the potentially higher valuations offered by US markets, he felt that London was a better cultural and business fit.\"First of all, most of our executives have started in England,\" he said. \"They all feel at home in the UK. We have a substantial part of our business in the UK, and most of the rest of the business is in Europe. Not much to do with the US.\"He said US stock exchanges were \"overcrowded\" adding \"I don't think we would get people to take the same interest in the company [in the US].\"Mr Mytilineos said the London Stock Exchange had appeared \"neglected\" in the years after Brexit but that other financial centres had failed to capitalise.\"Frankfurt, Paris, Milan or Amsterdam have not managed to overtake London and having withstood a difficult period, I think is on course to get back to the top,\" he said.UK energy prices 'not affordable'Metlen CEO Evangelos Mytilineos felt the UK was the best fit for the business, which quickly made the FTSE 100The Metlen CEO was less flattering about UK and European energy policy which is crucial to his business - \"a bit of metal is essentially energy in solid form,\" he said.Mr Mytilineos is also the president of Eurometaux, Europe's association for the non-ferrous metals and said that higher energy costs compared to the US had ravaged the membership.\"The situation with energy costs in the UK and in Europe for the industry is not viable,\" he said. \"We have hundreds of members. A large number of the most electro-intensive have gone out of business in the last three years. All of them because of the price of energy. They just cannot be competitive. It's as simple as that.\"He said that while he was \"in favour of the green transition\", politicians had not been honest about the costs of the enormous investments needed in the energy infrastructure to bring it about.He said the majority of firms had been eager when asked by politicians 'do you want us to go ahead, full speed on the Green Revolution?'\"But the question should have been, are you prepared accepting the fact that 30% of your salary for the next 30 years would have to be spent in the green transition, and then maybe the answer would have been very different,\" he said.Political messagingHe said the experience of watching investment push bills up in the UK and Europe was making messaging coming out of the US more politically attractive to some.He pointed to US President Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations last month in which he denied climate change, calling it the \"greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\", and refuted the use of renewable energy.\"I mean, it influences a lot of people in the world,\" said Mr Evangelos. \"So you may start to see, like we're seeing in Europe, especially, right wing parties to start blocking more and more measures for the energy transition.\"The answer, he argues, is having a more honest debate.\"We have to measure the needs of the societies and the means of achieving our goal, what we have, and how do we get there?\" he said.He said a debate on energy transition had never happened on a grand scale.\"Let's sit down. How much money we have, how much of that can we spend on infrastructure?\" he said. \"And let's go out and explain to the people, unless we do that, we are not going to have them on board, and there will be more and more resistance.\"He seemed confident that the UK and EU could come to a deal over steel tariffs.To protect EU steel makers, the bloc is proposing a 50% tariff from June next year on all imports from the rest of the world - including the UK.He said co-operation in areas like defence had sweetened the relationship.\"My take from Brussels is the climate towards the UK is much friendlier than it was three, four or five years ago. The fact that the UK is very willing to support Europe on the defence side - I think the climate is much warmer now to make a deal on these issues\".",

    "body": "4 hours ago\"It's one in, one out and back in again!\" for the Daily Express as it says a migrant sent to France - under the prime minister's immigration scheme - has returned to the UK \"on a small boat\". Tories have branded the news a \"farce\" says the Express, adding the return is \"making a mockery of Sir Keir Starmer's 'one in, one out' deal with France.The Daily Telegraph also goes with \"one in, one out then back in again\" for its top line calling it a \"major embarrassment to Sir Keir Starmer\". In other front page news, Jim Gamble, a former police chief \"lined up to lead\" the national inquiry into grooming gangs has withdrawn his candidacy.Metro carries the same headline as the Express and Telegraph, calling it a \"bizarre twist in Starmer's migrant plan\". The face of \"schoolboy Harvey's killer\" is also seen on the front page, as 15-year-old Mohammed Umar Khan has been sentenced to life for the murder of Harvey Willgoose.The Independent also echoes many of today's fronts with \"small boats farce: one in, one out... and back in!\" as its main headline. The PM's flagship policy is \"in chaos\", it says as the \"day of humiliation begins with another dawn crossing\".The Daily Mail dubs the migrant scheme \"le farce\" as it reports a man who has returned to the UK made his second Channel crossing \"just 29 days after he was kicked out of the country\".For The Sun, it says \"come again?\" as it reports on the migrants who have returned. A shot of a dinghy filled with people attempting to cross the Channel takes up much of its front page. The paper quotes Reform UK leader Nigel Farage who says \"illegals are laughing at us\". The Daily Mirror goes with \"unmasked\" for its main headline. The front page is dominated by the newly-released photos of the 15-year-old who fatally stabbed teenager Harvey Willgoose in February.The Guardian leads with the latest on the grooming gang inquiry calling Jim Gamble's exit \"fresh turmoil\". He was the only remaining candidate to chair the inquiry, it writes. A photo of three men in hard hats each carrying a toddler is the paper's lead image - taken in Ukraine, the paper says, after a Kharkiv nursery was hit in a \"wave of Russian airstrikes\".The Times also tops with the grooming inquiry, as it reports \"victims say minister should quit\". Four survivors who quit the inquiry panel said they would only return if Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips steps down. The paper reports survivors have sent a letter to the home secretary saying Phillips is \"unfit\" to oversee the process. Phillips has denied claims the government is seeking to dilute the focus of the inquiry, insisting its scope will be \"laser-focused\".Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been \"urged\" to raise income tax \"as Labour Budget splits emerge\" according to The i Paper. A \"bold move\" is what senior Labour figures argue will \"help fix the UK public finances - and raise £22bn next month\".The Financial Times also headlines on the chancellor, as \"lawyers and accountants rail against Reeves' plans for tax raid on partners\". The paper says they argue the \"raid would hit a cornerstone of the economy\".There's a \"traitor at the Beeb\" writes the Star, as \"celeb circles are awash\" with spoilers for the Traitors finale. It claims TV chiefs are \"battling to keep result under wraps\".The return of a migrant to the UK on a small boat, who'd already been sent back to France under the government's \"one in, one out\" scheme, is the lead for many. \"Le Farce\", declares The Daily Mail. The Daily Express and The Daily Telegraph's headlines both say: \"One in, one out...and back in again!\". The Telegraph carries reaction from Reform UK's leader, Nigel Farage; it quotes him as saying that the policy is \"an abject failure\". The paper also carries comment from the Conservative Party leader, Kemi Badenoch. She says that the government is \"too weak to take the tough decisions to secure our borders\". Writing in The Sun, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood pledges to \"act quicker\" to deport illegal migrants.The Guardian reports on research which suggests that one in 12 secondary school pupils is put into an isolation room at least once a week. The paper says the study from the University of Manchester showed that children with special educational needs were more than twice as likely to be put in isolation, as were pupils who identified as LGBTQ+. It reports researchers as saying that their work showed the practice was \"more widespread and harmful than parents or school leaders realise\".Women over 40 will be asked questions about the menopause during routine NHS check-ups for the first time, The Daily Mail reports. The paper says it's hoped the move will raise awareness of the symptoms so more women recognise the signs. The paper quotes Health Secretary Wes Streeting as saying that many women have been left to \"navigate\" menopause alone, because of an \"outdated health system that fails to acknowledge how serious it can be\".The Independent reports on a collaboration between Agatha Christie's detectives Miss Marple, and Hercule Poirot and the Mr Men and Little Miss books. \"Little Miss Marple, Muddle at the Vicarage\" and \"Mr Poirot, Mischief on the Nile\" are published today. They were commissioned by Adam Hargreaves, whose father Roger, was behind the original Mr Men series.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "9 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorIt might be the peak, or perhaps the mini-summit for the current bump in inflation.Economists across the city suggest its downhill from here, after the inflation rate for September remained static at 3.8%, failing to breach the expected 4% mark.In absolute terms inflation remains too high, higher than other similar countries, and too visible in the everyday items seen in the shops. Just under double the official target of 2% set for the Bank of England.But the direction of travel matters significantly. Even if it should stay around this level for the rest of the year, some significant falls are on the way in the spring, as various regulated price rises last year drop out of the calculation. It would be a much happier place if it were 2.5% in April. However, it is worth remembering that even as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed to the highest inflation in the G7 this year and next, it also said inflation would fall back to the 2% target by the end of next year.Crucially retail industry experts now assert food price inflation has also peaked, though prices remain at painful levels for many.This lowers - though does not eliminate - the chances of self-fulfilling expectations of inflation in the way wages and prices are set. This is the critical factor for the setting of interest rates.My immediate thought was the \"Santa\" rate cut from Andrew Bailey may be back on the table for December. But then I looked again at the information underlying some of last week's numbers from the IMF. Buried in the forecast is the suggestion of four rate cuts over the next year to take interest rates down to 3%. The only reason a cut is not expected next month, according to the IMF, is because it is too close to the Budget.A more benign inflation outlook suddenly makes that look less fanciful. The US Federal Reserve rate cuts are also in the background.The markets seem to be reassessing their view here and around the world. The effective interest rates on UK government debt fell sharply, regardless of whether those loans were for two or for 30 years. Ten-year rates fell to the lowest level this year, while two-year rates dropped to the lowest since last August.This could save a few billion from the gap in the Budget calculations, at just the right time for the chancellor.Even more important, it shows the UK is not being treated as an outlier by the markets. The chancellor went to some effort in her off-the-cuff UK sales pitch to worldwide investors in the US last week. Britain was, she said, the best place to invest and trade globally, that she was going to sort out Brexit-related economic problems and the UK had the fastest declining deficit in the G20.The Budget is going to be a challenge, but catastrophic suggestions about British bankruptcy and bailouts seem quite spectacularly off the mark, assuming that is, that the government does have nearly 400 MPs for its agenda. No one wants to be caught on the wrong side of the very real chance of a tech market crash, or unpredictable spike in the US-China trade war, or perhaps any unexpected innovations in the appointment of the new chair of the Federal Reserve in the US.The inflation number and gilt rate falls offer the chance of some respite, for a break in the circle of doom. The question is whether the tax measures Reeves needs to close even a smaller Budget gap, risk bringing it back through another door.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter PA MediaHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said her department is \"not yet fit for purpose\" after an internal report labelled it dysfunctional and detached from its core functions.Mahmood, who took office last month, said the Home Office had been \"set up to fail\" but said she was working to rebuild it so it \"delivers for this country\".Her comments come after a \"damning\" report uncovered by The Times newspaper found a \"culture of defeatism\" on immigration and failures making it harder to tackle crime and small boats crossings. The report, by the former Home Office special adviser Nick Timothy - who is now a Conservative MP - was commissioned in 2022 by the then home secretary Suella Braverman.Timothy was given access to the department and officials to carry out a two-month review of its effectiveness.He found \"too much time is wasted\" on identity politics and social issues at the Home Office, including \"listening circles\" in working hours in which civil servants meet to discuss their feelings about social and political issues.He warned that the department's performance was \"uneven\" with fragmented structures and no single official responsible for the immigration system as a whole.Among the most serious criticisms was the handling of asylum and immigration. The report described the system as \"lethargic\", with a backlog of 166,000 asylum cases and interviews often delayed for up to two years. Timothy found many civil servants refuse to work in immigration because they were either \"ethically\" opposed to controlling borders or fear the blame when things go wrong.It said the asylum process took an overly \"defensive approach\", with \"assessments of likely legal challenge, and even the possibility of defeat\" used \"as a reason not to do something\".He also highlighted chronic problems with data and technology, warning that the department relied on outdated systems that made it \"impossible to answer straightforward questions quickly\". Timothy dismissed calls to split up the department, calling it a \"distraction from the delivery of core business\".Instead he called for urgent investment in modern, interoperable systems to improve decision-making.On Wednesday, Mahmood said: \"This report, written under the last Government, is damning. To those who have encountered the Home Office in recent years, the revelations are all too familiar.\"The Home Office is not yet fit for purpose, and has been set up for failure. As this report shows, the last Conservative government knew this, but failed to do anything about it.\"Things are now changing. I will work, with the new permanent secretary, to transform the Home Office so that it delivers for this country.\"Mahmood's words echo those of former Labour Home Secretary John Reid, whose warning two decades ago sparked one of Whitehall's biggest shake-ups.In May 2006, Reid told MPs the immigration system was \"not fit for purpose\" following revelations foreign prisoners had been released without being considered for deportation. Reid's warning triggered major reforms that created the Ministry of Justice to run prisons and probation.A senior source told the BBC that Permanent Secretary Antonia Romeo aims to make the Home Office \"the 'blue-chip' department of Whitehall, and the destination department for top talent\".\"Antonia will be relentless in transforming the Home Office to get it match fit,\" the source said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr and Max MatzaUS forces have struck a second vessel alleged to be carrying drugs in the Pacific Ocean, amid an escalating US campaign against seaborne drug smuggling.Three people were killed and no US forces were harmed in the strike on Wednesday, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said. It comes a day after the US struck another boat in the Pacific, killing two people.Both vessels were believed to be carrying drugs along known trafficking routes in international waters, Hegseth added.The strikes are the eighth and ninth against suspected drug boats since 2 September - but the first in waters of the Pacific Ocean. Most US strikes have been in the Caribbean Sea. \"Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization,\" Hegseth posted on X.\"These strikes will continue, day after day. These are not simply drug runners—these are narco-terrorists bringing death and destruction to our cities,\" Hegseth continued.The post was accompanied by a video that appears to show a boat catching fire after being struck by a US bomb. Floating items are then seen in the water, before they appear to be targeted by a second airstrike. US President Donald Trump said he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters, but said he may go to the US Congress if he decides to expand targets to land.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do (it) by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. He said his administration was \"totally prepared\" to expand the anti-drug operations on land, which would mark a significant escalation. At least 37 people have been killed in the US strikes on alleged drug boats, including a recent strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean.Two men survived a strike last week, and were repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador. Ecuador's government later released one man - identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño - saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing. The other man, from Colombia, reportedly remains hospitalised. News of the strike comes as tensions rise between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".\"He better watch it or we'll take very serious action against him and his country,\" Trump said. \"He has led his country into a death trap.\"On Sunday, Trump denounced Petro as an \"illegal drug leader\" who is \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia.\"Trump added that the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, which has historically been one of its closest allies in Latin America. Both Colombia and nearby Ecuador have significant Pacific coastlines that experts have said are used to funnel drugs north towards the US through Central America and Mexico. US estimates from the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, indicate that the vast majority of cocaine bound for US cities passes through the Pacific. Drug seizures in the Caribbean - where the bulk of confirmed US strikes have so far taken place - account for a relatively small percentage of the total, although US officials have warned it is rising.To date, US officials have offered few details on the identities of those killed in the strikes or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belong to.Around 10,000 US troops, as well as dozens of military aircraft and ships, have been deployed to the Caribbean as part of the operation.",

    "body": "9 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsHelen LedwickWhen Helen Ledwick typed \"why do my insides feel like they're falling out\" into Google a decade ago, she had no idea that search would mark the beginning of a life-changing journey.The former BBC 5 Live journalist and podcaster was experiencing pelvic organ prolapse - a condition that affects around one in twelve women, but which many have never even heard of.Prolapse happens when one or more of the organs in the pelvis, such as the bladder, bowel or uterus, slip from their usual position and bulge into the vagina. It's not life-threatening, but it can have a profound impact on daily life, relationships and mental health.For Helen, the shock came just two weeks after a difficult birth with her second child.\"I stood up from the sofa and suddenly felt things shift,\" she recalls. \"It felt like when a tampon isn't sitting properly, you can feel something's not right.\"Confused and frightened, she grabbed a mirror and her phone to see what was happening.\"I'd never even heard the term prolapse before,\" she says, and since talking openly about it she's realised it's often a \"taboo\" subject despite being very common.Helen believes the shame and stigma surrounding it has led to a lack of awareness among women and health professionals - something she's now fighting to change.Helen LedwickHelen says her diagnosis, confirmed by a doctor, brought confusion and fear as she was \"hoping for an explanation, fix or some sense of urgency, instead I got a shrug of the shoulders.\"The initial advice she was given was to not do anything that could make it worse such as running, jumping or lifting.\"It kind of felt like the advice was don't live your life,\" she says.Perhaps more debilitating than the physical symptoms was the isolation Helen felt.\"You live with it in embarrassment, silence, shame and isolation,\" she explains. \"Because you don't talk about it, you think you're the only person in the world it's happened to.\"Helen initially ventured onto Instagram to seek support. Finding other people on the social platform who were similarly anxious and confused and in some cases too embarrassed to seek help prompted her to eventually launch a podcast and write a book, Why mums don't jump.Her goal was to create a platform for women to share stories and break the silence around pelvic health.\"I was angry because no-one ever talked about it. So I decided I would.\"I wanted to give women the knowledge that I'd found so hard to come by, and comfort in knowing they were not on their own.\"Dr Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, says Helen's experience is far from unique and issues can arise as symptoms aren't always obvious.\"Sometimes physically there isn't a lump to see, there's just a feeling of pressure and it might be in the lower back, at the front or slightly higher up near your belly button,\" she explains. \"The symptoms can also be more pronounced during sex which is again massively taboo.\"Prolapse can happen for a variety of reasons including childbirth, heavy lifting, being overweight or even after a hysterectomy. And in rare cases, it can affect men too.Pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes can help to improve symptoms, but sometimes medical treatment is needed such as vaginal pessaries or surgery.Gynaecologist Dr Christine Ekechi says women with prolapse may notice a swelling or a lump within their vagina \"as essentially what has happened is that we have weakening of the ligaments within the pelvic floor that can move for example the bladder\".Helen LedwickHelen says what began as a lonely Google search 15 years ago, has now become something far more powerful, helping women to recognise when there is a problem and seek help.In her case, recovery has been slow, but transformative.\"For me it's been a long process of building up slowly, doing postpartum [immediately after pregnancy] exercises, building up some strength work.\"Eventually she saw a physio who helped her to start running again. Helen says this was \"a massive moment because I really thought that was something I would never do again.\"Now, Helen is doing more than she ever thought possible and has signed up for a 10k run.\"I feel good and I've learned how to manage my symptoms. I've still got prolapse, but it doesn't rule my life in the way that it once was.\"I feel like I'm kind of winning the battle.\"Find out more about the symptoms of pelvic floor prolapse on the NHS website ",

    "body": "Just nowJennifer McKiernan,Political reporter and Chris Graham & Harry Farley,Political correspondentA group of four abuse survivors are demanding Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips resign in a list of conditions for them to re-join the grooming gangs inquiry.The four women have accused Phillips of \"betrayal\" over a letter where she described reports the scope of the inquiry could be expanded as \"untrue\".They also called for their victim liaison officer to go and, along with Phillips' exit, said this would mean the government was \"serious about accountability\", as well as continuing to call for a judge to chair the inquiry.Children's Minister Josh MacAlister has said Phillips has the \"full backing of the prime minister and home secretary\" and will not be asked to go.There has been turmoil over the past week, with Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds quitting the survivors panel in the inquiry on Monday, and two more known as \"Elizabeth\" and \"Jess\" following them on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.They all wrote open letters citing similar concerns, around the inquiry being widened beyond grooming gangs, tight controls on what they could say and who they could speak to, and potential inquiry chairs having links to policing and social care, alongside expertise in tackling child abuse.Phillips published a letter on Tuesday warning there was \"misinformation\" swirling around the inquiry and seeking to \"set the record straight\", saying that taking four months to appoint a chair was not unusual for large public inquiries and was not evidence of a \"cover up\".However, she also wrote that reports the government is \"seeking to dilute the focus of the inquiry, either by instructing it to take a regional approach to investigations or by expanding the scope beyond grooming gangs\" were \"also untrue\", insisting \"its scope will be laser-focused, as Baroness Casey recommended\".This appears have sparked anger among the four survivors, who write in their letter that they had \"raised legitimate concerns around the inquiry's direction\" but \"in response, Jess Phillips called our accounts \"untrue\".They wrote: \"Being publicly contradicted and dismissed by a government minister when you are a survivor telling the truth takes you right back to that feeling of not being believed all over again.\"It is a betrayal that destroyed what little trust remained.\"Speaking to Sky News, MacAlister confirmed there had been no change in support for Phillips, saying \"Jess will stay in post\".Before becoming an MP, Phillips worked for Women's Aid, developing services for victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, human trafficking and exploitation.MacAlister said this showed she was a  \"lifelong advocate and champion for young girls who've been abused,\" adding that she has \"already shown that she's properly engaging with the survivor community\".There has also been support for the way the inquiry has been proceeding from survivors who are staying on the panel.Samantha Walker-Roberts, from Oldham, wants the scope of the inquiry to include victims of other types of sexual abuse, so they are not \"silenced\".She was the victim of a grooming gang when she was 12 - but she was also raped and abused by a man who groomed her online, and as a younger child she was raped and abused by older men who she met through friends.Carly, from Huddersfield, who said she believes \"the most effective way to drive meaningful change is from within\" and remains \"hopeful\" the concerns raised by others \"will lead to constructive improvements\".On Wednesday, former Northern Irish police chief Jim Gamble ruled himself out of chairing the inquiry, saying victims and survivors needed a chair they could all trust and, while the \"majority\" of those on the panel supported him, it was \"clear that a lack of confidence due to my previous occupation exists among some\".Mr Gamble, a child abuse expert who headed up the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) police command, said he had \"hoped that my track record of fierce independence\" would have \"enabled me to proceed and hold the organisations and individuals who failed these young people to account\".But he said a focus on political \"point-scoring\" had created a \"highly charged and toxic environment\" within the inquiry. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Thursday, Mr Gamble said the source of some of this toxicity was social media, where people were \"stirring the pot\" from a distance.He told the programme that he had confidence in Phillips, saying: \"Has she got everything right? I don't think so, but none of us have.\"He also said he had seen no evidence of efforts to dilute the terms of reference for the inquiry or widen its scope.\"At no time did I get the impression that they wanted to shy away from the necessary focus to understand why race, ethnicity and culture is part of the problem with particular gangs.\"Mr Gamble was one of two candidates to chair the inquiry who had been identified. The other, Annie Hudson - who has a background in social work - also withdrew this week.  Watch: PM says grooming gangs inquiry will examine \"ethnicity and religion of offenders\"At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch joined calls for Phillips to be sacked, saying the inquiry is about \"Labour failure\".She said: \"Labour never wanted this inquiry, we demanded it... It is Labour ministers attacking the victims. We're standing up for them.\"The prime minister defended Phillips, saying she \"has probably more experience than any other person in this House in dealing with violence against women and girls\".He said \"survivors have been ignored for many years\" by the state and invited those that have quit the inquiry to re-join. He added that, whether they did or not, \"we owe it to them\" to answer their concerns.\"The inquiry is not and will never be watered down. Its scope will not change. It will examine the ethnicity and religion of the offenders and we will find the right person to chair the inquiry,\" he told MPs.The prime minister also announced Baroness Casey was being drafted in to support the work of the inquiry.Baroness Casey previously led a \"national audit\" of group-based child sexual exploitation that found the ethnicity of people involved in grooming gangs had been \"shied away from\" by authorities.Her findings, published in June 2025, prompted Sir Keir to order the creation of the national inquiry.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterBBCSpoiler warning: This article reveals details from the fifth episode of The Celebrity Traitors\"We've utterly failed,\" said David Olusoga, as the fifth episode of the Celebrity Traitors neared its end.And he wasn't the only celebrity who seemed mired in self doubt.\"So far, I've been so useless it's breath-taking,\" said Kate Garraway.Celia Imrie admitted being \"befuddled\", Sir Stephen Fry complained it's \"so dashed difficult\".And the whole nation shouted at their screens, wondering why the celebrities are quite so rubbish at catching a traitor.The episode started with another faithful - singer Charlotte Church - hitting the dust, as she became the Traitors' latest victim.Presenter Claudia Winkleman echoed all of our frustration, as she ticked off the celebs at breakfast.\"The voice of an angel and now she is among them,\" Winkleman said, solemnly, about Church's murder.\"You've lost seven faithfuls. Think about that while you enjoy your cheese,\" she said, before storming out.\"She doesn't like us does she,\" noted comedian Lucy Beaumont.But cracks quickly started to emerge in the treacherous trio of Traitors - Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross and Cat Burns.Celebs stumped as they try and decipher Traitors' identityEarly on in the episode, Burns started turning on Ross. \"This game is making me evil, but I've got to think for myself here,\" she said to the cameras.She also raised his name in an incredibly tense roundtable later in the show.Imrie and Sir Stephen also shared their suspicions that Ross could be a traitor during Wednesday's episode.And social media certainly wants him out. \"Get Jonathan Ross OUT!\" wrote India Willoughby, while Freddie Fraser from this year's civilian traitors said the same on TikTok. But the episode ended in a dramatic tied vote at the roundtable, with two faithfuls - Scottish actor Mark Bonnar and historian David Olusoga - receiving an equal amount of votes.That means the banishment will be left “to the hands of fate,” Winkleman said.\"Jonathan Ross could put a giant 'It's Me' sticker on his head and still not get voted off,\" lamented one X user.“As Alan Carr says, the faithful have got to up the nerve at the banishment table and behave less like pussycats and more like rottweilers,” said TV reporter Siobhan Synnot.Social media users were left wondering who has been dressing Jonathan RossElsewhere, the giggling, sweating, nervously-scratching-his-head Alan Carr remains a thing of the past.Now a cold-hearted killer, Carr seemed to take great pleasure in watching the faithfuls try and work out who had been murdered.“To be sitting there outwitting Stephen Fry, I mean, it's like beating Albert Einstein in chess or Cluedo or something,\" Carr said.\"I just started stuffing cheese in my mouth cos I can't stop grinning. Isn't it funny? I was so nervous when Claudia squeezed my shoulder blade, and now I just love being a traitor.\"Other talking points from Wednesday's show include Ross's outfits... again. And not only because he insists on walking around in sunglasses (surely this looks like a man who has something to hide?).“Once again Jonathan Ross proves he has one of the strangest choice of clothes ever seen on Traitors,” wrote one X user.Cat Burns - one of the younger celebs - revealing she doesn’t know who Helen Mirren is was another joyful moment. “She’s a national treasure,” her fellow players told her.Elsewhere, Celia Imrie continues to surprise us all - as she revealed she has a crush on Ross when she voted for him.And people on social media seemed pleasantly surprised at Mark Bonnar's singing during the challenge.\"Mark singing from the trap is such a vibe,\" wrote one X user.\"Not Mark singing Loch Lomond in the bear trap, I love it,\" said entertainment reporter Jodie McCallum. \"This is the Scottish representation we need.\"The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.More on The Celebrity Traitors",

    "body": "Trump says Putin talks 'don't go anywhere' as he imposes new sanctions 31 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House, Max Matza and Ian Aikman'It was time', says Trump on increase in Russia sanctionsThe US has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies in an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.The announcement came one day after US President Donald Trump said a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Budapest would be shelved indefinitely.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump said.While the economic impact to Russia is likely to be minimal, the latest sanctions represent a major shift in foreign policy from the Trump White House, which has previously said it would not impose sanctions until European nations ceased buying Russian oil.Trump had repeatedly threatened tougher measures against Moscow, but has avoided them until now in hopes of brokering a peace deal in the three-and-a-half year long invasion.His administration has sought to cast the US as a somewhat neutral mediator between the two warring nations, after years of full-throated support for Ukraine from his predecessor, Joe Biden.But the US president has grown increasingly exasperated with the Kremlin over its failure to move forward with negotiations.The sanctions are also something Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, has been for months calling for. He said they were a \"good signal\" from the US, adding that a ceasefire was possible if other nations applied more pressure on Russia.On Wednesday, Trump criticised Putin for not being serious about making peace and said that he hoped that the sanctions would force a breakthrough.\"I just felt it was time. We waited a long time,\" he said.He called the sanctions package \"tremendous\", adding that he hoped they could be swiftly withdrawn if Russia agreed to stop the war.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the sanctions were needed due to \"Putin's refusal to end this senseless war\". He said the affected oil companies - Rosneft and Lukoil - funded the Kremlin's \"war machine\".Oil and gas are Russia's biggest exports. The two Russian oil firms export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. Rosneft is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production, which makes up 6% of the global output, according to UK government estimates.Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey. Trump has also urged these countries to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.Ukraine has in recent months targeted Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure in an attempt to hurt its economy.Zelensky had visited the White House on Friday, seeking to acquire long-range Tomahawk missiles that could strike deep into Russian territory, but came away empty-handed.The day before, Trump had announced the proposal to meet Putin in Hungary after an unscheduled call from the Russian leader.But following a call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, the idea was put on hold, with Trump saying he didn't want a \"wasted meeting\".Trump later said he had refused to give Ukraine the missiles as they were \"highly complex\" and took a year of intense training to use. Zelensky appeared to suggest that, like with the sanctions, Trump may change his mind in the future.Fighting on the ground continued overnight, with strikes on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, killing at least two people, officials said. Earlier on Wednesday, Russia unleashed an intense bombardment that killed at least seven people, including children. Getty ImagesTrump and Putin met in Alaska in August in hopes of ending the war in Ukraine. A second meeting has now been shelved. Last week, the UK slapped a similar sanctions package on Rosneft and Lukoil, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves stating that \"there is no place for Russian oil on global markets\".Russia's embassy in London said targeting its country's major energy companies would disrupt global fuel supplies and drive up costs worldwide. It added: \"Pressure only complicates peaceful dialogue and leads to further escalation.\"Children among victims in Russian strikesWhy Trump can't make breakthrough with PutinEurope's leaders back call for frontline freezeEurope's reliance on Russian oil and gas has fallen dramatically since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but Russian gas still accounts for 13% of EU imports - though the bloc has pledged to phase it out completely.Trump had previously said he would only impose further sanctions on Moscow if Europe completely stopped buying Russian energy.EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen praised a new sanctions package approved by the EU on Wednesday, which includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports by 2028.She said this, along with the US sanctions, were \"a clear signal from both sides of the Atlantic that we will keep up collective pressure on the aggressor\".Earlier this year, the UK and US also sanctioned major Russian energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.EPARutte said \"sustained pressure\" will bring Putin to the negotiating tableNato Secretary General Mark Rutte was at the White House when the sanctions were announced, and praised the move for \"putting more pressure\" on Putin.He was expected to discuss a 12-point plan formulated by European allies and Kyiv that would see the current front lines frozen, a return of deported children as well as a prisoner exchange.The plan also includes a war recovery fund for Ukraine, as well as security guarantees and a clear pathway for Ukraine to join the EU.Trump has indicated that a key sticking point has been Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line - something Zelensky is in favour of.Russia has pushed back against that idea, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov indicating Russia had not changed its position of wanting Ukrainian troops to leave the parts of the eastern Donbas region Kyiv still controls.Additional reporting by Pritti Mistry and Danielle KayeFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "9 hours agoPeter RuddickBusiness reporterBBC/Lola DesignOnline shopping giant Temu has agreed to work with the greeting card industry to remove copied designs from its site more quickly.Card firms say hundreds of their copyrighted images have been used to create cheap rip-offs, costing them thousands of pounds in lost sales.Designers told the BBC the process for getting the plagiarised listings removed has been like the fairground game 'whack-a-mole' with copied products re-appearing within days.Temu said protecting intellectual property was a \"top priority\" and that it was encouraging sellers to join the trial of a new takedown process specifically for the greetings card industry.BBC/Lola DesignAmanda Mountain, the co-founder of York-based Lola Design, discovered the catalogue of designs she had built up over a decade had nearly all been copied.She found the images she had created had been lifted and were being advertised by other sellers on cards and other products like t-shirts.Amanda bought one of the cards using her design and found the image was distorted and the paper was of a poorer quality than hers.\"It's not a nice feeling to see something you've poured all your love and hours into taken within minutes,\" she told the BBC. \"I was in shock, and I actually thought to myself 'what is the point of me still designing, I might as well just stop now'.\"BBC/Citrus BunnAmanda, and her husband and business partner Frank, estimate that fraudulent versions of their products have made online sellers £100,000 in sales, equivalent to about 13% of Lola Design's annual turnover.However, Amanda said it is both the emotional toll and the time taken to get the copycat products removed that have had the biggest impact.\"Every piece that I create is actually a piece of me,\" she said. \"I know that sounds crazy, but it is. Every designer gives out a piece of themselves because they just want to create a little bit of happiness, and it is not much to ask for people to respect that.\"Lola DesignAfter pressure from the Greeting Card Association (GCA), Temu has now put in place a bespoke takedown process for the industry which, it says, will mean stolen designs are removed more quickly and won't be able to be re-uploaded.Previously, card firms would have to report each individual listing but, as part of the trial, they will now only have to submit one link. The software will remove the product and any others using the same design.One card publisher, who helped develop the new system, saw 68 listings removed automatically. Something which previously might have meant 68 separate forms or emails to Temu.According to the GCA, the system will then use AI to log the designer's original creation as a protected image. It will then block any products using that design before they appear for sale.BBC/Lola DesignIn a statement, Temu said \"intellectual property protection is a top priority\" and that it had \"invested heavily in resources to strengthen trust with brands, sellers and consumers\".It said most requests to take down copyrighted content were resolved within three working days, but that greeting card firms were being encouraged to join the new trial which it said would lead to more products being removed automatically.The system is bespoke to the card industry, however the BBC understands it could be used as a model for similar or alternative processes for other products. Amanda Fergusson, the chief executive of the GCA, said the industry welcomed the changes. \"We know our members feel very strongly about copycat sellers, and what's more we also know customers are often disappointed by cheap copies,\" she said.\"Our dialogue with Temu and the actions they're taking, is a welcome first-step to address those issues,\" she added.For Amanda and Frank, it is not just their livelihoods at stake but the future of the whole supply chain which relies on the 1.5bn greeting cards sold in the UK each year.\"At some point, its going to be the consumers that are going to be affected, not just us as designers, because there won't be any high streets,\" Amanda said. She also had a message for people buying copycat cards: \"Cheap always comes at a cost.\"",

    "body": "8 minutes agoAvon and Somerset PoliceMark Killick has three previous convictions for fraud dating back to 2008A \"prolific rogue trader\" who lured customers in with his \"charm and charisma\" has been found guilty of 37 counts of fraud.Mark Killick, who also operated under the aliases Marc Cole and Mark Jenkins, failed to complete building work at properties across the West of England between December 2019 and November 2021.The 56-year-old, of Shoe Lane in Paulton, Somerset, was found guilty of the 37 counts of fraud and cleared of one at Bristol Crown Court earlier following a three month trial. It is his fourth conviction for fraud since 2008.The prosecution highlighted Killick's spending on luxury goods, including a £25,000 Rolex watch which he claimed was an asset for the failing business.Police estimate that the 37 victims collectively lost more than £1.25m.Mark Killick has three previous convictions for fraud dating back to 2008The jury failed to reach a verdict on eight further charges against him. Avon and Somerset Police and Trading Standards received more than 100 complaints against Killick covering a period between 2019 and 2021.Martyn Nicklin, from Bristol Trading Standards, said Killick offered people their \"dream extension\" or renovation, which he started but frequently left \"completely unfinished\".He described Killick as an \"excellent salesperson\" who used his \"charisma and charm\" to defraud people.\"I think he is still one of the most prolific rogue traders that we've ever dealt with, if not the most prolific,\" he said.\"Certainly the scale, the number of victims, the financial impact; the harm that he's caused is vast,\" he added.TD ColeMany customers said they were enticed by the sleek website for Killick's company, TD Cole'Lengthy sentence' inevitableMark Killick's trial at Bristol Crown Court began in May 2025 and lasted until 10 October, with about three months of evidence. A reporting restriction imposed by the judge prevented media reporting the result of the case until now.Killick is due to be sentenced in December, with the judge having already told him a \"lengthy custodial sentence is inevitable\".Killick claimed in court he intended to run an honest business but was hampered by factors beyond his control - including a shortage of workers due to the pandemic and England doing well in the Euros championship.He was involved in a car accident on the M5 on 17 May 2021, which he used repeatedly as an excuse for delays.The prosecution said Killick spent money on overnight stays at luxury resorts, which he claimed were business trips.He also bought expensive jewellery which included a £25,000 Rolex Submariner watch he purchased from a jeweller in Bath in August 2020, just days after he had been given a £50,000 Covid bounceback loan.Killick was involved in a car crash on 17 May 2021, and soon began using photographic proof of the accident as an excuse for lengthy delaysKillick took on at least two new customers per week on average during 2020 and 2021, some just weeks before he placed TD Cole into liquidation.In a video shown in court, one of Killick's co-directors confronted him about taking large deposits when the company was in financial trouble. In it, Killick can be heard saying: \"We've lost everything. We've lost every penny, and that's it. It's all gone.\"",

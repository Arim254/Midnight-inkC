    "body": "Police have arrested two people \"for racially aggravated public order offences\" after they allegedly \"shouted slogans involving calls for intifada\" at a pro-Palestinian protest in central London.Five people in total were arrested, including one for obstructing the arrests of people shouting slogans and two more for public order offences, one of which was \"racially aggravated\", the Metropolitan Police said.The arrests came hours after the Met and Greater Manchester Police said they would arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" - an Arabic word for uprising.In a statement after Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, they said: \"Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed - words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\"The two forces also referenced the Manchester synagogue attack in October.The police forces said \"we know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'globalise the intifada' and those using it at future protests or in a targeted way should expect\" the two forces \"to take action\".\"Frontline officers will be briefed on this enhanced approach. We will also use powers under the Public Order Act, including conditions around London synagogues during services,\" the statement said.The UK's chief rabbi described the decision as \"an important step towards challenging the hateful rhetoric we have seen on our streets, which has inspired acts of violence and terror\".Visible patrols and protective security measures around synagogues, schools and community venues have been stepped up in London and Greater Manchester.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in Sunday's Bondi attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.Two people died in the knife attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on 2 October.Criticising the move by the police forces on Wednesday, Palestinian Solidarity Campaign director Ben Jamal described the move as \"another low in the political repression of protest for Palestinian rights\". He said police had not consulted the coalition that organises major protests in London or representative groups of the Palestinian community in the UK \"before making this far-reaching statement on our rights\".\"The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country,\" Mr Jamal added.In support of the statement, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said: \"We strongly welcome this necessary intervention.\" \"We have long warned that people chanting slogans like 'globalise the intifada' are inciting violence, and we have been making the case for robust enforcement in relation to this slogan with government at all levels for some time,\" the board said.Gideon Falter, chief executive of Campaign Against Antisemitism, said police chiefs \"are only now waking up\" after \"two years of repeatedly excusing calls to 'globalise the intifada'\".He said that \"banning this one chant is a useless token measure\", and added \"it is hard to see how they will possibly enforce this ban\".The Jewish Voice for Liberation - which describes itself as standing for the rights of Jews and Palestinians - said it did not believe the response was appropriate and had \"very rarely, if ever\" encountered antisemitism at protests. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in Parliament on Wednesday that his government had increased funding for Jewish security up to £28m.\"I'm pleased to do that, but I'm sad to do that,\" he said, adding that he had ordered a review of protest and hate crime laws.He was responding to a question from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said antisemitism was real and \"poisonous\", and that \"we must all work together to stamp it out\".The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people.Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.Update 17 December 2025: An earlier version of this article sought to explain the wider background to the Met and GMP announcement by referring to the first Palestinian intifada - including the description that it was \"largely unarmed\" - and the second intifada. However the language used in this brief summary did not give a clear enough or complete picture of the history and so this section has been amended to instead explain the context around the ongoing use of the term.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterReutersBP has appointed a new chief executive, making Meg O'Neill the first woman to run a major global oil firm.The London-based energy giant said its current boss Murray Auchincloss would step down less than two years after he replaced Bernard Looney, who was found to have committed \"serious misconduct\" in failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.BP executive vice president Carol Howle will serve as interim chief executive until Ms O'Neill, who has led Australian energy firm Woodside Energy since 2021, takes up her new role on 1 April.Ms O'Neill said she looks forward to helping BP \"do our part to meet the world's energy needs\".Mr Auchincloss, who took over from Mr Looney in September 2024, said he had told BP's chairman in September that he was open to stepping down \"were an appropriate leader identified\".\"I am confident that BP is now well positioned for significant growth and I look forward to watching the company's future progress,\" he said after Ms O'Neill's appointment was announced. He will serve in an advisory role until December 2026.Ms O'Neill said she would prioritise re-establishing the oil giant's market leadership, as well as advancing safety and driving innovation and sustainability.BP praised Ms O'Neill's time as chief executive of Woodside Energy, pointing to the firm's takeover of BHP Petroleum International in 2022.It said she had grown the business into the largest energy company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.Before joining Woodside, Ms O'Neill spent 23 years in technical, operational and leadership positions at Texas-based energy firm ExxonMobil.Mr Looney was dismissed without notice, and forfeited up to £32.4m ($43.3m) in salary and benefits, after admitting that he was not \"fully transparent\" about his past personal relationships.BP's board said they had been \"knowingly misled\" by Mr Looney.At the time, Mr Looney said in a statement that he was \"disappointed with the way this situation has been handled\".Ms O'Neill's appointment comes as BP is cutting its renewable energy investments and instead focusing on increasing oil and gas production.In February, the energy giant said it would shift its strategy following pressure from some investors who were frustrated that its profits and share price had lagged behind rivals.Rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's call to \"drill baby drill\" has encouraged firms to invest in fossil fuels.",

    "body": "7 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterFifa will finally release its much-anticipated return to video games in 2026, several years after its acrimonious split with developer EA.But it is Netflix, rather than a major game studio, which has secured the rights to the upcoming football game.Once one of the most profitable brands in gaming history, issues including a costly licence prompted Fifa's previous publisher Electronic Arts to stop using the name in 2023 - instead naming its best-selling game EA Sports FC.Netflix said the new Fifa would be developed and published by Delphi Interactive - which has yet to release a video game - and released ahead of the 2026 World Cup.It said subscribers will be able to play online via the Netflix app on iOS and Android devices - or on select TVs by using their phone as the controller.EA Sports released the first Fifa game in 1993, and ran the franchise for 30 years until moving away from the branding to create its own.The series was estimated to have around 150 million players.But the renamed game still connected with fans - with EA FC 24 being the best-selling game in the UK in 2023.Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the football governing body was \"very excited\" to team up with Netflix Games ahead of the World Cup in 2026.\"Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football,\" he said. \"It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for Fifa.\"California-based Delphi Interactive, the studio behind the game, is also working in partnership with IO Interactive on a new James Bond title, 007: First Light.The firm's boss Casper Daugaard said as \"lifelong Fifa fans\" it wanted to make the game \"the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created\".Reaction to the announcement has so far been mixed, with some fans questioning whether the mobile-first focus from Netflix was the way forward for the franchise.\"FIFA should never have left EA,\" said one person on social media site X. \"Let's see what the new game's got.\"",

    "body": "Dan Bongino has said he will leave his role as the FBI's deputy director in January.In a post on X, he thanked President Donald Trump, as well as the director of the FBI and the attorney general \"for the opportunity to serve with purpose\".It comes after Trump said earlier on Wednesday that the former podcast host \"did a great job\" in office, and \"wants to go back to his show\".Bongino, who was appointed to the role by Trump in February, was previously a New York City police officer and a US Secret Service agent assigned to protect Barack Obama. In recent years, he built a large following through his podcast and other media appearances. Bongino, a staunch Trump ally, was considered a surprise pick for the role –  which had previously been held by career agents – because he had no prior experience with the agency.The FBI Agents Association, which represents around 14,000 current and former agents, had opposed his appointment to the position.Announcing his decision in a social media post on Wednesday, he said: \"I will be leaving my position with the FBI in January. I want to thank President Trump, AG [Pam] Bondi, and Director [Kash] Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose.\"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you. God bless America, and all those who defend Her.\"Before joining the agency, Bongino had echoed disinformation and conspiracy theories about Trump's false claim that he won the 2020 election, and about the 6 January 2021 pipe bomb investigation. Bongino had also questioned whether sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had taken his own life in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited trial. In July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo that said Epstein did take his own life.The memo frustrated many of Trump's supporters, who echoed the Epstein conspiracy theories and rejected the justice department's findings.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "4 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentKing Charles has met a group of rail staff and passengers who had shown bravery during the Huntingdon train knife attack last month.The group included railway worker Samir Zitouni, who was hailed for his efforts to save passengers, train driver Andrew Johnson, and Stephen Crean, who was stabbed in the hand when he intervened.Eleven people were treated in hospital for injuries after the attack on the London-bound train, that had been diverted to Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire.Anthony Williams, 32, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder related to the train attack. There was much praise for the response of passengers and train crews during the incident on the service between Doncaster and London King's Cross on a Saturday evening.In Parliament, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood paid tribute to the \"breathtaking bravery\" of those who had helped, including the \"heroic acts of the passengers and train crew who intercepted the attacker\".MPs had called for the highest civilian medal, the George Cross, to be awarded to those who had shown great bravery.King Charles gave his own recognition with an audience at the Palace, where he posed for photographs with the visitors.They included Andrew Johnson, the train driver who was praised by Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander for diverting the train from the fast to the slow track after the alarm was raised.A short hearing in the case against Mr Williams was adjourned at Cambridge Crown Court earlier this month and proceedings are due to resume on 28 January 2026.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterLabour has granted six areas in and around London the power to make larger council tax hikes after reducing their share of government funding.Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, City of London, and Windsor and Maidenhead will be allowed to raise rates by more than 5% for two years without local voters needing to sign off the move.The authorities are among those expected to lose out under a move to shift more government cash towards deprived areas from next year. Ministers say the shake-up will make England's funding model fairer - but the Conservatives have accused them of wanting to \"punish\" low-tax councils.The new system, to be phased in over three years from 2026, aims to shift a greater share of government funding towards councils in England with higher deprivation and a higher share of properties in lower council tax bands.Labour argues these areas were harder hit when government grants were slashed during the austerity era in the 2010s, and that current funding rules, last updated in 2013, fail to reflect high demand among their residents for council services.A tweak to the new rules last month was believed to lessen the blow to inner London councils compared with the original proposals, unveiled in June, including by factoring in housing costs when deprivation is calculated.But the Institute of Fiscal Studies said the six councils granted additional council tax-raising powers were still among those areas facing the largest falls in their share of government funding.The think tank added that more urban and more deprived areas were set to see much bigger increases overall. It has previously said that outer London boroughs would fare better under the proposals. The six areas granted additional flexibility over council tax will be able to raise rates by more than 5% in 2026 and 2027 without the usual legal requirement to have it signed off in a local referendum.The local government department said the areas had been identified because of their \"very low\" council tax rates, with households in Band D paying between £450 and £1,280 less than the average in England.No council has ever won a referendum to raise council tax beyond 5% – although councils in precarious financial positions have been granted special permission to do so by the government, increasingly so in recent years.Residents in Birmingham have seen tax increases of more than 17% to balance the books over the last two years, after facing effective bankruptcy, while Croydon in south London raised its rates by 15% in 2023.The Conservatives said the funding review would \"punish councils that keep council tax low\" whilst \"moving funding to badly-run Labour councils that spend irresponsibly\".\"Inevitably, councils that lose out will be forced to cut services or raise tax - and with referendum principles scrapped, those hikes will be big,\" added shadow local government secretary Sir James Cleverly.Reform UK said the settlement would leave rural areas behind, \"funnelling money towards Labour-dominated London and city councils\".It comes as the government confirmed the overall level of council funding will go up by £3.9bn next year, 5.8%, assuming that all councils put up council tax by the maximum 5% across the board.

You know I was doing what I believed in as well as loved, with people I respected, and for reasons that matter to me, my country and democracy and freedom in this world.\"I was proud of what I was doing. Don't remember me with sadness and loss. Be proud.\"Ministry of DefenceLance Corporal George Hooley was 28 years old when he died serving in UkraineEarlier on Wednesday, a private ceremony was held at Brize Norton before L/Cpl Hooley's body was carried past mourners lining the route to the Carterton Repatriation Memorial Garden.He was due to be promoted to Corporal in January and had been given the role's responsibilities on his deployment to Ukraine, the MoD said.L/Cpl Hooley, who had previously been deployed to Afghanistan, Africa and Eastern Europe, was described in tributes as having a \"rare gift\" of \"deep kindness\".His company commander said: \"If you met George Hooley, you remembered it. His energy and enthusiasm were simply extraordinary.\"He provided spark that lifted others, a drive that inspired, and a zest for life that reminded us all how to live with purpose and joy. And we loved him for it. George had a rare gift: a deep kindness and genuine time for everyone.\"",

    "body": "18 hours agoVishnukant TiwariMadhya PradeshOn a recent winter morning in Panna, a diamond mining region in central India, two childhood friends made a discovery that they think could change their lives forever.Satish Khatik and Sajid Mohammed stumbled upon a large, glistening rock on a plot of land they had leased just weeks earlier.When they took the stone to the city's official diamond evaluator, they learnt they had found a 15.34-carat gem-quality diamond - one of the finest varieties of natural diamonds that exist.\"The estimated market price of the stone is around five to six million rupees [$55,000 - $66,000; £41,000 - £49,000] and it will be auctioned soon,\" Anupam Singh, the diamond evaluator, told BBC Hindi. The government holds quarterly auctions, drawing buyers from across India and abroad to bid for the diamonds.\"Estimated prices depend on the dollar rate and benchmarks set by the Rapaport report,\" Mr Singh said. Rapaport is widely regarded as a leading authority on independent diamond and jewellery market analysis.Mr Khatik and Mr Mohammed say they are over the moon. \"We can now get our sisters married,\" they said.Mr Khatik, 24, who runs a meat shop and Mr Mohammed, 23 who sells fruits, come from poor backgrounds and are the youngest sons in their families. For generations, their families have been trying their luck at finding diamonds, which is a common quest among the district's residents.Panna, which is in Madhya Pradesh state, is among India's least developed districts - its residents face poverty, water scarcity and unemployment. But it's also home to most of India's diamond reserves and remains a prime destination for diamond hunters.India's diamond reserves are relatively limited compared with the world's major producers, but they are historically significant.While most mines are run by the federal government, state authorities lease small plots to locals each year at nominal rates. With few job opportunities in the city, residents hope for a prized find to improve their fortunes - but most come up empty-handed.Mr Mohammed says that his father and grandfather had dug through these plots for decades but discovered nothing more that \"dust and slivers of quartz\".His father Nafees says that the \"gods have finally rewarded their hard work and patience\".They leased a plot in search of diamonds partly out of desperation, as their meagre incomes could not keep pace with rising household costs - let alone pay for a wedding, Mr Mohammed told the BBC.Searching for diamonds is no easy task but the two friends would sift through mounds of dirt after work in the evenings, or whenever they got time off from their day jobs.Like most locals, they searched for diamonds by hand - digging pits, hauling out soil and rock, washing it through sieves and carefully sifting through thousands of tiny stones once dried.Ravi Patel, Panna's district mining officer, said the two friends were incredibly lucky. \"They had leased out a plot on 19 November. It's their luck that they found a diamond of gem quality within a few weeks,\" he said.Though they have yet to collect the money, Mr Khatik and Mr Mohammed say they are hopeful.\"We are not thinking of buying land, expanding our businesses or moving to a bigger city; not yet. For now, we are focused on getting our sisters married,\" they said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBBCMurray Dowey was 16 when he took his own lifeA Scottish couple whose teenage son took his own life after being blackmailed on Instagram are suing the platform's owner Meta, in what's thought to be the first UK case of its kind.Murray Dowey, from Dunblane, was 16 when he became a victim of sextortion in December 2023.His parents have now launched legal action against Meta in a US court seeking punitive damages claiming that Instagram was not safe.Meta, which also owns Facebook, has been contacted for comment. It previously said it had made changes to the platform to protect children.Murray died in his home in Dunblane in December 2023 after he was targeted by scammers posing as a young girl. He was tricked into sending intimate images of himself and told they would be exposed to his family if he did not pay.Lawyers for his parents are now claiming Meta \"knew of safety features that would prevent sextortion\" prior to his death and instead \"prioritised profit\".Previously the company has said it had made real changes to Instagram, such as introducing teen accounts with built-in protections and giving parents the power to control their children's online experiences.Speaking to BBC news, his Murray's mother Ros said: \"The worst thing that could possibly happen to us has happened. \"There's nothing that Meta can do that is worse than what's happened so we're up for the fight. \"We'll take it as far as we can.\"The lawsuit, filed by the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC) on behalf of Mark and Ros Dowey, is believed to be the first UK case of its kind.Murray's parents, Mark and Ros Dowey, are taking the legal actionMurray's parents are named alongside a woman, Tricia Maciejewski, from Pennsylvania. Her son, Levi Maciejewski, took his own life at 13 years old.Sextortion has become big business in Nigeria involving thousands of young men nicknamed \"yahoo boys\".Guides on how to get involved in the crime are openly for sale online, as a BBC News investigation revealed earlier this year.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentTwo remand prisoners waiting to go on trial for alleged offences relating to Palestine Action have ended a hunger strike protest - but five more are said to be continuing to refuse food.The detainees, in various prisons, have made a series of demands including calling for the ban on Palestine Action to be lifted and for a defence firm with links to Israel to be shut down.The two longest-protesting detainees have been refusing food for 45 days according to supporters - a claim that has not been disputed by officials.Three people were arrested following a protest outside HMP Bronzefield in Ashford,  Surrey, in support of one of the prisoners.Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer said \"rules and procedures\" were being followed in relation to the hunger strike.Lawyers for the group have repeatedly written to Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy asking for a meeting, saying there is a \"real and increasingly likely potential\" that their clients would die as a result of their protest.Fifty-one MPs and peers have also written to Lammy asking him to meet the lawyers.The protests, which began in November, involve people who have all been charged with offences relating to alleged break-ins or criminal damage on behalf of Palestine Action, charges that are denied. The alleged incidents all occurred before Palestine Action was banned under terrorism legislation - but their trials are not taking place before next year.Supporters of the detainees confirmed to BBC News on Wednesday that Jon Cink and Umer Khalid had both ended their hunger strike after 41 days and 13 days respectively.Qesser Zuhrah and Amy Gardiner-Gibson are said to have each been refusing food for 45 days. Heba Muraisi began her protest a day later. Teuta Hoxha is said to have refused for 38 days and Kamran Ahmed 37 days. An eighth prisoner is described by supporters as intermittently joining the protest but then breaking it because of an underlying health condition.Some of the group have had periods in hospital but in each case they have been discharged or have self-discharged. Your Party MP Zarah Sultana has protested outside HMP Bronzefield, demanding urgent medical care for Qesser Zuhrah, who is on remand there.On Wednesday, an ambulance arrived at the prison and video posted on social media showed scuffles between protesters and police.Police were called after protesters \"attempted to gain entry to restricted areas\", Surrey Police said.According to police, a member of prison staff was assaulted while officers tried to remove protesters from the building.A 29-year-old man from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was arrested for suspected assault occasioning bodily harm.\"At the point of arresting this man, several people became disruptive towards police and a police officer was assaulted,\" Surrey Police added.\"The protesters then blocked the road, delaying our ability to get medical assistance to the injured officer.\" A woman, 28, from Worcester Park, Surrey, was arrested on suspicion of assault causing grievous bodily harm, and a man, 28, from Glasgow, was taken into custody on suspicion of criminal damage to a police vehicle.A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson said: \"The escalation of the protest at HMP Bronzefield is completely unacceptable. \"While we support the right to protest, it is deeply concerning that a member of staff has now been injured and protesters are gaining access to staff entrances – putting hard-working staff and security at risk.\"A spokesman for the South East Coast Ambulance Service would not comment on whether the ambulance had transported a protester to hospital.During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said to Sir Keir that ministers had declined to meet the protesters' representatives and one of the group had been taken to hospital.\"Many people are very concerned by the regular breaches of prison conditions and prison rules with respect to these hunger strikes,\" he said.\"Will he make arrangements for the Ministry of Justice to meet representatives of the hunger strikers to discuss these breaches of the conditions that they're experiencing at the present time?\"Sir Keir replied: \"He will appreciate there are rules and procedures in place in relation to hunger strikes, and we're following those rules and procedures.\"On Tuesday, justice minister Jake Richards said in answer to an earlier question from Corbyn that he would not be meeting the group's lawyers and the Ministry of Justice had \"robust and proper guidance and procedures\" for such scenarios.\"I am satisfied, and the ministry is satisfied, that those procedures are being enacted and we'll continue to keep it under review.\"An MoJ spokesperson said: \"Prisoners' wellbeing is continually assessed, and appropriate action is taken, including hospital treatment where required.\"They added His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service had assured ministers that all cases of prisoner food refusal were being managed in accordance with the relevant policy, and with appropriate medical assessment and support - consistent with prisoner rights.",

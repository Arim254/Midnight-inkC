    "body": "6 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness correspondentPA MediaGlobal Counsel, the lobbying firm co-founded by Peter Mandelson, has confirmed it is preparing to enter administration on Friday.Staff have reportedly been told the move became inevitable when leading clients severed their relationships with the company, after details emerged of apparent links with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Lord Mandelson resigned from the board of Global Counsel in 2024, though he remained a shareholder until earlier this month. His co-founder, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, stepped down as chief executive on 6 February.Sources close to the company insist its difficulties stem entirely from \"the Mandelson legacy\" and not from any actions by staff.Global Counsel warned there will be \"a significant number of redundancies being made by the administrators when they take control of the company\" on Friday. The lobbying firm was set up by Lord Mandelson and Wegg-Prosser after Labour lost the 2010 general election.It became a highly influential lobbying firm in Westminster, advising high-profile clients such as Shell, TikTok and Barclays.The company employs more than 100 people and has offices in Berlin, Brussels, Singapore, Washington DC and Doha.However, its future was thrown into question following the publication of documents from the Epstein files, which cast light on Lord Mandelson's links with the disgraced financier.In a statement on Thursday, Global Counsel said \"many clients\" had remained loyal to the firm in recent weeks. But it added: \"The continuing maelstrom of political and media attention surrounding Peter Mandelson has made it challenging to continue with the business in its current form.\"The administrators-in-waiting have already indicated that, in the unlikely event that any ongoing servicing of clients is viable, this will be on a limited basis only.\"The files also contained mentions of a meeting between Wegg-Prosser and Epstein in 2010, two years after the latter's conviction for soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor.Epstein died in New York in 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Lord Mandelson is credited as one of the key architects of the New Labour movement, which came to power with Tony Blair's election victory in 1997.He served in several ministerial posts under Blair and Gordon Brown, as well as being European commissioner for trade from 2004-2008.He was appointed ambassador to the US in December 2024, but was fired in September after the extent of his relationship with Epstein became clear.Earlier this month, two properties linked to Lord Mandelson were searched by police following allegations of misconduct in public office.Lord Mandelson has been contacted for comment but has not responded. The BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.",

    "body": "24 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC News reporterGetty ImagesIt's a heated debate in many households - is there a right way stack to the dishwasher?It turns out some of us may be doing it wrong so here are five rules to ensure gleaming dishes - and an end to the dishwasher debate.1. Don't pre-rinseGetty ImagesIf you're rinsing your plates before putting them in the dishwasher you're doing it wrong, says Andrew Laughlin, principal researcher at consumer group Which?Modern dishwashers use a turbidity sensor to detect how dirty the water, and therefore the dish, is. If you rinse everything beforehand, the machine thinks the items are clean and lowers its temperature and intensity, reducing its efficiency.\"Instead, it's far better to scrape leftovers into your food waste bin and regularly clean the dishwasher filter,\" says Andrew.Lynsey Crombie, author of The 15 Minute Clean, agrees: \"Modern dishwashers are built to detect dirt so if your plates are too clean going in, they can actually wash less effectively,\" she says.\"Remove leftover food into the bin, but don't stand there pre-washing. You're wasting water and time.\"2. Stack correctlyGetty ImagesAndrew's rule for stacking the dishwasher is - if you eat from it, put it in the lower rack, if you drink from it, place it in the upper rack.Positioning dirty surfaces towards the jets is important too. \"Face everything towards the centre of the machine for the best performance,\" he says.Lastly, make sure no items are touching so that the water can flow and wash effectively.Lynsey says you should angle bowls downwards so they don't collect water and mix up your cutlery so spoons don't nest together.But the biggest mistake many of us make is overloading the dishwasher, she says.\"If water can't circulate properly, nothing will come out clean no matter how expensive your tablet is.\"3. Place the dirtiest items in the centreGetty ImagesThere's nothing more frustrating than loading the dishwasher, only to find some things aren't clean when the cycle is finished.Andrew says the \"worst offenders\" include cereal, scrambled eggs, or starchy food with protein-heavy residues. To fix this, he recommends putting the really dirty items in the middle, where the spray intensity is highest.This will make the wash more efficient and save you time and money by avoiding putting the same things back in again for another wash.4. Use tablets and saltGetty ImagesDishwashers need a helping hand to reach their peak performance.Andrew says it's \"absolutely\" vital to use tablets as these help to break down the dirt and the food waste and start the cleaning process. They contain enzymes to break down proteins and starches, and surfactants so water spreads and cleans better.Special dishwasher salt, meanwhile, helps to \"soften the water preventing lime scale build up and those horrid white marks on glasses.\" Lynsey says even if your tablet says \"all-in-one\", she still recommends topping up salt \"because it protects the machine long-term\".\"Think of it as maintenance, not an extra,\" she says.Rinse aid dispensers are also worth considering, explains Andrew. These \"disperse the water on the surface of the dishes, helping them to dry at the end of the cycle and to run efficiently.\"5. Avoid certain itemsGetty ImagesIt's equally important to remember what to keep out of your dishwasher, adds Andrew.Non-stick cookware, sharp knives, and wooden items should stay out.\"High temperatures and water pressure could damage them,\" he says.Lynsey says you should avoid anything with adhesive labels as these can clog the filter.But what about whose turn it is to empty the dishwasher? That's a question no expert can answer.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "12 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorRai TVPaolo PetreccaIt was a moment of national pride for Italians watching the glitzy opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics live on state broadcaster Rai earlier this month.But for Paolo Petrecca, whose gaffe-ridden commentary of the event went viral and became a national embarrassment, it signalled the end of his broadcasting career.Petrecca, the head of Rai Sport, has handed in his resignation after his litany of on-air errors broadcast to an audience of 9.2 million viewers prompted a brief strike by news journalists.His tenure will end at the end of the Games, and he will not be commentating on the closing ceremony.Petrecca had been a last-minute stand-in, because the original commentator was dropped for revealing a \"sensational surprise\" element of the ceremony by mistake.He is considered close to the Brothers of Italy party of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and, while running Rai's news channel, presented her book I Am Giorgia to the public a year before she came to office.His broadcast had barely begun before he made his first mistake, welcoming viewers to the Stadio Olimpico, instead of Milan's fabled San Siro which had been chosen for the curtain-raising ceremony.What happened next was described by one reviewer as one of Rai's bleakest ever live broadcasts, when its flagship Rai 1 channel had an audience share of more than 46%.He introduced singer Mariah Carey, before correcting himself and explaining it was in fact Italian actress Matilda De Angelis. AFP via Getty ImagesMatilda De Angelis wrote \"Please call me Mariah\" after the opening ceremonyHis gaffe went viral, as Italians posted images of De Angelis with the slogan \"here's the amazing Mariah Carey!\" De Angelis herself went on social media to suggest sharing the rights to Carey's song All I Want for Christmas.When the camera fixed on President Sergio Mattarella, Petrecca referred to the president's daughter Laura beside him applauding, when the woman in the frame was in fact the president of the International Olympic Committee Kirsty Coventry.When the Olympic torch was handed to Italy's two highly successful volleyball teams, he failed to recognise men's volleyball captain Simone Giannelli, naming one member of the women's team.And he then resorted to national stereotypes, saying Brazilians had music in their blood, referring to African \"voodoo rites\" and Spaniards who were \"always very hot\", using the Spanish word calienti.Petrecca's disastrous performance was condemned by Rai's journalists' union Usigrai as a \"serious blow\" to the public broadcaster's image and the commentator who had been dropped for the curtain-raiser, Auro Bulbarelli, has since been given back the job for the closing ceremony.His decision to hand in his resignation was not unexpected and he will be replaced by colleague Marco Lollobrigida, considered one of the broadcaster's top sport presenters.But the affair has highlighted what critics argue is the government's attempt to pressurise the broadcaster at the expense of output quality, dubbing Rai TV as TeleMeloni.",

    "body": "1 hour agoThere is one image of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor dominates the today's front pages, marking the moment the former prince was arrested and released on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The Daily Express runs the picture of Mountbatten-Windsor slouched in the back of the car while leaving police custody on Thursday evening. The paper headlines on the King's comment that \"the law must take its course\". Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Guardian also leads with the same picture and the King's comment about his brother. The front page also previews a editorial in the paper reflecting on challenges for the Royal Family going forward, remarking that the \"old model – of discreet exile and silence – seems finished\". \"Downfall\" is the one-worded headline on the front of the Daily Mail, next to a zoomed-in version of the Mountbatten-Windsor photograph. It describes the former prince as looking \"haggard, shamed and haunted\" as he was released from police custody. The Daily Telegraph reports the former prince has become the first senior member of the Royal Family in modern history to have been arrested.  \"The magnitude of his fall from grace seemed etched on his face,\" the paper says. The Times has called the arrest of Andrew the \"biggest crisis for the monarchy since the abdication\".Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor \"has nowhere to hide\", the Daily Mirror reports. A former royal protection chief Dai Davies called the moment \"huge\" and says that the situation \"could affect the whole monarchy\". \"Now he's sweating\" is the headline of the Sun, a reference to the 2019 BBC Newsnight interview in which he claimed to be unable to sweat due to a medical condition. The Metro's headline also focuses on the response of King Charles to his brother's arrest. The King is believed to have had no warning before the arrest, which happened on the former prince's 66th birthday. The i Paper reports that Thames Valley Police \"carried out a morning raid at his temporary farmhouse residence on the Sandringham estate\". The Daily Star also carries the zoomed in image of Mountbatten-Windsor \"looking tired\" leaving the Aylsham police station after \"11 hours in police custody\". And, the one paper not focused on the former prince, Financial Times features the latest developments from the US on Iran. President Donald Trump has set \"a 10-day window to decide on Iran strikes\" or make a deal, the paper reports. It says in recent days the US has bolstered its \"huge military force deployed to the Middle East\". Related Internet Links",

    "body": "11 minutes agoBethany BellBBC Vienna correspondentBergrettung KalsAn Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him \"to be mitigating factors\". It said it also took into account \"the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant\".The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023. She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out. She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.Grossglockner mountain in AustriaAccording to reports in the Austrian media, the court heard how the mountain rescue team found Kerstin's body hanging upside down from a rock face.One of the rescuers told the court she had her rucksack on and her head was tilted back.Her eyes were wide open, she wasn't wearing gloves, and her boots were open, he said.\"We were amazed that she remained in that position.\" If the wind had been any stronger, \"she would have fallen over the south face\".The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was \"the responsible guide for the tour\". They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.His lawyer Kurt Jelinik said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.He said Kerstin was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.www.foto-webcam.euThis still from webcam footage shows the couple still climbing at 21:00 on 18 JanuaryProsecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that the man failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin became exhausted close to the summit.The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police. The content of the conversation is disputed. Rescuers said it wasn't an emergency call but the lawyer says he denies telling police that everything was fine.He scaled the summit and descended on the other side, leaving Kerstin behind. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00 am.Webcam images show his torchlit figure coming down from the summit.The trial sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders, raising questions about when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability.The case is subject to appeal.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonGetty ImagesThe East Wing of the White House was demolished in October 2025 to make way for the ballroomThe US Commission of Fine Arts overwhelmingly approved design plans for President Donald Trump's ballroom project at the White House.The panel made up of Trump appointees signed off on the design after architects made changes in response to commission concerns.\"We have to protect the country and the country's guests, and this is a facility that is definitely needed for over 150 years,\" Chairman Rodney Mims Cook Jr said.The East Wing of the White House was demolished last autumn to make way for the ballroom.The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit, sued to halt ballroom construction, saying plans for the project did not comply with the legally mandated review processes.Trump has argued the White House needs a ballroom because present facilities are inadequate to host important national events and foreign dignitaries.He has said the building will be \"the most beautiful ballroom anywhere in the world\" and will be paid for with money donated from private sources. The ballroom was initially expected to have capacity of 500 people but it has since been expanded to 1350.The ballroom project has faced stiff opposition from historic preservation groups and sections of the public.\"No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever - not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,\" the  National Trust for Historic Preservation said in its federal lawsuit. \"And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.\" The case is still in litigation.The commission's Secretary Thomas Luebke said the panel had received over 2,000 comments from the public and that they were \"overwhelmingly in opposition - over 99% to this project\".Is Trump allowed to demolish part of the White House to build a ballroom?Commission Vice Chairman James McCrery abstained from discussions and the vote at Thursday's meeting. His architecture firm was initially selected by Trump to handle the ballroom, but the administration switched architects on the project to Shalom Baranes.Two new Trump-appointed members of the commission were sworn in at the start of the meeting, including Chamberlain Harris, a White House aide.The ballroom project still needs approval from the 12-member panel of the National Capital Planning Commission, whose next meeting to discuss the ballroom is in early March. Six of its members are Trump-appointees and two others are Republicans from the US Congress.The ballroom is not the only major construction Trump is pursuing in the US capital.  He has also announced plans to build a triumphal arch as part of plans to mark the nation's 250th anniversary.",

    "body": "Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time58 minutes agoAngus CrawfordBBC News InvestigationsGetty ImagesA male lion in Hwange National Park, ZimbabweLion DNA has been used to successfully prosecute poachers for the first time in the world, it has emerged.Wildlife crime experts have only just revealed how they were able to identify the individual animal from body parts found in a suspect's village, as they matched a profile on Zimbabwe's lion database.A blood sample had previously been taken from the male lion, which was being tracked by authorities in Hwange National Park - using a radio collar.Two poachers were convicted for the 2024 incident and sent to prison in what is thought to be the first prosecution of its kind.The details of the convictions and the role the DNA database played have been previously unknown.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Traffic, which works to combat the illegal trade in wildlife, has shared the detail with us.In May 2024, authorities in Hwange National Park became suspicious after a radio collar worn by a male lion stopped working.Investigators and police traced its last known position and found a snare with lion fur attached to it.After collecting forensic evidence they questioned two men in a nearby village and discovered three sacks of meat, 16 lion claws and four teeth. These body parts would later be tested against the database, with the DNA from all matching the profile of that missing lion.TRACE, Simon DuresA lab in Zimbabwe created a DNA database of all lions in the countryBut possessing lion parts is not necessarily a crime in Zimbabwe.Having them can be explained away as old, traditional ornaments or as coming from an animal that died of natural causes.This has been an obstacle to prosecutions in the past.But thanks to a breakthrough in DNA profiling, that's now changed.The lab generated a DNA profile from the recovered body parts and compared this to the profile previously generated from a blood sample of the lion with the radio collar.The two profiles matched and scientists were able to identify the specific missing animal.TRACE, Simon DuresThe scientist was able to match the two DNA profilesOver the last eight years the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust (VFWT) has received about £250,000 from the People's Postcode Lottery in the UK to build up the DNA database of lions in Zimbabwe.The scientist at the trust, who made the discovery, asked to remain anonymous for his own safety, but said:\"Before we had access to this technology, we were only able to do species identification, but sometimes that's not enough.\"We can essentially match those claws or those products to the lion of interest that we are looking for.\"Within 10 days of the killing, the DNA evidence was presented in court.Two men pleaded guilty and were given 24 month prison sentences.The hearing was told the value of the lion was about $20,000.Richard Scobey, Traffic's executive director, said \"countries now have the forensic capability to bring, solid science-based evidence to court\" and that it will have global impact.TRAFFIC, Viv WilliamsLion bones are sold for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Teeth and claws are bought as jewelleryThis is understood to be the first time that DNA from an individual lion has been identified and used to prosecute poachers.Professor Rob Ogden has been closely involved in setting up the project and is co- founder of the organisation Trace, which promotes the use of forensic science in wildlife law enforcement.He says the prosecution gives \"a message of hope\" and shows what can be done using a combination of training, research and development and forensic casework.Recent figures suggest an increase in the number of lions being killed for their body parts which are then sold both as cultural objects in Africa and for traditional Chinese medicine.It is thought the rise may be down to organised crime gangs also involved in the illegal trade in Rhino horn and ivory trafficking.In Mozambique between 2010 and 2023, 426 lions were killed as a result of contact with humans with a quarter linked to deliberate poaching. A measure of the scale of the trade is also the number of seizures by the authorities in recent years.That includes 17 lion skulls found in Lusaka in 2021, reportedly en-route from South Africa, and a 2023 seizure in Maputo of more than 300kg of lion body parts.Which is why this breakthrough on DNA identification is seen as sending an important message to would-be poachers.",

    "body": "I thought being deaf would mean I couldn't be a dating show contestant - now I'm starring in one12 hours agoGeorgia Levy-CollinsandPolly Bayfield,BBC NewsbeatBecky Bailey/LumoTVOliver says he wanted to take part on a reality show but was worried about how he would communicate with othersA contestant on the UK's first British Sign Language (BSL) dating show says he hopes it teaches people about the deaf community - and shows they can \"have banter\" too.Oliver Scott is among the first to take part in the new series, Hold My Hand, which follows deaf or children of deaf adult (CODA) contestants as they navigate dating through BSL.The 27-year-old from Norwich tells BBC Newsbeat, through an interpreter, the show felt \"refreshing\" after always questioning \"why couldn't I be a contestant on something like that\" when watching other dating shows.It is the latest from LumoTV, a deaf-led streaming platform, and is presented by deaf identical twins Hermon and Heroda Berhane.Created with the deaf and signing community, the three-part series aims to highlight deaf culture and identity in a way that isn't widely seen on screen.Oliver grew up in a deaf family where BSL was his first language so he \"didn't feel the need\" to get a hearing aid or a cochlear implant.He says he often thought about what it would be like to be on a TV show, but worried about how it would work. \"We'd say it's impossible because of the communication, everybody talking, the different games are quite fast-paced, the gossip, the drama,\" he explains.\"How would I get to know people? It might be quite difficult.\"However, he says he had a \"fantastic experience\" on Hold My Hand and felt he could \"genuinely get to know a girl better\", while having \"a bit of banter\".Becky Bailey/LumoTVThe three-part series aims to highlight deaf culture and identity in a way that isn't widely seen on screenBack in 2022, model and dancer Tasha Ghouri became the first deaf contestant on ITV dating show Love Island.Oliver says Tasha is a \"brilliant representative\" of somebody that uses a cochlear implant - a small electronic device that helps her to hear - within mainstream media.However, he feels its important to show that deaf people have different communication preferences.\"They might see Tasha and think she speaks very well and think all deaf people are the same, and that's not the case,\" he says.\"I prefer to use British Sign Language. That is my first language. So I think we need more reflection of British Sign Language users in the mainstream.\"Oliver hopes people can learn more about the deaf community by watching Hold My Hand, and also challenge some misconceptions.\"We can be naughty, we can be mischievous, we can be cheeky, we can have fun, we can have great banter too,\" he says.\"It'd be really nice to expose hearing people to that too.\"Across wider media, he feels representation has been improving but he would like to see a deaf BSL user on a \"mainstream reality show\".Becky Bailey/LumoTVOliver feels its important to show that deaf people have different communication preferencesTeri Devine, associate director of inclusion for the charity Royal National Institute for Deaf People, says Hold My Hand is a \"huge milestone\" for representation of the deaf community.\"It really matters. Everybody wants to see somebody that's like themselves,\" says Teri.\"So if you see somebody on television that's a deaf person that's going on a date, you think: 'Oh, actually I can do that'.'\"Teri adds that it can also help people find their \"role models\" which can encourage them to feel like \"they can achieve anything they set their minds to\".The environment in which a date takes place can also make a difference for a deaf person, Teri explains.She says places which are quieter and brighter so the deaf person can see their date's face and read their lips can help make navigating dating easier.There has been increased representation of the deaf community in recent years on television, including actress Rose Ayling-Ellis becoming the first deaf contestant to compete, and win, Strictly Come Dancing in 2021.Ayling-Ellis also made history when she became the first deaf person to host live sports coverage on TV as one of Channel 4's hosts for the 2024 Paris Paralympic Games.- Hold My Hand is available to stream on LumoTV and YouTubeListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "15 hours agoHafsa KhalilListen: Lindsay Foreman spoke to BBC Radio 4's Anna Foster before the sentencingA British woman who was detained by Iran has told the BBC it was hard to remain positive in prison, hours before she and her husband were sentenced to 10 years for espionage.Lindsay and Craig Foreman were arrested while passing through Iran on a round-the-world motorcycle trip in January 2025. In a rare telephone interview from Tehran's notorious Evin prison, Lindsay likened their detainment to \"an endurance test for the mind\" and said being in jail had taken a physical toll on her.While the couple - who deny the accusation against them - has not spoken since the sentencing, her son described the decision as \"gut-wrenching\".Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called it \"completely appalling and totally unjustifiable\".Lindsay, who spoke over a crackly phone line, said she had been trying to exercise within the confines of the cramped Iranian prison, including running \"in circles\" in the small prison yard.\"I've resigned myself to the fact that my physical health might not be what it was when I came in but I can regain it when I leave,\" she said during the interview, which was played on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Lindsay noted it was \"incredibly hard to remain positive\" but was taking things \"one day at a time\".She added: \"I'm surrounded by people who are in worse situations who have to live this their entire life, so in some way I feel lucky that I've had the life I have until this point - and hopefully one day for me it will end.\"The Foremans had been heading for Australia on their trip of a lifetime, crossing into Iran from Armenia on 30 December 2024 and had planned to arrive in Pakistan by 4 January that year.But on 3 January, the couple were detained despite having Iranian visas, a guide and an approved itinerary.Lindsay's son, Joe Bennett, said that no evidence of spying has ever been presented by the Iranian authorities and called on the UK government to \"act decisively and use every available avenue\" to bring them home. Bennett has said the couple's lawyers in Iran made it clear there was no legal basis for a case against them, but that their bail applications had been ignored. At a court hearing in October, they were not allowed to defend themselves.The family say a judge delivered their sentence at the Branch 15 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court.Lindsay said hours before this was handed down that she and her husband had sent a letter to the Iranian authorities to complain about their treatment in what she described as a \"desperate attempt\" to seek justice.\"We have done what we can to be respectful of their system, to be patient with the legal process and believing that our innocence will prevail but it doesn't seem to be the case,\" she said.Lindsay added that they wanted to \"exercise their right to be heard\" and use Iran's legal system to show what it was doing to them was \"unfair and unjust\".She said she told them: \"Even in your own system, your own judicial system, you're in violation of the laws.\"The Foremans are being held in separate wings of Evin prison, which has long drawn criticism for alleged torture and inhumane conditions. It reportedly holds thousands of inmates, including journalists and political prisoners. The Sussex couple, who are both in their 50s, had endured 13 months in \"dire\" conditions, Bennett has previously said - adding that they were surrounded by \"dirt, vermin and violence\".Human rights groups say foreign nationals who are detained in Iran are often held for leverage and released only when the regime gets something in return. The BBC was previously told that the couple may be being used as diplomatic bargaining chips.Bennett said he had repeatedly urged the UK Foreign Office to help the Foremans.He has said that his family felt \"abandoned\" by the government, and that letters he sent to the prime minister and foreign secretary had gone unanswered. Responding to the sentence, Cooper said: \"We will pursue this case relentlessly with the Iranian government until we see Craig and Lindsay Foreman safely returned to the UK and reunited with their family.\"In the meantime, their welfare is our priority and we will continue to provide consular assistance to them and their families.\"The Foreign Office has long advised against all travel to Iran, warning British and British-Iranian dual citizens that having a British passport or any connection to the UK can lead to detention. Lindsay told the BBC on Wednesday that she and Craig had checked the government website before entering Iran, and had sought advice on how to travel through a hard-to-navigate region.\"I put my hand up and take responsibility for being here,\" she said.Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency in recent years, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK.British-Iranian citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released in 2022 and allowed to leave Iran after the UK settled a long-standing £650m debt owed to Tehran.French citizens Cécile Kohler, Jacques Paris and Olivier Grondeau, and German national Nahid Taghavi, were all released from Iranian jails following sustained pressure by their respective governments.

    "body": "3 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentGetty ImagesCould a different style of vaccine mark the end of the winter cold?A single nasal spray vaccine could protect against all coughs, colds and flus, as well as bacterial lung infections, and may even ease allergies, say US researchers.The team at Stanford University have tested their \"universal vaccine\" in animals and still need to do human clinical trials.Their approach marks a \"radical departure\" from the way vaccines have been designed for more than 200 years, they say.Experts in the field said the study was \"really exciting\" despite being at an early stage and could be a \"major step forward\".Current vaccines train the body to fight one single infection. A measles vaccine protects against only measles and a chickenpox vaccine protects against only chickenpox.This is how immunisation has worked since Edward Jenner pioneered vaccines in the late 18th Century.It is given as a nasal spray and leaves white blood cells in our lungs – called macrophages – on \"amber alert\" and ready to jump into action no matter what infection tries to get in.The effect lasted for around three months in animal experiments.The researchers showed this heightened state of readiness led to a 100-to-1,000-fold reduction in viruses getting through the lungs and into the body.And for those that did sneak through, the rest of the immune system was \"poised, ready to fend off these in warp speed time\" said Prof Bali Pulendran, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford.The team showed the vaccine also protects against two species of bacteria -  Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii.Getty ImagesPulendran told the BBC: \"This vaccine, what we term a universal vaccine, elicits a far broader response that is protective against not just the flu virus, not just the Covid virus, not just the common cold virus, but against virtually all viruses, and as many different bacteria as we've tested, and even allergens.\"The principle by which this vaccine works is a radical departure from the principle by which all vaccines have worked so far.\"The way it steers the immune system towards fighting an infection also seemed to reduce the response to house dust mite allergens – which are a trigger of allergic asthma.\"This is a really exciting piece of research,\" says Prof Daniela Ferreira, a professor of vaccinology at University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study.She said it could \"change how we protect people from common coughs, colds and other respiratory infections\" if the results are confirmed in human studies.\"One of the strengths\" of the study was a clear explanation of how this new style of vaccine was working, she added. Ferreira said the research \"could mark a major step forward\" offering protection against infections that \"place such a heavy burden\" on us all.However, there are still many questions to answer.The vaccine was given as a nasal spray in the experiments, but may need to be breathed in through a nebuliser to reach the depths of human lungs.   It is not known whether the same effect can be achieved in people or how long the immune system would stay in amber alert. There are differences in the immune systems between mice and humans, including our immunity being shaped by decades of infections.So the researchers are planning trials where one person is vaccinated and then deliberately infected to see how their body copes.There may also be consequences to dialling up the immune system beyond its normal state – raising questions of immune disorders.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the work was undeniably \"exciting\" but cautioned \"we have to ensure that keeping the body on 'high alert' doesn't lead to friendly fire, where a hyper-ready immune system accidentally triggers unwelcome side effects\".The research team in the US does not think the immune system should be permanently dialled up and think such a vaccine should be used to compliment rather than replace current vaccines.In the first stages of a pandemic, like early 2020 with Covid, a universal vaccine could buy time and save lives while a specialist vaccine was being developed.\"That would reduce mortality, disease severity, and perhaps build up a level of immune resilience that would have a huge impact,\" says Pulendran.The other scenario is at the start of winter when the usual wide range of winter bugs start to spread, \"one could imagine a seasonal spray that could be administered to imprint broad immunity\" against them all.Correction 19 February: This story was updated after an earlier version referred to Edward Jenner using the title Sir, when in fact he was never knighted.",

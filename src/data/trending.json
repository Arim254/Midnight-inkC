    "body": "Andrew Rosindell has resigned from the Conservative Party and defected to Reform UK.The former shadow minister and MP for Romford said the Tories were \"irreparably bound to the mistakes of previous governments\" and not willing to take \"meaningful accountability\" for poor decisions. He said he had spoken to Nigel Farage on Sunday evening before agreeing to join his party. The Reform UK leader called him \"a great patriot\" who \"will be a great addition to our team\".A Conservative source said Rosindell's departure was a prime example of Farage doing Badenoch's \"spring cleaning\" and that Reform was \"welcome\" to him.Rosindell's move comes after Robert Jenrick joined Reform on Thursday, hours after being sacked from the shadow cabinet by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who had accused him of plotting to defect.The 59-year-old, who was shadow minister for foreign affairs before his resignation said, in a statement on X that the \"views and concerns of constituents such as mine in Romford have been consistently ignored for far too long\".\"Our country has endured a generation of managed decline,\" he added. \"Radical action is now required to reverse the damaging decisions of the past and to forge a new course for Britain.\"Rosindell becomes Reform's seventh MP and the third sitting Conservative MP to join the party, following Danny Kruger and Jenrick.This week's defections mean that - putting aside independent MPs, who do not vote in a block - Reform UK now has the joint fifth biggest party grouping in the Commons, alongside Sinn Fein which does not send any of its seven MPs to Westminster. It is two MPs behind the fourth biggest party, the SNP.About 20 former Tory MPs have switched their allegiance to Reform UK, including former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who did so a week ago.Shadow Welsh secretary Mims Davies told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that Conservative MPs defecting to Reform were \"self-serving and completely wrong\".\"I do find this very confusing that these people who are saying they want to put things right, want to be right-wing, but ultimately there's a lot in Reform which is very left-wing and obviously populist,\" she said.\"I really don't think that arguing that Britain is failing helps people. People want to know, yes things are wrong but the people they've elected are willing to roll up their sleeves and get themselves up to what needs to be fixing rather than looking self-serving.\"Rosindell has held the Romford seat since 2001, although his majority was cut from 17,893 to just 1,463 at the last general election.After switching to Reform, he cited the Labour government's decision to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and the \"failure of the Conservative Party both when in government and more recently in opposition to actively hold the government to account on the issue\" as among the reasons for his defection.\"Both the government and the opposition have been complicit in the surrender of this sovereign British territory to a foreign power,\" he said.Farage said: \"The Tories' lies and hypocrisy over the Chagos Islands betrayal has tipped him over the edge, and we are delighted to welcome him to our ranks.\"The move comes hours after the Reform leader insisted his party was \"not a rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP\" and would not become the Conservative Party 2.0.Reform will not accept any more defectors after local elections are held on 7 May, he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.A Conservative source said Rosindell had been \"threatening to defect for months, denying it was happening as recently as Saturday\". They added: \"We're not going to be distracted from holding this disastrous Labour government to account.\"The Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"The stench of a failed and dying Tory Party now engulfs Reform.\"Nigel Farage is now unconditionally trying to rehabilitate their disastrous record,\" she added. \"The public won't be fooled: the Tories failed Britain and Reform want to do it all over again.\"A Liberal Democrat source said the defection was \"a change of rosette for a career politician worried about getting a P45\", adding: \"The public are fed up hearing about how Britain is broken from the very same people who broke it.\"Jenrick told a news conference where he announced his defection to Reform that the Tories \"broke\" the country and had \"betrayed its voters\", with the UK now \"in decline\". He later told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that the country needed a \"new and exciting\" leader \"who hasn't been part of that failed consensus\".Badenoch called it a \"good day\" for the Conservatives and said Jenrick was \"now Nigel Farage's problem\".She wrote in the Telegraph that Reform was destined to fail as it welcomed \"toxic people\" who \"destroy organisations\".\"A movement built on grievance and serial disloyalty is doomed to fail, and they will be at each other's throats soon enough,\" she said.Correction - an earlier, breaking news version of this story incorrectly stated that Rosindell was the seventh Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK. He is actually the third sitting Conservative to switch allegiance, and takes the number of Reform UK MPs to seven.",

    "body": "1 hour agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan CorrespondentandDearbail Jordan,Reporter Watch: Firefighters battle deadly blaze at Karachi shopping centreA massive fire that tore through a shopping centre in Pakistan's largest city has killed eight people, including a firefighter, and rescuers are racing to find dozens more still missing.It took firefighters more than 24 hours to put out the blaze in Gul Plaza that started Saturday night. The building housed 1,200 stores and spanned 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft). Parts of the building have collapsed, with officials saying the debris and lack of ventilation were hampering rescue efforts.\"Almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames\", by the time rescuers arrived at the site on Saturday night, local emergency services said.Fifty-eight people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the fire spread rapidly because of the presence of flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, and perfume in the building.By Sunday evening, various parts of the Gul Plaza were charred and reduced to rubble. Rescuers told Reuters news agency that the whole building could come down.Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said on Sunday that six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured. At least 20 people were injured, according to authorities.She added that the police were \"invoking mass disaster protocols\".ReutersIt took firefighters more than 24 hours to put out the blaze in Gul PlazaZain, a shopkeeper at Gul Plaza, told BBC Urdu that hundreds of people were inside the building when the fire broke out on Saturday.\"My shops were burning before my eyes. We couldn't even get the goods out of those shops. \"There are still many people inside, I have many friends who are out of contact,\" he said.Another onlooker said shopkeepers had tried to use fire extinguishers, but the intense blaze was uncontainable. Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

    "body": "4 hours agoThe fallout from Donald Trump's tariff threat to EU allies that oppose his campaign to annex Greenland dominates Monday's papers. The Guardian says European leaders are considering a plan to levy tariffs €93bn of US goods in response. The paper says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had a call with Trump to tell his economic attack on Nato allies was wrong.The Times focuses on the UK's role in all this and highlights that Sir Keir Starmer will give an \"emergency speech\" later today under the headline 'PM warns of downward spiral in US tariffs row'.The Financial Times follows with details that the possible retaliatory tariffs are being drawn up to give European leaders leverage in crucial meetings with the US president at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.\"Europe delivers a warning to Trump\" echoes the Independent. Elsewhere, the paper  fills its picture slot with a fist-pumping Emma Raducanu after she began her campaign at the Australian Open with a decisive win over Thailand's Mananchaya Sawangkaew. Raducanu is a popular picture choice on many of the front pages and the Daily Express accompanies its image of her celebrating victory with the headline \"Smiling Emma wins after slow start Down Under\". Its lead story, like most others, is about the tariffs and it focuses on Europe's warning that Trump's threat \"will rip Nato apart\". It also quotes Russia's response to the row, hailing it as a \"collapse of the transatlantic union\".\"Nato now 'heading for disaster' in Trump row\" is the Daily Mail's take, as the paper says Western leaders are warning the US president that his threat risked \"a dangerous downward spiral\" in relations.The i Paper calls row the \"biggest crisis\" to hit the Nato alliance in decades and its \"greatest threat\".The Daily Mirror's headline sums up the fallout as \"Trump's Greenland madness\" and spotlights Lib Dems leader Sir Ed Davey urging the King to axe his planned US state visit in April, saying the UK \"must not be a doormat for an extortionist\". In other news, a new survey reveals tea breaks are becoming a thing of the past for millions of workers, with only half leaving their desk to go to the loo and a third rarely leaving their workspace, Metro reports.Need an antidote for Blue Monday, measured as the day with the lowest public mood of the year? Well the Daily Star gives us news that Bez, whom it joyfully describes as a \"dancing maracas star\", will be heading back on the road in March as part of a 35-year anniversary tour with the rock band Happy Mondays. \"Don't worry... Bez happy\" is the headline as the paper pledges to \"cheer you up every day of the week\".Finally, the Sun reports on the news that former Little Mix star Jesy Nelson and her fiancé Zion Foster have split up after four years together.

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Hagan,BBC News,Harry Sekulich,BBC NewsandGuy Hedgecoe,MadridFootage shows emergency workers at scene of derailmentAt least 21 people have been killed after a crash involving high-speed trains in southern Spain, as authorities warn the death toll could rise overnight. More than 30 are being treated for serious injuries in hospital, Spain's transport minister Oscar Puente said. The incident happened near the town of Adamuz, close to the city of Cordoba, when a high-speed train travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed and crossed over onto another track, the rail network operator Adif said.The derailed train then collided with an oncoming train, travelling from Madrid to Huelva. Andalusian emergency services said at least 73 people in total were injured in the collision. The incident appeared to be \"extremely strange\", Puente added, because the train derailed on a straight stretch of track, which had been refurbished in May last year. The official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a \"night of deep pain\". Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Malaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by Renfe – had around 100 passengers.The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident. He described it as like \"a nightmare\".In a post on X, the Emergency Agency of Andalucía urged any crash survivors to post on social media that they are alive. The twisted wreckage of the train made it difficult to recover survivors and bodies, rescue crews said.Cordoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.\"According to Adif, the crash happened about ten minutes after the train left Malaga at 18:40 local time (17:40 GMT). The company said it was setting up spaces for relatives of victims at Atocha, Seville, Cordoba, Malaga and Huelva stations. All rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident and will remain close on Monday. The company said it will keep terminals open overnight for impacted passengers. The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told the Reuters news agency.The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"ReutersThe foyer of the hospital close to the crash site, Caseta Municipal, filled with affected passengersSalvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.In his latest update on X, he said he was among a group of passengers waiting in the \"freezing cold night\" for buses to transport them to a local sports centre.King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster with \"with great concern\".\"We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,\" the royal palace said on X.French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have both offered condolences in statements.\"My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the entire Spanish people. France stands by your side,\" Macron wrote on social media.In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.

    "body": "6 hours agoBecky Morton,political reporter,andDaniel De Simone,investigations correspondent ReutersThe government has abandoned a final debate on its Hillsborough Law following a backlash from campaigners and some Labour MPs over the extent to which it would apply to intelligence officers.The draft legislation creates a legal obligation for public authorities to co-operate with and tell the truth to inquiries.But a government amendment would have made co-operation by intelligence officers with inquiries subject to the approval of the head of their service.Bereaved families say MI5 and MI6 officers should be fully subject to the proposed law and point to a series of cases where MI5 has provided false information.The government had originally pulled just the amendment from a vote, due to be held on Monday, before it scrapped the entire third reading of the bill - when a draft law is tidied up before going to the Lords.A government spokesperson said it would continue to work with all parties to strengthen the bill \"without compromising national security\".Removing the amendment was earlier welcomed by the Hillsborough Law Now campaign group, which said it would \"engage further with government to ensure the bill fully applies to the security services whilst not jeopardising national security\".The proposed law - named after the football stadium in Sheffield where a deadly crush occurred in 1989 - aims to make public authorities and officials more accountable for failings.The government argued that its amendments on the intelligence services sought to balance the law's new duties with protecting national security.Ministers were facing a potential rebellion from Labour MPs, with around 30 backing a proposal by Liverpool Labour MP Ian Byrne that would ensure the legislation applied in a fuller way to intelligence officers.The government could still bring forward revised amendments when it reaches the House of Lords.Byrne - a long-standing campaigner for the law - told the BBC after the amendment was shelved: \"I think there's been an acknowledgement that their amendment was heading for defeat, and thank God they've withdrawn it.\"However, he added: \"I won't vote for any law to leave the Commons until myself and the families are happy with what it contains...\"I have spoken to some families, and they are absolutely firm that it has to be the full Hillsborough Law before it leaves the Commons.\"It is understood that Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee did not support the government's proposed amendment, posing an additional problem for ministers, because their amendment had proposed an oversight role for the ISC.It is also understood that, amid increasing government concern about a rebellion, the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum was personally involved in speaking to some MPs.The draft law, formally known as the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, is designed to stop cover-ups and would place the same \"duty of candour\" on public officials.However, campaigners had argued that giving those leading the intelligence services approval over disclosures would allow them to choose what could be made public, and said they could not support the bill in its current form.Families bereaved by the 2017 Manchester Arena attack had also called for the law to apply fully to the intelligence services.A public inquiry found MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held on the suicide bomber who carried out the attack, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.The Labour mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotherham, had also criticised the government's amendment, saying it created \"too broad an opt-out and risks undermining the spirit of the legislation\".A government spokesperson said: \"This legislation will right the wrongs of the past, changing the balance of power to ensure the state can never hide from the people it should serve, and putting a legal duty on officials to respond openly and honestly when things go wrong.\"The bill will make the police, intelligence agencies and the whole of government more scrutinised than they have ever been, but we can never compromise on national security.\"Earlier, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme she was confident the government would be able to resolve disagreements over the bill before Monday's vote.She insisted security services would not be exempt from the legislation but said ministers faced the challenge of ensuring officers, who often held confidential information, could continue to do their jobs.Nandy added the government wanted to make sure \"we never ever end up in a situation like we did with the Manchester Arena inquiry... where the security services are able to withhold information and present an inaccurate picture to families and to a public inquiry for a very long time\".The Hillsborough Law is the result of campaigning by families affected by the stadium crush, which led to the death of 97 football fans.Police leaders were found to have spread false narratives about the disaster, blaming Liverpool fans, and withheld evidence of their own failings.",

    "body": "The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, Syrian state media says.The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions.Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. It follows a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a \"unified Syria.\"SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said.In a televised address, Abdi confirmed the meeting and said he would share more details about the agreement with Syria's Kurds after returning from the capital. Speaking on Kurdish television channel Ronahi, he said the deal he had agreed to with Damascus included a ceasefire to avoid a broader war, stressing that the fighting had been \"imposed\" on the SDF.Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas.Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families.Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946.Kuridsh media reported that Abdi said the SDF remained committed to protecting what he described as the \"achievements\" and \"specific characteristics\" of the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria.The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State.The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday.Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

    "body": "12 hours agoGuy LambertCulture reporterThe BBC has called on the makers of The Apprentice to carry out stricter background checks on contestants, after one due to appear on the forthcoming series was found to have made offensive posts on social media.The messages from candidate Levi Hodgetts-Hague included discriminatory remarks towards Muslims and sexist comments about women, according to the Sun on Sunday, which first revealed the posts. Naked, the production company behind the award-winning show, said social media checks had \"failed to flag the offensive posts\", and that the process would be reviewed.Hodgetts-Hague has apologised for the posts, which have subsequently been deleted.The messages from Hodgetts-Hague, from South Yorkshire, are said to have included attacks on Islam and used derogatory language to refer to women.In other published posts from 2013 he reportedly expressed support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.BBC News has not seen the posts following the closure of the candidate's social media account.A BBC spokesperson said the views presented in the posts were \"totally unacceptable\" and the organisation was taking this \"extremely seriously\".\"We were completely unaware that this contestant had made such abhorrent comments,\" they said.\"We have asked the independent production company to fully review the social media checks undertaken given the process has clearly failed in this instance.\"The show presented by Lord Sugar is set to launch its 20th series on 29 January in which 20 candidates will compete for the chance to win £250,000 and go into business with the tycoon.Filming concluded in 2025, meaning Hodgetts-Hague will still appear in the programme.In a statement issued to The Sun on Sunday, Hodgetts-Hague said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" by the posts he made more than a decade ago.\"I offer my sincere apologies to all who I've offended, as well as my fellow candidates, for the truly awful language and views that they contain,\" he said.\"I take full accountability for the publishing of those posts. They are not a reflection of the values I uphold today.\"I would like to apologise for my actions, as well as to the production team for failing to bring this account to their attention.\"Production company Naked said it worked with \"reputable third-party providers\" to carry out comprehensive background and social media checks on all candidates.This is part of the company's \"rigorous due diligence\" before casting, a spokesperson said.\"On this occasion, these checks failed to flag the offensive posts, therefore we will be reviewing this process moving forward.\"\"Levi's historical posts contain language which is unacceptable and Levi has been spoken to about this behaviour,\" they added. \"He has apologised and insists that these posts do not reflect the man he is now.\"Earlier this week, a separate former Apprentice contestant, Dr Asif Munaf, was struck off the medical register after a tribunal found he posted antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media.Munaf, a candidate on series 18 in 2024, posted or reposted a total of 36 \"seriously offensive\" comments on X between October 2023 and July 2025.",

    "body": "China says its economy grew by 5% last year, as record exports helped Beijing meet its annual growth target.But the government figures also showed economic growth slowed to a rate of 4.5% in the final three months of 2025 compared to a year earlier.Beijing had set a goal of \"around 5%\" economic growth in 2025, despite struggles to boost domestic spending and a prolonged property crisis and the turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.While China's official figures show it hit its growth goal, some analysts have cast doubt on the accuracy of the data.\"The headline [gross domestic product] print came in at 5% for 2025, matching the government's target, we think growth is weaker than official figures suggest,\" said Zichun Huang, China Economist at Capital Economics.Huang added that her company's own calculations suggest China's official growth figures \"overstate the pace of economic expansion\" by at least 1.5 percentage points.Also on Monday, Chinese data showed the country registered the lowest number of births last year since records began in 1949.The total number of births dropped to 7.9 million in 2025, figures from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed.Officials said the country's population declined for a fourth year in row 2025, falling 3.4 million to 1.4 billion.The figures highlight China's deepening demographic crisis even as the government tries to boost birth rates by offering couples incentives to have more children.China reported the world's largest-ever trade surplus last week - the value of goods and services sold overseas compared to its imports - of $1.19tn (£890bn), driven by a rise in exports to markets outside the US.Speaking on Monday, Kang Yi, head of China's National Bureau of Statistics, said the country's economy \"faces problems and challenges, including strong supply and weak demand\", but added that it will be able to \"maintain stable, sound growth momentum this year.\"China's reliance on exports is likely to be tested in the year ahead, as the Trump administration continues to use tariffs as a key economic policy. The US president recently threatened to impose new levies on countries that trade with Iran or oppose his plan to take control of Greenland.As well as China's exporters moving away from the American market, China's economic resilience was helped by lower-than-expected US tariffs after Beijing and Washington agreed a tariffs pause.While China's manufacturers continued to boost exports, the country is grappling with a number of issues in its domestic economy.Beijing has been struggling with an ongoing property crisis and rising local government debt, which has made businesses more hesitant to invest and consumers cautious about spending.New data on Monday showed that house prices continued to fall in December, as the government struggled to stabilise China's property market. Prices dropped 2.7% last month compared to a year earlier, the sharpest decline in five months. Property investment also fell 17.2% last year.\"China's reported GDP of 5% is not surprising given the political incentives to ensure headline stability, but this clearly masks the horrible investment data,\" said Louise Loo, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.Retail sales grew just 0.9% in December, the slowest rate in three years, although the country's factory output rose 5.2% in December from a year earlier, beating the 4.8% growth in November.Chinese leaders have pledged \"proactive\" fiscal policies this year as they look to increase domestic spending and shift reliance away from exports and investments.",

    "body": "More than 60 Labour MPs have called on the prime minister to impose a ban on under-16s access to social media platforms.In a open letter to Sir Keir Starmer on Sunday, the 61 MPs said \"successive governments\" had done \"too little to protect young people from... unregulated, addictive social media platforms\". They urged him to follow the example of Australia, which brought in a ban in December. Several other countries are said to be considering similar laws.Sir Keir has not ruled out introducing a ban, saying \"all options are on the table\". The House of Lords is due to vote next week on a Lib Dem proposal that would see social media platforms restricted based on film-style age ratings.The letter, which includes the signatures of a number of committee chairs and former frontbenchers, said many constituents had contacted the MPs to express concerns about the effects of social media on young people.It read: \"Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experience that will prepare them for adulthood.\"The MPs said that \"around the world, government are recognising the severity of the crisis and taking action\", noting Australia's ban and that \"Denmark, France, Norway, New Zealand and Greece are expected to follow suit.The UK \"risks being left behind\" on the issue, they wrote.The letter, thought to be organised by Plymouth Moor View MP Fred Thomas, was signed by education select committee chair Helen Hayes, former whip Vicky Foxcroft, former education minister Catherine McKinnell, and former shadow cabinet minister Richard Burgon, among others.It is the latest example of political pressure on the government to propose a social media ban.Last week, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she would introduce an under-16s ban if her party won the next election.Meanwhile, the Lib Dems' proposal soon to be considered in the Lords would see social media platforms graded with age ratings in the same way films are.Under the plan, platforms using addictive algorithmic feeds or hosting \"inappropriate content\" would be restricted to users aged over 16, while sites with \"graphic violence or pornography\" would become adult-only.Several children's charities and online safety organisations have voiced opposition to a blanket social media ban for under-16s.The NSPCC, Childnet, and suicide prevention charity the Molly Rose Foundation were among 42 individuals and bodies to argue a ban would be the \"wrong solution\" on Saturday.\"It would create a false sense of safety that would see children - but also the threats to them - migrate to other areas online,\" they wrote in a joint statement.\"Though well-intentioned, blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children's safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need.\"Existing law should be \"robustly enforced\" to ensure social media sites, personalised games and AI chatbots were not accessible to under-13s, they urged, while all social media platforms should have evidence-based blocks for features that are considered risky for children of different ages.Ian Russell, the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing suicide and self-harm content online, said the government should enforce existing laws rather than \"implementing sledgehammer techniques\".The online safety campaigner - who established the Molly Rose Foundation in his daughter's honour - told the BBC's Newscast that a ban could have \"unintended consequences\" and \"cause more problems\".If you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.",

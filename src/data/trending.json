    "body": "2 hours agoGetty ImagesGopichand Hinduja and his family have a net worth of £35.3bnThe head of Britain's richest family, Gopichand Hinduja, has died aged 85.Known as GP, Mr Hinduja and his family made their fortune from the Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group, which operates in 11 sectors including finance, media and entertainment, and oil.It has about 200,000 staff around the world.The family said in a statement: \"He will leave a deep hole at the heart of our family.\"They added that he would be \"remembered for his formidable work\".Mr Hinduja helped transform his father's modest textile and trading businesses into a global conglomerate and one of India's largest companies.Mr Hinduja and his family topped the most recent Sunday Times Rich List with a net worth of £35.3bn. They also ranked 11th on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest businesspeople in 2024.Mr Hinduja was the second eldest of four brothers who controlled the business for decades.The oldest of the four, Srichand, died in 2023 at 87.It is not known who will now take over the leadership of the conglomerate. The youngest brother, Ashok, runs its operations across India including truck maker Ashok Leyland.The family also own significant real estate in London, including a number of large homes near to St James's Park and Winston Churchill's Old War Office in Whitehall, which has recently been refurbished to include a hotel.Mr Hinduja largely kept out of the public eye but was involved in the controversial \"Hinduja affair\" in 2001, which resulted in Lord Peter Mandelson resigning as an MP.Mr Hinduja had written to Mr Mandelson about his brother Prakash obtaining British citizenship, after the family's charity had donated £1m to the Millennium Dome, for which Mr Mandelson was responsible.Mr Mandelson resigned as a result, but was later cleared of wrongdoing after an inquiry. Prakash, his wife, their son and his wife were jailed by a Swiss court last year for exploiting domestic staff in their Geneva mansion.",

We will continue to support them and wish him a full and speedy recovery.\"It is thought Mr Zitouni \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a girl, leaving him with a gash on his head and neck.What do we know about the Cambridgeshire train stabbings?The 20 terrifying minutes endured by train attack passengersIn a statement, his family said they were \" immensely proud of Sam and his courage\".\"The police called him a hero on Saturday evening, but to us he's always been a hero,\" they said.\"We have been deeply touched by the outpouring of love and kindness shown to Sam, and by the many well-wishes for his recovery. \"The care provided by the hospital and the support from his colleagues at LNER has been incredible.\"PA MediaForensics officers remained at the scene on Sunday as investigations continuedOn Monday morning, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Breakfast the bravery he showed was \"utterly remarkable\" after putting himself \"in harm's way\".\"There are people who are alive today who wouldn't be… were it not for his actions.\"Peter McDonald, the Liberal Democrat chairman of Cambridgeshire County Council, also paid tribute to the \"extraordinary bravery\" shown by Mr Zitouni.He said: \"In a moment of great danger, Sam put the safety of others before his own. Thanks to his courage and presence of mind, lives were saved.\"He further praised the efforts of all the emergency service staff involved and those employed by the train operator and Network Rail.Ten people on board the LNER train, which stopped at Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, were taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital.An eleventh person went to the hospital later.Seven of those have been discharged and four remain in a stable condition, British Transport Police said.The attack took place on the 18:25 GMT LNER service from Doncaster, South Yorkshire to London's King's Cross station.Passengers said one person brandishing a knife began stabbing people on the train after it passed through Peterborough.A man was filmed on CCTV in a barbers' shop in Peterborough on FridayCambridgeshire Police had earlier said it was investigating whether the man accused of carrying out the attack was linked to an incident involving a 14-year-old boy in Peterborough and to two reports of a knifeman at a barbers' shop in the city.On Friday the teenager was stabbed and a man was reported to be at the shop carrying a knife. The shop made a second report the next day.British Transport Police (BTP), which is leading the investigation, has now said that \"detectives from BTP are linking all these incidents, and active inquiries are being made\".Cambridgeshire Police is carrying out an internal review of events that occurred prior to the mass stabbing attacks on the train.Chief Constable Simon Megicks said he had commissioned an internal review of events on Monday, but had since received a \"formal request from police and crime commissioner Darryl Preston for this review\".More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterPost Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates has agreed a multi-million-pound compensation figure from the Post Office, sources close to the deal have confirmed to the BBC.The payout for Sir Alan comes more than 20 years after he started campaigning for justice for victims of the Horizon scandal which led a group of 555 sub-postmasters launching landmark legal action against the Post Office.The exact sum paid to Sir Alan has not been made public and he has not responded to requests for comment.Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT system indicated shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts.Hundreds more poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution.Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to serious health conditions, addiction and even premature death.A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We pay tribute to Sir Alan Bates for his long record of campaigning on behalf of victims.\"We can confirm that Sir Alan's claim has reached the end of the scheme process and been settled.\"As of September 2025, a total of £1.23bn had been awarded to more than 9,100 sub-postmasters.Sir Alan first received an offer of redress in January 2024, which he rejected, describing it as \"cruel and derisory\".He was made another offer in May 2024 which he said was around a third of what he had requested. In May of this year, he said that he'd received a third offer for less than 50% of his original claim.Sir Alan was part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, under which claimants can either receive £75,000 or seek their own settlement.Former sub-postmaster Tim Brentnall from Pembrokeshire had his conviction overturned after he was prosecuted for false accounting.Brentnall told BBC Radio Wales Drive that Sir Alan's \"tenacity and dogged spirit\" kept him and other sub-postmasters going over the past 20 years. \"We all owe him a great debt.\"As part of plan to claim his own settlement, Sir Alan told the BBC his lawyers had included compensation owed for his 20 years of campaigning for justice for those sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal.The Post Office/Horizon scandal reached new heights in the public consciousness last year after Sir Alan's campaign for justice was portrayed in the ITV drama series Mr Bates vs the Post Office.The government adopted all but one of the recommendations of a report published following an inquiry into the scandal.The inquiry detailed the full human impact of the scandal for the first time: the report said that more than 13 people may have taken their own lives as a result of what happened to them.Earlier this year, Sir Alan accused the government of putting forward a \"take it or leave it\" offer of compensation amounting to less than half of his claim.Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal help.Last month, the government announced that all victims who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers.There are three different compensation schemes, which are aimed at different groups of victims.Individual eligibility for compensation depends on the particular circumstances of each case.However, the schemes have been criticised for being too slow and complicated, with many of the worst-affected victims receiving far less than their original claims.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBen ChuBBC VerifyGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves is contemplating tax rises in her Budget on 26 November.And she has said one of the key reasons is that the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), is going to lower its UK productivity growth forecast for the coming years.So why would lower UK productivity forecasts lead to tax rises?And is this something the government could have anticipated before it pledged not to raise taxes on working people in its 2024 election manifesto?BBC Verify has been looking into the statistics.What is productivity?Productivity is the amount of goods and services the entire UK economy produces for each hour of work done by everyone in the working population, also known as \"output per hour\".It gives an indication of how efficiently a country's economy is using its workforce and equipment to produce these goods and services - and so how productive a country is.A country with higher levels of productivity often has higher average wages and incomes.In the Spring Statement in March 2025 the OBR projected total UK productivity would grow by around 1% each year over the next five years.If productivity grows more slowly it means overall GDP growth - and overall tax revenues - will be lower than previously expected.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has estimated each 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the official productivity growth forecast increases projected government borrowing by £7bn in 2029–30.That is the year when the government's chosen borrowing rules require it to balance day-to-day spending with tax revenues, essentially so it's not borrowing for anything except investment.So if the OBR downgraded its forecast for average UK productivity growth over the next five years from 1% to 0.8% (-0.2 percentage points) that revision would increase projected borrowing in 2029-30 by £14bn.In March, the chancellor gave herself \"headroom\" against meeting her borrowing rules in 2029-30 of only £9.9bn. In other words, this was the leeway between meeting and not meeting her rules.That means an OBR productivity forecast downgrade of 0.2 percentage points (£14bn) would, on its own, wipe away this headroom, pushing the government into a projected deficit in that year.And if the chancellor wanted to restore that headroom against her rules she would need to either cut government spending or raise taxes by an equivalent amount.Given the spending budgets of departments were fixed in the June Spending Review, the chancellor is expected to try to restore her headroom against her fiscal rules by raising taxes.What's been happening to UK productivity over a longer period?The UK's productivity growth has been unusually weak since the financial crisis.Between 1971 and 2009, UK output per hour grew by 2% a year on average.But since 2010 it has grown by an average of just 0.4% a year.This productivity growth slowdown is not unique to the UK. It has been a feature of most advanced countries since 2010.However, the UK's slowdown has been relatively large.In the period 2010 to 2023, the UK's average annual growth rate fell by an average of 1.9 percentage points relative to the growth rate in the period 1971 to 2009.This was worse than the rest of the G7 group of industrialised nations, apart from Germany and Japan.Why has UK productivity growth been so weak?For many years after 2010, economists treated the UK's productivity slowdown as a puzzle, because there was no consensus on the cause.Some pointed to the lasting and outsize impact of the financial crisis on the UK, given our economy's reliance on financial services through the City of London.Others suggested the austerity era spending cuts and tax rises of the last Conservative-led government had contributed to it by reducing overall economic activity at a time when the UK had the potential to grow more quickly without generating inflation.More recently, Brexit has been cited as a contributor - both due to the reduction in trade relative to the UK staying in the EU's single market and customs union since 2020 and also the damage to business investment from the long period of uncertainty about the UK's future status in the years after the 2016 referendum.There is still no consensus on the reasons for the productivity slowdown, though many economists think historically low levels of investment in the UK economy - both from the private sector and government - are likely to be an important part of the story.Should this latest productivity downgrade come as a surprise?Not really, because in its most recent forecast the OBR was notably more optimistic about UK productivity growth than other UK forecasters, including the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).In March, the OBR was projecting medium-term potential supply growth for the UK (a wider measure of productivity, which includes increases in the available workforce) of 1.79%, versus the Bank of England's 1.5% and the IMF's 1.36%.And the OBR has been persistently optimistic about UK productivity growth since 2010.Given that, it is not surprising that the OBR has downgraded its forecasts to be more in line with other forecasters.Public finance experts note that if Rachel Reeves had given herself more headroom against her fiscal rules in March 2025 then she might not have needed to respond to this downgrade by raising taxes.Many public finance experts cautioned after her last Budget in October 2024 that if productivity growth disappointed, her plans and pledges not to raise taxes again looked vulnerable.",

    "body": "9 hours agoDharshini DavidDeputy economics editorGetty ImagesThe chancellor's pitch: the Budget will be painful, due to the actions of others, but it will be worth it, to tackle debt, help public services and promote growth.How does that add up?Rachel Reeves pinned the need for expected tax rises on the actions of previous governments – post-Brexit trading arrangements, austerity –  as the underlying reasons for a disappointing assessment by the official forecasters of the economy's productivity. That productivity has been held back by years of poor investment, and improvements have been slow. Lower productivity means weaker growth in the economy, hitting tax income and affecting assumptions about how much money the chancellor has to find  to meet her financial rules.Reeves also pointed to other external forces - tariffs and supply chain disruption – for the underwhelming performance of growth and inflation.But some of these were foreseeable. Even if the official assessment is worse than thought, productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - has long been problematic. And when it comes to external factors, President Trump's trade hostilities, for example, are expected to have a very limited impact on growth.Economists say the chancellor may need tax rises totalling some £30bn to meet her financial rules by a comfortable margin. Reeves accused past Conservative governments of prioritising political convenience, but her fiscal position also reflects similar actions by her own government.  The public purse is having to find several billions of pounds to fund U-turns over welfare and Winter Fuel Payments.Analysts, including those at the Bank of England, also point to the chancellor's own tax rises in last year's Budget as hindering growth and employment, and adding to inflation pressures this year.It was always risky for Reeves to suggest she wouldn't be back for another hefty tax raid. She met her financial rules by only a slim margin last year. The gamble didn't pay off, but it can't just be blamed on ill winds from elsewhere.It now appears that taxes are going to rise – and significantly. The chancellor argues money is needed to support the extra funding that has been put into public services, but the performance of these services depends on more than just cash. Official figures indicate that in the year after Labour came to power, the public sector, and in particular healthcare, became less efficient as productivity dropped. There's more work to be done if we're to get bang for our buck.More on this storyFor the actual detail on which taxes will rise, we'll have to wait until the Budget.But by skirting around the issue of whether manifesto pledges will be adhered to, while claiming to have inherited a dire environment, the chancellor has stoked speculation that income tax rates may rise. The pledges of not increasing the main rates of VAT, employee National Insurance Contributions and income tax always seemed risky to economists – the \"big three\" account for the majority of tax take. But they are also the most visible taxes for the public, and their inclusion in the manifesto made them appear taboo, glass only to be broken in cases of emergency.A rise in, say, income tax rates may come to pass (perhaps accompanied with a cut in National Insurance to offset the impact on workers). But it may not.The Budget is still being put together. The door to breaking manifesto pledges may have been deliberately nudged open so that if it doesn't come to pass, then an  alternate package of tax rises, however large, would be greeted with relief.There are a multitude of other options to consider– a levy on banks or the gambling industry, a further freezing of the thresholds at which different rates of taxes on incomes become applicable (so-called fiscal drag), a change in the liability of partnerships for National Insurance and even the tax treatment of pension levies have all been mooted.And those tax rises will still be substantial, and felt primarily in the pockets of the better off. Finding tax rises of the tune of £20-£30bn - sucking that amount out of the economy - is impossible without affecting incomes or profits, which risks damaging the outlook for growth.However big the tax bill, this Budget may not deliver everything the chancellor wishes for.",

Mrs Sears said: \"We are just everyday people that would help anyone, you can't see someone suffering, someone being frightened, you just help them.\" They provided a place of safety until the passengers' relatives arrived to collect them.PA MediaThe couple said passengers explained they were told to run \"as fast as they could\" following the attack on SaturdayOn Saturday evening, the couple said they could hear the doorbell of their flat ringing and Mrs Sears urged her husband to see who was waiting outside. She said: \"Les opened the door and let them in.\"There was six people - a man and his two children and two young girls and a girl on her own - and they were told something had happened on a train and just to run as fast as they could and get as far away as they could.\"The couple invited the passengers into their Huntingdon home and offered them something to eat and drink.Mrs Sears said: \"One of the girls had blood on her and she was a bit distressed.\"The dad was very anxious, obviously, he wanted to make sure his children were alright. All he wanted to do was give them a hug.\"ReutersEmergency services and the driver of the train have been praised for their heroic effortsThe couple, however, were unable to see who was outside in the dark and initially thought it might be a prank. Once he opened the door, Mr Sears said one of the women was unaware she had blood on her clothes and he cleaned it off for her. He said another of the women was \"so distraught\" and did not want to be left alone. Mrs Sears said: \"You just don't think, you do it without thinking.\"We were just there at the right time they came here and we had to help them... we didn't do nothing.\" More on this story",

    "body": "Israel has received via the Red Cross in Gaza a coffin which the Palestinian armed group Hamas says contains the body of a deceased hostage, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.Israeli forces will now transfer the remains to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.Israel had allowed members of the group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since a US-brokered ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October.Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 270 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 18 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas before Tuesday, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Six of the eight dead hostages still in Gaza before Tuesday were Israelis, one was Tanzanian, and one was Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Earlier on Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.The Israeli military said its troops killed a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoDavid Robinson / GeographThose involved in the tribunal all work at Darlington Memorial Hospital A transgender hospital worker felt a right to use a female-only facility at work as she had done for years without issues being raised, an employment tribunal heard.Eight nurses are challenging County Durham and Darlington NHS Trust's policy of allowing a female-only changing room to be used by Rose Henderson, a biological male who identifies as a woman.Rose, an operating department practitioner at Darlington Memorial Hospital who has been referred to by first name at the tribunal and uses female pronouns, also denied claims of giving \"evil looks\" at nurses who had signed a letter of objection to her use of and alleged conduct within the changing room.The tribunal continues.The hearing in Newcastle heard Rose had completed placements at the hospital since 2019 as part of studies at Teesside University, before beginning full time work there in 2022.Since the first day, Rose had changed in the female-only room, used by about 300 women, the tribunal heard.PA MediaEight nurses have taken legal action over a hospital trust's changing room policyNiazi Fetto KC, barrister for the nurses, asked if Rose had ever considered, as other transgender colleagues had done in the past, asking for a separate place to get changed.\"No, I didn't see it as necessary,\" Rose replied, adding the use of the women's changing room was \"never really brought up\" by managers.Mr Fetto asked if Rose had ever considered if using the changing room could pose a \"risk\" that other users might be upset, embarrassed or frightened by Rose's presence there.\"It never occurred to me it could be a risk, no,\" Rose said.The tribunal has heard complaints were first made by female nurses on the day surgery unit (DSU) in August or September 2023, with 26 women going on to sign a letter complaining about Rose's use of and conduct within the changing room in March 2024.Mr Fetto asked if Rose had continued using the changing room even after being aware of the \"discontent\", which Rose agreed with.\"To your mind you had a right to use the changing room?\" Mr Fetto asked.Rose replied: \"Yes.\"Mr Fetto asked if Rose had thought about the \"perspective\" of those complaining, to which Rose replied it was a source of \"wonder\" why there was \"suddenly an issue\" given she had been using the room for several years already.\"I considered their reasoning, but not to any great extent,\" Rose told the tribunal.'Above bigotry'Rose only became aware of the full details of the complaint when they were printed and broadcast in the media, the tribunal heard.Mr Fetto asked if, after that, Rose had made a point of going to the DSU in \"defiance\" of the women and to appear \"above bigotry and hatred\" as Rose had written in a statement to the tribunal.Rose said there were a \"good number of reasons\" professionally to go to the unit.Several nurses alleged Rose gave them \"evil looks\" or \"hard stares\", which Rose denied, telling the tribunal she did not know who the nurses were.\"I'm not in the business of levelling evil looks at anyone or hard staring,\" Rose said, adding people could think whatever they wanted about her but that did not influence her view of colleagues \"as professionals\".One of the lead nurses, Bethany Hutchison, said Rose had smirked at her as they passed in a corridor, which she took to be an attempt at intimidation.Mr Fetto asked Rose if she had \"displayed amusement\" towards nurse Bethany Hutchison.Rose said she was talking to another colleague at the time about something they found funny, \"but it wasn't [Ms Hutchison's] presence which I found amusing\".  Christian ConcernA poster was put up after nurses complained about a trans colleague using a female-only changing roomThe tribunal has heard a poster declaring the changing room to be \"inclusive\" was put up by some of Rose's colleagues after the row erupted.Rose saw a post about it circulating on social media and immediately contacted managers to ask for the sign to be taken down, saying it was done with good intentions but was doing more harm than good.Mr Fetto asked if Rose knew who put the poster up.Rose did not know exactly but assumed it to have been done by supportive theatre colleagues, a \"small subset\" of whom had been frustrated at not being able to do anything to help.The tribunal has heard allegations from the nurses about Rose's conduct in the changing room, with some claiming Rose would walk around in boxer shorts and stare at women getting changed.Rose said the allegations were \"false\".One of the nurses, Karen Danson, had told the tribunal Rose had once asked her three times if she was going to get changed, which had triggered flashbacks to sexual abuse Ms Danson suffered as a child.Rose did not know who Ms Danson was and could not recall such an incident, the tribunal heard.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he has visited troops near the town of Pokrovsk, where the fiercest front line battle between Russia and Ukraine is currently taking place.Zelensky posted photos showing him meeting personnel at a command post in the Dobropillya sector, some 20km (12 miles) north of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.Kyiv's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskiy, said on Monday that Ukraine was increasing pressure on the Dobropillya front to \"force the enemy to disperse its forces and make it impossible to concentrate their main efforts in the Pokrovsk area\".Russia has been trying to seize Pokrovsk - a strategic frontline town and logistic hub - for over a year.Although it has taken them months to approach the town's borders, Russian soldiers have now infiltrated it and on Friday, Zelensky said Russia had amassed 170,000 troops on its outskirts.Both Ukraine and Russia continue to issue claims and counter claims on the situation in and around Pokrovsk.    Capturing Pokrovsk could give Moscow access to the rest of Donetsk, including the towns Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - the so-called \"fortress belt\". Gen Syrskiy, acknowledged his troops were withstanding the \"pressure of a multi-thousand enemy grouping\" but denied they were encircled. Meanwhile, Russian military bloggers claimed 90% of Pokrovsk was under Moscow's control. Unverified videos posted on social media show instances of close quarter combat, drone attacks and street battles there. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Russian forces were operating with \"increasing comfort\" within the town, which once had a population of 60,000 but has now been almost entirely emptied of civilians and largely destroyed.Further east, Moscow's troops are also reportedly targeting the town of Myrnohrad, which would put Ukrainian soldiers at risk of encirclement. Intense drone activity has cut off many logistics routes, making evacuations and the supply of ammunition and vehicles near impossible.On Monday, Zelensky said Russia had had \"no success\" in Pokrovsk in recent days but acknowledged that \"things were not easy\" for Ukrainian forces in the area. He added that a third of all front line clashes were happening in Pokrovsk, and a half of all glide bombs used by the Russians were launched at the town. Earlier last week the Ukrainian president said that Moscow's troops in the area were outnumbering Kyiv's eight to one.Some Ukrainian commentators have criticised the government's efforts to continue to defend Pokrovsk, arguing that troops were being put at risk.In a post accompanying the pictures of his visit to Dobropillya, Zelensky on Tuesday wrote: \"This is our country, this is our East, and we will certainly do our utmost to keep it Ukrainian.\"Russia now controls 81% of the Donetsk region and 99% of neighbouring Luhansk, which collectively make up the Donbas.Moscow has never relented in its ambition to capture the entirety of the area, which Russia's President Vladimir Putin declared annexed in 2022 despite not being in full control of it.However, its progress along the front line has been grinding and occupying the heavily fortified towns in northern Donetsk could come at a huge cost of both manpower and resources.Away from the front line, Russia continues to pummel Ukrainian cities, targeting the country's energy facilities as winter draws in.A large-scale drone attack overnight Monday targeted the southern port of Odesa on the Black Sea, damaging industrial facilities, causing fires and affecting the local power supply. At least 15 civilians were killed and 44 injured in combined drone and missile attacks across the country at the weekend. Ukraine continues to hit back, mostly using drones to target industrial sites across Russia and border regions. On Tuesday, Kyiv said it had attacked a petrochemical plant in the Bashkortostan region and a refinery in the Nizhny Novgorod region, while earlier this week, a drone explosion killed a woman and injured three others in the Russian border region of Belgorod.",

    "body": "US fugitive Nicholas Rossi to serve at least 10 years in jail2 hours agoThe story of Nicholas Rossi, the US fugitive who ‘faked his own death’ (Video: Morgan Spence, Graham Fraser and David MacNicol)A US fugitive who faked his own death then adopted a false identity in an attempt to avoid being extradited from Scotland has been jailed for a second time for rape.Nicholas Rossi, 38, was found guilty of raping two women in Utah in 2008 after two separate trials earlier this year.He has now been told he must serve at least 10 years in jail after the judge in the second case imposed an additional sentence of between five years and life in prison.Rossi's attempts to evade justice after being arrested in the Covid ward of a Glasgow hospital in 2021 led to a worldwide fascination with his case.Staff had recognised his mugshot and distinctive tattoos from an Interpol wanted notice - but he claimed to be an Irish-born orphan called Arthur Knight, who had never been to America.Utah Department of CorrectionsRossi was jailed in Utah after being found guilty of rapeHe gave an interview to the BBC, where he maintained his story - but could not produce a birth certificate or a passport.Rossi continued to insist at a series of court hearings - which he usually attended in an electric wheelchair, wearing an oxygen mask, hat and three-piece suit - that he was the victim of mistaken identity.He was finally extradited to the US in January 2024, more than a year after a Scottish court had ruled that he was indeed Nicholas Rossi.He was convicted in separate trials in August and September this year of raping two women in Utah in 2008.The state has indeterminate sentencing, which is given in a range of years rather than a fixed number.PA MediaRossi was arrested in Glasgow in 2021 after being identified by hospital staffIn the first case, in Salt Lake City, the judge said that term should range from five years to life in prison.In the second case, in Utah County, the judge also sentenced Rossi to between five years and life - and ruled that the jail term should begin at the end of the first sentence.It will ultimately be up to the state's board of pardons and parole to determine how long he will spend in prison.The court in Utah County heard impact statements from Rossi's two victims, who spoke emotionally about how his crimes had devastated their lives.The women described the ongoing impact of their trauma and said Rossi was \"a danger to society\".Rossi also addressed the judge, claiming both women were lying and saying he would lodge an appeal.His defence asked for the sentence in the second case to run at the same time as the first jail term.But Stephen Jones, deputy Utah County attorney, argued that it should run after the sentence imposed in Salt Lake City.He highlighted that Rossi had made 4,498 calls to his wife from prison in Utah - 344 of them using other prisoners' accounts.He said this was a violation of prison policy and an example of Rossi's manipulation.Mr Jones said Rossi had been able to \"talk his way out of almost anything\" for 18 years – until he was finally \"held accountable\" in Salt Lake.Judge Derek Pullan said Rossi was a serial sex offender and a danger to others.PA MediaRossi attended a series of court hearings in Scotland during the extradition processBorn Nicholas Alahverdian in Rhode Island in 1987, Rossi spent time in care as a teenager and went on to become a child welfare campaigner.Reports of his death emerged in 2020, but the authorities suspected Rossi had fled to the UK after discovering that the FBI were investigating an alleged credit card fraud.His online footprint ultimately led police to the hospital in Glasgow, where he was identified by staff.Rossi insisted that he had been given his distinctive tattoos while he was lying unconscious in the hospital in an attempt to frame him.He sacked several lawyers before a sheriff eventually ruled in 2023 that he was Nicholas Rossi, and that his mistaken identity claim was \"implausible\" and fanciful\".He was flown back to America in January 2024 after failing to overturn the decision. Several months later, he admitted his real identity during a bail hearing in Salt Lake City.",

    "body": "Polls open in US elections - here are five things to watch4 hours agoKayla EpsteinWatch: Mamdani, Cuomo or Sliwa? New Yorkers on their choice for mayorIt's election day in the US.Voters are queuing up in New York to choose a new mayor, while Virginia and New Jersey will decide a pair of high-profile governor races. California voters will weigh in on whether to redraw their state's US House district maps.This so-called \"off year\" election doesn't feature presidential or congressional races, but there are still several critical votes to watch tonight.In New York City's mayoral battle, a younger, progressive Democrat is pitted against a member of the party's old guard. In the states of Virginia and New Jersey the outcome of the gubernatorial contests could be bellwethers for next year's congressional midterm elections. Californians are voting for a rare mid-decade redistricting, as Democrats try to counter Republicans' efforts to give their party an advantage in next year's midterm elections.Here are five things to watch.1. New York City mayoral raceEPA/ShutterstockAll eyes will be on the Big Apple as Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman, attempts a political upset in his bid to become New York City's youngest mayor in over a century.Mamdani, a democratic socialist, shocked the political establishment when he bested former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary this summer. Cuomo, undeterred, has continued to campaign as an independent. Meanwhile, Republican Curtis Sliwa has resisted pressure to drop out of the race to clear a path for Cuomo.New Yorkers could pick a political newcomer to run their city - and take on TrumpTrump backs Cuomo for New York City mayor and threatens to cut funding if Mamdani winsWho is Zohran Mamdani?If Mamdani wins, he will become the city's first Muslim mayor. Democrats around the country will be watching to see if his laser-focus on cost-of-living issues like rent, groceries and wages could serve as effective messaging in future races. Though Mamdani heads into election night with a suggested polling lead, the gap between him and Cuomo has narrowed. In the final stretch of the campaign, Cuomo has hammered Mamdani on crime and public safety, and said the young politician lacks the experience to lead America's biggest city.2. California redistrictingCalifornia's Democratic leadership is asking voters for permission to redraw the state's congressional districts in the middle of the decade. That's unusual in California, which by law relies on a nonpartisan committee to draw its congressional maps once every decade, based on census data.However, as Republican-led states like Texas and Missouri seek to hastily redraw their congressional maps to give their party an advantage in the 2026 midterm elections, California Governor Gavin Newsom wants to counter the losses with redistricting in his own state.California's Proposition 50 would allow the temporary use of new congressional district maps through 2030. The campaign has drawn $158 million in donations, according to the Los Angeles Times, with Democratic proponents vastly outraising the Republican opposition effort.Republicans in California, who hold only nine of the state's 52 US House seats, staunchly oppose the plan.A University of California Berkeley/IGS poll suggests 60% of likely California voters support Proposition 50, while 38% oppose it. The breakdown was highly partisan, with 93% of Democrats saying they would choose \"yes\" and 91% of Republicans choosing \"no\".3. New Jersey governor's raceNew Jersey is considered a Democratic state, but polls indicate a close race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.  It's one of the two governor's races this year that could indicate how Americans feel about the current political climate.Sherrill currently represents New Jersey's 11th District in Congress, and Ciattarelli is a former state assemblyman.Despite leaning blue, the state has had Republican governors in the past. The last one, Chris Christie, served two terms between 2010 and 2018.Rhetoric in the race has been heated. Ciattarelli and his supporters have run political advertisements featuring clips of Sherrill giving halting answers in interviews about her policies.It also has drawn the attention of nationally known names from both parties. Democratic stars like former president Barack Obama and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg have campaigned with Sherrill. President Donald Trump attended a virtual rally for Ciattarelli, and conservative activist Jack Posobiec has backed him.4. Virginia governor's raceVirginia's leadership usually swings between Democrats and Republicans, meaning the outcome of this year's gubernatorial election might serve as a bellwether for the electorate's mood.No matter which candidate succeeds, the state will elect its first female governor this year. Voters will choose between Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a US congresswoman, and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, the state's current lieutenant governor. If Earle-Sears wins, she will become the first black woman elected to lead a US state in the nation's history.Virginia is bordered by the liberal-leaning Washington DC to the north, where many residents work in the nation's capitol or for the federal government. But the state also has deep pockets of conservative voters throughout its rural districts, and swing voters.Spanberger has highlighted the economic impact of Trump's cuts to the federal government, which have impacted Virginia's employment. Earle-Sears has touted Virginia's economy under Republican leadership. But she also has leaned into cultural topics like transgender issues, which Republicans used successfully as a wedge issue in last year's presidential election.5. The Trump factorThough he's not on the ballot, Trump's name looms over this election.The New York City mayor's race is how the next leader of the city will deal with the Trump administration, which has meddled in the city's politics. Cuomo is pitching his experience as governor dealing with the first administration as a reason for voters to choose him.The president has implied that he will penalise the city if voters choose Mamdani.\"It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York, because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,\" Trump said in an interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday. Mamdani rejects the communist label.Trump kicked off the redistricting battle that led California to put Proposition 50 on the ballot, and has endorsed Ciattarelli in the New Jersey governor's race.",

    "body": "King's Birthday Honours: How does the UK honours system work?8 hours agoPA MediaKing Charles has knighted former England football captain Sir David Beckham at Windsor Castle.Beckham was awarded a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours in June, alongside actor Gary Oldman and musician Roger Daltrey.  UK Honours typically celebrate the contribution of well-known personalities, government employees and ordinary people who have served their community.When are UK honours awarded?Most UK honours are awarded on the monarch's official birthday in June and at the new year. The 2025 Birthday Honours also made Dames of author Pat Barker and singer Elaine Page, while Strictly Come Dancing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman were awarded OBEs. The reality TV personality Georgia Harrison was made an MBE for her work on online privacy after her former partner was jailed for sharing a video of them having sex.In the most recent New Year Honours, actor Stephen Fry, former England football manager Gareth Southgate and London Mayor Sadiq Khan were among those knighted.The list also included an MBE for Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, and CBEs for services to drama for actresses Sarah Lancashire and Carey Mulligan.EPALiz Truss - Britain's shortest-serving prime minister - was criticised for recommending honours for 11 political supporters and former aidesDissolution honours are typically given to politicians when Parliament ends before a general election. Outgoing prime ministers can also award resignation honours. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak named 36 people in his resignation honours list - most of whom were high-profile former Conservative ministers, and advisors. Boris Johnson and Liz Truss both issued resignation honours when they left office in 2022.Johnson's controversial list initially contained eight names rejected by the body which approves appointments to the House of Lords. Truss was widely criticised for submitting an honours list after only 49 days in the job.How are people chosen for honours?The New Year and King's Birthday honours are awarded by the King following recommendations by the prime minister or senior government ministers.Members of the public can also recommend people for an award. These nominations typically make up about a quarter of all recommendations.Honours' lists include awards for people who:have made significant achievements in public lifecommitted themselves to serving and helping BritainPA MediaThe King knighted the actor Stephen Fry in March 2025 for services to mental health awareness, the environment and charityResignation and dissolution honours are decided by the relevant prime minister and do not go through the same process.The Foreign Office has responsibility for the Diplomatic Service and Overseas List. Honorary awards for foreign nationals are recommended by the foreign secretary.Honours are traditionally kept confidential until the official announcement.How and when do people get their honours?Honours are typically awarded by the King, Prince of Wales or Princess Royal, at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle or the Palace of Holyroodhouse.Recipients can select their investiture's date and location but not which member of the Royal Family will preside over the ceremony.Deborah JamesThe podcaster and cancer campaigner Deborah James received her damehood from the Prince of Wales - then Duke of Cambridge - in the garden of her family homeBritish Empire Medals are presented locally by lord-lieutenants, who represent the King.How are nominees vetted?Can you turn down an honour?Poet Benjamin Zephaniah said it would be \"hypocritical\" to accept an honour including the world \"Empire\"Can an honour be removed?Some people have had their honours withdrawn by the Honours Forfeiture Committee.They include disgraced former entertainer Rolf Harris, who went to prison for 12 indecent assaults on four girls, and Anthony Blunt, the former art adviser to the Queen who was revealed to be a Soviet spy.Getty ImagesFormer Prime Minister Rishi Sunak backed calls to withdraw Ms Vennells' CBEWhat are the different types of honours?Knights and DamesThe honour of knighthood comes from the days of medieval chivalry, as does the method used to confer the knighthood - the accolade, or the touch of a sword, by the sovereign.A knight is styled \"Sir\" and their wife \"Lady\".Women receiving the honour are styled \"Dame\" but do not receive the accolade.The honour is given for a pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity.The rank of Knight Commander (KBE) or Dame Commander (DBE), Order of the British Empire, appears on the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list.The Order of the BathThe Order of the Bath is an order of chivalry and was founded in 1725 for service of the highest calibre.It has a civil and military division and is awarded in the following ranks: Knight Grand Cross (GCB), Knight Commander (KCB) and Companion (CB).The Order takes its name from the symbolic bathing which, in former times, was often part of the preparation of a candidate for knighthood.Order of St Michael and St GeorgeThis Order was founded by King George III in 1818 and is awarded to British subjects who have rendered extraordinary and important services abroad or in the Commonwealth.Ranks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCMG), Knight or Dame Commander (KCMG or DCMG) and Companion (CMG).Order of the Companions of HonourThis is awarded for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to 65 people. Recipients are entitled to put the initials CH after their name.Orders of the British EmpireKing George V created these honours during World War One to reward services to the war effort by civilians at home and service personnel in support positions.The ranks are Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE), and Member (MBE).They are now awarded for prominent national or regional roles, and to those making distinguished or notable contributions in their own specific areas of activity.British Empire Medal (BEM)The medal was founded in 1917 and was awarded for \"meritorious\" actions by civilians or military personnel, although the recipients did not attend a royal investiture.Scrapped in 1993 by Conservative Prime Minister John Major, the BEM was revived in 2012.Royal Victorian OrderBy 1896, prime ministers and governments had increased their influence over the distribution of awards and had gained almost total control of the system.In response, Queen Victoria instituted The Royal Victorian Order as a personal award for services performed on behalf of the Royal Family.The ranks are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO) and Member (MVO).Royal Victorian MedalAssociated with the Royal Victorian Order is the Royal Victorian Medal which has three grades: gold, silver and bronze. The circular medal is attached to the ribbon of the Order.Royal Red CrossFounded in 1883 by Queen Victoria, the award is confined to the nursing services. Those awarded the First Class are designated \"Members\" (RRC): those awarded the Second Class are designated \"Associates\" (ARRC).King's Police MedalAwarded for distinguished service in the police force.King's Fire Service MedalGiven to firefighters who have displayed conspicuous devotion to duty.King's Ambulance Service MedalAwarded for distinguished service in the ambulance service.King's Gallantry MedalAwarded to civilians, for acts of exemplary bravery.King's Commendation for BraveryAwarded to civilians and all ranks of the British armed forces, for actions not in the presence of an enemy.King's Commendation for Bravery in the AirAwarded to civilians and all ranks of the British armed forces, for acts of bravery in the air not in the presence of an enemy.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSarah EasedaleBBC WalesNorth Wales PoliceNeil Foden was jailed for 17 years for a string of sexual abuse offencesThere were more than 50 \"missed opportunities\" to intervene and stop a school head teacher who was able to sexually abuse girls for years, a report has found.A Child Practice Review (CPR), led by prominent expert Jan Pickles, has looked into the crimes of 68-year-old Neil Foden, from Conwy county in north Wales, who was jailed for 17 years after being convicted of 19 charges involving four girls.The review said Foden was a \"prolific sex offender who harmed many children\".The leader of Cyngor Gwynedd council said the authority took responsibility for the mistakes and missed opportunities to stop Foden and apologised \"to all those who have suffered\".A total of 52 concerns about safeguarding and other issues were found to have been raised and not acted on by Cyngor Gwynedd and other agencies as early as 2018, continuing until his arrest in 2023.The \"ambitious\" recommendations the report makes are \"designed to bring about the most significant change in safeguarding in schools in Wales in a generation,\" Ms Pickles said.She said the name of the review, Our Bravery Brought Justice, was chosen by one of the victims, and it was \"now our duty as adults, professionals, politicians to rise to their challenge\" and prevent similar abuse from happening again.The review was unique in its size and scale, analysing 10 times the volume of information that is usually looked at in a CPR, and took more than a year to complete.It also highlights an historical allegation dating back to 1979, not long after Foden qualified as a teacher.The highly critical 108-page report said he was a \"powerful figure\" within the education community in Wales who had a \"wide-ranging reputation as a bully\" and also used excessive force on boys.It said repeated warnings about Foden, who it describes as \"opportunistic and determined\", were either ignored or inadequately addressed.He was arrested in September 2023 after one of his victims showed an adult a photo of themselves with Foden and screenshots of sexually explicit text messages.Ms Pickles paid tribute to the bravery of the victims and described Foden as \"a sophisticated and controlling paedophile\" who \"created a culture which enabled his offending in plain sight\".She said safeguarding was a \"multi-agency responsibility\", requiring all agencies to contribute to keep children safe and follow agreed legislation, guidance and policies, adding: \"In this case, those arrangements failed.\"Commissioned by the North Wales Safeguarding Board following Foden's conviction in 2024, the report had been due to be published in September but was postponed just hours before it was due to be released.A statement at the time cited the need for the board to consider \"its legal obligations and information sharing further\".Timeline of Foden's offendingFoden had been the long-standing headteacher at Ysgol Friars in Bangor, Gwynedd, and for a time a strategic head at another school in the county.The report examined a time period from January 2017 to 30 September 2023, and highlights numerous instances when individuals and agencies reported concerns about Neil Foden's inappropriate contact with female pupils.It includes times he was seen alone with them, giving them lifts and accompanying them to medical appointments.It says they were all \"missed opportunities\" for action to have been taken against Foden.The review cites one meeting when four senior Cyngor Gwynedd officers from education, children and family services and legal departments came together to discuss issues about two vulnerable children.The children were said to have been seen by themselves with Foden for long periods of time, had been driven home alone by him, and that one girl was seen with her head on Foden's shoulder.But the discussion was one of professional conduct, not child protection, and there was no connection made to one of the children having already been the subject of concerns raised about Foden the year before.On another occasion, the report states that Foden accompanied a child to a hospital gynaecological appointment without the child's parent's knowledge.He later took the child to a further hospital appointment, leading the clinician to consult with a health safeguarding team.A letter was sent by the clinician saying that they understood that the child \"spends a lot of time with Foden in his room\".It was sent to the child via the school but was addressed to Foden, and was later found in what had been his office, more than five years later.The report states that the risk to this child was not considered, and that this was a missed opportunity.On more than one occasion the NSPCC raised concerns over Foden's \"inappropriate professional boundaries\", with one complaint about his relationship with a child in 2020 being dismissed by Cyngor Gwynedd as \"not meeting the threshold\" for child protection.The moment Neil Foden was arrested by policeThe review compared the failings in safeguarding it found in the Foden case to the Clywch Inquiry, which was published into the crimes of paedophile teacher and author John Owen at Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen in Pontypridd more than 20 years ago.It said it was \"appalling\" that the same issues identified in that inquiry, about failures to follow recommendations about monitoring staff conduct and safeguarding policies persisted today.The review called for a national strategy to ensure consistent safeguarding education and oversight across Wales.It also makes a number of recommendations, which Jan Pickles said were \"informed with the insight of the young people who were harmed\".These include updated guidance on handling allegations against school staff to be drawn up, and agencies told they must work together consistently.Nia Jeffreys, leader of Cyngor Gwynedd, said: \"We are saddened by the details that have been highlighted by the independent reviewers and we take responsibility for the mistakes and missed opportunities to stop Neil Foden.\"On behalf of the council, I apologise to all those who have suffered and pay tribute to their courage and strength.\"A statement from Ysgol Friars said: \"As a school, we will never lose sight of the horrific crimes that were committed, or the strength of those who stood up and spoke out.\"It added school leaders \"remain committed to learning from this disaster\". Assistant Chief Constable Gareth Evans from North Wales Police said the force recognised \"there were missed opportunities to safeguard these young people through the multi-agency safeguarding response and we apologise for this\".If you've been affected by issues raised in this story, there is information and support available on BBC Action Line.More top stories",

    "body": "4 hours agoIsaac AsheLeicesterPA Media/BBCThe defence case has been made for Karen Spragg (left) and Julia WandeltThe alleged stalking campaign of a woman who believes she is missing Madeleine McCann had little real impact on the day-to-day lives of Gerry and Kate McCann, her defence team has argued.Addressing the trial at Leicester Crown Court, Tom Price KC, representing Polish national Julia Wandelt, said his client only approached the McCanns as a last resort.He said: \"It's a tragedy of this case that the McCanns have had to live with interference in their lives since 2007, but when you examine what impact her actions have had you will see it wasn't that much.\"Both Miss Wandelt and co-accused Karen Spragg deny stalking Gerry and Kate McCann.Mr Price said the first contact made by his client to Glenfield Hospital and Operation Grange in June 2022 did not affect the McCanns, and was made with a genuine hope to answer \"complex questions about her background\".He said Miss Wandelt had contacted 23 different organisations including in the UK, Poland, and Portugal including police and Interpol, missing persons charities and the Find Madeleine website.He said: \"When she contacted the McCanns, she had tried everyone else. This is a woman at the end of her tether.\"He argued the Metropolitan Police's Operation Grange did not treat her approach seriously, with his client ruled out within 24 hours of contacting them.\"She just wants the certainty of a DNA test, it could have been done, it was not done,\" he said.There was no concern relayed to police by the McCanns when they became aware of Miss Wandelt's claims through a routine operational meeting, Mr Price said.After messaging became direct, Mr Price said there was never \"malevolence\" and that all the numbers she contacted were publicly available after being leaked in the Portuguese police files.He said: \"We never see, do we, any threats of violence, there's no swearing, nothing of that type.\"This is not wicked. This is the confused behaviour of a rather sad and pathetic young woman.\"PA MediaThe disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007 has never been solvedWhen she visited the public vigil for Madeleine McCann in May 2024, she was \"polite\" he said, and the following day she visited a police station, \"not the behaviour of a woman who's done something wrong\".When Kate McCann raised the matter with police after her visit to Rothley, it was two years on, Mr Price said, while police had also taken no formal action.Before the visit to the McCann's home in December 2024, the victims were \"just getting on with things\" he said.He argued that when confronting the McCanns at their family home alongside co-defendant Karen Spragg, his client \"didn't shout, didn't swear\" and when Mrs Spragg raised her voice \"she said don't speak to her like that\".He added that \"half an hour later\" the victims had \"waited for them to clear off\" and were \"in a car going to a party\".Mr Price said: \"It doesn't sound as though it is something that is disrupting their lifestyle.\"He said Miss Wandelt's actions had not been for any personal gain, other than to find out her identity.\"She's somebody who's absolutely ripe to be taken advantage of. And what has she got out of it? All she's got out of it is a period in custody and a restraining order,\" Mr Price said.'The lost Madeleine'Karen Spragg's solicitor Simon Russell Flint KC said his client's \"sole purpose once she became involved was to find out whether Julia Wandelt might be the missing Madeleine McCann, the abducted Madeleine McCann, the lost Madeleine McCann\".After reaching out following Miss Wandelt's appearance on a YouTube broadcast in September 2024, she \"supported\" and \"believed\" Miss Wandelt and wanted to know the truth of her claims - but did not \"encourage\", said Mr Russell Flint.He said: \"If you ask how a child can disappear, seemingly into thin air, are you then a conspiracy theorist?\"He said Mrs Spragg's \"purpose was not to cause upset to the McCanns\" and when she became involved in 2024, there was no DNA evidence to disprove her theory.Mr Russell Flint said: \"It was not until after Julia Wandelt's arrest, nearly three years after she had first asked and months and months after others started asking, police finally did what they had been asked. \"Before that nobody could have stood up and said with complete certainty and said Julia Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann, and that's a real irony of this case.\"It's the very test that Julia Wandelt, Karen Spragg and others had been begging to be carried out.\"Joe Giddens - WPA Pool/Getty ImagesKate and Gerry McCann gave evidence to the court from behind a privacy screen during the trialMr Russell Flint said it was \"obvious\" that his client posed no risk to the McCanns, as she was only arrested when Miss Wandelt flew back into to the UK in February.Julia Wandelt, 24, of Jana Kochanowskiego in Lubin, Poland, and Karen Spragg, 61, of Caerau Court Road, Cardiff, deny stalking the McCanns causing serious alarm and distress between June 2022 to February 2025.The trial continues.More on this storyRelated internet links",

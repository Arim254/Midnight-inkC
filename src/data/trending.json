It’s the biggest political event of the year, and this week Donald Trump kicked off the Republican’s campaign in Iowa, telling voters the odds are against him, but Republicans “need to win”.  The president’s chief of staff says this is just the start, and Trump will be campaigning for the midterms as if it were a presidential race because he’s good at driving voter turnout.  \nIn this episode, Sarah and Anthony discuss why the midterm elections matter, what the stakes are, and Republican chances of winning.  They’re joined by a former campaign adviser to Donald Trump, Bryan Lanza, who sets out why ICE immigration protests and worries over the economy shouldn’t stop a Republican victory.\nWe also hear from Mary in Kentucky as we build our own “United States of Americast”, finding Americasters in every US state.

    "body": "12 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,in Doha, Qatar,andJack BurgessEPAIran is due to hold live fire naval drills in the Strait of HormuzIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any attack on his country would spark a regional conflict, as the US continues to build up its forces nearby.\"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.Donald Trump earlier said Iran was in \"serious discussions\" and he hoped they would lead to something \"acceptable\", while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN he was \"confident that we can achieve a deal\" on Tehran's nuclear programme.Araghchi said: \"Unfortunately, we have lost our trust [in] the US as a negotiating partner,\" but added the exchange of messages through friendly countries in the region was facilitating \"fruitful\" talks with Washington.Iran's top security official Ali Larijani had previously said a framework for negotiations was progressing.As part of its build up of forces, the US has sent its aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region and late last week US Central Command said it was operating in the Arabian Sea.\"[Trump] regularly says that he brought ships... The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things,\" added Khamenei.Iran had been expected to begin a two-day live-fire naval exercise on Sunday in the Strait of Hormuz - one of the world's most important shipping lanes and a key route for energy supplies. However on Sunday Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) navy had no plans for such an exercise.Around a fifth of the world's traded oil passes through the waterway, which is about 33km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point between Iran and Oman. Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait if it were attacked. The US has warned Iran against any \"unsafe and unprofessional behaviour\" near its forces in the area.Araghchi responded by saying: \"The US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.\"On Saturday, two explosions in Iran heightened anxiety in the country. Local authorities said a blast that killed one and hurt 14 at a building in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas was caused by a gas leak. Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.In the south-western city of Ahvaz, at least four people were killed in another explosion, with local authorities again blaming a gas leak, according to Iran's Tehran Times.On Thursday, Trump said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid US military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.In his remarks on Sunday, Khamenei accused protesters of attacking police, the IRGC and other facilities including banks and mosques.\"The coup was suppressed,\" Tasnim quoted him as saying.",

    "body": "15 hours agoWatch: 'I've never taken a drug in my life or even drunk alcohol,' says PolanskiThere needs to be a \"system change\" on drugs policy, Green Party leader Zack Polanksi has said as he reiterated his backing for the legalisation of drugs.Speaking on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, he called for a \"public health approach\" that would ensure that someone who had a \"problematic relationship with drugs\" could get help from a medical professional.Earlier in the week, Sir Keir Starmer accused Polanski of being \"high on drugs, soft on Putin\", a comment Polanski said was \"disgraceful\" and \"a cheap joke\".A No 10 source said the prime minister had been making \"an important point about the recklessness and irresponsibility of the Green Party\". Polanski said he had personally never taken drugs or drunk alcohol, adding that it \"wasn't for me\".  Asked why he had never drunk alcohol, he said: \"I grew up in school where a lot of my friends were drinking and in fact taking drugs and it felt like  somebody needed to be sober.\"I've always liked dancing without taking drink or drugs.\"If anyone wants to do it and they're doing it safely fine, I'm glad people are having a good time.\"But we know lots of people aren't doing it safely so let's make sure they get the support they need.\"Asked whether he believed legalisation could send a message to young people that using drugs would be okay, Polanski replied: \"I think the danger is happening right now which is where we're pushing it into street corners and a black market.\"He pointed to the organisation Anyone's Child, set up by families of those who had died due to drug use.\"They're saying very clearly with one voice we need a national conversation about how the war on drugs is not working,\" said Polanski.\"In fact it's making drugs more dangerous and actually what we need is a grown-up conversation based on evidence, taking a public health approach that looks at prevention, intervention and makes sure that afterwards people can get the support they need.\"Last year, The Thistle in Glasgow became the first place in the UK where people could inject heroin or cocaine while under medical supervision without being prosecuted.The UK government has said it would not change the existing drug laws to allow for the creation of more legal drug consumption rooms but would welcome any evidence that came out of The Thistle's three-year pilot.It added the government was \"focused on delivering a balanced approach with strengthened law enforcement to tackle supply coupled with investment in treatment, the development of a skilled workforce, sustainable recovery services and peer networks that will support people in recovery with employment, housing and education\".He describes himself as an \"eco-populist\" and has sought to position his party firmly on the left of politics.Asked if there was a risk he could alienate some of his party's traditional \"tree-hugging middle class\" voters, Polanski insisted his was \"the party of the 99% versus the 1%\". He said there was \"always a risk in politics\" but added that since he became leader 130,000 new members had joined his party. At the next general election, the Green Party could face the option of going into coalition with one of the other parties. He has previously said the prime minister is \"not a man I would be willing to work with\". Asked on Sunday if he would potentially be prepared to work with other politicians on the left such as Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, he said it would depend on \"what kind of policy platform they were putting forward\". He added his \"biggest focus\" was trying to win more seats for the Green Party.\"If I was working with another politician, I would have some obvious demands - a wealth tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires, proper action on the climate crisis and indeed proportional representation so people's votes actually counted,\" he said.

    "body": "2 hours agoMark Savage,Music correspondentandPaul Glynn,Culture reporterGetty ImagesThe 26-year-old has scored an international hit with her second album, The Art of LovingBritish singer Olivia Dean has confirmed her status as one of pop's biggest breakout stars by winning the Grammy Award for best new artist in Los Angeles on Sunday.Dean went into the ceremony as the front-runner, thanks to joyful, soulful romantic pop songs like Man I Need and So Easy (To Fall In Love), which became transatlantic hits last year.Despite competition from fellow Brit Lola Young and R&B artist Leon Thoma, she came out on top, making her the first Brit to win best new act since Dua Lipa in 2019.\"I'm up here as a grand-daughter of an immigrant,\" she noted while accepting her award. \"I'm a product of bravery and I think those people ought to be celebrated.\"\"We're nothing without each other,\" she added.Her golden gramophone trophy marks her out as one of pop's most promising new names, joining former best new artist winners like Amy Winehouse, Billie Eilish, Adele and Olivia Rodrigo.She was presented with her award by last year's recipient, pop star Chappell Roan.The moment marked the culmination of a slow-burn success that began with Dean's first EP, OK Love You Bye, in 2019. Since then, she's experimented with numerous genres and sounds before settling on the pillowy, jazz-toned sounds of her second album, The Art of Loving.Late night conversationsBorn and raised in Highams Park, north-east London, Dean knew she wanted to be a singer from an early age.From a distance, she'd watched her cousin - So Solid Crew rapper and actor Ashley Walters - top the charts; but it was another Londoner who really inspired her.\"People always try and say something cool when they talk about their first record - but I remember my Granny taking me to Woolworths to buy Leona Lewis's A Moment Like This on CD single,\" she told BBC News two years ago.Her debut album, Messy, was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize; but it was last year's The Art Of Loving that really put her on the map.An intimate portrait of matters of the heart, it  reached number one in the UK album charts and earned her three concurrent Top 10 singles.The entire album was composed and recorded in a rented house in East London, where Dean shunned A-list writers and asked her closest collaborators to spend two weeks, mixing sessions with late night conversations over good food and \"lots of red wine.\"That easy-going, free-flowing approach is all over the record – whose stories of love and loss are conveyed with an easy informality, like your best friend spilling their secrets.Man I Need became her breakout single in the US, reaching number two in the Billboard charts. Speaking to the podcast…And The Writer Is, she said it had been inspired by Michael Jackson's 1987 single The Way You Make Me Feel and Haribo's insanely fizzy Tangfastic sweets.\"I came in that day and there was a lot of energy in the room,\" she recalled. \"And I was like, 'Guys, let's make something really fun. I want to make something I can dance to. I want to make something that when I perform live, it's just gonna be like a Tangfastic.\"We started with the drum beat and I was like, 'Yeah, I want to do something kind of like Michael [Jackson]'s The Way You Make Me Feel-esque'\"And I sat at the Wurly [a Wurlitzer electric piano] and we kind of just, like, wrote it.\"ReutersOlivia Dean had an outfit change before performing her track, Man I NeedIt's not just the music that has made Dean stand out.Early in her career, she railed against being pigeon-holed as an R&B artist, when her music spanned genres like pop, alternative and folk, alongside throwback soul.\"I have sometimes felt quite boxed in, like I have to make 'urban' music,\" she said, but \"I feel like I can do anything\".Last year, she made headlines again after demanding, and obtaining, a refund for fans who had bought resale tickets for her US tour from Ticketmaster.The star wrote an open letter to ticketing companies after some tickets were listed at more than 14 times their original face value, with prices rising above $1,000 (£750).Dean called the practice \"disgusting\" and \"vile\", prompting Ticketmaster to announce a price cap on resale tickets, and refund fans \"for any markup they already paid\" on its service.Showing that she's unafraid to stand up for her fans, earned the singer praise from all quarters of the industry - including Sir Elton John, who interrupted a camping trip to congratulate the star on her award nominations.Alexander FjodorovOn Sunday, the singer also fended off influencers-turned-pop stars Addison Rae and Alex Warren to top the best new artist category, as well as girl group Katseye, rock star Sombr and US indie pop band The Marías.For the second year in a row, all eight nominees performed during a special segment at the early part of Sunday night's ceremony - dubbed the biggest night in music.",

    "body": "Not a fan of the gym? You can build these quick wins into your day3 hours agoLucy HookerGetty ImagesJoin the gym, run up a mountain, sign up for spin classes. We are constantly being told to go to great lengths - and get very sweaty - to get fit.What if you just don't have the time or inclination?Jo Blodgett has the answer: activity \"snacks\" that you can almost effortlessly add in to your daily schedule. Blodgett is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health at University College London and has studied the impact that small bursts of action can have on your health.High intensity exercise - getting out of breath, getting your heartbeat up - is really beneficial, but it is only part of the picture, she told the BBC Radio Four podcast What's Up Doc?Here she explains how you can get fitter without a special outfit or a gym membership.1. Fit small bursts of activity into your dayGetty ImagesSpin class is not for everyoneThere are loads of ways you can add \"exercise snacks\" into your day, says Blodgett. Officially she calls it \"vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity\" or \"VILPA\" - essentially briefly increasing your effort during routine activities.\"It's about finding opportunities in your daily life that are going to push you a little bit more,\" she says.She suggests:Taking the stairs and the lift - Walking all the way to the 12th floor might be unrealistic, so walk up two floors then get in the liftGetting off the bus early – cycling to work is great, but if you need to take the bus, get off and walk the last stop as fast as possible. No lycra needed.Picking up your pace – you might already go for walks, try speeding up between two lamp postsFortunately, if you are not currently moving much, adding in just three or four bouts of intense movement, lasting one or two minutes each, can make a big difference to heart disease and life expectancy.2. Don't rely on a few gym sessionsGetty ImagesIf you do already manage to fit in regular gym workouts, or a game of football once a week, you can stop feeling smug now. Plenty of us are what Blodgett calls \"active couch potatoes\".Of course those activities are \"a good thing\" she says, but they won't make up for sitting all day at work staring at a screen or spending the evening slouching on the couch.\"Thirty minutes in the gym is only a tiny part of it\", she points out. \"What about the other 23-and-a-half hours?\"If that is you, she advises:Standing up - get up from your desk regularlyGoing for a walk - use half your lunchtime for a leg stretch instead of looking at your phoneMeetings on the go - think West Wing, walk and talk. This works for a lot of phone meetings tooThe evidence suggests sitting only for very short periods is best. \"Every 15, 30 minutes, can you stand up, shake around, sit back down?\" says Blodgett.This does not mean you should quit the gym.There is still a hierarchy, with higher intensity activity, that raises the heart rate, still offering the biggest fitness and health gains, followed by moderate activity such as walking, says Blodgett.3. Reduce the time you are not movingGetty ImagesHealth guidelines tend to focus on how much vigorous exercise you should be aiming for.Blodgett suggests flipping that and seeing if you can reduce the time you are not moving.A few countries including Canada and Australia have started using this message. Assuming you sleep for eight hours, at least half of the time you're awake - eight hours - should be spent on the move.Blodgett says:Keep moving - aim for less than eight sedentary hours a day. The more you can cut that back the better.Let children go free - Advice in Australia is that pre-schoolers should not be restrained in a pushchair or car seat for more than an hour at a time. On rainy days try playing with balloons indoorsLean in to daily chores - Carrying groceries, pushing the lawnmower and tidying the house are all ways to keep on the move and help with strength and balanceThere is no golden rule for how much is enough, says Blodgett. The more you move the better.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "4 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterThe Kennedy Center in Washington DC will be closed for a two-year renovation beginning in July, President Donald Trump has announced.In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump said the centre would close on 4 July this year \"in honor of the 250th Anniversary of our Country\". The move follows several artists cancelling performances at the storied institution after it was recently renamed as the Trump Kennedy Center.Shortly after taking office, the president fired several of the board members at the centre and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board.The new board renamed the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Several musical acts, including Steven Schwartz, the composer of the musical Wicked, and a group called Doug Varone and the Dancers, cancelled performances at the centre in the following weeks because of the Trump name change. On Thursday, the venue hosted a premiere screening of a documentary about first lady Melania Trump.Trump has said there would be a \"scheduled grand reopening\" for the facility, and that the renovations had already been financed. \"I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for construction, revitalization, and complete rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest performing arts facility of its kind, anywhere in the world,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"In other words, if we don't close, the quality of construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many events using the facility, will be much longer.\"Getty ImagesScreening of the documentary film Melania at The Kennedy Center on 29 January Trump had lambasted the physical state of the centre and worked with Congress to allocate more than $250m (£182m) to rebuild it, one of many renovation projects he has taken on in his second term. Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Last December Democratic US Representative Joyce Beatty filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name for that reason. Some members of President John F Kennedy's family too have denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloVisionhaus/Getty ImagesCrown Princess Mette-Marit said she regretted having any contact with Epstein at allNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has said he agrees with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's admission of \"poor judgement\" after it emerged she had extensive contacts with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The princess features hundreds of times between 2011-14, in the latest files released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein.This latest embarrassment for the royal family comes on the eve of her son's seven-week trial in Oslo on 38 charges including rape and assault.Princess Mette-Marit married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon as a commoner when her son Marius Borg Høiby was four, and is in line to become queen when her husband accedes to the throne.As the content of her email exchanges began to emerge, the princess released a statement on Saturday saying: \"I showed poor judgement and regret having any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.\" She went on to express her \"deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the abuses committed by Jeffrey Epstein\".Although the prime minister did not go further than agreeing with the princess's admission of poor judgement, his implicit criticism of her is considered unusual.  Støre said he also believed that ex-Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland had exercised \"poor judgement\", after it emerged that he had planned a family holiday on Epstein's private island, although he then cancelled it.The latest cache of Epstein files reveals that Princess Mette-Marit spent four days at Epstein's house in Palm Beach, Miami in January 2013; and in one email from the HRH Crown Princess account, Epstein is asked whether a mother should suggest naked women carrying a surfboard for her son's wallpaper.US Department of JusticeThe warm nature of the correspondence has appalled commentators in Norway, and one message implied she was aware of his initial jail term in 2008.Norway's royal family has been buffeted by a succession of scandals in recent times, including the marriage of the crown prince's sister, Princess Märtha Louise to a self-styled American shaman.Now as Norwegians prepare for the trial of Marius Borg Høiby, questions are being asked about his mother's failure to realise the toxic nature of maintaining contact with Epstein, and the role of her advisers.Mette-Marit is suffering from pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant. Her 29-year-old son, who is not part of the royal family, denies the most serious charges against him. One charge of rape involves intercourse while a woman was asleep. Three others allege sexual assault while women were incapacitated, which also counts as rape in Norway.If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in jail.No member of the royal family will attend the trial, which starts at Oslo district court on Tuesday. However, in an emotional statement to reporters last week, Crown Prince Haakon said \"our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by this case...we understand that this is a difficult time for many of you, and we sympathise\".Although his stepson was not a member of the royal family he said: \"We care about him, and he is an important member of our family.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoHenri AstierWikipedia CommonsJavier Tarazona was arrested in July 2021 - photo Juanjoseco123, Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 4.0Prominent Venezuelan rights activist Javier Tarazona has been freed, in the latest prisoner release announced by the government amid US pressure for reforms.Tarazona, the head of human rights NGO Fundaredes, was arrested in 2021 and detained in the notorious El Helicoide prison in the capital Caracas. His release was announced on Sunday by Fundaredes.Foro Penal, another Venezuelan rights group, said it had verified the liberation of more than 300 political prisoners since 8 January.On Friday acting President, Delcy Rodríguez said the government would introduce an amnesty law that is expected to benefit hundreds of political prisoners. Under the bill, El Helicoide is also due to be closed.In its statement on Sunday, Fundaredes said Tarazona had been jailed \"for defending human rights, denouncing abuses, and speaking out\".It added that his release did not \"erase the injustice he suffered\", but represented \"a necessary step in a process marked by criminalisation, persecution, and a lack of due process\".Tarazona had alleged that government officials had links with guerrillas in Colombia, with which Venezuela has a 2,000km (1,200-mile) border. The government accused him of treason, terrorism and incitement to hatred.Maduro's dramatic capture by US special forces on 3 January has encouraged families of opposition and human rights figures arrested under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez to step up their campaign for releases.Venezuela has long denied holding political prisoners, but families and rights advocates have demanded charges against detainees be dropped. Opposition politicians, journalists, and activists have faced charges including terrorism and treason, which their families describe as arbitrary.The amnesty bill announced by Rodríguez is expected to be approved by the National Assembly in the coming days. Its aim, the acting president said, is to \"heal the wounds of political confrontation, violence, and extremism\".Foro Penal has said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group added.",

At least 15 people were injured, State Emergency Services said.Earlier, at least two others were killed and nine injured in separate Russian attacks overnight and on Sunday. The victims included six people hurt when a drone hit a maternity hospital in Zaporizhzhia. Two were women giving birth at the time of the strike.In a post on Telegram, Zaporizhzhia regional head Ivan Fedorov called it further \"proof of a war directed against life\".BBC Verify confirmed the site was Maternity Hospital No.3 on Bocharova Street in the east of the city.Footage shared across social media carried the watermarks of national and local administrations and showed offices, rooms with beds for patients, and a children's room with the windows broken and covered in debris. Some footage showed degrees of fire damage, while two videos showed a fire still burning on the first storey. Another showed fire fighters breaking down interior doors and ferrying patients away.EPAA woman gathers her belongings from a room in the maternity hospital after the strikeReutersNo deaths were reported after the strike at the hospital on SundayUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said the hospital attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was pursuing a \"war against civilians contrary to peace efforts\".Fedorov later reported three people had been injured by a separate strike in a residential area.After the strike on the DTEK bus in the town of Ternivka, the company said 15 miners had been killed. It later revised the death toll down to at least 12.Elsewhere, a man and a woman were killed by a drone strike in the central city of Dnipro, Ganzha said. He also reported that a 72-year-old man had been injured in Nikopol.Separately, a 59-year-old woman was seriously wounded by shelling in Kherson, while three others were injured in a strike in Kharkiv, officials said.Moscow launched a wave of targeted attacks on Ukraine's power grid in January, leaving millions without heating or electricity during an extraordinarily cold winter - with temperatures forecast to plunge below -20C in places this weekend.US President Donald Trump had said on Thursday that Putin had agreed to halt attacks during the cold - the Kremlin later said the pause would expire on Sunday.Also on Sunday, Ukraine said it was working with Elon Musk's SpaceX to stop Moscow using the firm's Starlink satellite system for drone attacks.Kyiv's military relies on the system for internet connection, but said this week it had found Starlink terminals on long-range drones used by Russia.Musk said steps to stop the \"unauthorised\" use appeared to have worked, while Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov thanked him for being \"a true friend of the Ukrainian people\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a second round of three-way talks to end the fighting - nearly four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - would begin on Wednesday, rather than Sunday as had been planned.He did not give a reason for the delay, and said the talks between Russian, Ukrainian and US officials would take place in Abu Dhabi.Negotiations on a peace plan have for months been mediated by the US, with a key sticking point being Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.Moscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine, including most of the eastern Donbas region. It wants Kyiv to hand over the areas of the Donbas it has not yet taken by force, while Ukraine reportedly wants Russia to hand back control of its largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.Additional reporting by Richard Irvine-Brown, BBC Verify",

    "body": "4 hours agoJamie WhiteheadPA MediaLord Mandelson says he has resigned his membership of the Labour Party as he does not want to \"cause further embarrassment\" by his links to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The former cabinet minister, who was sacked as US ambassador last year because of his past connections to Epstein, appeared in the latest release of files by the US Department of Justice on Friday.Documents suggest Epstein made $75,000 (£55,000) in payments to Lord Mandelson in three separate $25,000 transactions in 2003 and 2004.In his letter to Labour's general secretary, Lord Mandelson said: \"I have been further linked this weekend to the understandable furore surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and I feel regretful and sorry about this.\"He added: \"Allegations which I believe to be false that he made financial payments to me 20 years ago, and of which I have no record or recollection, need investigating by me.\"While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party.\"I want to take this opportunity to repeat my apology to the women and girls whose voices should have been heard long before now.\"I have dedicated my life to the values and success of the Labour Party and in taking my decision, I believe I am acting in its best interests.\"Earlier on Sunday, Lord Mandelson had said he did not know whether the newly released documents were authentic.He reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following the disgraced financier's conviction, apologising \"unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered\".Labour MP Gordon McKee told BBC Radio 4 that Epstein's victims would be \"rightly outraged\" by the recent revelations and that Lord Mandelson had done the \"right thing\" by resigning from the Labour Party.A Conservative Party spokesman criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for \"allowing Mandelson to resign from the Labour Party instead of kicking him out\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch earlier on Sunday had called on the prime minister to suspend Lord Mandelson's membership and launch an investigation into his ties to Epstein.Housing Secretary Steve Reed had said the government was not aware of Lord Mandelson's alleged financial links to Epstein, after being asked about it by Laura Kuenssberg.Lord Mandelson has a long history with the Labour Party. His grandfather was Herbert Morrison, a cabinet minister in Clement Attlee's 1945 government, and he began working for Labour in the 1980s.Lord Mandelson was sent to Washington by Sir Keir in December 2024 as the UK's ambassador, but was sacked the following September after further revelations emerged about his friendship with Epstein.He has been on a leave of absence from the House of Lords since he was appointed UK ambassador to the US.Emails revealed he had been in contact with Epstein after the US financier's 2008 conviction, sending a string of supportive messages.Epstein's 2008 conviction was part of a plea bargain he reached in Florida. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges, including soliciting girls as young as 14 for prostitution.The latest documents were released by the US Department of Justice as part of millions of new files related to Epstein - the largest batch since a law mandated their release last year.The included bank statements, first reported by the Financial Times, appear to show three separate payments referencing Lord Mandelson, who was Labour MP for Hartlepool at the time, being sent from Epstein's JP Morgan bank accounts.The first, dated 14 May 2003, shows a payment was sent to a Barclays bank account where Reinaldo Avila da Silva - Lord Mandelson's partner at the time - is named as \"A/C\", typically an abbreviation for account. In that payment, a \"Peter Mandelson\" is named on the account as \"BEN\", which is often an abbreviation for beneficiary. The second and third payments of $25,000 were made to HSBC accounts only days apart in June 2004. In both, \"Peter Mandelson\" is the only person named, again as \"BEN\".  It is unclear if the three payments ever made it into any of the named accounts. Images of the former UK ambassador to the US in his underwear have also been uncovered in the latest tranche of Epstein files.In a redacted picture, he is seen standing next to a female, whose face is not visible.Lord Mandelson has said he \"cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were\".It is not known when or where the images of Lord Mandelson and the female were taken.Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.Meanwhile, emails in the files released on Friday also show Lord Mandelson tried to change government policy on a planned tax on bankers' bonuses, following requests from Epstein. \"Trying hard to amend,\" Lord Mandelson wrote to Epstein in December 2009. \"Treasury digging in but I am on [the] case.\"At the time Lord Mandelson was business secretary in Gordon Brown's government.Lord Mandelson has told the BBC that every UK and international bank was making the same argument about the impact on UK financial services, adding: \"My conversations in government at the time reflected the views of the sector as a whole not a single individual.\"",

    "body": "21 minutes agoNew revelations from the US Department of Justice's latest release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein fill many of Monday's papers. \"Mandelson under fire as files appear to show Epstein sent him $75,000 (£54,800),\" reads the Guardian's headline, reporting \"bank statements appear to show three payments of $25,000 (£18,270) referencing the former UK business secretary being sent from Epstein's JP Morgan bank accounts\". Lord Mandelson said he had no record or recollection of receiving the sums and did not know whether the documents were authentic. He repeated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\".The Financial Times leads with newly released documents appearing to show Lord Mandelson telling Epstein that US bank JPMorgan should \"threaten\" the UK over a proposed tax in 2009. Emails show Lord Mandelson, who held the business secretary portfolio at the time, was \"trying to 'amend' a supertax on bank bonuses\" through Epstein's Wall Street connections, according to the paper. In a statement to the BBC, Lord Mandelson said: \"Every UK and international bank was making the same argument about the impact on UK financial services. My conversations in government at the time reflected the views of the sector as a whole not a single individual.\"Lord Mandelson \"faces order for Epstein evidence\", writes the Daily Telegraph in its headline, as \"US Congress believes Labour peer has information on paedophile's enablers\". The committee \"spearheading\" the release of the Epstein files \"said it was poised to issue the Labour peer with a demand to testify in Washington DC\", according to the paper. The committee cannot compel testimony from foreigners, as the paper notes.The Metro says the latest release of Epstein files causes \"embarrassment of riches for old pals of Epstein\". It writes the \"paedophile billionaire... sent Mandelson $75,000 (£54,800)\", while emails from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson \"asking Epstein to marry her also emerged\". Meanwhile, \"pressure also grew on Andrew to testify before the US Congress... days after images showed the former Duke of York on all fours touching a woman\". The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Lord Mandelson and Mountbatten-Windsor are \"urged to testify to US Congress after Epstein revelations,\" according to the i Paper, in order to \"bring justice for Epstein victims\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is also \"under pressure to remove Mandelson's peerage and kick him out of the Labour Party,\" the paper said. On Sunday night, Lord Mandelson resigned his Labour membership.\"A second Jeffrey Epstein victim claims she was flown to the UK for a sexual encounter with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor,\" the Daily Mirror reports, citing comments from US lawyer Brad Edwards who also represented late accuser Virginia Giuffre. The former prince has not responded to the fresh accusations and has previously denied all wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Daily Mail also leads with the woman who alleges \"Jeffrey Epstein flew her to Britain for sex\". According to the paper, \"the unnamed woman says she was taken to Buckingham Palace for tea afterwards\".The Times writes that the woman's allegations against the former prince means the \"Metropolitan Police are facing calls to reopen the case\" against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The police force had previously not carried out a criminal investigation into the former prince, at the time saying \"international authorities were best placed\" to look into past allegations. The prime minister \"suggested voters were tricked into leaving the EU,\" writes the Daily Express in its lead story. It says Sir Keir is coming \"under fire for trying to 'rewind' Brexit\", quoting Reform UK leader Nigel Farage who says the prime minister is \"determined to drag us back under the heels of Brussels\".\"Motor racing ace Lewis Hamilton is dating US reality star Kim Kardashian\", reports the Sun in its front page scoop. The paper writes Kardashian \"jets in for a night at hotel\" in the Cotswolds, citing unnamed sources.And finally, the Daily Star reports \"sumo wrestling is one of Britain's fastest growing sports\", under the headline \"Sumomania!\" There has been an \"eight-fold\" increase  in the number of clubs offering the sport over the past three years, the paper writes.Lord Mandelson's resignation from the Labour party broke too late for the papers, but the front pages do reflect the added pressure he is coming under after the latest revelations related to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.According to the Daily Telegraph, Lord Mandelson is set to be summoned to US Congress to give evidence about his links to Epstein. Sources close to the House Oversight Committee, which the paper says has \"spearheaded\" the release of the Epstein files, say they are \"poised to issue\" Lord Mandelson with a demand to testify in Washington DC. The committee cannot compel testimony from foreigners, as the paper notes. The i newspaper says Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is also facing calls to give evidence to help \"bring justice\" for Epstein's victims.Mountbatten-Windsor is also on the front page of the Times. The paper reports that the Metropolitan Police are facing calls to investigate new allegations that a woman claimed she was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with the former prince. Mountbatten-Windsor has not responded to a request for comment but has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.The i newspaper reports that the over-50s are being encouraged to stay in work for longer for the benefit of the UK economy, as well as their own pension pots. Cabinet Office analysis shows that boosting what's referred to as the \"silver economy\" could drive innovation and generate employment opportunities.The Times says ministers are paying hospitals in England £3m a month to remove patients from waiting lists, which the paper says is making it look like the NHS is treating more people than it actually is. It is part of a process known as \"validation\", getting hospital trusts to review and update lists and removing those who no longer need care. An NHS source has said the practice allows other patients to receive treatment faster.And many of the papers carry photographs of the bizarre moment when the heavyweight boxer Jarrell Miller lost his hairpiece during a fight at New York's Madison Square Garden over the weekend. The Guardian says he appeared to laugh the incident off even though his \"flyaway toupee\" stole the show, while the Daily Mail says it was \"hair-raising\".Related Internet Links",

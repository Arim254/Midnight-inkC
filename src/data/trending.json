    "body": "18 minutes agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterAn unnamed star from Strictly Come Dancing has been arrested on suspicion of rape.Hertfordshire Police said the man, who was arrested last month, had been released on bail under investigation.A BBC spokesperson told BBC News: \"It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing police investigation.\"According to the Sun, the man is alleged to have raped a woman after a BBC event. The newspaper says the woman was not a contestant or professional dancer on the show, but had met the man due to his participation in the competition.In a statement, Hertfordshire Police said: \"A man was released on police bail under investigation having been arrested in London on Monday 13 October on suspicion of rape.\"The police force said the allegations related to an incident which happened in Hertfordshire.\"Meanwhile inquiries by officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Public Protection team will continue.\"Given the nature of the allegations, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.\"It comes after another man involved with the hit BBC dance show was also arrested on suspicion of rape in August.The Metropolitan Police said the man was also suspected of \"non-consensual intimate image abuse\".It is not known what role that individual had in the programme.Strictly, which has aired since 2004 and is predominantly filmed at Elstree Studios, has faced multiple controversies over the past few years relating to the behaviour of some of its professionals and celebrity guests.Separately, the BBC launched an investigation earlier this year into alleged drug use by two of the show's stars, who have not been named.In August, the Met said it was investigating allegations of drug use on the hit dance show.",

    "body": "6 minutes agoThe papers on Friday are leading on the long-awaited independent report into how the government handled the Covid pandemic. The front page of the Independent reads: \"Fatal cost of Boris's 'chaotic and toxic' No 10: 23,000 dead\".Pandemic delays were responsible for 23,000 deaths, according to the Times. The inquiry, lead by former judge Baroness Hallett, says the UK response to Covid was \"too little, too late\" and led to thousands more deaths in the first wave. The paper adds that 227,000 UK deaths were attributed to Covid during the pandemic. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pictured on the front page of the i Paper, which hones in on the report's allegations of a \"toxic, sexist and chaotic culture\" in Downing Street. Lockdowns could have been avoided altogether if action was taken in the \"lost month\" of February 2020, the paper says.The criticism levelled at the former prime minister also leads the Guardian, which says the report paints a \"consistent picture of delay, inaction and apparent inability to learn lessons\". \"Toxic, chaotic, calamitous\" is the Metro's verdict, which details some of the more damning allegations in the 800-page report.\"Inexcusable,\" declares the Mirror, quoting Baroness Hallet's evaluation of the government response. It says that the \"Partygate PM's 'toxic' administration\" broke its own rules, referencing the Covid scandal that ultimately resulted in Johnson stepping down as an MP.The Telegraph leads with the cost of the inquiry, calling it a \"£200m Covid 'I told you so'\". The paper quotes Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK, who denounced the expense to taxpayers and says the inquiry has \"told what we already knew\". The impact of lockdowns on British children is the focus for the Mail, which suggests that the education and wellbeing of young people was sacrificed to \"save their elders\". According to the report, the closing of schools and nurseries in 2020 brought ordinary childhood \"to a halt\".The Sun reports that a \"Strictly star\" was arrested last month on suspicion of rape. According to the paper, the allegations related to an incident which happened after a BBC event.Migrants who are high earners or entrepreneurs could be eligible for settlement in as little as three years, the Financial Times reports. The paper says others could be forced to wait up to 30 years, in what Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has declared the \"biggest overhaul of the migration model in 50 years\".The front page of the Express is dedicated to its Christmas appeal, which hopes to secure \"life-changing wheelchairs\" for children in partnership with charity Whizz Kidz.The Star leads on barbed comments from former English cricketer Monty Panesar, ahead of the Ashes kicking off on Friday.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Woman who drove round bend at 85mph admits killing three men9 hours agoAlan SimpsonJorja Colville will be sentenced in JanuaryA 21-year-old woman who crashed a car after driving round a bend at more than 85mph has admitted killing her three passengers.Reece Williams, 23, Lewis Soden, 24, and Connor Page, 21, all died after the Ford Focus being driven by Jorja Colville crashed near Falkirk in July last year.  The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Colville was also speeding at more than 90mph shortly before the accident outside the village of Dunmore. Colville admitted causing death by dangerous driving and will be sentenced on 8 January at the High Court in Stirling.Her bail was continued.Police ScotlandConnor Page, Lewis Soden and Reece Williams were all killed in the crashJudge Lady Ross told Colville a prison sentence was \"inevitable\" and that there was nothing that could be said to take away \"the desperate pain\" in the lives of the three victims' families.Colville, of Stirling, admitted causing the deaths of the men on 26 July last year by driving dangerously at excessive speed, failing to maintain control of her car, causing it to leave the road and travel onto a verge where it struck a tree.Advocate depute Scott McKenzie told the court that Colville, an early years assistant, had no previous convictions.'Screaming for help'The prosecutor said that on the day of the crash, witness Kirstin Scobbie was driving on Moss Road on the approach to the collision site when she saw Colville's car behind her.She was travelling at about 60 mph, the appropriate speed limit, when the Focus overtook her before pulling back in close to the front of her vehicle.Mr McKenzie said: \"The white Ford Focus pulled away from her at speed.\" Following a series of bends in the road she noticed debris on the roadway and then saw the Focus in bushes.The prosecutor said: \"She noted the vehicle was on its side and had sustained serious damage. \"She stopped her vehicle as she approached the white Ford and saw Jorja Colville covered in blood and screaming for help.\"The court heard that Colville said that there were three people in the car who could not get out.Mr McKenzie said: \"She described that none of them were awake and that she did not know if they were breathing.\"Another driver, Dean Norris, saw the Focus approaching him in the opposing lane and said it momentarily left the road surface due to the dip on the road and formed the impression it was travelling at excessive speed. \"He saw the vehicle land back on the road surface before it lost control as it passed him,\" said the prosecutor.Mr Norris turned back to offer help and went to the Focus, but could not find any signs of life from the three men inside the vehicle. When police arrived Colville confirmed she was the driver and said her boyfriend Reece Williams was in the car along with her friends.Mr Williams had sustained blunt-force injuries to his head, chest, abdomen and limbs in the crash.Mr Soden suffered multiple injuries to his head, neck, chest abdomen and pelvis and Mr Page died from multiple blunt-force head and neck injuries.The court heard that data recovered from the car showed its speed increased greatly on the approach to the crash scene, hitting a maximum speed of 92.6mph prior to a bend and continuing through the bend at speeds in excess of 85mph.Collision investigators said the crash occurred because the driver was \"driving at significantly excessive speed for the road layout and approaching hazards of which she was warned of\".The court heard that a section of the road before the crash site has a series of peaks and troughs with a warning sign in place to alert drivers.Defence solicitor advocate Gordon Martin KC told the court that Colville, who suffered a broken shoulder and ribs, has not driven since the incident.'Kind, generous and hardworking man'Following Colville's guilty plea, Mr Williams' mother Tracy said the tragedy had not only affected her family, \"but Jorja and her family too\".\"We know she didn't set out to cause hurt that day, and this will be something she will carry for the rest of her life,\" she said.In a statement issued through Digby Brown Solicitors, Mrs Williams added:  \"If I close my eyes I can see Reece as a little boy laughing and helping his granddad build a summer house.\"He was adored by his little sister and shared a special bond with his cousins and aunts. I am so proud of the kind, generous and hardworking man he became.\"We have been blessed with these memories but are devastated there will be no more.\"My family and I will never fully comprehend life without Reece.\"",

    "body": "Volodymyr Zelensky will speak to Donald Trump after the US presented Ukraine with a draft peace plan to end the war with Russia.The plan was reportedly drafted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff and his Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev, without Ukraine's involvement. In a statement, Zelensky's office said the US believed the draft plan could \"help reinvigorate diplomacy\" and added that Ukraine had \"agreed to work on the plan's provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war\".Kyiv supported \"all substantive proposals capable of bringing genuine peace closer,\" the statement said. The Ukrainians did not share any details of what the proposal entails, although according to sources quoted by Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters, it includes plans for Kyiv to give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, to cut significantly the size of its army, and to forego many of its weapons. If confirmed, these demands would be heavily slanted towards Moscow's interest - explaining Kyiv's lukewarm reaction to the draft.But in a press briefing for reporters at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected suggestions the plan demands major concessions from Ukraine.She said Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been \"engaging both sides equally to understand what these countries would commit to\".\"It's a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine,\" she said, without providing further details. \"We believe that it should be acceptable to both sides. And we're working very hard to get it done.\"Moscow downplayed the significance of the plan, which is rumoured to include 28 points. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that while there had been \"contacts\" with the US there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".The statement from Zelensky's office came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between the Ukrainian president and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.Despite Kyiv's tepid reaction to the draft, Zelensky said he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.In his nightly address on Thursday, Zelensky said Ukraine needs a \"worthy peace,\" and that the \"dignity of the Ukrainian people\" must be respected. But neither Ukraine nor its European partners were involved in drafting the new plan, and European foreign ministers warned against coming up with proposals without consulting Kyiv or Brussels.\"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\" said EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender. Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko told the BBC that Ukraine had \"not been consulted\".\"It looks like someone wants to decide things for us,\" she said. \"And that's very painful for most of us Ukrainians.\"Since starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, including a bilateral summit with Putin in Alaska, several visits by his envoy Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders. But as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict. While Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated. Earlier this week, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 17 people were still missing at the site on Thursday, Zelensky said as he offered his condolences. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoShiona McCallumSenior Tech Reporter Online marketplace Vinted says it has removed sexually explicit adverts, after a mum reported seeing a video depicting what she believed to be a pornographic scene while browsing for clothes. Kirsty Hopley, 44, from Carlisle, said she was searching the app for a dressing gown when the ad popped up.She was sitting next to her teenage daughter at the time.Ms Hopley reported the content to Vinted and later contacted Ofcom.She told BBC News the video, which started playing automatically, showed a \"sickening\" graphic and violent sexual encounter. The law and criminology teacher said she had installed content filters on her home internet and was shocked to see such material on the e-commerce platform.\"I probably won't buy anything from there again, which is disappointing as I love Vinted,\" she said. \"But I don't want to see content like that.\" The platform, which has no age restrictions, has recently faced scrutiny in France after reports that some sellers were using the site to direct users to adult content.The advert Ms Hopley saw was promoting DramaWave, a mobile app that produces short-form scripted stories for social platforms.Many of their series appear to follow romance storylines over multiple episodes of just a few minutes each. Vinted said the adverts have now been blocked. A spokesperson said the platform has a \"zero-tolerance policy for unsolicited sexual communications and the promotion of sexual content\". \"This includes prohibiting sexually explicit advertisements on our platform,\" they said. \"Where listings or ads are found to violate these rules, we will take action, including blocking or removing them.\"The BBC has approached DramaWave for comment. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told BBC News their rules were clear \"that ads must not cause harm or offence\". \"Harmful or degrading portrayals of women in ads are completely unacceptable, and we take a zero-tolerance approach to this kind of content,\" they said in a statement.They added: \"We encourage anyone with concerns about an ad they've seen to get in touch.\"Ms Hopley told BBC News she expected the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), which includes laws to protect children from explicit content online, to have prevented such material appearing on her phone.However the only paid-for advertising that is in scope of the OSA is fraudulent content.

    "body": "12 hours agoGetty ImagesTeachers could work a \"flexible\" four-day teaching week under new proposals announced by the Scottish government.Plans also include reduced classroom contact time with pupils and agreed national minimum standards for pupil learning hours. It would leave a fifth day for \"professional learning\" activities outside of the classroom, including lesson preparation, marking and training.Scotland's education secretary Jenny Gilruth said it demonstrated a \"clear commitment\" to teachers. But the EIS union said was \"not aware\" of how a four-day week would work.The EIS and NASUWT unions are currently balloting members on strike action over a failure to reduce class contact time - periods when teachers are directly teaching pupils.At the last Holyrood election, the SNP promised to cut contact time by 90 minutes a week to allow more time for other activities.  The new proposals could enable later start times, extended breaks, or restructured school days.The teaching unions emphasised that any allocated time outside of the classroom should be used as teachers see fit.PA MediaJenny Gilruth said the proposals showed a \"clear commitment to teachers\"The education secretary said the plans, along with a new pay deal, would form a new \"National Deal\" for teachers.Jenny Gilruth acknowledged that unions had \"strong\" opinions on these plans and said she would meet with the EIS later.She told BBC Scotland: \"The move to a four-day teaching week would really help to lighten the load in terms of workload, but also to create headspace for the teaching profession.\"We've come forward with some pragmatic solutions and we very much look forward to engaging with local government and also with the teaching trade unions on securing an agreement to ensure we can improve conditions for teachers.\"'Red line for teachers'A survey by the EIS in June found that the workload in schools was \"unfair, unhealthy and unsustainable\". Teachers said they were rarely or never able to do the work, preparation and correcting they had been asked to do within their working week.EIS general secretary Andrea Bradley said the promised 90-minute reduction in class contact time was a \"red line for teachers\".\"There can be no government or employer diktat over how this time should be utilised by teachers,\" she added.Ms Bradley told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the union was not yet aware of how a flexible four-day week would be implemented.She said the Scottish government's proposals did \"not amount to a plan that can be properly scrutinised\" and said it would not affect the EIS strike ballot.NASUWT said it was pleased with the proposals but it needed \"assurance that teachers will have the responsibility for deciding how such time should be used\". A spokesperson added: \"Our members are frustrated at the ongoing delays in the delivery of a clear Scottish government promise to them, which is why we have opened a ballot on industrial action on this matter.\"This is not a proposal to put teachers onto a four-day working week. The discussion is about exactly how a teacher's five day week might be structured.Any changes would come after negotiations involving the unions and councils. But there are clearly important practical issues which need to be looked at, not least in primary schools. Having a different teacher one day a week is different to having a different teacher for an hour, perhaps for PE or another specific subject. But there is real frustration among some teachers over their workloads. The unions want reduced contact time to help cut the amount of work teachers say they have to do in their own time in the evenings and at weekends.Strike ballots over this issue continue.Even if the proposals do not become the definitive long-term solution, will they be enough to avert the risk of a strike in the months before the Scottish election?",

    "body": "8 hours agoNardine Saad, James FitzGerald and Emma Saunders,Culture reporterThe US broadcast regulator has written to the BBC over a Panorama episode that edited together parts of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump.Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chief Brendan Carr wrote to the BBC's outgoing director general Tim Davie - and to top executives at public service broadcasters NPR and PBS, whose member stations air some BBC content.Carr said he wanted to determine if the BBC provided either the video or audio of the spliced speech to any broadcaster \"regulated by the FCC for airing in the US\".The BBC has previously stated it did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.Trump has threatened to sue over the programme, saying it defamed him. The BBC has apologised, while refusing the president's demand for financial compensation. The broadcaster has acknowledged the edit gave \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" on the day of the riot at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021.In Trump's speech in the Panorama episode, Trump: A Second Chance?, he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Of the edit, Carr wrote: \"In doing so, the BBC programme depicts President Trump voicing a sentence that, in fact, he never uttered. That would appear to meet the very definition of publishing a materially false and damaging statement.\"The letter goes on to say: \"As you may know, broadcasters regulated by the FCC have a legal obligation to operate in the public interest. Those public interest requirements include prohibitions on news distortion and broadcast hoax.\"Carr's letter also stated that he was \"writing to determine whether any FCC regulations have been implicated by the BBC's misleading and deceptive conduct\".The BBC has said it has nothing to add to its previous public statements. Last week the corporation set out why it does not think it has a case to answer in a letter to Trump's legal team.As well as stating it did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels, the BBC also said that when the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.The BBC letter also argued that the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.\"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters last weekend of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"Following his threat to sue for \"anywhere between $1bn and $5bn\", Trump was expected to speak to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer about the issue at the weekend. Details have not yet emerged.The Panorama episode was aired in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, which Trump went on to win. The BBC has said it will not show it again.The issue with the episode was highlighted by an earlier Daily Telegraph report that cited a leaked BBC memo written by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee. Mr Prescott also raised concerns about several other elements of the BBC's news output.BBC director general Tim Davie resigned during the furore, as did BBC News chief Deborah Turness. In the US, broadcasting licenses are issued by the FCC and are regulated by the federal agency.The BBC is regulated by the UK watchdog Ofcom.UK-based media lawyer Mark Stephens told BBC News that Trump's team appeared to hope the FCC could establish jurisdiction by proving the edited clip aired in the US.\"In reality, the FCC will likely come up empty. If the programme wasn't broadcast in America, that's fatal to Trump's claim and to the FCC investigation,\" he said.BBC News has contacted the FCC, which shared the letter from its chairman, as well as NPR and PBS, for comment.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterEurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, has halted its UK projects, claiming  \"unsustainable\" levels of taxation has made any future investments \"non-viable\".The company said it had been informed its business rates would increase by some 200% from next year.It hit out at the government, arguing that the higher costs were \"clearly contrary\" to ambitions of growing the economy and increasing investment.The Treasury said it would support firms \"hit hardest\" by tax hikes and would continue talks with affected industries over such concerns.The outburst from Eurotunnel comes days ahead of next week's Autumn Budget, where Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out the government's tax and spending plans.Speaking to the BBC, Eurotunnel's chief executive Yann Leriche said: \"All our investments, all our plans are becoming unsustainable.\"As you know, business rates, it's a property tax. And our property - the Channel Tunnel - has not changed. It's still the same tunnel, the same terminal, the same trains. Everything is equal.\"And so to face such an increase… is a real issue for us. Because we know in rail, we invest for the long term.\"The potential 200% increase in business rates for Eurotunnel is a result of new calculations by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), which provides the government with valuations and property advice used in setting taxation and benefits.Mr Leriche said while discussions were ongoing, this could see its business rates rising from £22m to £65m. A spokesperson for Eurotunnel said such a hike in business rates, along with other taxes, could put its total tax level at about 75% on UK earnings.The VOA told the BBC the body \"does not determine business rates\" and that \"next year's liability has not yet been confirmed\".\"This unparalleled and unsustainable level of taxation makes any future investment in the UK non-viable,\" the Channel Tunnel said. \"It is therefore impossible to develop new services, create jobs, and pursue what is needed for the long-term development of our activities.\"The company claimed it had \"no other choice but to freeze our future investments in railway assets in the UK, starting in 2026\".The BBC has asked Eurotunnel what investments it has frozen. The Financial Times reported that its chief executive, Yann Leriche, told the newspaper it had scrapped plans to reopen a freight terminal in Barking and to run a new direct freight service from Lille. The Channel Tunnel is an undersea tunnel linking southern England and northern France. Nicknamed \"Chunnel\", it comprises three tunnels, two rail tunnels used for freight and passenger trains, and a service tunnel.The link between Folkestone and Calais is operated by Eurotunnel. Separate company Eurostar, Eurotunnel's biggest customer, operates passenger services through the tunnel between London and a number of other European cities on the continent, including Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.A VOA spokesperson told the BBC it had engaged with Eurotunnel and their advisers \"on multiple occasions over the past eighteen months to discuss their valuation and fully explain our approach\". \"These discussions remain ongoing, and we are committed to continuing constructive engagement.\"The spokesperson added Eurotunnel could formally challenge the valuation.Ahead of the Budget, the Eurotunnel called on the government to \"provide certainty on business rates\".The firm has not been alone in issuing warnings to the chancellor, with supermarket bosses claiming part of the government's business rates reforms posed a problem for its industry.Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.It is expected that Reeves will confirm the rates businesses will have to pay at in the Budget, along with further details, which will come into force in April 2026.The Treasury said in response to Eurotunnel's comments that it did not comment on \"speculation around future changes to tax policy\".It said once it understood the \"complete\" revaluation picture, it would be in a position to \"make final decisions\" on support.

    "body": "Why an AI 'godfather' is quitting Meta after 12 years13 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesProf LeCun is known for advancing the deep learning field of AI, and for his jazzy bowtiesJust a couple of weeks ago, one of the \"godfathers\" of artificial intelligence was in St James's Palace being handed an award from King Charles for his work in artificial intelligence (AI).Professor Yann LeCun was being honoured along with six other recipients for his contributions to the field, which have been credited as advancing deep learning. But Mr LeCun is at odds with some of the AI world over the future of the generation-defining technology.And now he is going all-in on his idea of \"advanced machine intelligence\" after announcing he is leaving his role as Meta's chief AI scientist to start a new firm.During his 12 years at the company, Prof LeCun won the prestigious Turing Award and witnessed several flurries of excitement around AI - not least the most recent boom in generative AI accelerated by rival OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.But his departure comes amid speculation the AI boom could meet an abrupt end should the so-called \"AI bubble\" of ballooning valuations and soaring spending burst.Investors, analysts and even big tech bosses like Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai have said a market correction to the AI sector would ripple across the wider economy.What LeCun thinks the AI world gets wrongProf LeCun announced his planned departure from Meta on Wednesday after more than a week of rumours and reports of his exit.In a series of posts on Threads, he thanked the company's founder Mark Zuckerberg and highlighted its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab as his \"proudest non-technical accomplishment\".\"As many of you have heard through rumours or recent media articles, I am planning to leave Meta after 12 years: 5 years as founding director of FAIR and 7 years as Chief AI Scientist,\" he wrote.\"The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular.\"The lab has over the years focused on developing systems and techniques to advance machine learning and translation.But, like large parts of the sector, Meta has looked to concentrate much of the company's research and spending on large language models (LLMs) - the systems at the heart of generative AI tools such as chatbots and image generators.Prof LeCun has suggested LLMs will be less useful in attempting to create AI systems that can match human intelligence.Instead, he wants to pursue what he called \"advanced machine intelligence\".It trains AI models primarily by using visual learning - trying to replicate how a child or a baby animal learns.That differs to LLMs, which are fed vast amounts of existing data, and then asked to generate a result based on the data and a prompt.Prof LeCun will still have a relationship with Meta once he sets up his new company,  he said - adding in posts about his departure it would be a partner of his new firm.But reports suggest he has been increasingly moving away from the approach the company wants to take. Unlike his fellow AI godfathers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, Prof LeCun has cast doubt on the idea AI might pose an existential threat to humanity.In 2023, he called such fears \"preposterously ridiculous\".\"Will AI take over the world? No, this is a projection of human nature on machines,\" he told the BBC.But some have also questioned Prof LeCun's characterisation as an outlier or visionary in the industry.\"Yann LeCun has, without a doubt made genuine contributions to AI, and I am pleased to see him speak out again the limits on LLMs,\" said AI expert and professor Gary Marcus in a recent blog.\"But he has also systematically dismissed and ignored the work of others for years,\" he added, including himself among those whose work he suggested Prof LeCun had often overlooked.",

Both albums reached the top five in the UK.After the group disbanded in 1996, Mani joined Scottish rock band Primal Scream, first playing on their album Vanishing Point, released a year later, where his bass playing was a key part of krautrock-influenced lead single Kowalski.Roses reunionGetty ImagesThe Stone Roses pictured in 2012, left to right: John Squire, Mani, Ian Brown and ReniMounfield would go on to record four more albums with Primal Scream before leaving in 2011 to reform The Stone Roses.The band released two further singles in 2016, but no full-length album followed and the group disbanded once more in 2017 after old tensions resurfaced.The Stone Roses played a number of UK gigs over 2016 and 2017 before their split, including a concert at Glasgow's Hampden Park, which would end up being the classic line-up's last concert.Brown told the crowd: \"Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened.\"'One of the absolute best'Last month, Mani told the Rockonteurs podcast he was \"in a great space\" and was \"itching to get back\" on stage.The lead singer of The Charlatans, Tim Burgess, re-posted a picture of the pair together that he had originally shared last week, on Mani’s 63rd birthday.\"One of the absolute best in every way,\" Burgess wrote. \"Such a beautiful friend.\"Echo And The Bunnymen singer Ian McCulloch also posted a tribute on X, saying his \"thoughts and feelings\" went out to his family.\"I'm absolutely gutted to hear the news about Mani, who I have always loved and always will love, deeply and forever. Like a brother,\" McCulloch said. \"I am in shock to be honest.\"Getty ImagesMani also had a guest role in the 2002 movie 24 Hour Party People and was in supergroup Freebass, with fellow bass players Andy Rourke of The Smiths and Peter Hook of Joy Division and New Order.Hook wrote on X: \"Oh God. Mani... words just fail me this time, they really do. I cannot believe it. Sending all my love to his family. This is so sad. RIP mate. Love Hooky. X\"The supergroup disbanded before releasing their debut album, It's A Beautiful Life, in 2010.'A rare person'Liam Walsh, a Manchester-based music publicist and friend, said: \"I've known Mani for 40 years. He was such a rare person: he always greeted me - and everyone - with such warmth.\"He was always pleased to see you, and I was always delighted to see him. He had the most infectious laugh that gave him all those laughter lines.\"Walsh said he was \"in shock\" after hearing the news on his way to a music industry event. \"As I walked in, the Stone Roses' Fools Gold, with that famous bassline of his, was playing in the bar. His legacy will live on forever.\"Away from music, the Manchester-born star was a keen fan of Manchester United, and often spoke about the team on TV and radio.Mounfield's death comes after he announced an in-conversation tour of UK venues, which would have seen him recount his experiences and memories in the Stone Roses and Primal Scream from September next year.",

    "body": "When will the Epstein files be released and will they be redacted? 3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,The White House and Nardine SaadReutersSurvivors and family members talk about Jeffrey Epstein files US President Donald Trump has signed a bill ordering the justice department to release all its files from its investigation into convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The legislation, which calls for the release of the files \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" within 30 days, was approved overwhelmingly in both chambers of Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, on Tuesday.Trump then announced on his Truth Social platform that he had signed it on Wednesday, starting the clock on release of the files. Under pressure from Epstein's victims and rank-and-file Republicans, Trump on Sunday made a major reversal in his stance on the files and gave his blessing to passing the legislation. For months, he had resisted unsealing many documents from the federal investigation into the late financier. Congress' lower chamber began debating the measure on Tuesday morning and voted within hours. Several of Epstein's victims spent the day on Capitol Hill advocating for the bill's passage. Nearly all House lawmakers voted in favour of the resolution, which passed  427-1. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, was the only one who voted against the bill. Two Republicans and three Democrats did not vote. The Senate then passed the resolution.The House Oversight Committee has already made public thousands of documents from the Epstein estate relating to the late financier, but the resolution covers material currently in the possession of the justice department.Those records could, in theory, include files about imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as figures - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents. When did Trump sign the bill? On Wednesday morning, the Senate confirmed that it had passed the Epstein bill and sent it to Trump.Later that evening, Trump posted on social media that he had signed it into law. While the press and others are often invited to witness Trump's bill-signings, this was done out of public view, and the announcement was included in a long post that also blasted Democrats he claimed were tied to Epstein, touted the president's record during this second term, and addressed the two impeachment trials of his first term.\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.He added that because he had asked Republican lawmakers to support the measure \"the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage.\"The justice department now has 30 days to release its materials on Epstein.But there are obstacles to the files being shared.The House bill said the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\". That could potentially lead to delays, given that Trump has called for investigations into Epstein's links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton and Larry Summers, \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, whereas Summers has apologised for his \"misguided decision\" to continue communicating with Epstein until 2019.\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC. \"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\" For those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage. Several Republican lawmakers have expressed worries that Trump's order to the justice department to investigate Epstein's ties could slow the release of the files.Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman, vowed that he and fellow Republican dissident Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, would \"absolutely\" go to the floor of the House and read out the names of \"some of the men\" in the files if the records were not duly released by the justice department.Watch: How much do Americans care about the Epstein story?Will the files be redacted?In addition to possible delays, the public is also likely to see lots of redactions in any release of new Epstein documents. In the tranche of files released by the House Oversight Committee last week, names and phone numbers were frequently blacked out to protect privacy. \"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Prof Entin said. The latest bill says the attorney general can \"withhold or redact\" records that include victims' names, medical files and other personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".One attorney who handles sexual abuse cases supported Congress improving the provision. But she said releasing the files still might impact Epstein survivors.\"I'm glad in the act itself they put specific language reinforcing the privacy rights of the victims here,\" said Christine Dunn, co-managing partner at Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight's Washington, DC, office.\"I'm torn because I think transparency is almost always a good thing, I don't think things change until someone shines a light on them,\" she said. \"But at the same time for the victims, having to relive this in the media is going to be hard.\"The attorney general can also withhold classified material and images of sexual abuse.The justice department already said that a \"large volume\" of its 300 gigabytes of data from Epstein investigations includes images and videos of minors and thousands of downloaded videos and images of child sex abuse.Other information in the documents could be protected by grand jury secrecy rules, which the latest bill does not explicitly address.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Wednesday morning when asked about the Epstein files during an unrelated news conference: \"We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency, while protecting victims.\"Kayla Epstein contributed to this report.",

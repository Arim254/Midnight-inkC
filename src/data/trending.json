    "body": "Ruthless Ireland hit record away win over EnglandImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ireland had not won away at Twickenham since 2022ByAlastair TelferBBC Sport journalist at Allianz StadiumMen's Six NationsEngland (7) 21Tries: Dingwall, Lawrence, Underhill Cons: Ford 3Ireland (22) 42Tries: Gibson-Park, Baloucoune, O'Brien, Sheehan, Osborne Cons: Crowley 4 Pens: Crowley 3A ruthless Ireland kept alive their Six Nations title bid with a record 42-21 away win over England at Allianz Stadium.The visitors, whose previous record-winning margin was a 17-point victory in 2022, ran in five tries to embarrass Steve Borthwick's side.England's defeat - their fifth heaviest at home - leaves their championship hopes in tatters after two defeats and one win, with away games against Italy and France to come.Andy Farrell's Ireland proved too quick and slick for the hosts, scoring three tries inside the opening 30 minutes.England's home form under Borthwick had become formidable, but the run ended at nine consecutive victories after a miserable afternoon that was meant to be a celebration of captain Maro Itoje's 100th cap.Lack of discipline, missed tackles and simple errors were consistently punished, with 22 points the fourth-most first-half points conceded by England at home.Jamison Gibson-Park's quick thinking caught England napping, before tries by wingers Robert Baloucoune and Tommy O'Brien.Borthwick's side, who were looking to bounce back from last week's defeat by Scotland, finally crossed at the end of a frantic first half through Fraser Dingwall.Ireland could still claim the Triple Crown, which they won last year, with Dan Sheehan's try clinching the bonus point early in the second half.The visitors are still in the running for the championship but may rue not picking up a late bonus point in last week's win over Italy.Centre Ollie Lawrence and Sam Underhill scored second-half tries for England, but Ireland were always too far clear because of the boot of Jack Crowley and a try by Jamie Osborne.Ireland show class of 2023In the opening two rounds, Ireland were a long way off the side that claimed back-to-back titles in 2023 and 2024.With key personnel injured and players lacking form, Farrell's team has a new look this championship.And against England, Ireland's multi-phase attack looked back at its best.One player to benefit is Ulster wing Baloucoune, who was a standout performer against Italy last week - his acceleration and offload creating the initial break for Gibson-Park's try.His club team-mate Stuart McCloskey then burst up the middle of the pitch for Baloucoune to eventually dot down in the corner.Full of confidence, Baloucoune - who was also excellent in defence - broke clear and found replacement O'Brien, on for injured James Lowe, for a third unanswered try.Much of the build-up to the game at Allianz Stadium once again was dominated by the Ireland number 10 debate.Crowley's performance could well end it - for a while, at least - as he guided his side around the pitch brilliantly.But his poor missed touch-finder against Italy, with the clock in the red and a bonus point a real possibility, may prove costly if France slip up.Yet the game could mirror the 2021 win over England, which sparked Ireland's first rejuvenation under Farrell before they reached world number one in 2023.This was their sixth win over England in their past seven meetings.Media caption, First-half errors gifted Ireland scoring chances - BorthwickPressure mounts on EnglandMedia caption, 'Emotional' Dawson criticises England's mentalityEngland lacked energy and dynamism in the early exchanges against Scotland, trailing 17-0 after 15 minutes.The inclusion of Henry Pollock and Tom Curry from the off against Ireland was meant to be the fix, but the same problems were evident.Borthwick's side, who lost their 12-game winning run in Edinburgh, were unable to deal with the speed and intensity of Ireland's attack, and they once again came off second best in the air.The hosts did have opportunities to score in the first half but lacked any sort of clinical edge.Jamie George coming on for a misfiring Luke Cowan-Dickie and Marcus Smith replacing full-back Freddie Steward, who spent time in the sin-bin, before half-time summed up Borthwick's frustration.Losing scrum-half Alex Mitchell early in the game also did not help in dealing with the first-half chaos.Smith showed some sharp touches and was the player to send over Dingwall right on half-time.Caelan Doris' break at the start of the second half and subsequent yellow card for Pollock, which was followed by Sheehan's try, quickly ended any chances of a dramatic comeback.Hopes of a Grand Slam or a first title since 2020 could not be further away and given tricky trips to Rome and Paris are to come, Borthwick's side are now under increasing pressure.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ireland's win was their biggest ever over England in terms of points difference and points scoredSlide 1 of 6, Ireland players posing for a photograph, Ireland's win was their biggest ever over England in terms of points difference and points scoredLine-upsEngland: Steward; Freeman, Lawrence, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Heyes, Itoje (capt), Chessum, T Curry, Earl, PollockReplacements: Van Poortvliet for Mitchell (25), George for Cowan-Dickie (29), M.

    "body": "2 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesGiant tortoises are roaming the Galápagos island of Floreana for the first time in more than 180 years, in what conservationists have called a \"hugely significant milestone\".The release of 158 captive-bred juvenile tortoises onto the island is part of the Floreana Ecological Restoration Project led by the Galápagos National Park Directorate.The reintroduction follows a \"back-breeding\" programme launched in 2017 after scientists discovered tortoises carrying ancestry of the Floreana giant tortoise on nearby Isabela island.Floreana's native species, Chelonoidis niger niger, was driven to extinction in the 1840s by sailors who took thousands from the island for sustenance during long voyages. \"The restoration of Floreana has reached a hugely significant milestone, with 158 captive-bred giant tortoises released into the wild this week,\" the Galápagos Conservation Trust (GCT) said in a statement on Friday.\"This long-anticipated moment gives hope, not just for the future of Floreana, but for the future restoration of islands around the world,\" it added.Dr Jen Jones, GCT chief executive, described the moment as \"truly spine-tingling,\"  adding that it had validated two decades of collaboration between scientists, charities and the local community.The conservation project became possible after scientists discovered tortoises carrying Floreana ancestry on Wolf Volcano on Isabela island in 2008. Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykEPA/ ShutterstockNasa has said that its early March launch day for its highly anticipated lunar mission would almost definitely be pushed back, after the agency spotted problems with the system's helium flow in safety checks.  On Friday, the space agency said that its Artemis II mission, which would see astronauts sent to the moon for the first time in 50 years, could launch as early as 6 March. But NASA administrator Jared Isaacman announced on Saturday that an interruption to helium flow will \"almost assuredly impact the March window\". Four astronauts are preparing to be sent on the 10-day trip to the far side of the Moon and back, marking humanity's furthest ever journey into space. The check on Thursday, which involved fuelling the rocket ​with some 730,000 ​gallons of propellant over the course of 50-hours, initially revealed no faults. But overnight on Friday, engineers observed an interruption in the flow of helium required for launch operations.\"This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,\" NASA said in a statement on Saturday, adding that it would almost definitely delay its highly anticipated lunar mission. Disruption to helium, which is used to pressurise fuel tanks and cool rocket systems, is treated as a serious technical issue, according to Nasa. Nasa targets early March to send humans back around the MoonNASA's launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson had earlier said that Thursday's simulation felt like \"a big step in us earning our right to fly\", adding that he was \"very proud \"of the team. The test was the scientists' second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, having fixed earlier issues with filters and seals that had led to hydrogen leaks. Three US astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut, Jeremy Hanse, are due to take off in the mega Moon rocket, which will allow them several hours to study the moon's surface up close. It is hoped that the mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but accepted this could be an ambitious time frame. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentEPAIsraeli air strikes have killed at least 10 people in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say, despite a ceasefire.Israel's military said it had targeted sites belonging to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia and political party, in the Bekaa Valley, an area where the group has a strong presence.Hezbollah confirmed that at least eight of its members had been killed, including a senior field commander.The strikes were among the deadliest in Lebanon since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024.Despite the deal, which followed 13 months of conflict, Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon, on targets it says are linked to the group, which is supported by Iran.Images posted online from one of the locations hit on Friday night showed heavy damage in what appeared to be a residential neighbourhood.In a statement, the Israeli military said it had struck what it described as Hezbollah command centres and that the group \"systematically embeds its assets within the civilian population\". It said the group's activities were \"a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\".In a separate statement on Saturday, the military said it had \"eliminated several terrorists of Hezbollah's missile array in three different command centres... recently identified as operating to accelerate the organisation's readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks towards Israel\".Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US, says the ceasefire deal only applies to southern Lebanon, in the area between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel.The group, however, has so far rejected calls from Lebanese authorities to discuss the future of its weapons elsewhere in the country, including in the Bekaa Valley, where part of its arsenal is believed to be located.This week, Hezbollah dismissed a decision by the government to advance the second phase of the disarmament plan in areas between north of the Litani and the Awali river, in the port city of Sidon.Lebanon's government says Israel's ongoing actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam recently said the situation had become a \"one-sided war of attrition\".Hours before the attacks in the east, an Israeli strike hit the densely populated Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Helweh, on the outskirts of Sidon, in the country's south.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"command centre\" that had been used by Hamas, which said two members had been killed.The strikes come amid heightened tensions in the region, with the United States threatening to attack Iran if negotiations between the two countries fail to reach a deal.There are concerns in Lebanon that Iran might force Hezbollah to join its response to an attack if Israel becomes involved.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMaia Davies''Domenico is gone'' says mother of toddler who died after receiving damaged heartA toddler in Italy who received a damaged donor heart has died, the family's lawyer has said.Two-year-old Domenico died shortly before 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Saturday, Francesco Petruzzi told reporters. Monaldi Hospital, where he was being treated, said he had suffered a \"sudden and irreversible worsening of his clinical condition\".The heart given to Domenico during a transplant in late December was reportedly transported to the hospital in direct contact with dry ice, causing severe tissue damage.Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation in a case which has sparked outrage in Italy.Petruzzi has said the organ arrived \"burned by frostbite\" after being transported over 800km (490 miles) from Bolzano to Naples in an unsuitable container alongside the ice, without a thermometer to alert the medical team to the low temperature.The two-year-old had been on life support in Naples for almost two months. His mother Patrizia Mercolino had appealed to the Pope to help her son.\"It's over. Domenico is gone,\" Mercolino told reporters on Saturday.She said a foundation would be established in his name.The family's lawyer said the foundation would be for \"all children who cannot have a transplant and to help all victims of malpractice and medical negligence\".Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the \"whole of Italy mourns the loss of little Domenico, a warrior who will never be forgotten\".She wrote on X: \"On behalf of myself and the government, I offer my sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his mother Patrizia, his father Antonio and all his loved ones.\"I am certain that the competent authorities will shed full light on this terrible incident.\"On Wednesday, a panel of paediatric specialists concluded Domenico's condition was \"not compatible\" with another transplant.Doctors had warned a prolonged use of the life support system might have compromised his lungs, liver and kidneys.Petruzzi said at the time the family wanted to see all the relevant medical records: \"If the time for hope has ended, then the time for responsibility has begun.\"Italy's Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said earlier this week that \"we must absolutely clarify what happened\".\"We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians.\"\"We have an excellent national health service, which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith.\"",

    "body": "Iran students stage first anti-government protests since deadly crackdown15 minutes agoSiavash Mehdi-Ardalan,BBC PersianandJaroslav LukivClashes break out at Sharif University in TehranStudents at several universities in Iran have staged anti-government protests - the first such rallies on this scale since last month's deadly crackdown by the authorities.The BBC has verified footage of students marching at the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran at the start of a new semester on Saturday. A similar rally is reported to have taken place in the north-eastern city of Mashhad.The protesters were honouring thousands of those killed when nationwide mass protests were put down.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.US and Iranian officials meet in Switzerland on Tuesday and said progress had been made in talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme.But despite the reported progress, Trump said afterwards that the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached with Iran or the US would take military action. The US leader has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that \"help is on its way\". Footage verified by the BBC shows hundreds of protesters peacefully marching and chanting on a street near the Sharif University of Technology on Saturday.Students were also calling for more rallies on Sunday.Unverified footage has also emerged purportedly showing a peaceful sit-in protest at the capital's Beheshti University.Sizeable protests in other locations were also reported later in the day.Unverified videos posted online also show clashes between pro- and anti-government groups in one university in Tehran. It is not immediately clear whether any demonstrators have been arrested.In late January, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people since the unrest began, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. Hrana also said it was investigating 17,000 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Saturday's protests come as the Iranian authorities are preparing for a possible war with the US.The exiled opposition is adamantly calling on President Trump to make good on his threats and strike, hoping for a quick downfall of the current hardline government. But other opposition groups are opposed to outside intervention.The opposing sides have been involved in disinformation campaigns of social media, trying to maximise their conflicting narratives of what Iranian people want.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinAFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has fired a top prosecutor in Virginia just hours after judges hired him. A panel of judges announced on Friday that they had unanimously voted to appoint James W Hundley as the interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.Hours later, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on X: \"EDVA judges do not pick our US Attorney. POTUS does. James Hundley, you're fired!\"It is the second time this month that the Trump administration has abruptly fired a prosecutor who was appointed by judges.Hundley was picked to fill the seat vacated by Erik Siebert, who resigned in September under pressure from President Donald Trump.In appointing Hundley - a veteran litigator with more than three decades of experience - to the role, the district court judges cited a law that allows them to hire a new person to the role after the previous holder's term expired. The justice department has argued that the president and the attorney general maintain the right to appoint interim US attorneys. Some critics have accused the Trump administration's appointments of skipping the Senate confirmation process.In addition to Virginia, judges in New York, New Jersey, California and Nevada have ruled that a Trump administration's pick for a US attorney role was serving unlawfully. \"It was a great honor to be appointed by the Court as Interim United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia,\" Hundley said, in part, in a statement to the BBC. \"Despite my dismissal by the President, I will continue to support our country and its justice system in any way I can,\" he added.Siebert, who was appointed as acting attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in January 2025, had been overseeing the investigation into James over allegations of mortgage fraud.James, a Democrat who led a civil fraud suit against Trump in 2023, has previously denied the allegations as \"baseless\" and says they are motivated by \"revenge\". Siebert's office ultimately decided not to bring criminal charges against James after Siebert expressed doubts about the strength of the case. That decision drew the ire of Trump, who had called for James to be investigated. Siebert then resigned from his position after Trump said: \"I want him out\". Days after Siebert's exit, Trump appointed Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide and the president's former personal attorney, to the position. Halligan quickly secured grand jury indictments against James, as well as against Comey. Comey, a longtime adversary of Trump, was accused of lying to Congress about not authorising a leak of classified information to the media.",

    "body": "Liverpool manager Arne Slot says he is \"not weak\" and denies the situation with Mohamed Salah has undermined his authority.The 33-year-old winger has been left out of the squad to face Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday after giving an explosive interview two days ago, claiming he was \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool and his relationship with Slot had broken down.Slot says he does not feel that way and was \"surprised\" by Salah's comments.Speaking in Milan on Monday night, Slot added he had \"no clue\" if Salah, who signed a new two-year contract in April, had played his last game for Liverpool, but added he was a \"firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player\".He said his conversation with Salah to tell him he would not travel to Milan was \"a short one\".\"Usually I am calm and polite, but that doesn't mean I am weak,\" he said.\"If a player has these commands about so many things, then it's about me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see - he's not here.\"He added: \"I don't feel my authority is undermined, it is not the way I feel it.\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation. There is always the possibility to return for a player. I have no clue [if he has played his last game for Liverpool] - I cannot answer that question at this point in time.\"Salah said in his interview it was \"very clear that someone wants me to get all the blame\", but Slot says he does not know if that comment was aimed at him and gave his reasons for leaving Salah out for the past three games.\"It is hard for me to know who he was talking about,\" Slot said.\"That is not the way I feel. He has the right to feel the way he does, but he does not have the right to share it with the media.\"He was very respectful and has trained really hard before the weekend - to that extent it was a surprise to me the comments he gave.\"Yes, we were [on speaking terms] but it doesn't mean we were always agreeing on things.\"But it is not the first or the last time that a player who is not playing has said something similar to that.\"We as a team have struggled this season. I have tried to come up with solutions - that is my job. We tried many things and we looked very vulnerable against Nottingham Forest and PSV so I decided to play with an extra midfielder.\"Sources told BBC Sport the decision to leave Salah at home was taken with the full support of Slot, and that it is in the best interest of all parties involved for the player to have a brief period away from selection given the nature and timing of his public comments.It is understood there will be no formal disciplinary action taken by the club.Egypt forward Salah departs for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday and also looks likely to miss Liverpool's Premier League home game against Brighton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).Salah has scored 250 goals for Liverpool since signing from Roma in 2017, but has just five in 19 games this season.Slot has named a 19-man squad for Tuesday, with the Reds also missing forwards Cody Gakpo and Federico Chiesa, and defensive midfielder Wataru Endo.Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson says Salah's team-mates \"have different thoughts\" about his outburst, but the Brazil international wants the winger to return.\"This is not a situation that makes us happy, first and foremost because on a personal level we all love Mo,\" he said.\"We were a little bit caught by surprise but we know it is a personal situation so we are leaving it between him and the club.\"What we believe does not come into things. What we want is for him and the club to reach an agreement in the best interests of him and the club and all of the playing staff.\"I hope he plays again for the club.\"He added: \"We as his team-mates and his friends, we hope the best thing happens for him, but as Liverpool FC players we want the best for the club as well. We want a win-win situation for everyone.\"Alisson also backed his manager Slot, adding: \"We believe [in] his style of play and that he is capable of helping us to turn around this situation.\"Almost 48 hours after Salah spoke, this was Arne Slot's chance to say his piece.Monday was a public holiday in Milan but the media conference room inside the San Siro was still packed. It is hard to think of a more anticipated pre-match media conference in recent times.Slot used his humour to start off by joking with a reporter that he asked five questions in one, but minute by minute, details began to emerge and it was clear to see who was in charge.When BBC Sport asked him whether he understood Salah's comments when the Egyptian said he was \"thrown under the bus\", Slot said: \"Usually I'm calm, I'm polite but I'm not weak. If a player has these comments about so many things, then it's up to me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see because he's not here.\"This was Slot on the front foot and he was backed later by goalkeeper Alisson, who insisted that the Liverpool squad are firmly behind the manager who won the Premier League.That backing from a senior player was crucial on a night where Slot was asked if he felt his authority was undermined by the whole saga.Slot categorically denied he felt that way, even if he was surprised when he heard the quotes on Saturday night.The Liverpool coach did not delve too much into the specifics, insisting that his conversation with Salah was short, but he said enough to explain the situation without inflaming it any further.And, importantly, the door is still open for Salah even though Slot said he had \"no clue\" whether the 33-year-old has played his last game for the club.The club insist this was mainly because of Salah bringing his own future into question. Their position is that Salah still has a contract and as Slot said, he is a \"firm believer\" in the possibility for a player to return.After 10 minutes of questions solely focused on Salah, the Liverpool media officer, sitting next to Slot, said it was time to move on to questions about the game itself.Ultimately though, regardless of how Liverpool fare tomorrow against Inter Milan, this is a story that will continue to dominate the agenda until there is a clear resolution.",

    "body": "3 hours agoReutersThe nightclub is located in a busy tourist areaThe owners of a nightclub in Goa, India, where a devastating fire killed 25 people on Sunday, fled the country hours after the tragedy, police have said.Indian authorities confirmed the two brothers, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, boarded a flight to Phuket in Thailand shortly after the incident.Investigators believe the fierce blaze was triggered by fireworks being set off inside the venue, Birch By Romeo Lane, which is located in a busy nightlife area of Goa, a coastal state popular with domestic and international tourists.The majority of the victims were staff members, while four were holidaymakers visiting from Delhi. Five people are still being treated in hospital.Police have appealed to Interpol for help to find and arrest the Luthra brothers.Police said they travelled to Delhi to carry out a raid on the mens' home, but  discovered they had left the country. \"It shows their intent to avoid police investigation,\" Goa police said in a statement. Saurabh Luthra, whose social media identifies him as the chairman of the company which operates the club, posted a statement on social media expressing \"profound grief\", but did not reference his whereabouts.\"In this hour the irreparable sorrow and overwhelming distress, the management stands in unwavering solidarity with the families of the deceased as well as those injured, and conveys its heartfelt condolences with utmost sincerity,\" Monday's post said.It added that \"management\" would provide \"assistance, support and cooperation to the bereaved\".His brother Gaurav Luthra has not commented publicly.At least four people were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the fire, including the venue's manager.The Birch nightclub in Arpora, an area with several high-end nightlife businesses, was packed with customers who had come to hear a Bollywood DJ when the fire broke out in the early hours of the morning.Eye witnesses have described scenes of total panic to the BBC, as people tried to flee.The main section of the venue is built on an island in the middle of a lake, which visitors accessed via narrow walkways - a layout which made it difficult for firefighters to tackle the blaze.Part of the venue was entirely destroyed. Police initially said an exploding gas canister was the cause, but now believe it was due to pyrotechnics igniting wooden ceiling beams.Several of the victims were migrant workers who had travelled to Goa to find employment, including four Nepalese nationals.Among those who died were two brothers who were both engaged to be married next year, and four members of the same Delhi family.The police said the bodies of all the victims had been returned to their families.

    "body": "At least 30 people were injured after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit north-eastern Japan on Monday night, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes.The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31mi), about 80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen.Some train services have been suspended and thousands of homes have been left without power as a result. Authorities have also warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days - urging the public to remain on high alert for at least a week, according to local media reports.Addressing citizens affected by the earthquake, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said: \"Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking.\"Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency.The Aomori prefectural government said around 2,700 homes have been left without power. East Japan Railway has also suspended some services along the north-eastern coast.The Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said.\"We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,\" he added.Following the tremors, Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said.None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency.Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011.That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year.Earlier this year, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, with worst-case scenarios suggesting it would cause trillions in damage, and potentially kill hundreds of thousands.Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - have already been responsible for thousands of deaths.",

    "body": "36 minutes agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterDepartment for TransportThe government has unveiled its branding for Great British Railways (GBR), marking a step forward in plans to nationalise the railways.In the past year, the government has taken three rail franchises back into public control, something Labour promised in its manifesto.The new livery and branding uses a red, white and blue colour scheme to mirror the Union Flag and will be used on GBR trains, at stations and on its website and app. While the Budget included plans to freeze regulated rail fares in England next year, the government has previously said it cannot guarantee customers will see lower prices under renationalisation. The rollout of the design, which was created in-house, is expected to take place gradually, with passengers beginning to see the trains across the national network from next spring. Through December, the design will be displayed at stations, including London Bridge, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, Leeds City, and Manchester Piccadilly.The Railways Bill, which will allow for the creation of GBR, is currently making its way through the House of Commons. The government has said it is renationalising the railways so it is \"owned by the public, delivering for the public, not for private shareholders\".The rollout of GBR will also include an app, which will let customers check train times and book trains without booking fees. Disabled passengers will also be able to use the app to book assistance. Department for TransportA mock up of what the GBR app might look like Several train companies had been nationalised under the previous Conservative government, including Northern, TPE, Southeastern and LNER.There are now seven train operators already in public hands, accounting for about a third of journeys, with franchises being acquired as their contracts have expired. In the past year Greater Anglia, South Western Railway and c2c have been nationalised, with more expected to follow in 2026. The GBR logo is the distinctive double-arrow logo currently used by National Rail, which provides passenger information and tickets, and was created in the 1960s as the logo of British Rail - the state-owned company which previously operated Britain's railways.  Getty ImagesThe double-arrow logo was previously used by British RailTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander said that the new design \"isn't just a paint job\", and that it represents \"a new railway, casting off the frustrations of the past and focused entirely on delivering a proper public service for passengers\".Jacqueline Starr, executive chair and chief executive of Rail Delivery Group - a collection of Britain's train operators - welcomed the government's commitment to improving services for customers. \"We will continue to work closely with industry partners to support a smooth transition to Great British Railways,\" she said.

    "body": "6 hours agoLily Jamali,North America Technology Correspondent, San FransciscoandOsmond Chia,Business reporterUS President Donald Trump has announced that he will allow AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China.\"We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America's lead in AI,\" Trump said on social media on Monday.The decision will apply to other US chip companies like AMD and comes after extensive lobbying by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, who visited Washington last week to drum up support.Nvidia - both the world's leading chip firm and most valuable company - has found itself at the centre of a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China in recent months, and had been banned from selling its most advanced chips to Beijing.Trump reversed the chip-selling ban in July, but demanded that Nvidia pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government.Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to stop buying Nvidia chips manufactured for use in the Chinese market. \"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" Nvidia said in a statement provided to BBC News.Nvidia's H200 is a generation behind its Blackwell chip, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor.Mr Huang told the BBC in September that the US needed \"to make sure that people can access this technology from all over the world, including China.\"He has also repeatedly warned that China, which has cultivated a chip production ecosystem of its own, was close behind the US in chip development.Nvidia hailed Trump's announcement on Monday.\"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,\" Nvidia said in its statement.The companies shares rose slightly on the news.Trump said \"$25% [sic] will be paid to the United States of America\" in his post.The BBC has reached out to the White House for clarification on the arrangement, which will likely face opposition from national security hawks in Congress.The sale of H200 chips to some Chinese customers \"buys time\" for the US to negotiate a deal with Beijing over rare earths and prevent major disruptions to global supply chains, Alex Capri from the National University of Singapore said.China holds a near-monopoly on the processing of rare earth minerals, which are essential for the production of most electronics.Although access to H200 chips is likely to benefit China's technology sector, Beijing is still expected to work towards reducing dependence on the US, Mr Capri said.Beijing had previously directed local tech firms to reject Nvidia's older H20 chips and encouraged them to buy domestically produced semiconductors, he noted.Researchers at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) said China's People's Liberation Army is using advanced chips designed by US companies to develop AI-enabled military capabilities.\"By making it easier for the Chinese to access these high-quality AI chips, you enable China to more easily use and deploy AI systems for military applications,\" said Cole McFaul, senior research analyst at CSET. \"They want to harness advanced chips for battlefield advantage.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesNew York City Mayor-Elect Zohran MamdaniNew York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani will live in the Manhattan mansion that his predecessors have called home, leaving behind a rent-stabilised apartment that became the subject of heated debate during his campaign.Gracie Mansion, which dates to 1799, has served as the residence for most New York City mayors since World War Two. But Mamdani, for whom affordable housing is a central issue, did not confirm he would live there immediately following his victory in November.\"This decision came down to our family's safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,\" Mamdani said in a statement on Monday.He has been living in the Astoria neighbourhood in the borough of Queens. The area, home to many middle-class families, is famous for its abundance of immigrant communities and global cuisine.\"To Astoria: thank you for showing us the best of New York City,\" Mamdani's statement said.\"While I may no  longer live in Astoria, Astoria will always live inside me and the work I do.\"During his campaign, Mamdani tied his core platform - freeze the rent – to his own housing situation. But his rivals, mainly former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, criticised Mamdani for occupying the apartment even though he came from a famous family. His mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesGracie Mansion, built in 1799, is the official residence of the New York City mayorNot every mayor has chosen to live at Gracie Mansion.Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire entrepreneur and founder of the eponymous financial and media company, chose to live in his own townhouse on the Upper East Side neighbourhood of Manhattan during his three terms, which ended in 2012.Bloomberg said he believed Gracie Mansion should be a space for public city functions, and he pushed for an extensive renovation of the ageing property.When Mamdani moves in, sometime around his inauguration on 1 January, he will find himself in surroundings very different than his modest Astoria digs.With its butter yellow paint, green shutters, and white railings, Gracie Mansion is a wedding cake of a house overlooking the East River. Inside, the lower floor of the Federal-style mansion is decorated in the spirit of the home's original era.The compound, which reportedly has five bedrooms, also has enhanced security to protect the mayor and their family.Some residents have alleged that Gracie Mansion also has supernatural lodgers. Chirlane McCray, the wife of former mayor Bill De Blasio, told reporters that doors occasionally opened and closed by themselves, and the floorboards creaked eerily.Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams was more certain. \"I don't care what anyone says,\" he declared in 2022. \"There are ghosts in there, man.\"Mamdani's current apartment is rent stabilised, meaning the city sets limits on how much landlords can raise the rent each year. New Yorkers consider these apartments valuable lifelines as the cost of housing outpaces what many can afford.Records showed Mamdani paid about $2,300 (£1,725) each month for his apartment. According to the real estate platform Zillow, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is $3,500 (£2,625) a month.",

    "body": "7 hours agoThe Guardian leads with Sir Keir Starmer hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and senior European leaders at Downing Street, in what it calls \"a critical moment\" for the embattled country. The leaders are hoping to achieve a \"breakthrough\" by giving Ukraine \"access to billions of pounds of frozen Russian assets\", the paper writes. Sir Keir believes \"a deal to unlock £100bn for Ukraine\" could occur \"within days\" following the meeting at Number 10, the Times reports. The leaders of the UK, France, and Germany will push for the frozen Russian funds - currently sitting in European bank accounts - to be freed, an approach which faces opposition from Belgium over concerns it could be \"legally liable for a sum equal to a third of its annual GDP\".The Independent leads on Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper warning of \"escalating\" Russian cyber attacks. In a major speech today, Cooper will tell diplomats that there is an increased danger of \"hybrid threats\" - both physical and cyber - from hostile states, \"designed to weaken critical national infrastructure, undermine our interests and interfere in our democracies\". \"Paramount gatecrashes Netflix deal,\" is the lead for the Financial Times, which reports on the streaming giant's $108bn (£81bn) \"hostile bid\" for Warner Bros Discovery. It says Paramount is \"teaming up with Middle East sovereign wealth funds and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to derail Netflix's agreed deal\".\"Sir Keir Tiktoking rubbish!\" trumpets the Daily Star, which writes the prime minister has become \"the first PM to join TikTok despite huge fears over the Chinese app\". Experts warn policies of \"capping pension salary sacrifice schemes and slashing the tax-free limit for cash ISAs\" will \"delay UK retirement age\", the i Paper reports. Economists tell the paper the Budget policies could lead to \"threadbare private pension pots\" adding \"pressure on the state system\".The Daily Telegraph leads with claims that \"gangs offer free crossings to asylum seekers if they carry drugs across Channel\". The paper's investigation, which it has shared with the Home Office and National Crime Agency (NCA), suggests some groups offer \"VIP crossings\" for those willing to act as \"drug mules\" from northern France. Spokespeople for the NCA and Home Office both tell the paper they do not recognise the practice, while noting they are \"alive\" to drug threats.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch says there must be \"no stone unturned\" in a national inquiry into grooming gangs. The paper writes Badenoch will push for convicted offenders with dual nationality to be \"stripped of their citizenship and deported\".The Daily Mirror leads with the \"unbreakable bond\" forged between the parents of the Southport attack victims who are \"offering comfort in the face of impossible grief\". After sharing baby photos of Elsie Dot Stancombe, Alice da Silva Aguiar and Bebe King as part of a BBC documentary, the families say their friendship allows them \"to pull the light out\" of the darkness.\"The head of the Royal Navy unleashed an extraordinary broadside at [Chancellor] Rachel Reeves,\" the Daily Mail writes, accusing the government of failing to properly fund defence. The First Sea Lord Sir Gwyn Jenkins warns \"Russia is spending billions to control North Atlantic\", as the paper features its own campaign titled \"Don't leave Britain defenceless\".Metro leads with police adopting new e-bikes to \"take down gangs\" in London. Gangs ride on similar vehicles capable of reaching 60mph to steal \"bags, watches and phones\" from victims, the paper says. A number of Tuesday's papers carry photos of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with the Ukrainian, French and German leaders after their talks in Downing Street on Monday. The Times reports that a deal to release up to £100bn of frozen Russian assets in Europe - which could be used to help Ukraine with the war or with reconstruction - is only \"days\" away. The paper says the money is one of the few \"cards\" the Europeans have to use in negotiations with Washington.The Daily Telegraph reports that Donald Trump's peace deal could be \"on the brink of collapse\" because of President Volodymyr Zelensky's insistence that Ukraine has no obligation to cede territory to Russia. It says that Kyiv will send a Europe-backed counter proposal to the US president later on Tuesday.The Financial Times claims that former prime minister Sir Tony Blair is no longer being considered for Trump's so-called \"board of peace\" in Gaza after objections from Arab and Muslim states. The paper says the opposition is in part because of his support for the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. But a source close to Sir Tony has told the BBC that the board will be made up of \"serving world leaders\", so he does not qualify - but he will sit on a smaller, executive, committee.Migrants crossing the Channel in small boats are bringing heroin into Britain on behalf of people smugglers, according to an investigation carried out by the Telegraph. It says asylum seekers are being offered free or \"cut-price\" crossings from northern France if they swallow packets of Class A drugs and deliver them to organised criminal gangs. The paper says it's shared its findings with the Home Office.Most of the papers carry photos of the Queen visiting the studios in Bristol where the second series of the Disney+ hit Rivals is being filmed. Camilla was famously good friends with the late Dame Jilly Cooper, who wrote the book it's based on. The Mirror reports the Queen told the cast she \"binge-watched\" the first series while she was recovering from pneumonia. The Express says Dame Jilly herself had confirmed that the book's lothario, Rupert Campbell-Black, was inspired by her friend Andrew Parker-Bowles, the Queen's ex-husband.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "14 hours agoDaniela Relph,Senior royal correspondentandNoor Nanji,Culture reporterThe Duke of Sussex's access to security when he visits the UK is under review, sources have told the BBC.In May, Prince Harry lost a legal case to have his police protection reinstated when visiting the UK.In a BBC interview after the ruling, he said it was not safe to bring his family back to the country of his birth because he could not guarantee their safety.It is understood a Home Office review will now look at whether he should automatically receive full police protection on visits to the UK even though he is no longer a working member of the royal family.Sources close to the prince say this level of security review is long overdue. According to The Sun newspaper, the process for reassessing the duke's threat level is already under way and a decision is expected next month.King Charles has only met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children once before. He last saw his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.Prince Harry's security was downgraded after he stepped back from frontline royal duties in 2020 and moved to the US with the Duchess of Sussex.In his legal challenge earlier this year, he contested the decision-making process used by a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office.Ravec had concluded that because Prince Harry was going to be an infrequent visitor to the UK, his security needs would be assessed on a case by case basis.But in doing so, the duke's legal team argued that Ravec did not properly re-assess the threats he faced when considering his situation in 2020.His lawyers had argued that he had been \"singled out\" for \"inferior treatment\", but the court ruling upheld that there had been nothing unlawful about how the decision had been reached.A senior judge ruled that Prince Harry's \"sense of grievance\" over how the decision to alter his security was reached did not amount to a basis for a successful appeal.That decision meant the duke's security remained outside the automatic, high level of protection which is provided for senior royals.Speaking to BBC News in California shortly afterwards, Prince Harry said he was \"devastated\" at losing his appeal.He also said any prospect of a return to the UK for him and his family was \"impossible\" in light of the Court of Appeal ruling, adding: \"I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\"At the time, Buckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\"A government spokesperson said: \"The UK Government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate.\"It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesShoppers carry Target bags outside of Macy's flagship store on Black Friday in New York, US, on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025.Rachael Dunfell knew two things about her husband's 21-year-old cousin: that he liked specialised racing bikes and that he was interested in the Vikings.But those pieces of information yielded few ideas for a suitable Christmas gift. So Rachael, 33, from Manchester, turned to artificial intelligence.She inputted his age, his hobby and his interest into Copilot, the Microsoft-owned chatbot, which led her to the website of a niche retailer that sells Viking-themed metal bike parts.\"It's just something that I really would never have known existed,\" she said, \"but it was perfect.\"AI is shifting the holiday shopping experience. People are increasingly turning to AI tools, from Copilot to OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google's Gemini, for help with gift ideas and to compare prices, with implications for bargain hunters and retailers alike.John Harmon, a senior technology analyst at Coresight Research in New York, called this year the first holiday season shaped by AI-powered shopping.While there is not a great deal of data on spending directly linked to AI, Salesforce has said AI is expected to drive 21% of all holiday orders globally, for a total of $263bn (£197bn) in sales.More than half of US consumers say they would probably or definitely use AI to help with their shopping, a Coresight survey found.In the UK and Ireland, a survey of 2,000 consumers by technology company CI&T, released this month, found that 61% use or have used AI tools while shopping - most often to find where to buy an item or locate the best deal.But more than two-thirds of respondents could not think of an AI-powered retail experience that impressed them. Businesses are scrambling to make the most of AI channels to promote their products.\"Retailers feel the urgency because AI is already shaping what people buy,\" said Melanie Nuce-Hilton, senior vice president of customer success at GS1 US, an information standards organisation.\"If the product information the model learned from is outdated or inconsistent, the recommendation can miss the mark, and it's often small brands that lose visibility when that happens,\" she added.Rachael DunfellRachael Dunfell used ChatGPT to find a niche gift for her husband's 21-year-old cousinAI firms 'hold the cards'The technology is starting to move beyond using AI tools to help find a product on a retailer's website, to letting shoppers buy items without even leaving a chat-bot.OpenAI at the end of September announced an Instant Checkout feature. In the weeks since, the ChatGPT maker has announced partnerships with several major retailers and marketplaces to list some of their products directly on the chat service. Etsy and Shopify led the pack, followed by Walmart in October and Salesforce and Target in November.Walmart, for example, said its partnership with OpenAI \"allows customers and Sam's Club members to plan meals, restock essentials, or discover new products simply by chatting\".But at this stage, there are limitations for shoppers seeking to offload their holiday shopping entirely. Buying items without leaving AI chats is still a nascent phenomenon, only weeks in the making.And AI companies hold the cards, analysts said.Not every retailer is set up for direct purchases within ChatGPT, Mr Harmon said. Some have not yet received approval from OpenAI.\"It's OpenAI's game. They're in control of who is listed and how long it takes,\" he said.\"The smaller ones will be left out for the time being, until they're able to convert their data and get approved to have it listed on OpenAI.\"Analysts said retailers could draw in shoppers by prioritising partnerships with AI companies.The agreements have the potential to boost brand perception among consumers, said Yanliu Huang, a marketing professor at Drexel University. She noted the benefits for a company like Walmart, which is known for its low prices but is seeking to appeal to higher-educated and younger consumers, too.Ms Huang predicted that other large retailers like Costco, as well as smaller brands, are likely to follow suit.Burlap & Barrel, a spice company based in the US, sees AI-powered shopping as an opportunity to boost sales.Ori Zohar, the firm's co-founder and co-chief executive, acknowledged that the company is better positioned than many other small businesses in his sector to draw in shoppers, given its robust online presence.\"That ended up being really, really good content to feed into the AI models,\" Mr Zohar said. He attributed the company's recent growth, in part, to AI searches that led customers to its website.But Mr Zohar said Burlap & Barrel is not currently seeking direct partnerships with AI companies like OpenAI. Executives are instead focused on building out the company's own database of spices - information that AI tools can pick up and put on shoppers' radar.Ori ZoharOri Zohar, the co-founder of spice company Burlap & Barrel, said AI-powered shopping presents an opportunity to boost salesBenefits and risksAllan Binder, a teacher and sound engineer currently based in Hanoi, Vietnam, said he started using AI last year to brainstorm gift ideas for friends and family in the US.Having already used AI tools for research purposes, using them to find niche presents felt like a \"natural extension\", said Allan, 35, originally from Detroit, Michigan. Among his AI-powered discoveries: scissors from an artisan manufacturer in England and pottery from Indonesia, a birthday gift for his mother last summer. This holiday gifting season, his AI searches have led him to historic prints.\"[Chatbots] have the potential to connect very targeted products with their audience,\" he said.But he acknowledged the risks of offloading shopping to AI agents, especially for those who undertake less research on their own to supplement AI-generated results.\"I think AI shopping will help informed consumers become more informed,\" he said, \"while making it easier for uninformed consumers to buy without much thought.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterWarner Bros DiscoveryNetflix and Paramount are fighting to buy Warner Bros, including HBO, home of hits such as White LotusThe fight in Hollywood to buy Warner Bros Discovery is shaping up to be a blockbuster. Paramount Skydance, backed by the billionaire Ellison family, has been wooing Warner Bros for months, hoping to join forces with the storied Hollywood name as the media company struggles to compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney. So far, Warner Bros has spurned its proposals. Then it announced a deal to sell the most valuable parts of its business - its studio and streaming divisions - to Netflix instead. Undeterred, Paramount chief executive David Ellison launched a hostile takeover bid, making his suit directly to shareholders.What is a hostile takeover bid?In corporate deals, a hostile takeover is when a company moves to acquire another firm without the consent of the target company's management, typically by offering to buy its target's shares. It differs from a friendly takeover - one that is mutually agreed upon by the boards of directors and shareholders at both companies.What do we know about the two bids?Netflix's proposal includes Warner Bros' studio and streaming networks, leaving the rest of the company to be spun off as an independent company. Its offer values those holdings which include brands such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema, and HBO Max, at $82.7bn, including debt. Netflix is offering to pay $23.25 per share, and give existing Warner Bros a stake in the new company - a mix of cash and equity it says is worth about $27.75 per share. Paramount, by contrast, says it wants control of the entire company, including the firm's traditional pay-TV networks, which are seen as a declining business. Its deal values the entire company at $108.4bn.Paramount is proposing to pay $30 per share, in an all-cash offer, which it says gives shareholders more certainty than Netflix's plan.In both cases, the target completion date is many months away. Why do Paramount and Netflix want Warner Bros?Warner Bros, which traces its roots back about a century, has a vast library of content, ranging from classics like Looney Tunes and Casablanca to Friends, Superman and Harry Potter. Its HBO division is known for \"prestige\" television, including The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Succession. But the storied firm has been under pressure as online streaming has disrupted film and television industries. For Netflix, the streaming industry's biggest player with more than 300 million customers, buying the film and streaming division would bolster its movie offerings, while heading off any potential rivals looking to get their hands on the Warner Bros content. Paramount, by contrast, is looking for a partner that will give it the scale to compete against industry giants such as Netflix and Disney. A takeover would build on Mr Ellison's purchase of Paramount, which he folded into his Skydance film studio over the summer.On the streaming side, he is looking to add HBO Max's roughly 120 million streaming customers to Paramount's 79 million. Analysts say a tie-up could offer benefits to the struggling traditional pay TV networks as well, giving them greater clout in business negotiations and presenting opportunities for cost savings.Paramount's traditional networks include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central, while Warner Bros would bring CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings. Who is likely to win?Both deals raise competition concerns and are expected to face scrutiny from regulators in the US and Europe. Netflix's plan has drawn warnings that it would give the dominant streaming player even more power over actors and screenwriters, while putting further pressure on local cinemas. But a combined Paramount-Warner Bros would also leave it in control of a significant slice of sports and children's entertainment, raising potential concern for advertisers and local television distributors. Paramount's plans, which would put CBS and CNN under the same parent company, have also been closely watched because of the potential impact on the news business and the Ellisons' ties to Trump.Analysts said approval would likely hinge on how broadly regulators decide to define the market, and whether players like YouTube are considered part of the competition.Netflix is relatively new to deal-making.Some have also suggested that Paramount could be in a stronger position thanks to the relationship between Trump and the Ellison family, including tech billionaire and Republican megadonor Larry Ellison. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is also one of Paramount's financial partners. But Trump himself has offered little certainty about his views.Though he has praised the Ellisons in the past, on social media on Monday, he took aim at their ownership of Paramount, triggered by a 60 Minutes interview that the company aired with former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative.Previously, he had noted potential concerns about Netflix's tie-up, given the size of the company, while also praising the streamer's bosses. How could the deal affect consumers?It's not clear. Neither Netflix nor Paramount have offered much insight into how they would incorporate Warner Bros into their current offerings or seize the opportunity to launch new kinds of streaming packages.  When it comes to prices, boosting Netflix's offerings could allow it to charge customers more. But if viewers find they are paying for one streaming service rather than two, it could cost them less.More than 70% of HBO Max customers in the US also subscribe to Netflix, according to analysts at Raymond James.

    "body": "11 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterWarner Brothers DiscoveryWarner Brothers Discovery is owner of HBO, known for shows like Sex and the City Paramount Skydance has made another offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery as it seeks to trump a rival plan from Netflix to buy the company's studio and streaming networks. Paramount, which is backed by the billionaire Ellison family, said it was making a direct offer to shareholders of $30 (£22.50) per share to scoop up the whole of Warner Bros, including its traditional television networks.It said its proposal was a \"superior alternative\" to Netflix's, delivering more cash upfront to shareholders and greater prospect of approval by regulators. President Donald Trump has said \"there could be a problem\" with Netflix's purchase, pointing to competition concerns given the size of the companies. Paramount is a smaller player than Netflix that is known for brands such as CBS News, Nickelodeon and Mission Impossible. It started submitting offers a few months ago, eventually prompting Warner Bros, owner of HBO and classics from Looney Tunes to Harry Potter, to formally open a bidding process. Wall Street analysts have long said they believe a Paramount-Warner Bros combination makes sense, because it would give the company the scale to compete against rivals such as Netflix and Disney. Paramount was also seen as a strong suitor because the relationship between Trump and the Ellison family, including tech billionaire and Republican megadonor Larry Ellison, was expected to help ease the approval process. But Warner Bros declared Netflix the winner of the auction on Friday, announcing a deal that valued its studio and streaming networks, including HBO, at about $83bn (£62.3bn), including its debt.It said the sale would proceed after a planned spin-off of other parts of Warner Brothers' business, including CNN, into an independent company.Paramount's offer values the entire company at $108.4bn, which it said was a better deal. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is among the financial partners Paramount is working with as part of the deal, according to paperwork submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Netflix executives on Monday expressed confidence in their plans, dismissing Paramount's attempt as \"entirely expected\". Warner Bros said it would review the offer but was not currently changing its recommendation. It said it would respond within 10 business days. Watch: Trump says he will be \"involved\" in the Warner Brothers merger decisionEither takeover is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.Analysts said Netflix's plan would likely raise concerns about dominance in streaming, while Paramount's proposal would prompt a review of the impact on advertisers and local television distributors, given the power of a combined company over sports and children's networks.Paramount's plans, which would put CBS and CNN under the same parent company, have also been closely watched because of the potential impact on the news business and the Ellisons' ties to Trump.The president said over the weekend he expected to be involved in the approval process. But he has offered little certainty about his views.While noting potential concerns about Netflix's tie-up on Sunday, he also praised the streamer's bosses. Meanwhile on social media on Monday, he took aim at Paramount for a 60 Minutes interview that it aired with former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative.In an interview with CNBC, Paramount chief executive David Ellison said he had had \"great conversations\" with Trump about the deal, while noting that he did not want to speak for the president. Netflix is the biggest streaming company in the world, with more than 300 million subscribers. Mr Ellison's plan would build on his purchase earlier this year of Paramount, which he folded into his Skydance film studio. \"Paramount ultimately needs this deal more than Netflix,\" said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, calling the Warner Bros assets simply \"nice to have\" for the streamer.Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr Ellison talked up the benefits of his plan for the entire media industry, arguing that Netflix's takeover of Warner Brothers Discovery would give one firm too much power over actors and other players in the industry.\"It's a horrible deal for Hollywood,\" he said.He also said he thought Warner Bros' plan to spin-off its traditional networks into an independent company would set them up to fail and ultimately prove a mistake for shareholders.\"I think [its shares are] going to be worth a lot less than people are claiming,\" he said. But Netflix executives, who spoke at a business conference on Monday, said they were confident their takeover could win approval, noting that their plan does not include plans for major cuts.Shares in Warner Bros rose more than 4% on Monday while Paramount shares jumped 9%.Shares in Netflix, however, dropped more than 3%.",

    "body": "2 hours agoReutersWhile peace talks continue, so does fighting along the front line in eastern UkraineUkraine is preparing to present a revised peace plan to the White House, as it seeks to avoid making territorial concessions to Russia.Kyiv is set to propose alternatives to the US after President Volodymyr Zelensky again ruled out surrendering land, saying he had \"no right\" to do so under Ukrainian or international law.He made the comments as he met European and Nato leaders on Monday, part of a collective push to deter the US from backing a peace deal which includes major concessions for Ukraine, and which allies fear would leave it vulnerable to a future invasion.Meanwhile, the city of Sumy in north-western Ukraine was left without power overnight after a Russian drone attack.The region's governor said more than a dozen drones had hit power infrastructure, the latest in Russia's nightly attacks. No deaths were reported.Zelensky's ongoing diplomatic tour of Europe comes after days of intensive talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators over the weekend, that failed to produce a deal Kyiv could agree to.Zelensky was due to be briefed on that private summit on Monday by his chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, who wrote on Telegram that he would feed back details of direct talks between the US and Russian President Vladimir Putin.The Ukrainian president told a news conference that his team could send a new proposal to the Americans as soon as Tuesday, AFP news agency reported.On the subject of surrendering land, Zelensky said: \"Russia is insisting that we give up territories, but we don't want to cede anything.\"He continued: \"We have no legal right to do so, under Ukrainian law, our constitution and international law. And we don't have any moral right either.\"Zelensky has long maintained that any changes to Ukraine's borders would need to be authorised by a public referendum.Elsewhere, he told reporters that the initial 28-point plan proposed by the US - and rejected by Kyiv and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia - had been cut down to 20 points, according to Interfax-Ukraine news agency.He said no \"pro-Ukrainian\" points had been removed from the draft, though there had also been no \"compromise\" on the subject of territory. Zelensky singled out control of the eastern Donbas region and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as being among the \"most sensitive\" issues.The original leaked version of the US-backed plan proposed that Ukraine hand over total control of the Donbas to Russia, despite the fact that Kremlin forces have been unable to capture it in full after almost four years of war.Energy produced at Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, would be split between Russia and Ukraine, the draft plan said.Leaders in Kyiv and across Europe have indicated there has been progress in refining that draft in recent weeks, and have praised the Trump administration for seeking to mediate an end to the fighting.But Monday's hastily arranged Downing Street summit - attended by Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz - was widely viewed as a show of support for Ukraine as it seeks to resist White House pressure.No 10 said there had been an agreement that the US-led talks represented a \"critical moment\" to ramp up support for Ukraine, and repeated calls for a \"just and lasting peace... which includes robust security guarantees\".EPAThe nature of those future security guarantees are another open question in the negotiations. Efforts continue to assemble an international coalition prepared to offer ongoing military support to Kyiv in the event of a peace deal, though it is not yet clear what form that would take.While the UK and France have proposed deploying international troops in Ukraine, several key defence players in Europe, including Germany and Italy, have expressed scepticism about that idea. It is also not clear to what extent the US would be willing to underpin any future defence arrangements for Ukraine. Following talks in London, Zelensky flew to Brussels to meet Nato chief Mark Rutte and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, and will meet Prime Minister Georgia Meloni in Italy on Tuesday.Moscow has also claimed talks with the White House have been constructive, despite little public indication it has moved on any of the goals set out by the Kremlin when it launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.On Sunday, Trump indicated that he viewed Zelensky as the main obstacle to securing a peace deal, something he has made a key foreign policy goal and which the president claimed he would be able to achieve rapidly during the 2024 presidential election campaign.He told reporters that Russia was \"fine\" with the peace plan outlined to both sides by the US, but that he was a \"little disappointed that Zelensky hasn't read it\". Almost simultaneously, Zelensky said he was waiting to briefed by Umerov following three days of discussions with his US counterparts in Miami.\"Some issues can only be discussed in person,\" said Zelensky.",

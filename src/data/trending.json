    "body": "Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy, has died aged 35.Her family announced her death in a social media post shared by the John F Kennedy Library Foundation, writing: \"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts.\"In November, Schlossberg, a climate journalist, announced her diagnosis of an aggressive form of cancer. She said in an essay that she had been given less than a year to live.Schlossberg was the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, and is survived by her husband George Moran and their two children, three-year-old Edwin and one-year-old Josephine.In an article published last month in The New Yorker titled, \"A Battle With My Blood,\" Schlossberg revealed she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in May 2024, after giving birth to her second child.\"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me,\" she wrote.Schlossberg described the treatments she received, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, but shared that doctors did not give her a good prognosis.She also wrote of the pain she feared her passing would cause for her family, which has endured multiple personal tragedies. Her grandfather, President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963 and her uncle, John F Kennedy Jr, died in a plane crash in 1999. Her younger brother, Jack Schlossberg, is running for Congress in New York.\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" Schlossberg wrote.\"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she said.In her essay, Schlossberg also expressed disappointment in her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Another relative, Maria Shriver, a journalist and the former first lady of California, paid tribute to her \"sweet, beloved Tatiana\" as someone who \"loved her life\".\"She created a beautiful life with her extraordinary husband George, and children Eddie and Josie. She fought like a warrior. She was valiant, strong, courageous.\"\"Tatiana was a great journalist, and she used her words to educate others about the earth and how to save it\", Shriver wrote on Instagram.Before her widely-read essay about her diagnosis, Schlossberg forged a successful career as a climate journalist.Schlossberg authored the book \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have\". She also wrote about climate and other beats for the New York Times.In December 2021, she reported on local experiments to harness the energy of the London Underground to provide heat to homes, in an effort to fight climate change.\"I think climate change is the biggest story in the world, and it's a story about everything,\" she told NBC News in 2019. \"It's about science and nature, but it's also about politics and health and business. To me, looking at this as a journalist, it seemed like a really important story to tell.\"\"And if I could help communicate about it, that might inspire other people to get involved and work on the issue,\" she said.",

    "body": "11 hours agoTabby WilsonWatch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuA train driver has died and at least 40 people have been injured in a head-on rail collision near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Two trains collided on the single track leading to the ancient Inca town on Tuesday, according to a statement from the local government. It said that 20 ambulances had attended the scene and that injured people had been transferred to medical facilities in the nearby city of Cusco.The US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured in the crash, but police have yet to confirm the identities of anyone involved in the incident.Getty ImagesOne of the two trains affected in the collisionLocal media outlet Peru21 reports that \"hundreds\" of tourists remain at the scene awaiting evacuation, which has been \"hampered\" by difficult terrain around the crash site.At least 20 of the injured are in a serious condition, a health official told the Reuters news agency. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes. The two trains involved in the accident were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident. The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear. The crash comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process. The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative due to its limited accessibility. Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World. Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the the Inca trail with a registered tour operator. In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about overtourism.",

    "body": "Gold and silver have seen a rollercoaster end to a year in which their prices are on track to record their biggest annual gains since 1979.The price of gold soared by more than 60% this year to hit a record high of more than $4,549 (£3,378) an ounce before falling after Christmas to stand at about $4,330 on New Year's Eve.At the same time, silver was trading at about $71 an ounce after hitting an all-time high of $83.62 on Monday.This year's gains were driven by several factors including expectations of more interest rate cuts, but experts warned sharp increases over the year could lead to a drop in gold and silver prices in 2026.\"Gold and silver prices are experiencing a notable rise due to the interplay of several economic, investment, and geopolitical factors,\" said Rania Gule from trading platform XS.com.The main driver of the price rises of precious metals, she added, are expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in 2026. Prices of gold and silver were also buoyed by gold purchases by central banks and investors buying so-called \"safe haven\" assets due to concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investment platform AJ Bell, said soaring gold and silver prices had been driven by investors \"latching onto precious metals in response to concerns over inflation\" as well as volatile stock markets.\"The market backdrop looks unchanged as we move into 2026,\" he added.Mr Coatsworth said high government debt in the UK and US, as well as Donald Trump's tariffs and nerves over a potential AI bubble, would encourage investors to \"stay bullish on gold and silver\".But he warned sharp gains for the assets in 2025 make them vulnerable to a sharp pullback next year.He said: \"If financial markets go through a difficult patch, investors looking to liquidate positions might first reach for assets that have delivered strong gains in the past year or so, or ones that are easy to sell. Gold ticks both boxes.\"Ms Gule said she expects gold to continue to rise in 2026 but \"at a more stable pace compared to the record highs observed in 2025\".Also this year, central banks around the world added hundreds of tons of gold to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council trade association.Daniel Takieddine, co-founder of investment firm Sky Links Capital Group, points to \"supply tightness and industrial demand\" for helping to push up the price of silver.China, which is the world's second biggest producer of silver, has said it would restrict the export of the precious metal.In October, China's Ministry of Commerce announced new restrictions on exports of silver as well as the metals tungsten and antimony to \"to step up the protection of resources and the environment\".Responding to a post on social media about Chinese government restrictions on silver exports, Tesla boss Elon Musk said: \"This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes.\"Mr Takieddine also highlighted the large amounts of money that have flowed into the precious metals market through investments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).ETFs are baskets of investments that trade on a stock exchange like a single stock. They can be seen as a convenient way to trade precious metals as investors do not have to take possession of physical bullion.Silver also has the potential to rise again in the coming year, said Mr Takieddine. But he warns \"rallies may be followed by sharper corrections.\"",

Five further books followed, and the TV version soon created a stir after launching in North America in late November. The show, which is adapted and directed by Jacob Tierney, is set to launch in the UK on 10 January on Sky and streaming service Now.Speaking to Variety, Reid said an \"amazing thing\" had come out of the attention the show has received.\"Jacob was on CNN a few weeks ago. For whatever reason, the interviewer asked him about my Parkinson's diagnosis,\" she recalled.\"I thought it was kind of odd, but then the next day, one of the top Parkinson's experts in the world reached out to me and asked if he could help me.\"Reid explained: \"I've never gotten to talk to a Parkinson's expert. I've been on a five-year waiting list here because I live in a very small place.\"Now he's found me a Parkinson's expert, a neurologist, and I have an appointment in a couple weeks. \"That could change things for me because I'm not really getting the treatment that I should be getting.\"He also told me how to change my medication so I can sleep because I never slept. That change made me sleep through the night, which really helps with writing.\"SkyHeated Rivalrly has been a huge hit internationally, and is due to launch in the UK in JanuaryReid said her Parkinson's made it hard for her to write \"because I can barely control a mouse\".\"I can't type for very long,\" she continued. \"It's hard for me to sit in a chair for very long. I need to figure out new ways to write.\"I don't know if that will be voice-to-text. I don't know if I can write that way. It doesn't feel natural, but I need to figure out something because it is taking me a very long time to write now.\"Heated Rivalry follows rival hockey players Shane and Ilya, played by Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie.The pair are bound by rivalry and ambition, but begin a secret affair which evolves into a years-long relationship.What is Parkinson's disease?Parkinson's is a progressive condition that worsens over time.Those with the disease have too little of the chemical dopamine in their brain because some of the nerve cells that make it have stopped working.Symptoms include:involuntary shaking of parts of the bodyslow movementstiff and inflexible musclesSource: Parkinson's UK",

A very hard time,\" he told BBC News during rehearsals at London's Riverside Studios. \"Especially when you reflect on a tough year.\"So you want to look at, maybe, optimism into 2026,\" said the Boyzone singer, explaining his aims for the show.\"I hope that I can bring some sort of joy to people, so they feel like they're not at home alone tonight, that I'm right there with them.\"As one of his best known solo songs puts it, Ronan Keating wants to end 2025 by putting a \"smile on your face\".BBC Studios/Andy HeathcoteName in lights.

The people who have gone before me. Ridiculous. And here I am, little old me. Be careful what you wish for.\"He says this while standing in front of a giant R-O-N-A-N, made up of Elvis '68 Comeback-style golden lights. \"My head is swelling constantly,\" he jokes.It turns out, he has been wondering where the display will end up after the concert.\"In my bedroom?\" he suggests mischievously. \"That would be amazing.\"Getty ImagesKeating's former flatmate Louise (second right) with her Eternal bandmates in 1994 (L-R: Easther Bennett, Kéllé Bryan and Vernie Bennett)These annual New Year's Eve shows have become renowned for their guest appearances.

Keating has enlisted the help of an old flatmate, Louise, with whom he shared digs during the early days of her group Eternal.\"Lou and I and Shano [his nickname for Boyzone's Shane Lynch], we were flatmates back in 1995, right next door to Ant & Dec in London,\" he reminisces.  \"It was a poptastic house.

It was very cute.\"So who took longer in the bathroom, him or Louise? \"Shano,\" he answers without missing a beat. \"Plucking his eyebrow!\"BBC/Jack Barnes/Kieron McCarronShona McGarty was in EastEnders for 16 years playing Whitney Dean. Tonight she is more Whitney HoustonAnother special guest is the former EastEnders star and finalist in this year's I'm A Celebrity, Shona McGarty. \"What a voice,\" enthuses Keating. \"She was singing every night on the show and I just thought, man, we've got to get her on New Year's Eve. That was her audition.\"Tonight, there  will be no rendition of her campsite creation Feeling Good in the Jungle. Instead she will be duetting on the Tracy Chapman song that Boyzone took to number two in the charts, Baby Can I Hold You.

The phone hasn't stopped ringing. And yes, I have received more Christmas cards this year than I normally do,\" he chortles.Resolutions? He's saying nothing at allOne thing Keating will not be doing is making any New Year's resolutions. \"If I've got to make changes, I make them now. I won't wait till a certain date, because I'll only fail.\" He pauses, suddenly looking more wistful. \"Really for me it's about spending more time with loved ones; family and friends. It's been a tough couple of years. We lost my brother,\" he explains.In July 2023, his elder brother Ciaran was killed in a car crash at the age of 57, while travelling to watch his son Ruairí play for Cork City Football Club.\"Now, keeping the family together is more important than ever for me,\" he emphasises.It suddenly becomes clear that Keating was also talking about himself when explaining how difficult people can find new year. Tonight he too will use music as part of his own healing process, by singing the soundtrack to his more than 30-year career, a period over which he has made the journey from Boyzone to family man.Ronan and Friends: A New Year's Eve Party is on BBC One and iPlayer from 23:30 GMT except in Scotland where the Hogmanay show will feature music from sea shanty singer Nathan Evans, Michelle McManus and the award-winning folk supergroup Mànran.

Since then the team has been testing its systems from their mission control in Cardiff.Veronica Viera, the company's payload operations lead, shows us an image that the satellite beamed back from space.It's taken from the inside of the furnace, and shows plasma -  gas heated to about 1,000C - glowing brightly.She told us seeing the image was \"one of the most exciting moments of my life\".\"This is so important because it's one of the core ingredients that we need for our in-space manufacturing process,\" she explains.  \"So being able to demonstrate this is amazing.\"Space ForgeThe heat shield will need to be tested to see if it can safely return the materials The team is now planning to build a bigger space factory - one that could make semiconductor material for 10,000 chips.They also need to test the technology to bring the material back to Earth.On a future mission, a heat shield named Pridwen after the legendary shield of King Arthur will be deployed to protect the spacecraft from the intense temperatures it will experience as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.Other companies are also looking skywards -  to make everything from pharmaceuticals to artificial tissues.\"In-space manufacturing is something that is happening now,\" says Libby Jackson, head of space at the Science Museum.\"It's the early days and they're still showing this in small numbers at the moment.\"But by proving the technology it really opens the door for an economically viable product,  where things can be made in space and return to Earth and have use and benefit to everybody on Earth. And that's really exciting.\"",

National Rail said several routes had been affected following the theft between Doncaster and Sheffield, which it first reported shortly before 05:30 GMT on Wednesday. After initially saying the disruption was expected to last until mid-morning, National Rail later said passengers were likely to face problems all day. Services run by Northern, including local services in South Yorkshire and trains running from Doncaster to Hull and Scarborough, are among those affected.CrossCountry services between Edinburgh and Birmingham New Street, which call at Sheffield, Wakefield, Leeds and York, have also been affected.TransPennine Express services running between Liverpool Lime Street and Cleethorpes, which call at Doncaster, have been hit as well.'Delayed or revised'A spokesperson for Northern said services were able to run between Doncaster and Swinton again from about 09:30 GMT onwards, although they warned that \"fewer trains will be able to operate along this route while this issue continues\". They also said that trains between Sheffield and Doncaster/Adwick \"may be delayed or revised\". \"Northern train ticket restrictions have been lifted in the affected areas, including advance and peak restrictions, during this disruption,\" they added.A National Rail spokesperson said: \"Theft of signalling cables between Doncaster and Sheffield means trains must run at a reduced speed on all lines. \"As a result, services operating between Doncaster and Sheffield may be cancelled, delayed by up to 25 minutes, revised or diverted.\"Disruption is expected until the end of the day.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoAleem MaqboolReligion editorBBCAs incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally says she has received many letters of support\"One of the wonderful things over the last couple of months is I've had hundreds and hundreds of letters of support,\" says the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury.Dame Sarah Mullally - who will be the first woman to hold the position - says many of the letters she has received have been from women, who talk of the way her nomination to lead the Church of England has had an impact on them.\"I had a wonderful letter from an ordained woman who said the announcement of my appointment was the first time that she felt affirmed as a priest,\" she told BBC Radio 4.Dame Sarah was in conversation with former Prime Minister Theresa May, guest editor of the Today Programme for New Year's Eve.There had been \"difficult moments\" in the Church as a woman, Dame Sarah acknowledged, just as she experienced in the NHS and in government - in her position as chief nursing officer for England.A ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral in January will see her election confirmed, and in March she will be formally installed as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at Canterbury Cathedral.There is some opposition not just to a woman leading the Church, but to women becoming priests at all in the wider Anglican Communion, both in the UK and abroad.Dame Sarah told Theresa May her approach has always been to encourage clergy in their ministries, even if they were theologically opposed to the ordination of women.\"I believe that, for this time particularly, we do need leaders who are collegiate, who are collaborative,\" she said, adding that part of her preparation for her new role was to listen.Dame Sarah Mullally (r) spoke to former Prime Minister Theresa MayThe Church should take a similar listening approach to divisions in wider British society, she said, particularly around immigration and identity.\"People do feel insecure, their identity has been challenged and we shouldn't ignore that, but churches, I think, have the opportunity to listen to that,\" said the incoming archbishop.\"Churches are [also] very good at trying to create that sort of interfaith conversation in the community.\"Dame Sarah has long-voiced strong opposition to any legalisation of assisted dying - and remained unequivocal on the issue during her Radio 4 interview.Her view is informed by sitting alongside \"many people who have died\", in her roles as both a nurse and a priest, said Dame Sarah - who has had a seat in the House of Lords since becoming Bishop of London in 2018.Amendments to proposed legislation are currently being considered - but Dame Sarah told Theresa May that nothing would make the bill safe enough to \"protect the most vulnerable in our society\".\"Those who support the bill talk about choice. I'm not sure we have choice - we don't properly fund palliative care, we don't properly fund palliative-care research,\" she said.\"I'm worried that people may make a decision for assisted dying because they're not having the right palliative care or the right social care.\"While her fellow senior bishops in the House of Lords appear united in having a similar outlook, recent polls suggest that view is out of kilter with the majority of the British public who support assisted dying in some circumstances. A survey commissioned by one lobby group in favour of such a move suggests 69% of Christians support a change in the law. What's happening with the assisted dying bill?Baroness May went on to ask about safeguarding in the Church of England, and Dame Sarah said \"we are truly sorry\" for the \"significant safeguarding failures\" within the institution.\"Reaching out to the marginalised, the vulnerable, being safe, is at the heart of what I believe in terms of my Christian faith,\" said the incoming archbishop.Baroness May asked Dame Sarah about safeguarding in the Church of EnglandIt was Theresa May who announced the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), while she was home secretary in 2014. The seven-year inquiry was highly critical of the Church of England in its findings.The previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, stood down a year ago after being accused of failing to follow up information about abuse. The Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, has been interim Church leader since, but he too has faced questions over his handling of an abuse case.The Church is now considering a complaint against the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury over her handling of an abuse allegation during her tenure as Bishop of London.In her Radio 4 interview, Dame Sarah said progress had been made on safeguarding in the past decade - she also spoke of her support for the future introduction of some independence into Church safeguarding procedures.\"I think that we still have to work to restore trust in us and I think that [independent safeguarding professionals] would be a significant step.\"",

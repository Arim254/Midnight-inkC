Because I have to go out for a meeting,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000).</p><p>The scientists' work is about how molecules can be built together into structures - or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The Nobel committee called it \"molecular architecture\".</p><p>The men worked out how to build constructions with large spaces between the molecules, through which gases and other chemicals can flow. </p><p>These \"rooms\" can be used to capture and store chemicals that humans want to get rid of, including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or so-called forever chemicals, also known as PFAS.</p><p>The scientists began working independently on the structures in the 1970s and 1980s. Prof Robson asked his university to drill holes into the lab worktops so that wooden balls - representing atoms - could be attached to wooden rods, representing chemical bonds.</p><p>So far MOFs have only been used on a small-scale, but companies are looking into whether they can be mass-produced.</p><p>One potential application is to break down harmful gases, including those used in nuclear weapons. </p><p>Companies are also testing whether they can be used to capture the planet-warming gas carbon dioxide from power stations and factories.</p><p>\"Together, [the winners] have helped lay the foundations of and set the direction for one of the fastest-growing areas of fundamental research in modern chemistry,\" said Professor Sheila Rowan, vice-president of the Royal Society, Britain's national scientific academy.</p><p>The award is another indicator of the value of chemistry in addressing some of the planet's hardest problems.</p><p>\"Every year we see Nobel Prizes given to chemists who welcome the challenge of finding solutions to the biggest problems our global society faces – better healthcare, environmental protection, clean energy, and secure food and water for everyone,\" said Dr Annette Doherty, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry in Britain.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/abbc/live/ef1b9380-a431-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/abbc/live/ef1b9380-a431-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abbc/live/ef1b9380-a431-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/abbc/live/ef1b9380-a431-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/abbc/live/ef1b9380-a431-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/abbc/live/ef1b9380-a431-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/abbc/live/ef1b9380-a431-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abbc/live/ef1b9380-a431-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Three members of the Nobel committee hold a model of metal-organic frameworks, which is an orange, pink and yellow structure.\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Members of the Nobel committee hold a model of a metal-organic framework</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>Professor Kitagawa works at Kyoto University in Japan, Professor Richard Robson is at University of Melbourne, Australia, and Professor Omar M Yaghi is at the University of California, US.</p><p>Professor Kitagawa was motivated by the principle of \"the usefulness of useless\", according to the Nobel committee.

He has until Wednesday evening to come up with a plan for the \"stability of the country\" and has held talks with several political parties.</p><p>Like his predecessors, Lecornu was unable to push through a budget to bring down the government's deficit and tackle public debt.</p><p>Ahead of a second day of talks, Lecornu said he had detected a \"willingness to have a budget for France before 31 December\".</p></div><div><p>\"And this willingness creates movement and convergence, obviously, which makes the prospect of dissolution [of parliament] more remote,\" he said in a statement in the courtyard of his Paris residence at the Hôtel Matignon.</p><p>The outgoing prime minister then began talks with Socialist leaders. He is due to go on French TV at 20:00 local time (18:00 GMT) to give details of whether he had found a solution. </p><p>His best hope appears to be some kind of political pact to prevent any new government being thrown out in a confidence vote.</p><p>Commentators and officials said Lecornu's TV appearance meant it was unlikely  President Emmanuel Macron would himself give an address.</p><p>Lecornu's shock resignation on Monday left France in renewed political turmoil, 18 months before the end of Macron's second term in office. Macron's decision to call snap elections in mid-2024 left France with a hung parliament and a succession of minority governments.</p><p>Lecornu was in the job for only 26 days before his government fell apart, triggered by criticism from the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau.</p></div><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0kn04453z8o\">Time may be running out for master of clocks Macron: What next for France?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c749k11vnzgo\">Yet another French PM resigns, spelling yet more trouble for Macron</a></li></ul></div><div><p>Macron then gave the outgoing prime minister 48 hours to find a way out of the crisis.</p><p>After talks with Lecornu on Wednesday, Socialist leader Olivier Faure appeared to rule out any chance of his centre-left party joining the next government.</p><p>\"The budget plan, the way it was presented today, is a budget plan that we cannot be part of... and a joint government with Macron's [allies] is unimaginable,\" he told reporters.</p><p>That does not mean the Socialists would try to bring down a new government, which the hard-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen and radical left would be likely to try. Le Pen, whose party leads in the polls, has called on Macron to \"seriously consider\" dissolving parliament and holding new parliamentary elections.</p></div><div><p>Overnight there were suggestions that Lecornu could secure centre-left support if the government suspended highly contested pension reforms that raised the retirement age from 62 to 64. However, outgoing Finance Minister Roland Lescure warned that would cost France hundreds of millions of euros this year, and billions more in 2026, when the country is trying to cut its budget deficit.</p><p>France's public debt earlier this year was almost 114% of economic output (GDP), and this year's budget deficit is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.</p><p>Without Socialist involvement in the next government, Lecornu's best hope is to cobble together a revitalised centrist cabinet with the Republicans - known as the <i>socle commun</i> - or common platform.</p><p>The Republicans have so far made clear they will not join a left-led government, but their return to government with the Macronists is not definite either.</p><p>National Assembly President Yaël Braun-Pivet, who met Macron on Tuesday, told French radio they had not discussed dissolving parliament and she did not see it as a good idea: \"Above all it wouldn't resolve a great deal.\"</p><p>Braun-Privet later warned that if a budget deal was not agreed in the coming days, France would face \"very serious consequences\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ea79/live/8b3ef4b0-a43b-11f0-b5e5-3d5590257ca4.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ea79/live/8b3ef4b0-a43b-11f0-b5e5-3d5590257ca4.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ea79/live/8b3ef4b0-a43b-11f0-b5e5-3d5590257ca4.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ea79/live/8b3ef4b0-a43b-11f0-b5e5-3d5590257ca4.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ea79/live/8b3ef4b0-a43b-11f0-b5e5-3d5590257ca4.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ea79/live/8b3ef4b0-a43b-11f0-b5e5-3d5590257ca4.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ea79/live/8b3ef4b0-a43b-11f0-b5e5-3d5590257ca4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ea79/live/8b3ef4b0-a43b-11f0-b5e5-3d5590257ca4.jpg.webp\" alt=\"THOMAS SAMSON/AFP A woman with blonde hair and a black jacket talks into a microphone\" /><span>THOMAS SAMSON/AFP</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>National Assembly President Yaël Braun-Pivet said that Macron had not brought up new elections in conversation with her</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Lecornu said in his statement that reducing France's budget deficit below 5% of national economic output (GDP) was crucial, and that based on his conversations so far there was a willingness to have a budget by the end of the year.</p><p>\"Reducing our [budget] deficit is key, including for the credibility of France's signature abroad, and quite simply our ability to borrow, and therefore the impact also on interest rates.

The Welsh Conservatives have said they will replicate the cut if they win power in May's elections.</p></div><div><p>In her conference speech, Badenoch claimed the Conservative Party was \"fizzing with ideas\" to fix the \"broken model\" she said was holding the country back.</p><p>She pledged to scrap a string of government policies - from new employment rights to VAT on private school fees.</p><p>And she ran through some of the big policy announcements the party has made this week, including:</p><ul><li>Scrapping business rates to boost high streets</li><li>Axing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce32r5k43vwo\">carbon tax on electricity</a> </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8wgnz1r3xo\">Trebling police stop and search </a>in crime hotspots</li><li>Closing down \"rip off\" university courses and boosting apprenticeships.</li></ul><p>Her promise to end the \"family farm tax\" got a big cheer in the hall, and her proposals to slash welfare spending and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1mxy2j2elro\">take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights</a> also went down well.</p><p>In a sustained attack on the Labour government, she said: \"All they have delivered is a doom loop of higher taxes, weaker borders, and month after month of chaos.</p><p>\"They had a plan to win, but no plan for power.</p><p>\"No vision for Britain. They know how to make promises, but not how to deliver them.\"</p><p>Acknowledging the Conservatives' dire opinion poll ratings and recent local election losses, she said voters were \"still angry\" with her party.</p><p>And in a swipe at Reform, she said this had led to \"parties that in normal times would never be seen as a serious option for government are gaining ground, making promises they will never be able to keep\".</p><p>But the speech was chiefly aimed at emphasising that the Conservative Party is under new leadership - one that was prepared to make the \"bold\" and \"tough\" decisions that her opponents would not.</p></div></article>",

Emergency workers were continuing to search for people feared trapped under rubble.</p><p>It is the third consecutive day that Ukraine has struck the region, leaving thousands of people without power and at least two other people dead. </p><p>Ukraine has not commented on the attacks but has repeatedly struck targets inside Russia, including Belgorod, during the conflict, which is now in its fourth year. </p></div><div><p>Wednesday's series of  drone and missile attacks damaged homes, vehicles and power lines in multiple districts of Belgorod, Gladkov wrote on Telegram. </p><p>He shared photographs from Maslova Pristan showing a sports centre with its roof and walls blown apart, and said rescue workers were clearing debris and assessing the damage.</p><p>In the nearby town of Moshchenoye, six people - including a child - were injured when a rocket and drone struck a truck, while a man was hurt when a car was hit in Masychevo.</p><p>The strikes follow two days of similar attacks that have caused blackouts and structural damage in Belgorod city and surrounding areas. Videos verified by BBC Verify showed explosions and fires near a local power station late on Tuesday. </p><p>Nearly 40,000 residents were affected by power cuts across seven municipalities, according to Gladkov.</p></div><div><p>Ukraine has dramatically increased the number of attacks launched against Russian oil refineries in recent months, sparking fuel shortages and price rises in some parts of the country, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czx020k4056o\">the BBC has found.</a></p><p>At least 21 of Russia's 38 major refineries - where crude oil is converted into usable fuel like petrol and diesel - have been hit since January, almost half again as many as during the whole of 2024. The strikes have contributed to fuel shortages and rising prices across several Russian regions.</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukraine are continuing. Ukraine's air force said on Wednesday its defences shot down or disabled 154 drones, but 22 struck targets in 11 locations.

It also called for the release of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically-elected leader who was deposed in the coup and jailed. </p><p>The Sagaing region has been a key battleground in the war, with large parts of it under the control of volunteer militias.</p><p>These groups, known as the People's Defence Force (PDF), also run the local administration. An official in the local PDF told BBC Burmese that they had received information about a potential airborne attack during Monday's gathering.</p><p>They tried to end the protest quickly, but the paramotors - as paragliders are known locally - reached the scene earlier than expected, he said.</p><p>It all happened in seven minutes, he said. He says the explosion injured his leg, but some people near him were killed. </p><p>Locals said it was hard to identify the bodies in the aftermath.</p><p>\"Children were completely torn apart,\" another woman who had helped to organise the event told AFP news agency. She was not at the scene but attended funerals on Tuesday, and added that they were still \"collecting body parts\".</p></div><div><p>In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International said that the junta's use of motorised paragliders to attack communities was part of a \"disturbing trend\". </p><p>BBC Burmese recently reported that the junta were increasingly opting for paramotors amid a lack of aircraft and helicopters, as well as jet fuel. </p><p>International sanctions over the past few years have made it harder for Myanmar's rulers to procure military equipment - though the recent influx of technology from countries like China and Russia seems to have helped turned the tide. </p><p>Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack \"should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection\".</p><p>He also called on Asean, the South East Asian regional bloc due to convene later this month, to \"increase pressure on the junta and revise an approach that has failed the Myanmar people for almost five years\".</p><p>Myanmar is scheduled to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3pp4n952o\">hold general elections in December</a>, the first vote since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, say the vote will not be free and fair and is aimed at trying to legitimise military rule. Many opposition parties have been banned, and voting is likely to take place in only about half the country, in the areas the military controls.</p></div>",

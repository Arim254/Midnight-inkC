    "body": "8 hours agoAlex ForsythPolitical CorrespondentBBCReform UK could win more seats than any other party at the next general election - perhaps enough to form a government. Or so suggest repeated opinion polls, released since May. That was also when Reform won control of 10 English local authorities - so what does their first six months at the helm at local level show about what a UK government led by them could look like?Listen to Alex reading this articleLast month a leaked video recording showed Linden Kemkaran, Reform UK's leader in Kent, swearing at councillors from her own party and telling them to \"suck it up\" if they didn't agree with her.The footage became national news - insights into tensions within local government are, after all, rarely made public, and Kent is Reform UK's self-professed flagship council.Plenty of critics seized on the incident.Reform suspends four councillors after video leakLabour MPs in Kent labelled her \"unprofessional\" and \"not up to the job,\" and local Liberal Democrat and Green groups claimed Reform's running of the council had descended into chaos.Five of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party amid the upheaval. Kemkaran, meanwhile, remains firmly in post. And she has declared that it is \"business as usual\" at Kent County Council.To some the fallout was undoubtedly damaging and has prompted questions about whether this insurgent party, that is consistently topping national opinion polls, really is a credible force ready to run the country - something they are trying to prove.Danny Kruger, who is one of Reform's five MPs, has his own take. Last month he described the party as a bit of a pirate ship with an \"ill-disciplined\" crew and a \"buccaneering\" captain, but added: \"A powerful ship with a dangerous broadside, a terror to its rivals…\"The job… is to help turn this pirate ship into His Majesty's Royal Navy ship, ready to enter the King's service and serve our nation.\"Gareth Fuller / PAFive of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party. Linden Kemkaran (left) remains in postSo what can we glean from Reform's performance at local level about how they lead - and how well they have so far fared on delivering their promises?These are, after all, promises that are not dissimilar in nature to those they would need to keep if they were successful in their bid to reach Number 10.Reform's own version of DOGEIt has been exactly six months since the local elections saw Reform take outright control of 10 English local authorities, including six of 21 county councils.In all it won 677 seats - more than any other party, amounting to 41% of the total up for election.Before the elections, Nigel Farage addressed a packed rally in Birmingham promising his party would \"send in the auditors… get rid of the fraudulent contracts… cut spending\" if it won.Shortly after their success in the local elections, Reform launched a \"DOGE\" unit, based on billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to cut spending in the US with a Department of Government Efficiency.A photo call on the steps of Kent County Council followed, with a promise that a team of soft ware engineers, data analysts and forensic auditors would \"visit and analyse\" local authorities to identify \"wasteful spending\".But the unit has run into legal challenges in accessing sensitive council data. So far it is reported to have visited only a handful of the councils in England that Reform controls.AFP via Getty ImagesLocal elections saw Reform UK take outright control of 10 English local authoritiesZia Yusuf, Reform's head of policy who led the DOGE team until last month, acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming \"overwhelming demands\" from Whitehall. Nonetheless he insists that hundreds of millions of pounds in savings have already been identified.\"The reality is there's a lot of information that can be shared… because it's in the public domain already,\" he says. \"[DOGE] has been working with every single one of our councils on an ongoing basis.\"He points to certain decisions by Kent County Council, including halting a planned office move and stopping net-zero schemes, as examples of the savings he says Reform has found.Carl Court /Getty ImagesZia Yusuf, a former Reform chairman, led the DOGE team until last monthCouncils spend the bulk of their budgets on statutory services that they have to provide by law, and the cost of these services has spiralled in recent years.The County Councils' Network, which represents some of England's largest local authorities, says its members spend on average 69% of their budgets on adult social care and children's services, with some spending up to 76% - an increase from 63% a decade ago.Reform's argument is that there's still \"waste\" to be found, with Yusuf saying: \"This idea that… because social care is statutory there's no point in finding those savings - we don't buy that.\"But Stuart Hoddinott, an associate director at the Institute for Government think tank, believes that the savings Reform have identified so far are \"minuscule\" in comparison to the financial challenge facing the sector.\"They've found things that are just so tiny to be completely insignificant or are cutting programmes that might actually end up saving money in the longer run. \"It has just been a complete sort of mirage so far... It's like somebody who makes £30,000 worrying about losing 2p per year.\"Budget pressures and a 'broken' systemThe pressure on council budgets across the country has been well-documented. Ahead of this year's spending review, the Local Government Association estimated councils would face a funding gap of £8.4bn by 2028/29.The controversial Kent council meeting, in which tensions boiled over, was a private discussion that seemed to focus, among other things, on both budgets and local government reorganisation.It is another illustration of how, when it comes to setting a budget, Reform is now facing many of the same challenges as parties that preceded it.Stuart Hoddinott acknowledges that Reform has entered a \"broken\" system, given the pressure on funding for statutory services and cuts already made across the board - but he accuses the party of \"bluster\" and \"outlandish promises\".\"They have focused on culture wars, things like 'Oh we'll just cut DEI (diversity equity and inclusion) programmes from local authorities and won't run a Pride flag up the pole every June, then that will solve our financial problems,'\" he argues.\"They were also very naive to think that they would be the ones to solve it [budget pressures] given that you have had 15 years of 300-odd local authorities all battling this and trying to come up with solutions.\"More from InDepthReform's DOGE unit has now had a change of personnel.Richard Tice, the party's deputy leader, has taken over, a change he says was simply a \"natural evolution\" from Yusuf.He has said billions can be saved, and that his focus will be on local government pension schemes, property and \"waste-related contracts\". The party, he adds, will also make announcements on support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, which is a cost pressure for councils.\"You'll be hearing over the next few weeks in areas where we have achieved savings, we have identified savings – and where we need to have some serious discussions about what actually is sensible in certain areas,\" he has said.But these are thorny issues that will likely prove controversial.PA MediaZia Yusuf (pictured with Nigel Farage) acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming 'overwhelming demands' from WhitehallTony Travers, a professor in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics, argues that any benefits would likely take time to filter through.\"Reforming the pension system… might produce benefits for local government in the medium term, but it's probably not going to do it for next May, next April,\" he says.\"That's the trouble. With a lot of these things, they can't be done quickly or as quickly as Reform needs.\"He believes that Reform's cost-cutting narrative was, ultimately, \"never realistic\" - and in his view the party is now facing the \"dawning reality\" of an \"extraordinary period of financial constraint\" that other councils have faced before them.Future of council tax risesNow, as councils begin the process of setting budgets for next year, the picture looks bleak for many - including those led by Reform.Lancashire is facing a budget gap of £100m over the next two years; in West Northamptonshire the council has warned of \"tough choices\" as it tries to plug a £50m gap; while Worcestershire has asked residents for their views on a potential council tax rise of 10%, combined with millions of pounds of cuts.And Warwickshire council - led by George Finch, who was just 19 years old when he took office this summer - warned of \"difficult decisions to come\".Getty ImagesGeorge Finch was just 19 years old when he took office this summerEven though the government has increased the amount of funding available to councils this year and is introducing a new method of allocating funding from next year, claiming it is \"fixing a broken system\", this all still poses a challenge for Reform UK, if it is to fully meet its promises to cut costs and save money.Early indications are that Reform-led councils will raise council tax from April 2026 – something acknowledged by both Richard Tice and Zia Yusuf - though both say the focus is on keeping increases low.\"We never said we would cut council tax,\" Tice says. \"But if you can identify the savings, identify what you shouldn't be doing… then we can achieve lower increases than anybody else.\"Yusuf suggested the rises were unlikely to exceed inflation levels.\"I would expect certainly [in] most of our councils [for] council tax not to go up by more - it is their decision, but it will be a rise in line with inflation, as opposed to the council going into bankruptcy or a rise much more than 5%,\" he says.Getty ImagesReform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promises(His comments came before Reform-led Worcestershire signalled the possibility of a 10% rise.)But keeping council tax relatively low sometimes entails spending cuts – which might not prove popular.And the question now is whether Reform really can prove to be better custodians of public money than their predecessors – and avoid the effective bankruptcy that has hit some other local authorities, while providing value for money.Scaling up the challengeAt the start of the year, Reform UK, Labour and the Conservatives were all averaging about 25% in opinion polls registering voting intention. But in May that all changed: for more than five months Reform's average poll result has hovered around 30%, while the two other parties have now fallen below 20%.Prof Travers believes the party would likely encounter challenges similar to those it is currently facing in councils were it to win the keys to Number 10. It has previously promised tax cuts, and an overhaul of government spending to increase efficiency, echoing its programme for local government.Already there are signs they are realising what is realistic, and what is not. Earlier this week Farage rowed back on his party's previous promise to deliver tax cuts worth £90bn a year. \"Substantial tax cuts\" are not currently \"realistic\" because of the \"dire state\" of the public finances, he said, proposing instead \"relatively modest\" changes, such as raising tax thresholds and scrapping inheritance tax for family-run businesses.\"The truth is, the constraints of real government would be just as real if they got in at Westminster,\" Prof Travers says.\"Could you really cut benefits for millions of people? It's not that easy… So all of this is the kind of local version of the fact that even political parties who attempt to cut or reduce NHS spending, find themselves increasing it. It's just a local version of that.\"Ben Ramanauskas, a senior research fellow in economics at the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, argues that Reform's instinct to look to cut back waste is right – despite the challenges. \"Definitely, any party should be looking for efficiency savings,\" he says. \"This is taxpayers' money being spent and the priority has to be essential public services. There are examples of where there is some waste going on.\"But it is a very tough job for local authorities and councillors,\" he adds. \"And I think any party in that position would possibly struggle, given just how our system operates.\"He argues it will be easier to \"scale up\" savings at a national level, with the ability to pull all the levers of power.Reform’s main risksLooking ahead to the next general election, it would be logical to assume that the fate of Reform - and whether or not it will win enough support to make the leap to Downing Street - rests in part on how it fares at the helm of the councils with these gnarly financial challenges.After all, Reform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promises - so what are the consequences if they cannot deliver on their own pledges in local government?Luke Tryl, director of focus group and polling company More in Common, argues that this link is not necessarily as direct as it may seem.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesDissatisfaction with the economy, NHS and immigration is driving support for Reform\"If you look at the reasons people went and voted for Reform in the local elections, they were number one – overwhelmingly - migration, and Channel crossings in particular. And number two, general disillusionment with the main parties.\"I'm just not sure that Reform's failure to find savings necessarily helps with that.\"Instead, he believes that one of the main risks for Reform that could cost it supporters would be a significant failing in one of the councils – such as a crisis in social care, or bins, or bankruptcy.\"I don't say that the message of 'Reform has put your council tax up' is going to be deterring people in the general election,\" he added.Getty ImagesReform UK could be the biggest party in the next parliamentAs to whether Reform is ready, based on the evidence so far from their leadership of England's councils, in the six months since May, the jury is out.\"It's very difficult to say exactly that Reform councillors are more or less chaotic than other councillors,\" says Stuart Hoddinott.\"They get more attention. So these stories tend to blow a bit more. Having said that, there does seem to have been a lot of incidents since the election.\"Meanwhile, the party's performance in councils has arguably faced even more scrutiny than their political opponents.And while the party says it is making progress on its promises, it is clear it is grappling with the same set of challenges as the parties that came before.So far, it seems the solutions are not proving easy to find for anyone.Top image credits: Gareth Fuller/ PA - Jacob King/ PA and Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoDr XandMorning Live doctorGetty ImagesPopcorn in moderation can be a more nutritious choice than crisps as it is a fibrous wholegrainScroll through social media or glance at the supermarket shelves and you'll see endless products claiming to improve your gut health.It seems everyone's talking about looking after their microbiome - the trillions of tiny organisms living in our digestive system – which influence everything from digestion and immunity to mood and sleep.Gut health is all about having the right mix of bacteria and enough fibre-rich food to keep everything moving and your body feeling its best.The key to keeping the microbes happy is feeding them the right food and it's easier than you think to maintain a healthy gut.Instead of reaching for pricey probiotic shots or snacks, I recommend making these five easy food swaps to give your gut a boost.Swap crisps for popcorn. Popcorn is a wholegrain so it's packed with fibre that feeds the good bacteria in your gut and it's also lighter and far less processed than a bag of crisps.Swap sweets for dried fruit. This can be a hard swap to make if you love sweets but dried apricots, raisins or dates can still hit that sweet spot whilst also delivering fibre, vitamins and natural sugars that your gut and your energy levels will thank you for.Add lentils or chickpeas to your bolognese. Pulses are full of prebiotic fibre which acts as food for your gut microbes and they can help bulk out your meal, making it go further while adding texture and extra plant-based protein so it's a great way to eat less meat without feeling like you're missing outSwap flavoured nuts for plain ones. Flavoured nuts are often loaded with salt and sugar while plain nuts give you healthy fats and fibre without the additives your gut could do without.Swap ice cream for frozen berries and kefir. Ice cream might make your taste buds happy, but frozen berries with kefir (a tangy fermented milk drink) give you natural sweetness, antioxidants and live cultures that can help your microbiome flourish.Of course there are many other foods you can consume to improve your gut health like drinking kombucha or eating fermented food such as kimchi or sauerkraut, but it's not necessary to focus on that too much.The most important thing for your gut and overall health is eating a range of whole foods that are rich in fibre like fruits and vegetables.And when it comes to supplements and probiotics, my advice is the same - there's no evidence it will do you any good and products like probiotic drinks and powders promising miraculous results can cost you hundreds of pounds which I see as a waste of money.Additional reporting by Yasmin Rufo",

    "body": "10 hours agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentGetty ImagesChildren will be taught how to budget and how mortgages work as the government seeks to modernise the national curriculum in England's schools.They will also be taught how to spot fake news and disinformation, including AI-generated content, following the first review of what is taught in schools in over a decade.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the government wanted to \"revitalise\" the curriculum but keep a \"firm foundation\" in basics like English, maths and reading.Head teachers said the review's recommendations were \"sensible\" but would require \"sufficient funding and teachers\".The government commissioned a review of the national curriculum and assessments in England last year, in the hope of developing a \"cutting edge\" curriculum that would narrow attainment gaps between the most disadvantaged students and their classmates.It said it would take up most of the review's recommendations, including scrapping the English Baccalaureate (EBacc), a progress measure for schools introduced in 2010.It assesses schools based on how many pupils take English, maths, sciences, geography or history and a language - and how well they do.The Department for Education (DfE) said the EBacc was \"constraining\", and that removing it alongside reforms to another school ranking system, Progress 8, would \"encourage students to study a greater breadth of GCSE subjects\", like arts.The former Conservative schools minister, Nick Gibb, said the decision to scrap the EBacc would \"lead to a precipitous decline in the study of foreign languages\", which he said would become increasingly centred on private schools and \"children of middle class parents who can afford tutors\".Other reforms coming as a result of the curriculum review include:Financial literacy being taught in maths classes, or compulsory citizenship lessons in primary schoolsMore focus on spotting misinformation and disinformation - including exploring a new post-16 qualification in data science and AICutting time spent on GCSE exams by up to three hours for each student on averageEnsuring all children can take three science GCSEsMore content on climate changeBetter representation of diversityThe review also recommended giving oracy the same status in the curriculum as reading and writing, which the charity Voice 21 said was a \"vital step forward\" for teaching children valuable speaking, listening, and communication skills.However, the government is not taking up all of the review's recommendations.It is pushing ahead with the reading tests for Year 8 pupils reported in September, whereas the review recommended compulsory English and maths tests for that year group.Asked why she stopped short of taking up the review's recommendation, Phillipson told the BBC that pupils who are unable to read \"fluently and confidently\" often struggle in other subjects.And she addressed the claims that scrapping the EBacc could lead to fewer pupils taking history, geography and languages at GCSE, saying the measure \"hasn't led to improved outcomes\" or \"improvement in language study\".\"I want young people to have a good range of options, including subjects like art and music and sport. And I know that's what parents want as well,\" she said.She said ministers recognised \"the need to implement this carefully, thoroughly and with good notice\", adding that schools would have four terms of notice before being expected to teach the new curriculum.Prof Becky Francis, who chaired the review, said her panel of experts and the government had both identified a \"problem\" pupils experience during the first years of secondary school.\"When young people progress from primary into secondary school, typically this is a time when their learning can start falling behind, and that's particularly the case for kids from socially disadvantaged backgrounds,\" she told the BBC.Professor Becky Francis led the curriculum and assessment reviewShe said the approach to the review was \"evolution not revolution\", with England's pupils already performing relatively well against international averages. She said the call for more representation of diversity in the curriculum was not about \"getting rid of core foundational texts and things that are really central to our culture\", but was more about \"recognising where, both as a nation but also globally, there's been diverse contribution to science and cultural progress\".Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott said the changes \"leave children with a weaker understanding of our national story and hide standards slipping in schools\".\"Education vandalism will be the lasting legacy of the prime minister and Bridget Phillipson,\" she added.Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the review had proposed \"a sensible, evidence-based set of reforms\".But he said delivering a \"great curriculum\" also required \"sufficient funding and teachers\", adding that schools and colleges did not currently have all the resources they need.He said a set of \"enrichment benchmarks\" - which the government said would offer pupils access to civic engagement, arts and culture, nature and adventure, sport, and life skills - had been announced \"randomly\" and \"added to the many expectations over which schools are judged\".Additional reporting by Hope Rhodes",

    "body": "4 hours agoWatch: Smoke hangs over Louisville after deadly plane crashAt least seven people have been killed after a cargo plane ran off the runway and burst into flames in Kentucky on Tuesday.The burning aircraft, which was operated by the American delivery company UPS, struck several buildings when it crashed mid-takeoff. Officials fear the number of dead and injured could rise. Here is everything we know so far.Where did the crash happen and what was hit?UPS flight 2976, a cargo plane, crashed during takeoff at Louisville International Airport at around 17:15 local time on Tuesday, skidding off the runway and striking nearby buildings. The aircraft burst into flames and at least two nearby businesses were hit by the wreckage, the state's governor Andy Beshear has said.Kentucky Petroleum Recycling was struck \"pretty directly\", Beshear said, with a second business - Grade A Auto Parts - also impacted.Unverified footage of the incident shows the plane was already engulfed in flames when it careered off the runway.The flames spread to several buildings close to the runway and officials launched a major operation to halt the blaze from spreading further. Nearby residents were ordered to stay inside over fears of further explosions and air pollution. The airport is located in Kentucky's biggest city and several neighbourhoods and business districts surround it. All operations at the airport have been halted.CBSHow many people have been killed or injured?Officials have confirmed seven deaths so far but have warned that number is expected to rise.It is unclear whether that death toll includes the three crew members who were onboard the plane and are feared dead.Eleven other people are have been injured and are being treated in hospital - but local officials say that figure is also likely to rise.The head of the local fire service said he was not aware of anyone being trapped in nearby buildings but said searches were still ongoing. Two workers at the auto business that was struck were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday evening, and it is not known how many customers were on the premises when the crash happened.Courier Journal via ReutersWhat caused the crash?A preliminary investigation is under way but officials have said it is too early to say what caused the crash.Officials did note, though, that the massive blaze was due to the amount of fuel onboard the aircraft, which was beginning a journey of around 4,300 miles (6,920km) to Hawaii. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel when it crashed.It has not been confirmed what cargo was on board, though officials have said the plane was not carrying anything that would create a heightened risk of contamination. Louisville Fire Department chief Brian O'Neal said the amount of fuel spilled at the crash site made it a \"very dangerous situation\".An order warning people to shelter in place was reduced from a five-mile radius from the airport to a one-mile radius as crews worked to contain the blaze on Tuesday night. The model of aircraft involved was a MD-11F large triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago.",

    "body": "Harassment and bullying did happen at top rowing club8 hours agoClodagh StensonBBC South InvestigationsGetty ImagesOxford Brookes' women's team prepare to race in 2017 - the club is one of eight High Performance Academies that develop Olympic rowersSexual harassment, racism and bullying did happen at Oxford Brookes University Boat Club, an independent investigation has confirmed.The report was commissioned by the university after a picture of a so-called \"toughness sheet\", allegedly criticising members of the top rowing team, circulated online in November 2024.A summary of the findings by law firm Penningtons Manches Cooper was submitted to the university in April and has been shared with the BBC by a contributor to the investigation.Oxford Brookes University said it had made \"leadership and coaching changes\" and \"new, progressive structures\" were now in place at the club.Heather, not her real name, rowed at Oxford Brookes University Boat Club (OBUBC) and was interviewed as part of the investigation. She said that while at the club she witnessed sexual harassment towards women and that public weight shaming of athletes was \"prolific\".Heather said she saw the men's squad asked to jump up and down topless, and \"if any of their body parts jiggled, they needed to lose it\".\"I felt it was important to be part of the investigation because I felt that a lot of the athletes might not feel able to speak out about their experiences,\" Heather said. She said she also feels that Oxford Brookes has \"glossed over\" issues around sexism, racism and bullying and that it has a duty to be transparent about \"the culture of the club and what they're doing to improve that.\"Oxford Brookes' boat house in Cholsey is home to one of the UK's top rowing programmesWhat did the investigation find? The independent investigation was conducted by the law firm Penningtons Manches Cooper, that interviewed 41 current and past athletes from OBUBC. A summary of the report was shared with the BBC by someone who contributed to the investigation and then requested its findings through a Freedom of Information request. Any individuals' names within the report had been redacted. The investigation found: \"Multiple and varied instances\" of sex discrimination and sexual harassmentRepeated breaches of British Rowing's Code of Conduct, including rules prohibiting coaches from having sexual relationships with athletesEvidence of bullying, \"personalised profanity\", and three incidents of \"racial slurs\"That there had been data protection breaches and it suggested that aspects of the club's finances should be auditedBreaches of British Rowing's Weighing GuidanceThat there had been \"repeated interference\" during the investigationThe report summary recommended that disciplinary action be taken against some OBUBC members, a Welfare Officer be appointed, and that there should be more Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training. A spokesperson for Oxford Brookes University said: \"When concerns were initially raised about coaching at the Oxford Brookes University Boat Club, we took swift action by launching the independent investigation that led to the production of this report.\"Respect, inclusion and the dignity of everyone who studies and works here are central to our culture.\"We have worked with British Rowing to address the issues raised in the report, with leadership and coaching changes and new, progressive structures now in place at the club.\"More stories from OxfordshireThe investigation began after the picture of a so-called \"toughness sheet\" circulated online.It included comments next to rowers' names including \"Put the pies down\", \"Get a haircut\" and \"Watching you row is like watching paint dry\".After the sheet was leaked, an unverified WhatsApp message from a senior member of the boat club referencing the \"toughness sheet\" was seen by the BBC. It asked someone to \"own up\" for posting a photo of it online, otherwise they would be \"tracked down\". In December 2024, Oxford Brookes University announced that an investigation would look at behaviour and culture at the club. Heather said she feels that methods like the \"toughness sheet\" are not effective in training athletes, and that \"success and wellbeing should come hand in hand\". Oxford Brookes is home to one of the UK's top rowing programmes, with eight members of its boat club selected to represent Team GB at the Paris Olympics.British Rowing said that they \"worked collaboratively with and supported Oxford Brookes University as it implemented the recommendations identified through its independent investigation into coaching practices at Oxford Brookes University Boat Club.\"More on this storyRelated Links",

    "body": "8 hours agoJennifer MeierhansBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAdverts for LED masks that are not registered with the medicines regulator have been banned (stock photo)A number of adverts for LED face masks have been banned for making unauthorised claims they can improve acne and rosacea.The popularity of at-home beauty devices has surged in recent years with social media feeds filled with influencers unboxing and reviewing the masks as the latest skincare trend.However, dermatologists are divided over whether light-emitting diodes (LED) in at-home masks can deliver the results of medical-grade devices used in clinics. The advertising watchdog banned adverts for cosmetic devices which were not registered with the medicines regulator.LED therapy is thought to stimulate cells and improve the skin, but devices must be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to make medical claims about skin conditions like acne and rosacea.Devices registered with the MHRA can be searched on its Public Access Registration Database (PARD). Dermatologists have previously told the BBC there have not been clinical trials with large enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time to know the benefits of at-home LED masks.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) used AI to search for ads which might break the rules, and the bans followed that search.'My acne had disappeared'An advert on Project E Beauty's website showed before and after images of a woman's forehead with and without acne, with the words: \"By week three, my acne had disappeared\". The ad stated: \"Our most advanced LED mask for deeper skin renewal\". It claimed it \"treats acne\" and offered \"83% improvement in acne lesions in four weeks\".The ASA said \"no medical claims could be made for the product, whether or not such claims appeared in customer testimonials.\"Project E Beauty LLC said it had removed potential medical claims relating to \"healing\", \"treating acne\" and \"rosacea\".It also said it had amended the advert to state that any references to acne in before/after photos and reviews were testimonials based on personal experiences.Silk'nThis advert was banned for making a medicinal claim about acneA paid-for social media ad for Silk'n featured a video of a woman using an LED face mask with the caption: \"Finished with the blue light to help treat my acne and scars\".Invention Works BV, trading as Silk'n, acknowledged the term \"acne\" constituted a medical claim. It said the advert was created by a woman after prolonged use of the mask and the wording reflected her individual perception and results.The ASA told Silk'n the adverts must not appear again in that form.BeautaholicsBeautaholics agreed not to make claims about acne in adverts in futureOther adverts banned include one on the Beautaholics website for a RejuvaLux mask which stated: \"This mask provides targeted solutions for...acne...rosacea.\" Beautaholics said it would not make claims regarding the treatment or prevention of medical conditions in future.A paid-for social media ad for a mask by Luyors Retail Inc was also banned after it stated: \"It helps tackle everything from acne...with clinical precision.\"Luyors said it would ensure future advertising did not refer to \"acne\" or other terms that could imply a medicinal claim.Izzy Dharmasiri at the ASA said ads \"can have an influence on what people buy,\" so it was \"important that advertisers don't blur the line between cosmetic benefits and medicinal claims.\"She said advertisers \"need to have evidence to back up any claims they make in their ads\". She said the banning of the adverts was part of its work to protect vulnerable people \"seeking genuine solutions to medical problems\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoSeveral papers lead on the aftermath of a speech by the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, in which she did not rule out a U-turn on Labour's manifesto general election pledge not to hike income tax. Despite the chancellor saying she will make \"necessary choices\" in the Budget, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch says Britain watched the speech \"in horror\" and that Reeves is \"blaming every else\" for chaos, according to the Daily Express.A hike in income tax would be the first since 1975, and break a \"50-year taboo\" against the policy, the i Paper reports. Economists cited by the paper say Reeves must add 2p on income tax if she wants to make the UK's public finances \"more resilient, and avoid having to return for more\" in the near future.\"We will all have to do our bit\" is the chancellor's quote featured in the Times. The paper reports more lines from Reeves' speech where she vowed to put \"national interests\" before \"political expediency\". Elsewhere, a photo of Sir David Beckham receiving his knighthood at Windsor Castle is front and centre.\"Reeves's waffle bomb\" is the Daily Mail's take. The paper also reports that Labour has been accused of \"educational vandalism\" after ministers announced they would scrap a number of Tory reforms on education. The changes will include cutting GCSE exams and simplify primary school tests. \"Labour dumbs down schools\" is the headline.\"Make it fair, Rachel\" is the Daily Mirror's headline as it leads with a plea from trade unions to the chancellor, calling on her to tax the wealthiest before targeting ordinary workers. Sharing the top spot, \"bend a knee like Beckham\" is the paper's take on Sir David Beckham's knighthood.The Daily Star's headline is \"Rach sparks tax rise fury\", as it reports on the chancellor's \"first pre-Budget speech for 50 years - hinting at huge tax rises\".\"Reeves puts Britain on notice,\" says the Independent. The paper reports that a think tank has warned that a 2p income tax rise might not be enough to fix the country's finances. A smiling Sir David Beckham holding his knighthood medal also fills the front page as the paper declares: \"Arise Sir Becks!\"\"Finally... Sir Goldenbawls\" follows the Sun, as it reports that Sir David Beckham admitted he was \"crying for months\" after learning of his long-awaited knighthood. \"It's been been a very emotional day,\" he said after the ceremony at Windsor. The Guardian's front page spotlight's Sir David calling his knighthood \"my proudest moment\". Also prominent, the paper reports on Health Secretary Wes Streeting's warning that NHS staff are bearing the brunt of \"ugly\" racism. In an interview with the paper, Streeting says incidents of verbal and physical abuse based on people's skin colour are happening so often that it has become \"socially acceptable to be racist\".The Telegraph says that pressure is mounting on the BBC's senior executives after a leaked dossier revealed \"serious and systemic\" editorial bias. The paper says Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for \"heads to roll\" over the allegations. A BBC spokesperson said: \"While we don't comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.\"Finally, the Metro celebrates the story of the LNER rail staff worker who has been praised as a \"hero\" for saving passengers' lives during the Cambridgeshire train attack. The paper quotes Samir Zitouni's family who say: \"He's always been a hero.\"Chancellor Rachel Reeves features on many of the front pages after she warned voters about the \"necessary\" choices to be made at this month's Budget to balance the books.The Financial Times says she has \"opened the door\" for a \"manifesto-breaking income tax rise\".The i Paper highlights that such a hike would be the first since 1975, and break what the paper calls a \"50-year taboo\" against the policy.The Daily Mail labels the chancellor's Downing Street speech on Tuesday as \"all bluster\" and a \"waffle bomb\".According to the Daily Telegraph, some within Labour have been left fearing the worst. An unnamed Labour MP tells the paper they believe putting up taxes will \"scotch whatever limited chances\" the party has of being re-elected, and that breaking the manifesto pledge could leave them with \"no credibility\".The Times says ministers have raised concerns that an increase in income tax could see them lose some voters \"forever\".The front page of the Metro has a photograph of the rail worker, Samir Zitouni, who protected passengers during the knife attack on a train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday. More details were released about him yesterday. The paper quotes his family who say \"he's always been a hero\".The Daily Telegraph reports that Sir Keir Starmer's deal to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been delayed. The paper says it is because a Conservative peer submitted an amendment to the legislation, to try to make the government consult the Chagossians before going ahead.A Foreign Office spokesman said there had been a lack of notice given regarding the amendment, and a Lords vote to confirm the Bill would be moved to a later date.And most of the papers feature photographs of Sir David Beckham receiving his knighthood at Windsor Castle yesterday. \"Bend a knee like Beckham\" says the Daily Mirror while the Daily Mail goes for: \"Arise Sir Becks.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Israel has confirmed the latest body of a hostage returned by Hamas via the Red Cross is that of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen.The 19-year-old's remains were handed over on Tuesday as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump last month.\"Following the completion of the identification process... [Israel Defense Forces] representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage, Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, that their loved one has been returned to Israel and positively identified,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said.Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.Israel had allowed members of the Palestinian armed group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.Staff Sgt Chen was serving as a soldier in the IDF's 7th Brigade when Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023. The IDF said he was killed inside a tank during a battle in Kibbutz Nir Oz and that his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas.\"The remains of Itay Chen, a young American taken hostage by Hamas at just 19 years old, have finally returned home. We honour his life, mourn his loss, and stand with his family,\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel welcomed his returned but also stressed that there were seven deceased hostages still in Gaza. \"Please don't stop until they are all back home. Until the last hostage,\" it said.The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since the ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October.Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Trump's Gaza peace plan, including plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.The US has now reportedly drafted a UN Security Council resolution that would give a two-year mandate for a transitional governance body in Gaza, known as the Board of Peace, and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF). The text says the ISF would be tasked with working with Israel and Egypt to secure border areas, \"ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip\", protecting civilians, and training a new Palestinian police force. It also says the ISF would be authorised to \"use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\". It is understood the draft has not yet been formally sent to other Security Council members for negotiations.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 270 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 18 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas before Tuesday, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese. The bodies of another 15 Palestinians are expected to be returned to Gaza in exchange for Sgt Chen.Five of the seven dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.The Israeli military said its troops killed a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them.",

    "body": "Investigators have boarded an Australian cruise ship, more than 10 days after the death of an elderly female passenger who was left behind on a remote island.Suzanne Rees, 80, had been hiking on Lizard Island with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer, but broke off from the group for a rest.The ship left without her, only returning several hours later when the crew realised Ms Rees was missing.Officials from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) boarded the vessel on Wednesday morning local time.The organisation, which is probing the incident, alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner, told the BBC it could not comment on the investigation.The Coral Adventurer had been expected to dock at Cairns – where its operator Coral Expeditions is based.But a lack of available berths meant it instead dropped anchor a few kilometres north early on Tuesday evening, off the coast of Yorkey's Knob, where it remained on Wednesday morning.The BBC understands only a skeleton crew were on board.Ship tracking data showed one of the vessel's smaller boats, known as a tender, moving between the ship and the shore on Tuesday night.All passengers disembarked at Horn Island in the far north of Queensland over the weekend and were transferred to the mainland on a charter plane.The 60-day cruise around Australia, which had cost guests tens of thousands of dollars, was cancelled due to Ms Rees' death as well as mechanical issues.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast.Tracking data shows the vessel initially left Cairns at around 07:30 local time on 24 October - after a delay of around a week because of mechanical issues.The next day it reached Lizard Island - also known as Jiigurru or Dyiigurra - in the northern area of the Great Barrier Reef for the first stop on the journey.Passengers aboard were transported by tenders to the secluded island – home to a luxury resort and a research station - for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne Rees' daughter, Katherine Rees, said last week that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".She described her mother, who was from Sydney,  as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"Ms Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"A search and rescue effort late on Saturday 25 October – the day she went missing – did not find any sign of Ms Rees. Her body was discovered the following day.Last week Mark Fifield, the chief executive of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, confirmed the firm was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Mr Fifield said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.",

    "body": "8 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorThe 'godmother' of AI, Professor Fei-Fei Li has told the BBC that being the only woman amongst seven pioneers of artificial Intelligence being presented with a top engineering prize by the King today makes her \"proud to be different\".The King will present the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Prof Li and six others during a ceremony at St James's Palace.  Those honoured alongside her are Prof Yoshua Bengio, Dr Bill Dally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton, Prof John Hopfield, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang and Meta's Chief AI Scientist Dr Yann LeCun.They are being recognised for their contributions to the development of modern machine learning, a field that underpins the rapid advancement of AI.Dr Hinton, Prof Bengio and Yann LeCun, currently Chief AI Scientist at Meta have widely been recognised as the \"Godfathers of AI\" since they were jointly awarded the 2018 Turing Award.  There is however only one so-called \"godmother\" of AI and Prof Li told the BBC she has grown to accept the moniker.\"I would not call myself godmother of anything,\" she said.  She said a few years ago when people started calling her that, she had to \"pause and recognise if I rejected this, it would miss an opportunity for women scientists and technologists to be recognised this way\".\"Because men are pretty easily called godfathers or founding fathers.\"\"For all the young women I work with and the generations of girls to come, I'm okay now accepting this title,\" she added.Born in China, Prof Li emigrated to the US as a teenager and went on to excel in computer science. She is co-director for Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute and co-founder and CEO of World Labs.It is her work on ImageNet a project which enabled major advances in computer vision for which she is recognised. She and her students created large-scale image recognition datasets upon which a lot of artificial intelligence technology is now built. It paved the way for computer vision – working out how computers could 'see'.She says the importance of that data set \"open the floodgate of data-driven AI\".She thinks the next AI milestone will come when it is able to interact with the world around it.This ability was is \"innately important and native to animals and humans\", and if this could be unlocked in AI, it could \"superpower\" humans in many ways, \"including creativity, robotic learning, design and architecture\".This will be the first time all seven laureates have come together in person. The three \"godfathers\" have publicly stated opposing views on how dangerous AI could be. Dr Hinton has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the potential for AI to pose an \"extinction-level threat\".  But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta has written that apocalyptic warnings are overblown.Prof Li says she takes a more \"pragmatic approach\" and says the disagreement amongst scientists is \"healthy\".\"We're used to even disagreement, and I think that's healthy. A topic as profound and impactful as AI requires a lot of healthy debate and public discourse.\"I think in the case of AI, both extreme rhetorics concern me…I have always advocated for a much more science based, pragmatic method in communicating and educating the public.\"So, yes, I would like to see our communication of AI to be much more moderated and grounded in facts and science instead of the extreme rhetorics\".The Queen Elizabeth prize is awarded annually to engineers responsible for groundbreaking innovations which globally benefit humanity. Previous recipients include Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.Lord Vallance, chair of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said the winners \"represent the very best of engineering,\" adding that their work \"demonstrates how engineering can both sustain our planet and transform the way we live and learn.\"Additional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "body": "58 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterOnline retailers Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Wish are being investigated in France in relation to the offence of enabling minors to access pornographic content on their platforms, the Paris prosecutor said on Tuesday.The country's consumer watchdog had reported the four firms to the prosecution service on Sunday after raising concerns about the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein's platform over the weekend.In an earlier statement, Shein said it would cooperate fully with authorities and is willing to provide information on sellers, buyers and products involved. When contacted on Wednesday, it did not have further comments to add.AliExpress told the BBC it takes the matter very seriously.Temu and Wish have also been contacted for comment.The Paris prosecutor's office said the four platforms are being investigated over violent, pornographic or \"undignified messages\" that can be accessed by minors.Shein and AliExpress are also under investigation over the dissemination of content related to children that are of a pornographic nature, the prosecutor's office said.The cases have been referred to Paris' Office des Mineurs, the prosecution service added. The office is an arm of the French police force that oversees the protection of minors.AliExpress said the listings in question violated its policies and were removed once it became aware of them.\"Sellers found to violate or trying to circumvent these requirements will be penalised in accordance with our rules,\" AliExpress said in a statement.On Monday, Shein said it had banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide. The Singapore-based retailer also said that it would permanently block all seller accounts related to the illegal sale of the childlike dolls and set stricter controls on its platform.The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, had said the sex dolls' description and categorisation left \"little doubt as to the child pornography nature\" of the products.The scrutiny of Shein comes as the company, which was founded in China, prepares for the opening on Wednesday of its first permanent physical outlet in France.Protesters have been seen gathered in front of the Paris department store where Shein is set to open the outlet.Shein plans to open outlets in other French department stores in cities including Dijon, Reims and Angers.",

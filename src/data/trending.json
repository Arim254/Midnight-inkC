    "body": "Trump's foreign policy and what it might mean for the World CupImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Fifa president Gianni Infantino gave US president Donald Trump the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize in DecemberBySports editorA group of cross-party MPs have called on Fifa to consider expelling the United States from the World Cup until the country demonstrates \"clear compliance with international law and respect for the sovereignty of other nations\".It follows the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid on the capital city Caracas this month, along with warnings that US president Donald Trump has recently issued to a host of other countries.So with the US due to host both the World Cup and Olympics over the next two and a half years, what questions does America's foreign policy raise for sports organisations, and could any take a stand?'Repeated veiled and overt threats'Back in December, Fifa awarded Trump its inaugural 'Peace Prize' at the 2026 World Cup draw ceremony in Washington, saying he had \"played a pivotal role\" in establishing a ceasefire and promoted peace between Israel and Palestine, and that he has sought to end other conflicts.In the few weeks since, the US has taken military action in both Venezuela and Nigeria and has hinted at possible further operations in Greenland, fellow World Cup co-host Mexico, and two other participants in the tournament - Colombia and Iran.Now, 23 politicians from Labour, the Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru have signed a motion, external in parliament, calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup. They say such events \"should not be used to legitimise or normalise violations of international law by powerful states\".The MPs express concern about the \"escalation of US actions against Venezuela\", including \"the kidnapping of President Nicolas Maduro\", claiming that they amount to \"a direct intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign state\".Their motion also notes \"repeated veiled and overt threats made by senior US officials\", towards Denmark, Colombia and Cuba\", saying it \"undermines the rules-based international order\".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The United States launched a military strike on Venezuela and captured president Nicolas Maduro on 3 JanuaryWhat has the US done and said?While the White House is yet to respond to the BBC about the MPs' motion, it has previously claimed that the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug-trafficking and terrorism. Trump said the US will now control Venezuela and its oil industry.Maduro insists he is a prisoner of war, and Trump faced strong criticism at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected\" during the US action.Meanwhile, Trump has also told Cuba to \"make a deal\" over Venezuelan oil exports \"before it is too late\", and said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\".As with Venezuela, Trump has accused Colombia of not doing enough to tackle drug trafficking. Colombia president Gustavo Petro has told the BBC that he believes there is now a \"real threat\" of US military action against his country.Trump has also claimed that drugs are \"pouring\" through Mexico into America, adding \"we're gonna have to do something\", amid reports that he has started planning a mission to send in US troops. Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum says she has rejected any US military action on Mexican soil.Trump has also insisted his country needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons and has not ruled out using military force. The mineral-rich Arctic territory is controlled by Denmark, a fellow Nato member, and potentially also in the World Cup if its team comes through the play-offs. The Trump administration has also faced mounting scrutiny over the legality of air strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.Could Fifa act?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gianni Infantino was elected president of Fifa in February 2016Fifa declined to comment on the MPs' motion, and there is no suggestion it may reconsider the annual awarding of its peace prize. But few believe it will take any action against a country that is hosting the majority of its matches at the World Cup, especially given the close relationship the governing body's president Gianni Infantino has cultivated with Trump.Such ties have led to accusations that Fifa has become politicised, although it insists that as an organiser of football events it has a statutory duty to remain neutral. This is not the first time Fifa has come under pressure over the political actions of a World Cup host. In 2018, the tournament went ahead in Russia despite the country annexing Crimea four years earlier. Russia also stood accused of cyber attacks, meddling in western elections and carrying out the Novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury.However, comparisons have also been drawn with the way Fifa subsequently banned Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a sanction that remains in place.\"Let's have consistency,\" Brian Leishman, one of the MPs who has signed the motion, told the Daily Mirror when asked about the US action in Venezuela. \"It's an invasion of a sovereign nation and the kidnap of a president in Venezuela. I'm very critical of Maduro, I want to be very clear on that, but what we've seen is a breach of international law. When you see how Russia has been treated, which is absolutely correct, I just want there to be consistency.\"Some at Fifa privately point out that the Russian Football Union is still a member association and that the ban on playing internationals was more down to teams refusing to play against Russia and security concerns, rather than the governing body taking a moral position.An insight into Fifa's approach came in October when Infantino said Fifa \"cannot solve geopolitical problems\" amid pressure to sanction Israel after a United Nations commission of inquiry concluded that it had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\".What about the Olympics?The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also maintains a ban on Russian teams at the Games, with individual athletes only allowed to compete as neutrals, as long as they are admitted by the relevant sporting federations.However, it has ruled out the exclusion of any American athletes from February's Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina in Italy.In a statement issued to BBC Sport, it said: \"As a global organisation, the IOC has to manage a complex reality. The IOC has to deal with the current political context and the latest developments in the world. \"The ability to bring athletes together, no matter where they come from, is fundamental to the future of values-based, truly global sport, which can give hope to the world.\"For this reason, the IOC cannot involve itself directly in political matters or conflicts between countries, as these fall outside our remit. This is the realm of politics.\"Last year, the IOC also rejected calls to bar Israel over the Gaza war, stating that the country's national Olympic committee had complied with the Olympic Charter.IOC sources have told BBC Sport a distinction has to be made with Russia because  it took over Ukrainian territory and put athletes there under the control of the Russian Olympic Committee, which is against the Olympic Charter.Los Angeles is hosting the Olympics in 2028.'A looming stress-test'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams for the first timeSome believe that, depending on Trump's next moves, the situation could become harder for sports bodies to navigate.\"Fifa and the IOC could be heading towards one almighty headache,\" according to John Zerafa, a veteran advisor to countries and cities wanting to host major sports events.\"Both organisations' charters emphasise peace, respect for sovereignty, and non-discrimination.\"In Russia's case, that led to bans and restrictions on athletes and teams. If, in a worst-case scenario, the US were to use force against Greenland - a Nato ally's territory - would those same principles apply? If Denmark qualifies via the play-offs, would it boycott the World Cup? Would European or Nato leaders refuse to attend US-hosted events?\"This isn't just geopolitics. It's a looming stress-test for sporting institutions that pride themselves on neutrality, yet repeatedly find themselves forced to take political positions when international law and conflict collide with global competition.\"Trump's tougher immigration policies could also have an impact on the World Cup, which begins on 11 June.Fifa and US authorities have promised a welcoming and unifying tournament, but there are now four competing countries - Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Ivory Coast - whose fans face full or partial travel bans, with the White House referencing a need to manage security threats. For other fans, a programme designed to shorten wait times for interviews for visitor visas for those with tickets has been brought in. However the White House's World Cup Taskforce has not ruled out Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, external targeting undocumented immigrants at World Cup venues. Meanwhile, domestic tensions in the US have intensified after Renee Good, 37, was shot dead by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, triggering large protests in the city.The Euoprean Democratic Party (EDP) references the incident in a letter it sent to European authorities on Wednesday, saying it is a \"significant indicator of the current operational climate and of the level of discretion exercised in the use of force by federal authorities, with potential implications for perceptions of safety and for the overall guarantees provided during an event of global scale.\"The party also warns of \"growing concerns over legal and administrative uncertainty, including the risk of non-transparent or discretionary visa decisions and border controls, as well as potentially invasive practices involving personal data and online activity\", which it claims \"may translate into concrete risks for European citizens...\"The party says it may ask national football federations to consider pulling out of the tournament if safety guarantees are not forthcoming. As Fifa's biggest-ever tournament approaches it will be fascinating to see what further impact US policies at home and abroad have on ticket sales, collaboration between the co-hosts on issues such as security, and whether sports bodies feel they need to do more to navigate a complicated geopolitical landscape.",

    "body": "1 hour agoLauren TurnerBBC NewsGetty ImagesHoover's latest novel, Woman Down - her first since 2022 - was released this weekBest-selling author Colleen Hoover has revealed she has been having treatment after being diagnosed with cancer.The US writer, 46, known for It Ends With Us and Reminders of Him, said she has nearly finished radiotherapy and that earlier surgery was a success.She publicly discussed the news in an Instagram post this week, with a selfie showing her in a hospital gown.In a further message on Tuesday, she told fans: \"I'm doing much better. My cancer diagnosis was a while ago but I chose to keep it private until after finding out my surgery was successful and what my other treatments would be.\"That came after she initially shared the news with fans in a private Facebook chat about a month ago, telling them the cancer had been removed and that \"I'm okay\".'Huge and scary'In the Facebook post to Colleen Hoover's CoHorts - her fan group - she explained that she had suffered recurring health issues throughout 2025. But she put her concerns to one side while the film adaptation of Reminders of Him was being shot in Canada, and did not seek medical advice \"until the movie was finished\", she explained.On her return home she received her cancer diagnosis. \"It felt huge and scary for a bit, and I had to miss out on the Regretting You premiere and some other important career and personal moments, I just wasn't ready to share with anyone until I knew what the outcome would be,\" she said.Hoover has not specified what type of cancer she has.In another Facebook post last week, she said her cancer was possibly linked to environment and lifestyle factors, such as \"a lack of exercise, poor diet and stress\".\"I'm happy and grateful to be alive but I hate vegetables,\" she said. \"I hate when I have to get off the couch. I hate sweating. I hate when science is right.\"She joked that if anyone saw her at a restaurant eating grilled chicken and drinking water, \"I'm probably real mad about it\".'I'm a badass'On Instagram this week, Hoover said the hospital gown selfie was posted to thank Texas Oncology - where she has been receiving treatment - and that she had been open about her diagnosis \"for a while\".Her latest novel, Woman Down - her first since 2022 - was released this week.But the author said her cancer update \"wasn't a ploy to get sympathy-sales for release day\".Hoover, who has three children and lives in Texas, added she had received radiation treatment in Dallas on Monday morning and later surprised fans at a South Carolina bookshop that was hosting a midnight release event for her new novel.\"Not because I'm lying about anything, but because I'm a badass,\" she added. Her other books include It Ends With Us, which has sold more than 20 million copies and was adapted into a film in 2024.That was overshadowed in some ways by a legal battle between actor-director Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, his co-star in the film.",

Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Sutherland \"entered a ride-share vehicle, physically assaulted the driver (the victim), and made criminal threats\" in an incident at 00:15 PST (08:15 GMT) on Monday. The victim was not injured in the incident, the LAPD added.Sutherland, 59, was released after paying a bond of $50,000 (£37,000). He is due to appear in court on 2 February. The BBC has contacted his representatives for comment.The incident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood and is under investigation by the LAPD's Hollywood Division.Sutherland, known for roles such as special agent Jack Bauer on Fox's 24, and as the US president in Designated Survivor, is the son of actor Donald Sutherland.The British-Canadian actor has been arrested several times in the past, and in 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation.He was arrested for assault in 2009, although the charge was later dropped, and was most recently arrested after making an illegal U-turn in Hollywood in 2020.",

    "body": "11 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorDitching his plans to make digital ID mandatory for workers in the UK is an almighty backtracking and dilution of one of the prime minister's flagship policy ideas of the autumn.I remember the first time Sir Keir Starmer talked publicly about his plans, because he was talking to me when he did so.It was September, and we were sheltering from the pouring rain, in an outside metal stairwell next to a giant ship being built by BAE Systems on the banks of the Clyde in Glasgow.What he had to say that day was rather overshadowed by the swirling storm around his then Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, who 24 hours later was out of a job.What those around him were describing as \"phase 2\" of his government was already off to a bumpy start, but digital ID was seen as a defining idea of the parliament that the prime minister could own and then lean into the arguments it provokes with his opponents, within his party and beyond it.The thing is it provoked a lot of arguments, perhaps more than he had anticipated, including among some Labour MPs.It was the mandatory element that became the magnet for the stickiest criticisms.The idea cratered in popularity. It revived so many of the arguments that nuked the last Labour government's plans for ID cards about two decades ago.The sense from critics of an overbearing state, a \"show us your papers\" society.So what have ministers done? They have junked the mandatory element of it.People will still have to digitally prove they have the right to work – but could use other things to do it.This new government digital ID will not be essential.The argument I hear within government is they are ditching the bit that is unpopular, but keeping something people might choose to use themselves because it could make accessing public services easier, for instance.In short, the whole initial public pitch for why digital ID was a good idea - cracking down on illegal migration and illegal working - has been shelved.The emphasis now is on digital ID being an aide to consumers.\"Let's remove the whole culture war thing entirely and focus on the pragmatic element plenty of people will like and will choose to use,\" is how one government figure put it to me.Others say if the prime minister really is going to focus on the cost of living when he is addressing domestic policies, he needed to junk unpopular stuff that was getting in the way of that.The opposition parties have piled in with their criticisms, while welcoming the government's change of heart.Here is the political challenge for Downing Street: the climbdowns, dilutions, U- turns, about turns, call them what you will, are mounting up.In just the last couple of weeks, there has been the issue of business rates on pubs in England and inheritance tax on farmers.Before that, among others, income tax, benefits cuts and winter fuel payments.Sir Keir Starmer's critics, external and internal, are taking note.Just hours before this latest backtracking, the Health Secretary Wes Streeting – who'd quite fancy being prime minister himself one day – said it was important the government \"gets it right first time\".That, to put it very politely, is a work in progress for Sir Keir Starmer.",

    "body": "China announced record export numbers for 2025, a year when US President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade policy caused turmoil in the global economy.Beijing on Wednesday reported the world's largest-ever trade surplus - the value of goods and services sold overseas compared to its imports - at $1.19tn (£890bn).It's the first time China's full-year trade surplus has passed $1tn, beating 2024's record figure of $993bn.China's monthly export surpluses passed $100bn seven times last year - a sign that Trump's tariff campaign have barely affected its overall trade with the rest of the world.Trade with the US did weaken, but this was made up for by a rise in Chinese exports elsewhere, especially to South East Asia, Africa and Latin America.Wang Jun, the deputy director of China's customs, said during a press conference on Wednesday that the figures are \"extraordinary and hard-won\" given the \"profound changes\" and challenges in global trade.He noted a rise in exports of green technology, artificial intelligence-related products and robotics.The huge surplus can be explained by strong overseas demand for Chinese goods as trade with global partners including South Asian countries and others in Africa and Europe grew, as well as a weak domestic market.China's economy has been weighed by a property crisis and rising debt, which has made businesses more hesitant to invest and consumers cautious about spending.As a result, there is less of a need to import goods, and imports rose by just 0.5%, according to the new figures.Meanwhile, a weaker yuan, a strong supply of goods and inflation in Western countries have also made Chinese exports more attractive.The results are a \"mixed blessing\" for Beijing, said trade policy analyst Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation.China has benefited from sales and more jobs created from its business abroad, but its goods could face \"greater scrutiny\" from foreign markets that are under pressure to compete with its products, she said.China's success will likely continue in 2026 as Chinese goods and services become more deeply entrenched into global businesses, said Elms.These latest figures will be seen in Beijing as a sign that China has customers all around the world, besides the US, but Wang warned that China faces an uncertain external environment.Several countries have raised concerns that their markets are being flooded with low-priced Chinese products they cannot compete with.Businesses are also bracing for another year of turbulence and tariff tensions from the Trump administration.In April last year, Trump caused turmoil in the global economy by announcing sweeping tariffs on goods from more than 90 countries. Some of the most severe tariffs were reserved for China, which exports more to the US than any other country.An escalating war of words between the world's two largest economies saw threats of blanket triple-digit tariffs.At the time, trade experts saw this as a test of China's reliance on the US market, which Beijing insisted was just one of many places that Chinese businesses could sell to.Both sides managed to pause hostilities after a meeting between Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, avoiding a complete breakdown in trade relations.Other more moderate tariffs remain in place, which have severely dampened Chinese exports to the US.",

    "body": "Sebastian Ofner made a sorry exit from Australian Open qualifying after forgetting the rules and celebrating victory early - before going on to lose the match.The Austrian thought he had clinched victory over Nishesh Basavareddy at 7-1 in the third-set tie-break and raised his arms in celebration, pointing at his head as he walked towards the net to shake hands with his American opponent.However, final-set tie-breaks are played to 10 points, meaning he still needed another three points to win.Ofner only realised his mistake when the umpire briefly spoke to him.Basavareddy then reeled off eight of the next nine points on the way to winning 4-6 6-4 7-6 (13-11) and advancing to the final round of qualifying at Melbourne Park.The 20-year-old held his hands to his neck in a 'choking' gesture before letting out a roar of celebration.\"In a super [match] tie-break, you always have a chance, so I kept believing,\" Basavareddy told the Australian Open website., external\"I saw him tense up a little bit, but the balls were quite old there, so every rally was a war.\"Basavareddy will face Britain's George Loffhagen for a place in the Australian Open main draw.Loffhagen was leading the qualifying eighth seed Yoshihito Nishioka 6-3 3-1 when the Japanese player retired with an injury.Britain's Arthur Fery beat Australian former world number 17 Bernard Tomic 6-4 6-2 to set up a meeting with Croatia's Dino Prizmic.But Harriet Dart's hopes are over after she lost a deciding third set to Thailand's Lanlana Tararudee in a 6-0 3-6 6-3 defeat.Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley are already in the men's main draw, while Emma Raducanu, Francesca Jones, Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter will feature in the women's singles.The tournament begins on Sunday, 18 January.Earlier, British number two Norrie was denied a quarter-final place at the Auckland Classic by Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.World number 28 Norrie, a two-time runner-up at the event, had a match point in the 10th game of the third set but fell to a 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-4) defeat.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRegan Morris,Los Angeles, CaliforniaandChristal Hayes,Los Angeles, CaliforniaSport fans will be able to sign up from Wednesday for a chance to attend the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games - with tickets starting at $28 (£20.80).Registration opens at 07:00 local time (15:00 GMT) for fans to enter a random ticket draw covering all events that will take place at the Games. The window will remain open until mid-March. If chosen, fans will be notified via email and will be given a time slot to purchase tickets in April. One million of those tickets will sell for $28, and about one-third are set to cost less than $100 (£74.41).\"These Games belong to everyone,\" Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2028 said on Tuesday. \"These Games have to be affordable and inclusive.\"The announcement of affordable ticket prices come after the price of tickets for the 2026 men's football World Cup - which will also be hosted in the US, as well as Canada and Mexico - received some public criticism. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, LA officials said affordability and accessibility were central to their ticketing plan - and their hope that sport fans around the globe would be able to attend. Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at $27.95 (£20).A special early purchase window will also be open for residents in the Los Angeles area and Oklahoma City, where some Olympic Games are also being held.2028 will be the first time the Olympics will be held in the US since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics - in 1932 and 1984 - and plans to use its already established infrastructure to host the Games. Event organisers, along with hundreds of Olympians and Paralympians, gathered at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday for a ceremonial lighting of the Olympic venue's cauldron ahead of the opening of ticket registration. The Coliseum hosted events on both the previous occasions that the Olympics were held in LA, and it is set to co-host the opening ceremony along with track and field events in 2028. Organisers at the event on Tuesday explained how the ticketing would work. Once registered - using their name, email and zip code - fans will be entered into the random draw for time slots to buy tickets in April. The earlier slot a fan is given, the better their chances at securing tickets - as being given a time slot does not guarantee that there will be tickets available once a time slot is open.The first set of tickets will be up for purchase from 9-19 April. Admission for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games will be among the tickets on offer.Most of the Games will be held across Los Angeles and southern California, but both canoeing and softball will be held in Oklahoma. LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield called the random ticket-drawing process \"the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged\". \"No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity,\" she added.Registration for tickets will be open until 18 March, and there is no advantage to registering early.",

    "body": "At least 32 killed after crane collapses on train in Thailand9 minutes agoJoel GuintoandJonathan Head,South East Asia Correspondent, BangkokWatch: Emergency responders clamber over mangled train after crane collapseAt least 32 people have been killed and 66 others injured after a construction crane fell onto a moving train in north-eastern Thailand.The crane derailed the train and crushed some of its carriages, one of which caught fire. A one-year-old and an 85-year-old are among those injured, with seven people in critical condition, according to authorities.Officials say some 171 passengers had been onboard the train when the accident occurred at around 09:00 local time (02:00 GMT). The State Railway of Thailand has launched an investigation into the incident and announced that it is taking legal action against the construction company responsible for the crane.Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited said it expressed regret and it would provide compensation and relief to the families of those who died or were injured.The train had been travelling from Bangkok to the north-eastern Ubon Ratchathani province when the accident occurred, carrying mostly students and workers travelling for school and work in other districts.Local outlet The Nation reported that the incident occurred while the crane was lifting a large concrete section which dropped on to the train, causing four coaches to derail.One survivor, train staff member Thirasak Wongsoongnern, told local media that he and the other passengers were thrown into the air after the crane fell on them.An eyewitness, Maliwan Nakthon, told BBC Thai that she witnessed the moment the crane collapsed. \"There were small pieces, like fragments of concrete, that started falling,\" she said. \"After those fell, the crane slowly slid down and hit. It struck hard, and then it came down and crushed the train.\"\"The whole incident took less than one minute,\" she added.ReutersConstruction work had been going on when the train travelling past was hitReutersA worker on the train described being thrown into the air at the moment of impactThai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who is due to visit the scene later on Wednesday, called for \"someone [to] be punished and held accountable\" for the incident.\"Accidents like this can only happen due to negligence, skipped steps, deviations from the design, or the use of incorrect materials,\" Anutin said.The crane was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with neighbouring Laos, where a Chinese-built high-speed line is already running to south-western China.Known officially as the Bangkok-Nong Khai HSR Development for Regional Connectivity, the Italian-Thai Development Company is listed as the firm in charge of the Lam Takhong-Sikhio section where the incident took place.The State Railway of Thailand has announced that it is suing the company. The initial cost of damages for the train carriages alone are reported to be more than 100 million baht (US$3.1bn).One of Thailand's biggest contractors, the company was responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake. Last year the company's president and several designers and engineers were charged with professional negligence over that incident. Some have denied wrongdoing. The Chinese embassy in Thailand said that no Chinese construction companies or workers were involved in the collapse, Chinese state media reported.Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations.In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others.Around 150 people have been killed over the past seven years in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.More on this story",

    "body": "ByChief football writerLiam Rosenior's arrival at Chelsea offers him the chance to change the course of Premier League history for English managers and head coaches.Since the Premier League's inception almost 34 years ago, one of its great anomalies is that no English names have appeared on the managerial roll of honour as winners.Howard Wilkinson, now 82 and a long-time elder statesman of the game, was the last Englishman to lift the title with Leeds United in 1991-92, but in the league's previous guise as the First Division.Since then, 12 managers have led their team to Premier League triumph, but no English managers have claimed the coveted crown, the list dominated by proud Scot Sir Alex Ferguson's 13 wins and Catalan Pep Guardiola's six titles at Manchester City.Rosenior, 41, is only the fourth permanent English manager currently in the Premier League after moving from Strasbourg - joining Nottingham Forest's Sean Dyche, Newcastle United's Eddie Howe and Burnley boss Scott Parker.Michael Carrick is taking over from sacked Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, but only until the end of the season, and the fallen Old Trafford giants have a long road back to title aspirations.This small ratio of English managers in the Premier League is way behind Europe's accepted top five leagues when it comes to national representation.Sixteen of the 20 top-flight managers in Italy are Italian, 11 of the 20 in Spain are Spanish, 12 of the 18 in Germany are German and 10 of the 18 in France are French.Including caretakers and interim appointments, there have been 92 non-British and Irish managers in Premier League history.The current table is led by Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, followed by Guardiola at Manchester City and Aston Villa's Unai Emery - three Spaniards.So why has the Premier League eluded English managers - and can anyone end that drought?Ferguson's empire and the foreign greatsThe advent of the Premier League in 1992-93 coincided with Ferguson ending Manchester United's 26-year wait for a title, the first of an unprecedented 13 titles he brought to Old Trafford.Aston Villa, under the management of Ron Atkinson, finished second that season, 10 points adrift. It was a rare case of an Englishman having a brush with this success.Another Scot, Sir Kenny Dalglish, defied the Ferguson trend with Blackburn Rovers in 1994-95 before the Premier League became the adopted home of great European managers.Arsene Wenger was welcomed with headlines asking \"Arsene Who?\" when he docked at Arsenal from Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan on 30 September 1996.Only two foreign Premier League managers, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ruud Gullit, had preceded Wenger, who became a transformational figure with a revolutionary approach.He won three titles - including 'The Invincibles' unbeaten league season in 2003-04 - a record seven FA Cups and six Charity/Community Shields, winning the league and FA Cup double in 1998 and 2002.Chelsea then started a renaissance of their own under 'The Special One' Jose Mourinho, who arrived from Porto in 2004 as a Champions League winner, immediately ending a wait for a title stretching back to 1955.This started the influx of title-winning managers from abroad, such as Italians Carlo Ancelotti, Antonio Conte, Roberto Mancini and Claudio Ranieri, a Chilean in Manuel Pellegrini, then the German Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, who was followed by Dutchman Arne Slot.Dion Dublin, who was in Manchester United's 1992-93 squad, told BBC Sport: \"A lot of the foreign managers that have come over here have had success in Europe and won trophies as well, so maybe they know how to do it. Maybe that's why no English person or manager has won it.\"The Premier League started in 1992, so things have changed a lot since then. I believe an English manager will win the Premier League, no doubt about that. When? I'm not too sure.\"Since 1992, England has proved the outlier in Europe's big five leagues, with 29 Italian wins in Serie A, 24 Germans in the Bundesliga, 23 French winners in Ligue 1 and 14 Spanish winners in La Liga.Have English managers had a chance?Media caption, Pundits on why has no English boss has won the Premier LeagueThe instances of English managers being placed in charge of top clubs is now vastly reduced, although Newcastle United have been willing to trust managers such as Kevin Keegan - the only Englishman since Atkinson to finish runner-up when they conceded a 12-point lead to Manchester United in 1995/96 - and now Eddie Howe.They have had the highest-placed English manager in nine seasons in the Premier League, compared to Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa's three.Former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp has finished as the highest-ranked English manager in the Premier League five times, ahead of Howe on four then Sam Allardyce and Sir Bobby Robson, both on three occasions.So is the dearth of English Premier League winners down to lack of opportunity - or simply not being as good as those parachuted in from abroad taking the elite jobs?Rosenior landed at Chelsea through a new route, getting his chance at Chelsea through the club's multi-ownership model with parent company BlueCo.Would Rosenior, sacked by Hull City in May 2024 then leaving Strasbourg in seventh place in Ligue 1, have been considered by Chelsea without involvement in that set-up?Wayne Rooney, who was assisted by Rosenior when manager at Derby County, said: \"Young English managers don't really get that chance and he's gone and he's put the work in.\"For young English coaches, well, I think it's massive. We don't really see English managers at big clubs, so he'd be leading the way for us.\"Tony Pulis, who pitted his wits against the great European managerial names at Stoke City, believes there is one main reason why the Premier League's list of winning managers has no English names.\"I would ask how many English managers have managed the top clubs in the past 25 years,\" he told BBC Sport. \"This is why no English manager has won it.\"You look at the clubs who have won multiple titles in that time. The teams are there, and the players are there, to win the title, but it's usually been a foreign manager picking the team. If you haven't got the best team, and the best players, you are not going to win the Premier League.\"Gary O'Neil, who has succeeded Rosenior at Stasbourg after managing AFC Bournemouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers, has a different view, saying: \"I think it will be easy to say that English managers don't get given the opportunity, but I don't think that's the full truth and completely accurate.\"I think the Premier League is the best league in the world, the most competitive league in the world with the most money, and as English coaches you need to earn that opportunity. You know no-one's giving people top jobs as a favour. You have to earn those top jobs, and some of the coaches that have come over here and been successful are at a very, very high level.\"Which English manager can end the drought?Rosenior looks best placed given the resources, talent and willingness to invest at Chelsea - but others have hopes for Eddie Howe and Frank Lampard.Howe won Newcastle's first domestic trophy for 70 years, and their first silverware for 56 years, when they beat Liverpool in last season's Carabao Cup final. He has also taken them into the Champions League for a second time.Lampard's managerial career is undergoing a successful rebuild at Championship leaders Coventry City after two spells at former club Chelsea, as well as Derby County and Everton.Former Manchester United and England defender Phil Jones told BBC Sport: \"I think the number one would be Eddie Howe. \"The job that he did at Bournemouth was incredible, what he's done now at Newcastle - and I think given time, given the squad, given the licence to go about it and have a real go at it and a real shot at it, I think he could potentially be the one to get over the line.\"He's managed big egos for a long period of time and as a manager you've got to be able to manage up, you've got to be able to manage down. I like the way he sees football, so I think he's got a great chance.\"Dublin, added: \"I think Frank Lampard is at the top of the list along with Sean Dyche at the moment. Whether they're going to do it at the clubs they are at now or whether they get a move or they get poached we don't know.\"O'Neil said: \"I do think it will be done. I do think we will get an English one that manages to get themselves a top job and find that momentum and get over the line, but it is obviously a very, very difficult task. So difficult to do - but I do believe it will be done at some point.\"Graphics produced by Joe BradshawPremier LeagueFootball",

    "body": "23 hours agoJemma CrewandFaarea Masud,Business reportersEPA/ShutterstockUS President Donald Trump has said countries doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff on trade they do with America.It comes as Iran cracks down on anti-government protests, with thousands of people feared dead.Trump has used the threat of tariffs before to exert pressure on countries. Here's what we know so far.   What do we know about the tariff? Not a huge amount. On Monday Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Effective immediately, any country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. \"This order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"The president has not gone into any detail beyond that.Follow live updatesDecision time for Trump on Iran but what does he ultimately want?Why are there protests in Iran and what has Trump said about US action?Which countries trade with Iran?Of the 100-plus countries that trade with Iran, China is its biggest export partner.In the year to October 2025, it bought more than $14bn (£10.4bn) of products from Iran, according to figures from Trade Data Monitor which are based on statistics from the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration.China is followed by Iraq, which received $10.5bn worth of goods from its neighbour. Iran also counts the United Arab Emirates and Turkey among its largest customers.In fact, exports from Iran to Turkey jumped substantially from $4.7bn in 2024 to $7.3bn last year.   Almost all of Iran's top 10 exports are fuel-related - it is one of the world's largest oil producers.It also ships food to other nations, including pistachios and tomatoes. However, Iran buys far more staples from its trade partners than it exports.Food makes up about a third of Iran's imports, in particular corn, rice, sunflower seeds and oils as well as soybeans.     But Iran's biggest import is gold.In the 12 months to October, it imported $6.7bn worth of gold compared to $4.8bn in the year before.How could the tariff be implemented?Trump's post says the 25% tariff is \"effective immediately\", and the order is \"final and conclusive\".However, there has been no detail as yet from the White House as to how it would work in practice, or which countries specifically it would apply to.We don't know if it would cover all countries who deal with Iran or just its biggest trade partners. It is also unclear whether the 25% tax will come on top of existing tariffs the Trump administration has already imposed. The US has also not specified under what law the new tariff would be introduced. Sweeping tariffs announced last April were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.But this is currently subject to legal challenge - with the US Supreme Court due to rule as soon as Wednesday. On Monday Trump said the US would be \"screwed\" if these tariffs aren't upheld.Enforcing the proposed tariff could be difficult. Iran is estimated to have made billions from oil exports in 2024 using a fleet of shadow ships that are hard to track and by selling its oil in Chinese yuan rather than the more traditional US dollars.How might this affect US-China relations?On the face of it, Trump's announcement risks reigniting the trade conflict between the US and China. If the president meant what he wrote, it would mean Chinese goods sent to the US should immediately be subject to the new 25% tariff.However, these are already subject to an average tariff rate of 30.8%, according to Bloomberg Economics.So will the new tariff be imposed in addition to the current levy? Or will allowances be made?China has previously shown a willingness to push back against what it perceives as disproportionate action by the US. It has done so partly by introducing its own tariffs, but more importantly by announcing restrictions on exports of rare earths, which the US desperately needs for its tech-heavy industries. China currently dominates the global supply, giving it crucial leverage, which helped Beijing reach a temporary trade truce with the US in November that defused tensions.So introducing a new 25% tariff on China now would be highly provocative, and Beijing has already warned it will \"take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests\".Analysts question whether it will actually happen, given the real-world impact of previous Trump announcements not always matching the initial headline.What is happening with Iran's economy?Iran's huge oil reserves make it one of the world's top 10 oil producers and it should be a source of great wealth.However, its economy has been crippled by years of mismanagement of the public finances, a fall in oil sales and biting international sanctions.Many of the country's 92 million people are struggling to afford basics such as food and utilities, and the cost of living is at the heart of the protests seen in recent weeks.Household spending has fallen compared to its 2008 peak, according to BBC analysis, and government restrictions on women's ability to work has pushed the employment rate down from 42.4% two decades ago to around 37%.At the same time things have become more expensive thanks to high inflation, which hit 48.4% in October amid government policy changes that have led to the value of the rial to fall against the US dollar.That makes imports even more expensive. Those are even more important because significant under-investment in the electricity and water systems mean they are unreliable and have undermined government pledges to increase domestic production of everything from food to consumer goods.A reduction of fuel subsidies in December and potentially even less foreign trade due to these latest tariffs means inflation could yet climb higher and push the economy even closer towards collapse.Additional reporting by Theo Leggett and Jonathan Josephs.",

    "body": "Chef 'not embarrassed' by one-star hygiene rating at Michelin-starred restaurant6 hours agoAmy MackrillBBC WalesBBCYnshir Restaurant and Rooms is run by chef Gareth Ward in CeredigionThe chef behind Wales' only two-Michelin-star restaurant has said he is \"not embarrassed\" after it was awarded a one-star hygiene rating.Ynyshir Restaurant and Rooms, near Machynlleth in Ceredigion, which charges nearly £500 per head, received the rating after a visit by food safety officers on 5 November.According to the Food Standards Agency (FSA), a score of one out of five means \"major improvement\" is necessary. But chef patron Gareth Ward, who has featured as a guest judge on MasterChef: The Professionals, said the restaurant was working \"at the highest standard in the world\" and doing \"something different\" with how it approaches raw ingredients and techniques. Ynyshir offers a high-end dining experience starting at £468 per person, including a 30-course tasting menu and an in-house DJ. It remains Wales' only restaurant with two Michelin stars after it was given the prestigious award in 2022.The Michelin Guide describes it as \"a truly unique experience\", adding: \"The evening starts early, which gives chef-owner Gareth Ward five hours to take diners on a playful culinary journey around the globe.\"He has a particular reverence for Japanese cuisine, with sashimi and A5 Wagyu beef likely to appear on the surprise menu of around 30 vibrant servings, all using outstanding produce prepared with superb craft.\"According to the inspection results, published on the FSA website, the restaurant's management of food safety required \"major improvement\", while the cleanliness and condition of facilities and the building also needed improvement. 'Hygienic food handling' was rated \"generally satisfactory\".Ward told the BBC one of the things inspectors had questioned was the restaurant's use of raw ingredients.\"We buy in the best ingredients from around the world and a lot of it I serve raw,\" he said.\"I'm buying sashimi-grade fish from Japan and they're questioning, 'well, we don't know the water, so how do we know it's sashimi grade?'\"Well, it is sashimi grade, this stuff's eaten raw all over the world and, just because our rules don't fit their rules, they're questioning it.\"He said some of his aged ingredients had also been scrutinised, adding: \"I've got a salt chamber for ageing fish but they obviously don't like the idea of ageing stuff.\"Getty ImagesChef Gareth Ward (l) pictured at The Good Food Guide Awards 2023Despite the rating, the chef said he remained confident. \"I'm not embarrassed by it, I'm not upset by it,\" Ward said. \"The people in life that push the hardest and think outside the box and do something different will always have to deal with this kind of stuff.\"My standards never drop below 100%.\"I'm not at all ashamed but I am disappointed. I'm not sat here thinking 'oh my god, I'm embarrassed, I've done something wrong', because we haven't. What we have done is something different.\"Ceredigion council said it stood by the \"professional judgement of its staff in applying UK food hygiene standards\" and would not be commenting further. How do food hygiene ratings work?The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) is operated in partnership between the Food Standards Agency and local authorities.A new food hygiene rating is given to businesses where food is supplied, stored or consumed every time it is inspected by a food safety officer from its local authority. Establishments are rated from zero to five, with five representing \"very good\" and a rating of one meaning \"major improvement is necessary\".Ratings are described as a \"snapshot\" of the hygiene standards found at the time of the inspection, which looks at factors like how food is stored, handled and prepared, as well as the cleanliness of facilities.It also judges how food safety is managed more widely including a business's training, processes and systems.'Highest standard in the world'Ward said he had invested heavily in equipment and laboratory testing to ensure food safety, including a £50,000 freezer which reached temperatures of -80C (-112F). Since the inspection, he said he sent the restaurant's fish away for laboratory testing and that it had \"all come back absolutely clear\".However, he said inspectors were \"not 100% wrong\", adding that an additional hand washing sink had now been installed in the fish preparation area.Ward said paperwork problems had also contributed to the low score. \"Some of our paperwork wasn't right, and that's our fault,\" he said.\"Sometimes you miss stuff or sometimes you write stuff down wrong or forget stuff. I'd need a full-time office worker doing the paperwork to get it perfect every time.\"The chef said Ynyshir also employed the services of a specialist company which made sure the restaurant was complying with required food standards.He said the issues raised had been dealt with \"immediately\" and that a reinspection had been requested but a date has not yet been set.Ward said: \"My restaurant is working at the highest standard in the world and we take what we do very seriously.\"I've got 27 years of experience in what I do. The kitchen is open, everyone can see everything, the place is immaculate.\"More top stories",

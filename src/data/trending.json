    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems6 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them. How will we live?\"We want safety. We go to sleep and wake up afraid.\"Top picture credits: AFP via Getty Images and Anadolu via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Not trying to be as aggressive as Max [Verstappen] or as forceful as other champions might have been in the past – whatever it may be. My style of just trying to be a good person and a good team member.\"The 26-year-old Briton did a lot of talking after climbing out of his car in Abu Dhabi,  where his third-place finish in the 2025 season finale ensured he beat Verstappen to the championship by just two points. That is the way of things in F1, where drivers have to finish their media commitments before getting down to the business of celebrating their success.Among the thousands of words that came out of Norris' mouth, these were among the most fitting comments at the end of a season that has in many ways reflected his journey to the top.It has not been easy. There have been bumps in the road. Some even feel Red Bull's Verstappen would have been a more worthy champion, given his revival in the final third of the season.While Verstappen mounted one of the all-time great comebacks from the start of September, Norris weathered an early rough patch, and rode his own concurrent wave of momentum all the way to ultimate success in Abu Dhabi, in a race that, while tense, always felt like he had it under control.After he celebrated on the podium, where he was drenched in champagne by race-winner Verstappen and McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, as the three title contenders finished at the front just as they had started the race, you could almost feel Norris coming to terms with his achievement in real time as he discussed how he had got to where he had.There were some very touching comments about how much it meant to him to make so many people who were important to him happy, especially his parents and his colleagues at McLaren.\"I feel proud but not because I'm going to wake up tomorrow and go, 'I beat everyone,'\" he said. \"I'm not proud because I get to just say I'm a world champion. I'm proud because I feel like I made a lot of other people happy.\"And as he talked, he began to open up on who he is, his honesty, his determination to be true to himself and his wish to be open about his feelings, even the difficult ones, a trait for which he has been criticised from time to time.\"Could I have gone out and been more of that person you probably want me to be at times? I could have done,\" he said.\"I would have been less proud about it in some ways. So, that's why I'm very happy with myself. I kept my cool, I kept to myself, I kept the focus on myself, and I got the most out of how I am.\"'The struggles turned into strength'Norris started the season as favourite, after McLaren's strong end to 2024, but after winning the first race, he went through a rough patch and Piastri moved into a comfortable lead.Norris was not at one with the car, was finding it difficult to feel the front axle when he was trying to take it to the limit in qualifying. That led to mistakes - even a big crash in Saudi Arabia - and when you start behind in modern F1, you tend to finish there.But he and McLaren worked at it. The team came up with a tweak to the front suspension aimed at improving feel. It was a small thing. It made a small difference, but a barely perceptible one.From there, he slowly improved, began to build momentum, but it was more about the work he was putting in behind the scenes.He knew what he needed to be better at, and he worked on it, on adapting to the car, on not being alarmed that it felt slightly different from what he wanted.It was a mental approach as much as a change in driving, and slowly it began to make a difference.\"It started after I had that kind of bad run in race two, three, four, five, six, that kind of area,\" he said. \"Or certainly when it was like, 'All right, my way is not working. I've got to understand things differently. I've got to speak to more people. I've got to understand what I'm thinking, why I'm thinking it. Why am I doing this? Why am I getting tense in qualifying? Why am I making the decisions that I'm making?' Whatever it may be.\"Certainly, the bad run of results and lack of performance - not speed, because I think the speed's always there - but lack of putting things together when I had the capability of putting things together, allowed or opened up the doors to go and understand: \"OK, I need to do more than just try again next weekend. I need to try and understand things on a deeper level.'\"That opened up understanding myself more, understanding things more at a championship level. That's the level I've got to be at. \"And yes, certainly the struggles turned into strength. So I would say, if I didn't have those struggles at the beginning and then had the weakness at the end, would I have caught on to those things as quickly? Probably not.\"Media caption, A young Norris shares ambition to be world championHe was 34 points adrift of Piastri after the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August, with only nine races remaining. That was when the run of form that ultimately took him to the title started.But while the outside perception was that this had freed Norris up and allowed him to just go for it, he says it was the opposite.\"No, it didn't allow me to relax,\" he said. \"Thirty-four points against a guy who had the same car, who was doing an incredible job, who I know is incredibly great, it didn't fill me with confidence and (make me) think I have nothing to lose now.\"I just had to step up, what I was doing away from the track, the people I was working with. I had to involve people to that group, I had to work harder, I was on a simulator, I had to change my approaches, I had to change my style of driving, I had to dig deep, to unlock more of my ideas.\"I'm trying to understand more things quicker, in a more advanced way than I ever have before.\"Team principal Andrea Stella said: \"The level of Formula 1 drivers nowadays is so high, to compete at this level, the only way to stay in the quest is to keep evolving continuously.\"If I look at Lando, definitely there was a lot that was taken away from the quest last year, even if it didn't go to the last race. I think Lando elevated his sense of, almost his status, like, 'I can compete with Max.'\"This season there was another important turning point, which is the way Lando, and we talk specifically about him for a moment, responded to the difficulties we had at the start of the season. There was the start of a process which was structured, it was holistic, it was involving the personal development, professional, driving, racecraft.\"It makes me particularly glad that Lando could capitalise on this, because this has been something that not necessarily I've seen many times before, in terms of the amount of work, the people involved, and the rate of development.\"For Stella's boss, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown, this was a personal achievement as well as a professional one. Brown started backing Norris on a management level when he was 14, supported him through the junior ranks and brought him to McLaren.\"I remember when he was about that big. The management he has around him have done an awesome job bringing him up to be the mature world champion that he now is. And it's a great accomplishment. It's very rewarding.\"'I missed Lando growing up'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris embraces his mother Cisca with his manager Mark Berryman in the backgroundFor his family, there have been sacrifices, as his Belgian mother Cisca told BBC Radio 5 Live after the race.\"It's overwhelming, emotionally draining,\" she said, \"but we backed Lando during all the good and bad times. We always stood on his side, and not just Lando, but it was all the children. It's a dream come true for Lando.\"We didn't push the children; they had chosen what they wanted to do, and we supported them. It does take sacrifices, because the girls and the boys have been growing up almost separate. It was passing ships in the night. They chose what they wanted to do and we supported it.\"It takes its toll because I missed Lando growing up. When he was eight, he started to compete. It took him all over the place, but Adam (Norris' dad) stood on his side, and I missed him badly. I am still missing him. I don't see him often. \"He can do what he wants. He is a grown-up man, and the last six months, he has changed and become stronger in his mind as well.\"As he came to the end of his remarks post-race, Norris was still reflecting on the difficulties, and how they had helped turn adversity into the ultimate success.\"If I look back at it from the first half of the season,\" he said, \"not the most impressive.\"Certainly times I've made some mistakes, I've made some bad judgments, I've made my errors.\"But how I managed to turn all of that, and have the second half of the season that I had, is what makes me very proud, that I've been able to prove myself wrong. That makes me very happy.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris' McLaren team have won the constructors' championship in the past two seasons",

    "body": "Overwhelmed by Christmas already? How to get better at saying noImage source, Getty ImagesByGyasi B-HibbertBBC NewsUpdated 1 hour agoThe winter holiday period is meant to be joyful, yet for many of us it comes with a heavy mix of responsibilities and social pressure to go to parties and events we don't want to.Agreeing to something we don't want to do is a feeling that we've all experienced. It can manifest in physical responses like a tight stomach, a dry mouth, or even a higher heart rate.Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, hosts of the BBC's What's Up Docs wellness podcast, say they've both been affected. \"We both get the wobbly voice.It's so hard to go, 'actually, I don't want to do this thing you're asking me to do. I don't want to go along with the thing we're all expected to go along with,'\" says Dr Xand on What's Up Docs.But getting more comfortable with saying no may be the first step to taking more control over our lives.\"Whether you're eight or 80, saying no, and sticking up for what you believe in is actually quite important for your mental health,\" says Dr Xand.Behavioural scientist Dr Sunita Sah suggests three ways to get better at it. Should you say 'no' more often?The doctors explore the psychology behind our reluctance to turn things down, and how we can become more comfortable protecting our boundaries.1. Realise it's okay to say noSaying no can feel uncomfortable. Many of us were brought up to do as we were told, and as adults we struggle to go against how we've been raised.\"We equate compliance with good and defiance with bad,\" says Dr Sah. \"Children get lots of training in compliance, but they need to receive training in defiance too.\"Reshaping how we view and define saying no is key. Seeing it as a positive act instead of a negative one can be instrumental in taking greater control over decisions.\"To defy is to act in accordance with your true values, especially when there is pressure to do otherwise.\"When deciding whether to say yes or no, the question to ask is whether you're going against your values.These are often expressed as single, powerful words like integrity, compassion, or equality. But we may struggle to enact them in daily life.Establishing your values is the first step towards upholding them. \"If we write them down, research shows we are more likely to act in alignment with them,\" says Dr Sah.2. Ask for more time Image source, Getty ImagesIf you don't need to answer immediately, then ask for more time. Dr Sah emphasises the importance of becoming comfortable with asking for a pause.Phrases such as \"Let me think on this\" or \"That's really interesting, let me get back to you\" can be highly effective in buying time to evaluate whether you truly want to undertake the task.\"We know that with any sales pitch, you want to get either some physical distance or some psychological distance between you and the person asking the question.\"We can get that psychological distance from talking to ourselves and asking, 'Do you really want to do this?'\" she says.Creating some physical space between yourself and the person asking the question can also be instrumental in making an informed decision. Dr Sah has previously spoken about how making the decision in private gives us the space to change our mind.3. Practise on your neighbourIf you find it difficult to say no, then practising in low-stake scenarios can help. We make decisions every day, most of them quite small. Things like an invite to your neighbour's house, lending an item or stopping to speak with a salesperson are all perfect opportunities.\"It's not a glamorous act of defiance. It's not standing up to your sexist or racist boss, but it's still necessary to do the less glamorous but still important self-protected bits of defiance,\" says Dr Xand.\"We can lean into those situations where we found it easier to defy and think about what made it easy for me in that situation and use that in other situations,\" adds Dr Sah.When it comes to the important situations – where agreeing would violate something that matters to you – you can then be more confident saying no.Image caption, Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "1 hour agoEmma Saunders,Culture reporterandChi Chi Izundu,Investigations correspondentPA MediaFormer BBC Radio 1 and Capital Xtra DJ Tim Westwood has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, sexual assault and indecent assault at a court hearing in London.The 68-year-old is charged with four counts of rape, nine counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. The charges relate to seven women, some as young as 17 years old, with the allegations spanning 1983 to 2016.Three of the accounts of indecent assault are alleged to have taken place in BBC studios in 1996. Mr Westwood hosted shows on Radio 1 between 1994 and 2013.He appeared at Southwark Crown Court on Monday morning and was granted bail until his trial, which is due to begin in January 2027.In court, he dressed in black jeans and a burgundy shirt, and only spoke to confirm his name and enter his pleas.He is charged with the following offences:In 1983, a 17-year-old girl was allegedly indecently assaulted in the Fulham area of London.In 1986, a woman in her 20s was allegedly indecently assaulted in the Vauxhall area of London.Between 1995 and 1996, a female between the age of 17-18 was allegedly raped in London. It is also alleged that the same woman was indecently assaulted in central London within the same timeframe.Between 2000 and 2001, a female between the age of 17-18 was allegedly raped and indecently assaulted in London.In 2010, a woman in her 20s was allegedly raped in London.In 2010, a woman in her 20s was allegedly sexually assaulted in Stroud.In 2016, a woman in her 20s was allegedly sexually assaulted in the Finchley area of London.Mr Westwood was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and, after leaving Radio 1, hosted a show on Capital Xtra until 2022.",

    "body": "A water leak at the Louvre museum in Paris has damaged hundreds of works, just weeks after thieves stole priceless French crown jewels from the museum in broad daylight.The museum's deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, said between 300-400 works, mostly books, were affected by the leak - and that the count was ongoing. Mr Steinbock told French media the damage occurred in the Egyptian department and that the volumes are \"those consulted by Egyptologists\", but that \"no precious books\" were affected. The problem that caused the leak, which was discovered in late November, had been known for years, and repairs are scheduled for next year, Mr Steinbock added.The volumes will be dried, sent to a bookbinder and restored before being returned to the shelves.Mr Steinbock described the books as \"Egyptology journals\" and \"scientific documentation\" from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \"No heritage artefacts have been affected by this damage,\" Mr Steinbock told the Agence France-Presse news agency.He added: \"At this stage, we have no irreparable and definitive losses in these collections.\"The leak is the third major issue faced by the museum - which is the most visited in the world - in as many months. In November, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices, and on 19 October, four burglars made off with jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring security gaps. The jewels still haven't been recovered, and the museum has since moved some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.A report published in October by France's public audit body, known as the Cour des Comptes, criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was \"to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings.\" ",

    "body": "Severe weather warnings including an amber warning have been issued ahead of Storm Bram which is forecast to hit the United Kingdom on Tuesday and Wednesday.Gusts of up to 90mph (144km/h) are likely across north-west Scotland but strong winds will be felt widely.Heavy rain will also lead to localised flooding particularly in Wales and south-west England where ground conditions remain saturated from recent rainfall.There is the possibility of damage and transport disruption.Storm Bram - named by Met Eireann, Ireland's equivalent of the Met Office - develops rapidly on Tuesday, moving north to the west of the UK but bringing heavy rain and strengthening winds for all.The strongest winds will be around Irish Sea coasts and up to the north-west of Scotland where severe gales are possible later on Tuesday.A Met Office amber warning for wind, valid from 16:00 to 23:59 BST Tuesday covers north-west Scotland where gusts of up to 90mph (144km/h) are possible for a few locations.Impacts will include delays and cancellations to some of the transport network as well as damage to some buildings.Yellow warnings have also been issued.  The first comes into force across west Wales and south-west England from 22:00 Monday to 16:00 BST Tuesday with wind gusts widely 40-50mph (64-80km/h).But additionally, yellow warnings will cover Northern Ireland from 09:00 to 21:00 GMT on Tuesday and much of Scotland and north-west England from 12:00 Tuesday to 06:00 GMT on Wednesday.Gusts of 50-60mph (80-97km/h) will be felt widely but exposed coastal areas and higher ground could locally see gusts more than 70mph (113km/h).Travel disruption and damage is also possible in these areas.As well as strong winds, Bram will also bring some heavy rain into Tuesday.In addition to the warnings for wind, there is a yellow Met Office warning for rain across much of Wales and south-west England from 18:00 Monday to 18:00 GMT Tuesday.20-40mm (0.8-1.6in) of rain is expected widely with up to 80mm (3.2in) over Dartmoor and the higher ground of Wales.The Met Office suggest there is a small chance of up to 100mm (3.9in) on the more exposed and prone hills.After weeks of heavy rain at times, with the ground so saturated, there is the risk of further localised flooding.More yellow weather warnings for rain cover north-west England from midnight to 15:00 GMT Tuesday and central Scotland from 06:00 to 12:00 on Tuesday where there could be a lot of rain falling over a short period of time.Up to 80mm (3.2in) is expected over the Cumbrian hills in particular which could lead to some flooding.The main area of rain will clear away to the north-east during Tuesday.But, rain and strong winds are likely to continue especially across Scotland into Wednesday.Over the last few months the UK has seen Storm Benjamin and Claudia which were named by France and Spain respectively.So far we have only experienced one storm named by the UK Met Office and our storm naming group - Storm Amy. That is why we go back to the 'B' name - Bram - on the UK, Ireland and Netherlands storm naming list.The next storm after Bram would be named Chandra if medium or high impacts are expected.",

    "body": "5 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentandJoel GuintoJapan has protested after Chinese fighter jets locked radars on Japanese aircraft as tensions between the two nations worsened.Locking radar onto an aircraft is considered a threat because it can signal a potential attack. Japan said there were two such incidents Saturday off its southern Okinawa islands.Japan said it scrambled fighter jets in response to the Chinese J-15 fighter jets, while Beijing accused Tokyo of \"harassing\" its forces during a training exercise. No injuries or damage were reported.Diplomatic ties between Japan and China have spiralled since last month, after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile rhetoric towards each other, with the widening rift affecting daily life for citizens in both countries.Last week, China and Japan's coast guards gave conflicting accounts of a confrontation near disputed islands in the East China Sea.A Japanese defence ministry official said the intention of the Chinese J-15 jets was \"unclear\", but added that there was \"no need\" to lock on to the Japanese planes if their intention was to locate other aircraft.The J-15 jets, which were launched from China's Liaoning aircraft carrier, first locked its radar on Japanese jets at 16:32 local time on Saturday (07:32 GMT) and again at around 18:37.The official added that the Japanese aircraft \"did not do anything that could be considered a provocation\".\"It is extremely regrettable. Japan has strongly protested to the Chinese side, and we firmly requested measures to prevent recurrence,\" Takaichi told reporters Sunday in Wajima, Ishikawa prefecture.\"We will respond calmly and resolutely,\" she said.The Chinese navy however said Japan's claim was \"completely inconsistent with the facts\" and told Tokyo to \"immediately stop slandering and smearing\". It added that its training exercise in the area had been previously announced.This comes two weeks after Japan scrambled aircraft when a suspected Chinese drone was detected off Yonaguni, island near Taiwan. Tokyo has said it is planning to deploy missiles from Yonaguni in a move that has angered Beijing.A month of heightened tensions have seen China ask its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan.China has also banned the importation of seafood from Japan and suspended the screening of popular Japanese films.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPanisa Aemocha,BBC Thai, BangkokandKelly NgWatch: Thousands flee Thailand-Cambodia borderResidents on both sides of Thailand's and Cambodia's border evacuated in droves on Monday as fresh clashes erupted, killing at least five people.Both sides have each accused the other of starting the violence, which is the most serious confrontation between the two countries since they agreed to a ceasefire in July.Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul says his country \"never wanted violence\" but will \"use necessary means to preserve its sovereignty\", while Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen accused Thai \"invaders\" of provoking retaliation.Since May, escalating tensions between the neighbours have led to more than 40 deaths, as well as import bans and travel restrictions.ReutersResidents living at the border evacuate in droves as fresh clashes erupted on MondayOn Monday, the Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani Province, including by launching air strikes along the disputed border; while Phnom Penh's defence ministry said it was the Thai forces that attacked first, in Cambodia's Preah Vihear province.At least one Thai soldier and four Cambodian civilians have been killed, and about a dozen wounded as a result of Monday's fighting, according to officials on either side.For Thai teacher Siksaka Pongsuwan, though, there are other, hidden victims of the clashes: the children living near the border, he warns, are \"losing opportunities and... precious time\" compared to their peers living in relatively peaceful cities.Children bearing the bruntNearly 650 schools across five Thai provinces have been ordered to shut for safety reasons, Thailand's education minister said, following the fresh tensions that have simmered since Sunday.Meanwhile, videos on social media show chaotic scenes at schools in Cambodia's border provinces as parents rushed to take their children home.And this is not the first time these children have had their education interrupted in recent months.Siksaka PongsuwanSiksaka Pongsuwan says he and his neighbours on the Thai side of the border are torn about whether to evacuateIn July, in the midst of the children's examinations, five days of intense fighting broke out between the two nations. In the aftermath, Pongsuwan's school switched to online classes, but not all students could access them - some lived in households with no internet, while iPads distributed by the schools did not reach everyone.In Cambodia, former journalist Mech Dara shared several clips of children frantically running out of their schools on his X account.\"How many times [do these] kids have to suffer the shocking environment?\" he wrote. \"The nonsense fighting bring kids [a] horrible nightmare.\" He also shared a picture of a boy, still in his school uniform, having some food in an underground bunker. \"Why does the kid and his family have to eat their meal in the bunker...?\" he wrote.Meanwhile, Pongsuwan told the BBC that he and his neighbours are now torn about whether to evacuate - even as gunfire can be heard every now and then in his village.\"If you ask whether we're scared, yes we are... Should we leave? Will it really be safer? Or should we stay?\" he tells the BBC.Where the latest clashes have broken outA century-old dispute, reignitedThe century-old border dispute between the South East Asian nations dramatically escalated with a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand on the morning of 24 July, followed by Thai air strikes.Days later, Bangkok and Phnom Penh agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. In October, both sides signed a ceasefire agreement during a ceremony with US President Donald Trump in Malaysia. At the time, Trump claimed a historic achievement in ending the border conflict.But just two weeks after that signing, Thailand said it would suspend the implementation of the agreement, after two of its soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion near the Cambodian border.Cambodia, which nominated Trump for a Nobel peace prize for his role in brokering the ceasefire, has repeatedly claimed it is committed to the deal.Thailand and Cambodia have been contesting territorial sovereignty along their 800km land border for more than a century, since the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Koh Ewe",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump has flagged potential concerns over Netflix's planned $72bn (£54bn) deal to buy Warner Brothers Discovery's movie studio and popular HBO streaming networks.At an event in Washington DC on Sunday, he said Netflix has a \"big market share\" and the firms' combined size \"could be a problem\".On Friday, the two companies said they had reached an agreement to bring Warner Brothers' franchises like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones to Netflix, creating a new media giant.The planned deal, which has raised concerns among some in the industry, is yet to be approved by competition authorities. The BBC has contacted Warner Bros, Netflix and the White House for comment.Launched in 1997 as a postal DVD rental business, Netflix has grown to become the world's largest subscription streaming service. The deal, the biggest the film industry has seen in a long time, would cement its number one position.Under the agreement several global entertainment franchises, such as Looney Tunes, The Matrix and Lord of the Rings, would move to Netflix.The deal is expected to be completed after Warner Bros splits its business in the second half of 2026.The US Justice Department's competition division, which oversees major mergers, could contend that the deal violates the law if the combined businesses account for too much of the streaming market.At an event at the John F Kennedy Center in the US capital, Trump said that Netflix has a \"very big market share\" which would \"go up by a lot\" if the deal goes ahead.Trump added he would be personally involved in the decision on whether or not to approve the deal and repeatedly highlighted the size of Netflix's market share.He also said that Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently visited the Oval Office and praised him for his work at the company.\"I have a lot of respect for him. He's a great person,\" said Trump. \"He's done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"Mr Sarandos earlier acknowledged that the agreement may have surprised investors but said it was a chance to position Netflix for success in the \"decades to come\".Blair Westlake, a media executive and former chair of Universal Studios' television and networks group, told the BBC's Today programme that \"the only two pieces that matter\" when it came to competition concerns were the combination of Netflix and Warner Brothers' HBO streaming business.\"Netflix is not in the studio production business the way Warner Brothers is, and even the library size of films and television programming that Netflix owns pales in comparison to Warner,\" he said.However, while the Netflix deal would give it a strong position in video streaming, experts have said it would not look so dominant if regulators adopt a broader definition, to include cable and broadcast TV and also YouTube as competitors.\"A lot of people don't realise that the number one place that consumers in the world go for viewing of content consumption is YouTube, and it's far and away beyond anything else,\" said Mr Westlake.He added he thought the deal would eventually be approved, but \"I think that there will probably be concessions that have to be made\".Bill Kovacic, a former chair of the US competition watchdog the Federal Trade Commission, told the Today programme that Trump's comments meant negotiations over any problems surrounding the deal were \"going to run through the White House\".\"That means that we're going to have probably a deep level, an unprecedented level of presidential control in the resolution of what used to be a technical analysis of a merger,\" he said.Netflix beat several rivals including Comcast and Paramount Skydance to strike an agreement with Warner Bros.Paramount Skydance, which is headed by David Ellison, had previously tried to buy all of Warner Bros, including its cable networks.Warner Bros rejected that approach before putting itself up for sale.David Ellison's multi-billionaire father, Larry Ellison, is a close ally of Trump.The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches called for the merger to be blocked, saying the \"world's largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent.\"\"The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers,\" it said on Friday.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "12 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, TokyoBBCScientists at Waseda University in Tokyo are developing caregiving robotsLast year, more than 18,000 older people living with dementia left their homes and went missing in Japan. Almost 500 were later found dead.Police say such cases have doubled since 2012. Elderly people aged 65 and over now make up nearly 30% of Japan's population - the second-highest proportion in the world after Monaco, according to the World Bank. The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care.Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure.Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who go missing.Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area.In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours.Robot caregivers and AIOther technologies aim to detect dementia earlier.Fujitsu's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups.\"Early detection of age-related diseases is key,\" says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. \"If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer.\"Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a \"future\" caregiver. It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change adult nappies and prevent bedsores in patients.Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken OrdersSimilar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.\"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says.Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.\"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, human connection remains irreplaceable.\"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\"At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.\"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\"Getty ImagesSharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patientsAdditional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

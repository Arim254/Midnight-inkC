    "body": "4 hours agoPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is pictured alongside China's Xi Jinping on most of Friday's papers, following their meeting in Beijing on Thursday. The Financial Times says Sir Keir is seeking to \"restore better relations\" with the Chinese president, at what the paper is calling \"a time of global instability\". The prime minister is also front and centre of the Telegraph, which features a photograph of Sir Keir attending a ceremonial welcome in the Chinese capital, paired with the caption \"Starmer among friends\". The paper has also launched a \"Campaign for democracy\", and leads with a \"revolt\" over cancelled local elections around the UK. Councillors in Norfolk and Welwyn Hatfield have stood down \"in protest\" of the \"axed\" votes, and the Telegraph says others are considering taking similar action.\"Capitulation in Beijing\" declares the Mail, condemning what it says is a trip for the prime minister to \"suck up to\" China. Sir Keir \"gave the go-ahead to China's nest of spies embassy\", the paper says, and will leave China \"virtually empty-handed\". Planning permission for China's controversial new embassy in London was granted earlier this month, after repeated delays. The Chinese embassy previously said: \"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application. This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\"The Guardian says Sir Keir has taken a \"major step towards rapprochement\" with China, opening the door for Xi to visit the UK. The Star takes a lighter approach to the visit, writing \"Great ball of China\" after the prime minister gifted Xi the football used during last weekend's English Premier League match between Manchester United and Arsenal. The Chinese president is reported to be a supporter of Manchester United, while Sir Keir is an Arsenal fan.\"Iranian guard corps to be treated as terrorists by UK\" reads the Times, after the European Union added the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its list of terrorist organisations on Thursday. The group operates separately to Iran's army, and has sworn loyalty to the Ayatollah. According to the paper, the Home Office has been drawing up legislation to enable the ban since last May, but sources have told the Times that is now likely to be brought forward.The i Paper reports that the Home Office is set to deport asylum seekers to Syria, despite concerns about \"violence and deteriorating conditions\" in the \"war-torn\" nation. The shift is part of Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's promised migrant reforms, it says, which have been inspired by similar policies in Denmark.Thieves have targeted a Cheshire property shared by presenter Maya Jama and footballer Ruben Dias, according to the Sun. It reports that the couple are \"devastated\", after clothing, jewellery and clothes were taken from the \"£4m Omaze prize-draw mansion\". The Mirror leads on fresh comments from boxer Anthony Joshua, who has paid tribute to the two friends killed in a car crash that he \"miraculously survived\" at the end of last year. The paper said he referred to the men as his \"brothers\", and said he still couldn't \"get my head around it\".The assisted dying bill leads the Express, which features an interview with a terminally ill mother issuing a \"desperate plea\" to the seven peers blocking the legislation from passing through the House of Lords. The Metro says a London bus driver has been sacked for \"gross misconduct\", after he allegedly chased down and punched a thief who had \"snatched\" a passenger's necklace. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondentFamily HandoutTwo serving British Army officers are to face a court martial over the handling of a case of sexual assault of the teenage soldier Jaysley Beck, who later took her own life.Gunner Jaysley Beck, 19, was found dead at her barracks at Larkhill camp in Wiltshire in 2021. She had complained she had been sexually assaulted. Last October, former Battery Sergeant Michael Webber was jailed for six months for sexual assault.An earlier inquest into her death heard the Army's handling of her complaint had played \"more than a minimal contributory part into her death\".The Army has already issued an apology, saying it was \"profoundly sorry\" for the failings identified at the inquest.The Service Prosecution Authority has now charged two officers in Beck's chain of command.The BBC has been told they are Major James Hook and Colonel Samantha Shepherd, who were both made aware of her complaint before she took her life. After the inquest, Beck's family had written to the head of the Army, General Sir Roly Walker, requesting that further action be taken against both officers.In a statement, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: \"Following an investigation by the Defence Serious Crime Command, we can confirm two individuals have been charged with offences under Section 19 of the Armed Forces Act (conduct prejudicial to good order and service discipline).\"It would be inappropriate to comment further as legal proceedings are ongoing.\"Beck's mother, Leighann McCready, said that \"more than 4 years on from the loss of our daughter we are very relieved to have finally got to this point.\"The MoD has set up a serious crime command and launched a violence against women and girls taskforce, and more recently has agreed in principle to remove the handling of serious complaints from the individual services.",

Mark Anderson, 36, is accused of going to the New York jail where Mangione is being housed and allegedly posing as an FBI agent, a criminal complaint states. He allegedly said he had paperwork that had been \"signed by a judge\" to free the accused killer.Though the complaint does not name Mangione, a law enforcement source told the BBC that Anderson allegedly sought to free him. He appeared before a judge on Thursday but has not entered a plea. The BBC has contacted an attorney said to be representing him. Anderson approached the intake area of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday and is accused of telling officers that he was an FBI agent, the criminal complaint states. He said he had paperwork \"signed by a judge\" to authorise the release of an inmate.When officers asked him for credentials, Anderson provided a Minnesota driver's license, claimed be in possession of weapons, and \"displayed and threw\" what authorities described as \"numerous documents\" at jail staff, according to the complaint. Bureau of Prisons officials then detained Anderson and searched his bag, where they found a large \"barbeque type fork\" with two prongs and a tool that resembles a pizza cutter.The suspect had travelled to New York City for a job opportunity from Mankato, Minnesota, and had been working at a local pizzeria, according to the law enforcement source.Department of JusticeAuthorities searched Anderson's bag after he claimed to have weapons and found these utensils, according to the criminal complaintAnderson is facing a charge of impersonating an officer. Mangione has been held at the Brooklyn jail since 2024. He was arrested in a McDonalds in Pennsylvania after a multi-state manhunt and then extradited to New York. He faces both state and federal charges in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and has pleaded not guilty. Since his arrest, Mangione has attracted a legion of supporters both online and at his court appearances. The killing also launched a debate in the US over healthcare costs.Jury selection for Mangione's highly anticipated federal trial is currently scheduled for September.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoToby MannandChris Mason,Political editorWatch: Trump says it's \"very dangerous\" for UK to get into business with ChinaDonald Trump said it was \"very dangerous\" for the UK to deal with China, as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer continued his visit to Beijing to reset relations.The US president was reacting to agreements aimed at increasing business and investment between the UK and China, announced after Sir Keir met Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of a three-day trip.\"Well it's very dangerous for them to do that,\" Trump said at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania when asked what he thought of Britain increasing business ties with China.In response to Trump's remarks, Downing Street indicated that Washington had been aware of this trip and its objectives in advance.No 10 also pointed out  the US president was due in China himself in April.Trump did not say anything further about the UK's engagement with China, pivoting instead to Canada and delivering a similar warning.He said it was \"even more dangerous, I think, for Canada\".  \"Canada is not doing well. They're doing very poorly, and you can't look at China as the answer,\" he added.Trump earlier this week threatened to impose tariffs on Canada if it went through with economic deals struck with China on a recent visit to Beijing by its Prime Minister, Mark Carney.The comments come after Sir Keir said the UK's relationship with China was in a \"good, strong place\" following his talks with Xi at the Great Hall of the People on Thursday.Sir Keir said on Friday that the \"very good meetings\" with Xi had provided \"just the level of engagement that we hoped for\".\"We warmly engaged and made some real progress, actually, because the UK has got a huge amount to offer,\" he told a meeting of the UK-China Business Forum at the Bank of China in Beijing.Agreements on further co-operation in other areas such as organised crime and illegal immigration were also announced.ReutersSir Keir Starmer delivers remarks at a UK-China Business Forum at the Bank of China, in Beijing on FridayThe chair of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, Chris Torrens, praised Sir Keir's visit to Beijing as \"successful\". Torrens told the BBC it made \"sense for the UK to be looking to China, it's one of its larger trading partners\".He added that other Western leaders had either been to Beijing recently or would do so soon, including Trump, who is expected to visit in April.\"The US are maybe sanctioning and reprimanding other economies and slapping tariffs on countries that are doing deals with China but the US itself may well do a deal with China. In fact we expect that this year,\" Torrens told the BBC. Sir Keir was due to travel to Shanghai, his last stop in China before leaving for Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart, Sanae Takaichi, for a working dinner.Opposition MPs have criticised Sir Keir over the trip to China – the first by a UK leader since 2018.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Sir Keir had \"gone to Beijing to kowtow to President Xi\" and accused the government of trading \"national security for economic crumbs off the Chinese table\".The US was the UK's largest trading partner in 2025, while China was the fourth largest, according to the Department for Business and Trade.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBen HattonBBC NewsPA MediaThe site of a drone attack in Kyiv earlier in January US President Donald Trump says Russia's Vladimir Putin has agreed not to attack Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and other cities and towns for a week due to \"extraordinary cold\" weather. Russia has not confirmed any such agreement, but Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed Trump's announcement and said he expected Russia to keep its promise.Trump did not specify when the pause would begin, but temperatures in the Ukrainian capital are due to plummet from Thursday night and reach -24C (-11F) in the next few days. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the bitter winter, as it has during cold periods since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Speaking at a televised cabinet meeting in Washington DC, the US president said: \"I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that.\"\"It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it,\" Trump added.The Ukrainians, he said, \"almost they didn't believe it, but they were very happy about it because they are struggling badly\". Later on Thursday, in a post on social media, Zelensky said Trump had made an \"important statement\" about \"the possibility of providing security for Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this extreme winter period\". \"Our teams discussed this in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We expect the agreements to be implemented,\" he said. The BBC understands that Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions - pausing its own attacks on Russian oil refineries in response.Last week, Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the UAE for the first trilateral talks since the war began.All sides described the talks as constructive, but there has been no announcement that Russia had agreed to pause its attacks for the duration of the extreme cold currently gripping the region.Instead, attacks have continued, crippling the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or electricity.Electrical companies carry out round-the-clock repairs, but their work can be quickly undone by Russian air attacks. Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJonny HumphriesNorth WestBBCInaayah Makda was struck by a wave as she sat on rocks on a beach in CasablancaA seven-year-old British girl is missing after being swept out to sea on the first day of a family holiday in Morocco.Inaayah Makda, from Blackburn in Lancashire, was hit by a large wave as she and her parents sat on rocks on a beach in Casablanca on Wednesday, her family have said. Her parents Zubair and Tasneem Makda were also knocked into the sea but lost sight of their daughter. Naseem Khan, a presenter for the Blackburn-based UCTV, posted on social media a voice note from Zubair in which he said he was \"praying\" for his daughter to be found but had received little help from the authorities.In the voice note, Zubair said: \"We were just on rocks... that were sort of spread apart. \"It's sort of like half a metre-high type of rocks and that's when the tide just suddenly just swept everyone out. \"Inaayah was on the rock behind me.\"He added: \"I pray she's OK and she's on a rock or something and she's just waiting for somebody to rescue her.\"I just pray she's not gone and she's not left us. He added: \"I've always said that she's a special girl.\"Zubair and Tasneem, described as hard-working professionals, were on their first night of a week-long family holiday when it happened. A relative, who did not wish to be named, said the tide appeared to be a long way out when they first arrived on the beach but came in very quickly - within about 20 minutes - catching them by surprise. \"There were no warnings or signs there for tourists,\" she said. 'We're devastated'The family ended up cut off and surrounded by water, when a wave knocked Inaayah one way and her parents the other, the relative said.She disappeared from view before her father could reach her. The parents, who are still in Casablanca, have reportedly turned to a private search operator with a helicopter to assist with the search. A neighbour of the family, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC Inaayah, a pupil at Roe Lee Park Primary School in Blackburn, was a \"lovely, bubbly, cheeky little girl\".She said she was the only child of her \"hardworking\" parents, and was \"their whole world\".\"We're all just in shock. We're devastated,\" she said.Gillian Wilton, head teacher at Roe Lee Park Primary School, Blackburn, said: \"We are extremely upset to hear the news of Inaayah Makda, who is currently missing in Morocco.\"Our immediate and heartfelt thoughts are with her, her parents and family at this devastating time.\"We will continue to pray for Inaayah's safe return and know that all our school community will have her in their thoughts and prayers.\"The school would also like to offer our continued support to our pupils and parents.\"She asked that parents contact the school if they needed any help and support. Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain said he was \"heartbroken\" by the incident and had been in touch with Inaayah's family. He said: \"I'm aware the family is doing all that they possibly can to locate Inaayah. My understanding is they've been out on the beach all day trying to locate her. \"It's a dreadful and distressing situation and given that they're in a foreign land they deserve all the help that they possibly can obtain.\"He added: \"I am urgently raising this matter with the UK authorities, including the Foreign Office, to ensure every possible step is being taken to support the search efforts and to provide the family with all the assistance they require at this deeply distressing time.\"The Foreign Office said it was \"supporting the family of a British national reported missing in Morocco\" and was \"in contact with local authorities\".More like this",

    "body": "7 hours agoJemma CrewBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAround six million low-income households will continue to receive £150 off their winter energy bills after the government confirmed its Warm Home Discount will remain for five more years.It follows a consultation on how best to continue the scheme, which has been in place since 2011, with eligibility widened last year to include a further 2.7 million families.Ministers said extending the scheme until the winter of 2030/31 would help with the ongoing high cost of living, which has largely been fuelled by a big increase in energy costs.Charities broadly welcomed the continuation, which had been expected, but several said £150 did not go far enough to help struggling households.Energy companies pay for and distribute the £150 Warm Home Discount to people's bills, meaning households who are eligible should get the discount automatically, provided their supplier has over 1,000 customers.The government also said that 345,000 Scottish low-income households would now automatically receive the rebate next winter, bringing Scotland's policy in line with England and Wales.Previously, eligible Scottish households have had to apply for the scheme.The government said a small number of households will need to provide extra information to ensure they get the discount for the current winter period.If they have received a letter advising them to call the helpline they must do so by 27 February, the government said.The Warm Home Discount is separate to £150 on average the government has said households will save on their energy bills from April, as set out by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her November Budget.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has promised to lower energy bills by £300 by 2030. But critics have called this unachievable, and the author of the report his savings estimate was based on has since warned it could be wiped out by rising electricity costs.The latest price cap set by the energy regulator Ofgem rose by 0.2% for the January to March period, following a 2% increase in October.Energy suppliers currently cover the cost of giving the Warm Home Discount to lower-income customers through the standing charge, which is a fixed fee that they charge all customers.But the government is proposing to change this so that suppliers cover the discount with the unit rate – the per-kWh charge for electricity and gas usage – meaning higher-use customers would contribute more to the discount than ones who use less energy. It recently consulted on this, saying it would be \"fairer\" and overall \"average consumers will see bill savings\". It said it will provide an update \"in due course\".'Avoids a damaging cliff edge'Gillian Cooper, Director of Energy at Citizens Advice, welcomed the continuation but urged the government to rethink its plans to change how suppliers cover the  cost as these threaten to \"undermine\" the scheme's impact.\"Moving costs away from standing charges will increase bills for higher energy users, reducing the overall benefit of the discount for those households who need it most.\"Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said keeping it in place \"avoids a damaging cliff edge\" for struggling families, but also \"risks locking in a scheme that we already know doesn't reach everyone who needs help\".Miliband said the continuation of the discount until 2030-31 will \"give families much-needed peace of mind that they will continue to receive vital support, as we take action to bring down bills for good\".Shadow Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho said: \"Most families will see no benefit from this announcement, but despite Ed Miliband promising families he would cut their bills by £300, they are seeing their bills soar thanks to Labour's policies.\"Ned Hammond, deputy director of policy for customers at Energy UK, which represents energy companies, said it will work with the government on \"further changes\" to the scheme. \"[These include] better targeting and tiered support, to ensure that is both directed to those most in need and provides the right level of assistance to really make a difference for customers struggling to afford bills.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoChurch of ScotlandLord Jim Wallace was the 2020 moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandLord Jim Wallace, who served as Scotland's first-ever deputy first minister, has died age 71.The former Scottish Lib Dem leader was undergoing a procedure at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on Thursday, but suffered complications afterwards.His wife Rosie Wallace said their family were \"very shocked\", adding: \"It was all so sudden. He was still incredibly active in a whole host of areas.\"Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton described Wallace as \"one of the architects of modern Scotland\".Flags at the Scottish Parliament are flying at half mast and will be until 20:00 on Friday.Wallace became MP for Orkney and Shetland in 1983, and joined the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as MSP for Orkney.As deputy first minister, he covered Scotland's top job on several occasions, including stepping in following the death of Donald Dewar and the resignation of Henry McLeish.He stepped down as an MSP in 2007 and was appointed to the House of Lords.He sat on Sir Kenneth Calman's commission on devolution, which recommended extending Holyrood's powers. A popular Lib Dem figure, he campaigned with his successor Alex Cole-Hamilton as recently as 2024.PA MediaJim Wallace remained a popular Lib Dem figure and campaigned with his successor Alex Cole-Hamilton in 2024Cole-Hamilton said Wallace was \"one of the finest liberals our party has ever produced\".He said: \"For me personally, he was a mainstay of support throughout my adult life. Even as he went into hospital for the final time, he was still sending me words of advice and I will always try to live up to the standards he set.\"Throughout his career, Jim was widely respected across party lines for his integrity, calm judgement and deep belief in liberal values: fairness, the rule of law and respect for communities, no matter how remote.\"Scotland is a better country because of Jim Wallace, and the Liberal Democrats are a better party because of his example.\"Born in Annan, in Dumfries and Galloway, Wallace went to Annan Academy before attending Cambridge and Edinburgh universities. He was called to the bar in 1979, practising mainly in civil law cases, and became a QC in 1997.First Minister John Swinney said he was \"profoundly shocked\" to learn of Wallace's death and that his contribution to Scotland is \"demonstrated by the success and strength of the Scottish Parliament\".Swinney said: \"Jim helped shape the very first Parliament and he remained an important contributor to Holyrood as a champion of devolution and a strengthened Scottish Parliament.\"I enjoyed and valued a warm personal friendship with Jim and appreciated the immense personal kindness he always showed to me and my family.\"Former First Minister Jack McConnell described Wallace as \"the best of men\".Lord McConnell said: \"His contribution to securing a Scottish Parliament, being the best deputy to three first ministers that any of us could have hoped for, and a fantastic cabinet minister too, will never be matched.\"Honest, reliable and filled with compassion. What a loss he is — but what a difference he made.\"He added: \"I will miss him dearly.\"Henry McLeish, another former first minister, told BBC News that Scotland had lost \"not only a great politician and public servant but one of the finest colleagues I've ever worked with\".He said: \"He was honest. He had vision. He made an enormous contribution to making sure that the parliament we have today is working in the way that all of us imagined some years ago.\"Jim was just a very faithful, committed Scot wanting the best for his country and working in so many different forums to achieve that. Across party lines, across country, he will be sadly missed.\"Politics can be a gruesome business. You know, you can have your ups and downs, your likes and dislikes, but nobody, I think, disliked Jim. And he put his heart into every effort he was involved in. Great Scot, great politician, and in that sense will always be remembered.\"'Served church and state'Wallace was brought up in the Church of Scotland - in which his accountant father was an elder - and religion and politics were inter-related interests and influences throughout his life. In 2021, he took on the role of the moderator of the Church of Scotland.The Kirk's current moderator, the Rt Rev Rosie Frew said she was \"shocked and saddened\" by Lord Wallace's death.She described him as \"kind, accommodating, informative and entertaining\".She added: \"It was both a joy and a privilege to spend time with him and his wife Rosie.\"He served both church and state faithfully and well over many years.\"My thoughts and prayers are with Rosie and their family at this difficult time.\"Wife Rosie said Wallace sang in the Dunblane Cathedral choir over the festive period and was looking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren.She said it \"brings some comfort\" that he had been \"surrounded by those he loved most when he died\".And she added she was \"thankful\" the whole family had been together in Scotland over Christmas when Clare, one of their two daughters, and her family had flown in from New Zealand.",

    "body": "Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family6 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentCCTVDozens of members of the Ming family were sentenced in SeptemberNo-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of a organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in  September.China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to  human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009.They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.Chinese Ministry of Public SecurityMing Zhenzhen and Ming Guoping in the custody of Chinese policeThey remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for \"extraordinary contributions to state development\".His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate \"pig-butchering\" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.Getty ImagesShe Zhijiang, who is accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, was extradited to China last yearDuring interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.",

    "body": "'He enjoyed hurting people': Teen attacked others before murdering schoolboy, 128 hours agoPhil Mackie,at Birmingham Crown CourtandElliot Ball,West MidlandsThe killer was caught on camera at the murder sceneA teenage killer who murdered a 12-year-old boy in Birmingham \"enjoyed hurting people\" and had a history of targeting vulnerable victims.Det Insp Joe Davenport said the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, would attack victims for \"violence sake\".\"He enjoyed hurting people and he enjoyed watching the chaos that unfolded,\" he said.In footage shared by West Midlands Police after the guilty plea, the youth is shown telling an officer how he had found Leo's body and told another member of the public to raise the alarm.Before the murder, the teenager had attacked people in the same area on the 19, 20 and earlier on 21 January 2025 - the same day he killed Leo.In the most serious incident, he beat an elderly woman with her own walking stick and then threw her in a river.Davenport said the killer had targeted people \"he knew he could beat and would easily overpower\". Det Insp Joe Davenport said the killer of Leo Ross had a history of \"targeting vulnerable people\"After stabbing Leo, the killer returned to the scene to observe the aftermath and even spoke with police officers who had responded to the attack. Davenport said they found his behaviour \"odd\" with some interactions standing out as \"being really unusual\".\"For example, he said that he didn't touch him, so he's not involved in the case. Just a really unusual thing to say,\" the officer explained. \"He was wearing dark clothing with his hood up - it felt unusual to be dressed in that way.\"The fact that he's continued to do it and has hung around afterwards, waiting to see what happens, it's like he was enjoying seeing what he's done.\"West Midlands PoliceLeo was walking home from school when he was stabbed Tim Boyes, the acting head teacher at Leo's school at the time, said he had been in the office when the call came through to say a student had been stabbed.\"It was unreal. I've dealt with fatalities before, but never one quite as horrible and shocking as this,\" he said.While at the scene, he said other members of staff had pointed out the youth to him.Paying tribute to Leo, Boyes described him as a \"quirky, lovable\" boy who was passionate about fossils.\"For a 12-year-old he was quite young and he had a naivety and simplicity,\" he said.After the stabbing, West Midlands Police said the killer tried to throw his weapon into the river but it landed on the river bank.The knife was later recovered by police with the killer's DNA on it as well as the DNA of Ross.\"That proved to be the critical evidence in the case,\" said Davenport.

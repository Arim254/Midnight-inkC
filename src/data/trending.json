    "body": "10 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media Editor, Los AngelesBBCTwo-time Oscar winner, Sir Anthony Hopkins tells the BBC that he can't \"take credit\" for his successNot many people can say they've been given a private piano recital by Sir Anthony Hopkins. But that's exactly what happened when our four-strong BBC team went to interview the double Oscar-winning actor in Los Angeles.We were in the same room as the man who terrified as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, shattered as a butler in The Remains of The Day and devastated as a dad with dementia in The Father.An actor who was cast by Oliver Stone as President Nixon because - according to Sir Anthony - the director said \"you're nuts like Nixon\".At a grand piano in a hotel in Beverly Hills, as he plays us a piece he calls Goodbye, it's clear an artistic soul exudes from his every pore. Haunting notes of music, lines of poetry and Shakespearean verses cascade out of him.A private piano recital with Sir Anthony HopkinsWe were meeting because Sir Anthony's publishing his autobiography, We Did OK, Kid, an honest and at times upsetting account of a loner who was bullied and written off as a child in Wales and became one of Britain's finest acting exports.He puts his success down to sheer luck, telling me: \"I couldn't take credit for any of it, I couldn't have planned any of this - and now at 87, about to turn 88, I get up in the morning and I think, 'Hello, I'm still here,' and I still don't get it.\"From the outside, it looks less about luck and more about his deep understanding of human emotion, as his performances testify. I ask what makes him such an instinctive actor.\"It's such a miracle being alive,\" he says. He finds the complexity of human beings \"fascinating... I mean, how can you produce Beethoven, Bach and then Treblinka and Auschwitz?\"Sir Anthony has always understood the duality of being human, and it explains his acting range.He got his first break on film when the actor Peter O'Toole suggested he audition for the 1968 movie The Lion in Winter, in which O'Toole was playing Henry II.At that point, Sir Anthony had been a member of Sir Laurence Olivier's National Theatre company for several years. But, he recalls: \"I couldn't fit into the British theatre style, I just felt out of it.\"He also \"didn't want to be standing on stage holding a spear for the rest of my life, in wrinkled tights, I just wanted to have a bit of a life\".He was cast as Richard the Lionheart and couldn't believe that a baker's son from Port Talbot was working with Katharine Hepburn.The actress, playing his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, gave him \"the best advice I've had\" as they rehearsed their first scene together. She told him to \"just speak the lines... Don't act, just do it\". She also said he was \"real good\".Hepburn was right, of course. Some classically trained theatre actors, particularly back then, didn't appreciate how much they needed to adjust their performance for the intimacy of a camera. He did.He doesn't much care for talking about the craft of acting, or certainly the reverence there can be around it, but he shares his method with me: \"Be still. Be economic. Don't act or twitch around, you know, 'showing off' acting... simplify, simplify, simplify'.\"Hollywood PicturesDirector, Oliver Stone (L) told a reluctant Sir Anthony that he wanted him to play Nixon because he was \"nuts\" like President NixonHis performances stand out because he's an actor of huge emotional depth and psychological insight. Think of him as Dr Treves, the friend and protector of John Hurt's Elephant Man. Or as Lecter, still for me the most terrifying of characters more than 30 years on. The serial killer is a monster but Sir Anthony understood that less is more, on screen.Getty ImagesSir Anthony and Jodie Foster both won Oscars for their roles in The Silence of the LambsInstead of playing Lecter as obviously monstrous, \"you go the opposite way, you draw back\", he explains. He realised as soon as he had read a few pages of the script that the role was \"a life-changer\". He writes in his memoir that he \"instinctively sensed how to play Hannibal. I have the devil in me. We all have the devil in us, I know what scares people\".Watch: Sir Anthony Hopkins on playing the infamous Hannibal LecterHe tells me he played Lecter still - and deadly. So when he was in character opposite other actors, he decided, \"Don't take your eyes off the person. That's terrifying.\" He puts on Lecter's metallic rasp for me and appears to enjoy repeating his character's words to Jodie Foster's Clarice. \"You're not real FBI,\" he almost hisses.\"That's scary,\" he says. He's not wrong. Even in an upmarket LA hotel on a warm autumn afternoon, I'm feeling chilled.And what about the famous line - \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which he follows with that vampire-like hiss? He explains as a child he'd seen the Hungarian-American actor Bela Lugosi do the same when playing Count Dracula in the 1931 movie. Sir Anthony decided in the moment of filming to copy it and The Silence of the Lambs director, Jonathan Demme, kept it in.Getty ImagesBela Lugosi's portrayal of Count Dracula in the 1931 horror film influenced Sir Anthony when playing Hannibal Lecter What is startling about the memoir is the disconnect between how the world viewed the young actor and how much it was clearly missing about him. He was bullied at school for what other kids saw as his large \"elephant\" head. He was slapped around by teachers who deemed him a complete dunce. Even his parents pretty much wrote him off.He believes it was the making of him. It \"gave me a core of anger, resentment and revenge\", he says.But why hadn't they all noticed his talents? This was a child who was given the 10 volume Children's Encyclopaedia when he was six (\"I was so captivated, I read every one of them\") and became fascinated by astronomy. A boy who played the piano, made art and loved Dickens and Shakespeare, quoting from them extensively.A school report in 1955 when he was 17 marked \"the turning point\" in his life. It was terrible, as usual. \"What's going to happen to you?\" Sir Anthony recalls his father lamenting. \"I said: 'One day, I'll show you, both of you'.\"Sir Anthony HopkinsSir Anthony, a \"little confused boy\" by his own recollection, with his father at Aberavon Beach in 1941Sir Anthony HopkinsSir Anthony Hopkins, here in 1953, says he was bullied at school, where teachers thought he was \"thick\"He's pleased his parents lived long enough to see him succeed. When he won his first best actor Oscar, for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992, 11 years to the day after his father died, he rang his mother in Wales and said: \"I guess I did OK.\"But it was a rough ride in the early days. He was an alcoholic who picked fights with directors and others. He wasn't always a good husband to his first two wives. Booze turned him nasty. \"That's the ugly side of alcoholism,\" he writes. \"It brought out a brutal side of me. I'm not proud of it at all.\"The anger, he believes, came \"from inside, my own insecurities, being bullied at school and all the rest of it. I didn't like authority\".ShutterstockSir Anthony (seen with co-star Kate Nelligan) played an alcoholic actor, Theodore Gunge, in the 1974 TV drama The Arcata PromiseThen one night in LA in December 1975, almost 50 years ago, he drove his car while in \"a complete alcoholic blackout\". When he came to, he realised that he was \"out of control\" and could have killed someone. He made a phone call to ask for help.\"Suddenly, something said 'it's all over, now you can start living'... the craving left and it's never come back.\"At his first meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, he had a realisation about everyone else in the room.\"They're all misfits like me. Like all of us. We feel we never belong. We feel self-hatred. All of us are the same. I'm not alone.\"It's that feeling of disconnection that shines out of the book. He writes that his wife Stella believes he is on the autism spectrum which is \"likely right, given my proclivity for memorisation and repetition... and my lack of emotionality\" but he says he prefers the term \"cold fish\". I want to know why.It seems to have begun as a reaction to the bullying and screaming at him through school and National Service. \"I'd just stare them out, and that drove them mad,\" he recalls. \"You withdraw into yourself and think, 'OK you can't hurt me, can you?\" It was, he says, his \"only defence... and that's a power, you see: I don't care.\"Of course, Sir Anthony does care and we talk a little about the state of the world. It's at this point in our interview that he becomes his most passionate. He grew up in Port Talbot surrounded by people who had been impacted, even brutalised, by war. He played Sir Nicholas Winton, the man who saved hundreds of mainly Jewish children from the Nazis, in the film One Life.Warner Bros.In One Life, Sir Anthony played Sir Nicholas Winton, a stockbroker who helped to save nearly 700 mainly Jewish children from the NazisWhen I ask him about whether he worries about increasing polarisation now, he becomes very animated and intense.\"The world has always been a place of utter turmoil. But I think if we go on in this way of hatred... we are dead.\"Nobody's allowed to have an opinion. Nobody can have a different view. That's fascism. And it's insanity.\"If he has any advice about it all, it's to say \"'Come on, stop this rubbish, beating each other up over ideas. They're only ideas and we're only going to be dead one day'.\"Sir Anthony Hopkins' best performances  ShutterstockBrooks FilmsSir Anthony played President Nixon, but told us that, if offered the role of President Trump, he'd say noSir Anthony played the role of Dr Frederick Treves with compassion and said of his character that he \"wrestled with his goodness\"I ask him, as he looks back at his long life, what his biggest regrets are and he's quick to answer. \"People I've hurt over the years, the stupid things I did.\"He's estranged from his only child, his daughter Abigail, who he walked out on when she was just one and he was in the depths of alcoholism.He writes that \"after realising I was unfit as a father for Abigail, I vowed not to have any more children... I couldn't do to another child what I'd done to her\".He has tried to repair their relationship over the years.Getty ImagesSir Anthony with his daughter, Abigail  (here at the premiere of Little Man Tate in Los Angeles in 1991), describes his estrangement as \"a tremendous source of pain\"When he took on the role of King Lear in his 80s, in Sir Richard Eyre's 2018 film, Lear's words to his daughter Cordelia struck a painful chord. He writes in his new book: \"The line that hit me harder than perhaps any other I've ever spoken was 'I did her wrong'. Saying those words, I felt deeply, perhaps for the first time in my life, how I had hurt my own daughter.\"I remembered how as a baby she'd lit up when I walked into the room. I remembered how I said goodbye to her the night I walked out. I remembered how I had tried and failed to win her back later. I remembered how I had given up. And as Lear, but also as myself, I began to cry.\"He didn't want to talk about it in our interview. Poignantly, in this section of the book, he writes: \"I hope my daughter knows that my door is always open to her.\"I couldn't help feeling moved reading this. It's as if he is trying to send a message to her, hoping against hope that there might be a reconciliation before it is too late.Playground TelevisionSir Anthony (pictured with Florence Pugh) says playing King Lear made him reflect on the hurt he caused his own daughter, AbigailAt 87, he is looking back, aware he has lived many years longer than he has left to live. \"Most of my friends have died, they're gone, God bless them,\" he says. \"I hope to be around a little longer. But even that, I'm thinking, 'oh well, I had a good time'.\"He certainly still appears to be having fun. After some early reserve when we first met, he quickly relaxed. When he played the piano, he shared how he had lost two much-loved pianos when his house burnt down in the LA fires earlier this year. \"They were all under the rubble\".As we walked through the hotel lobby together, he was spotted by guests and waved happily to them. \"I like to say hi because people think actors are special. We're not at all,\" he smiles.ReutersSir Anthony credits his third wife Stella Arroyave with helping him overcome \"feelings of anxiety in a way that set [him] free\"Whatever he says, it was special to spend a few hours in his presence. He's an acting legend who's given us six decades of memorable performances. He's also a genuine heavyweight who is steeped not just in musical knowledge, but culture, history and philosophy.And we end the interview on a philosophical note - as he recites \"They are not long, the days of wine and roses\" from an Ernest Dowson poem and muses on the fleeting nature of life.\"What are we doing here, what are we?\" he asks. \"We can't explain anything about ourselves. We may have fancy ideas, religious ideas, philosophical ideas, scientific ideas... what's that all about? We're nothing finally, and yet we're everything\".We Did OK, Kid by Sir Anthony Hopkins is published on 4 November.",

    "body": "Do Bills have blueprint to beat Chiefs? Best of NFL week nineImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Will Josh Allen and the Bills finally beat the Chiefs in the play-offs?ByPaul HighamBBC Sport JournalistSunday of week nine had just about everything, and with so much to get through it has been tough to pick out the big talking points.Obviously, we have to look at how the Bills beat the Chiefs for the fifth consecutive time in the regular season, but did their performance suggest they can finally beat them in the play-offs?After largely being overlooked it is time to study the Seattle Seahawks, especially their surgical quarterback, while there is only one option for our game of the week when there is an 89-point thriller going down in Cincinnati.Here is what caught our eye from Sunday.The breakdown - are Bills finally built to beat Chiefs?The Patrick Mahomes v Josh Allen head-to-head now stands at 5-5, but the Kansas City star has won all four play-off meetings and has three Super Bowl rings.So make no mistake, this version of the Bills has been built to beat the Chiefs and they produced an almost flawless display.Buffalo dominated both lines of scrimmage and the time of possession, holding the ball for almost 10 minutes more than the Chiefs. The best way to beat Mahomes of course is to keep him off the field.When he was on it, the Bills defence both swarmed him and covered his receivers - resulting in being hit a career-high 15 times and recording a career-low 44.1% completion.Mahomes had never completed less than 50% of his passes in his nine-year career.On the flip side, Allen completed a team record 88.5% of his passes and ran in two short touchdowns to take his career tally to 79 - more rushing touchdowns than any other quarterback in NFL history.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Patrick Mahomes was hit a record 15 times and had a career-low completion percentageThose two 'tush push' touchdowns were a big difference, as the Chiefs largely stopped them in last season's AFC Championship but could not on Sunday - while Mahomes ran three plays from the Bills' one-yard line and failed to find the endzone.Buffalo also cracked the Chiefs defence with Dalton Kincaid having the first 100-yard receiving game against them in 12 matches.And with 114 yards James Cook was the first 100-yard rusher the Chiefs had allowed since Lamar Jackson on the opening day of the 2024 season - and first running back since Zamir White on 25 December 2023. In nine previous meetings the Chiefs average 14 points more in play-off games than regular season, but the Bills certainly look to have a blueprint for success this time around if they again find the Chiefs blocking their path to the Super Bowl.In focus - Sam Darnold dazzles for SeahawksImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sam Darnold hit 17 straight completions for Seattle in Washington\"Sam's execution right now - he's just ridiculous,\" said Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald after another dazzling Sam Darnold display.Yes, Josh Allen, Jackson and Mahomes have all shown glimpses, but the 'other guys' of the quarterback fraternity are showing up this season.Second-year triggermen Drake Maye and Bo Nix are both 7-2 after leading the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos to wins on Sunday, while in Los Angeles Matthew Stafford is lighting it up for the Rams and Justin Herbert likewise for the Chargers.But it was Darnold's time to shine in Washington on Sunday with a surgical first half in which he completed all 16 passes and threw four touchdowns as the Seahawks dismantled the Commanders.ESPN's, external Total Quarterback Rating (QBR) system is an in-depth metric that takes into account opposing defensive strength and game state as well as yardage and scoring stats - and is a 0-100 system where 75 and above is regarded as excellent.Darnold's 97.8 mark on Sunday was the best of his career and his third over 97 this season - Jackson is the only other player to get over that mark so far.In short, the 2018 third overall draft pick has been excellent this season, proving that his renaissance in Minnesota last year was no one-hit wonder.Seattle are 6-2 but locked in a titanic NFC West struggle with the Rams and San Francisco 49ers also having six wins, but their impressive away form of 4-0 this season and 11-1 since the start of 2024 means they will not fear hitting the road in the play-offs.Plus, general manager John Schneider has said \"we're in and we'll see what's shaking out there\" regards the upcoming trade deadline, so obviously feel they are in the 'Super Bowl window' now with Darnold at the helm.Watch this space.Game of the week - pure cinema in CincinnatiIt started with a Bengals touchdown from the opening kick-off and ended with a Bears touchdown 17 seconds from the end - with everything in between being pure drama.More than 1,000 yards of offence, 89 points and 11 touchdowns - four of them inside the final five minutes of a breathless 47-42 victory for Chicago in a stunned Cincinnati.From Caleb Williams catching a touchdown pass to 40-year-old Joe Flacco having a career-best 470 yards and leading a 14-point comeback inside the final two minutes, this game had it all.Yet the drama was still not over, as after getting the ball back with 54 seconds left, Williams hit rookie tight end Colston Loveland to gallop away for a 58-yard winning score.\"It's like taking years off my life,\" said Bears safety Kevin Byard. \"It's super special. This is the greatest game, greatest sport in the world - just the emotions up and down.\"Spare a thought for the Bengals, especially the offence though, as after blowing a 15-point lead against the winless Jets last week they are now the first team since the 1960s pre-Super Bowl era to score 38 or more points in successive games and lose both.Record books - field goal history made, againImage caption, Field goals have got longer in the past few yearsTom Dempsey - who was born without any toes on his kicking foot - held a field goal record of 63 yards that stood for 43 years before Matt Prater finally broke it in 2013.But kicks are getting longer - in the past 14 months Prater's 64-yard mark has been equalled or bettered four times, the latest being the ironically named Cam Little's huge 68-yard effort on Sunday.That beat Justin Tucker's previous best by two yards, and cleared the crossbar with some room to spare as well.There has now been seven 60-plus yard field goals already this season, with five being the previous best in a campaign, so three points are seemingly available from anywhere these days.It is a tough life being a kicker in the NFL with the game often being on the line, so it is only right they get some praise when perfecting their craft. Week nine game notes and statsThe Indianapolis Colts proved how crucial turnovers are in the NFL, with six of them in one game stifling the league's top offence in the defeat by the Steelers. Was it just a blip for Daniel Jones, who committed five of them, or a worrying sign of things to come?Christian McCaffrey is on his way to legend status with another huge 173-yard outing for the 49ers, in his 16th game with a rushing and receiving touchdown - putting him above the great Marshall Faulk for the most in the NFL.There could be big trouble for the Washington Commanders who lost second-year quarterback Jayden Daniels to what is believed to be a dislocated left elbow.In leading the Vikings to beat the Lions, JJ McCarthy became the first player ever to have two passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in two of his first three career games.Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart also made history as the first rookie with a passing and rushing touchdown in four consecutive games during their defeat by San Francisco.Have your say - who is your MVP so far?Watch - the Whole 10 Yards on Harry KaneMedia caption, The Super Bowl winner who wants to train Harry Kane",

    "body": "24 minutes agoLucy Manning,Special correspondent and Fiona NimoniBBCA Scunthorpe United player and a Nottingham Forest fan are among the victims stabbed in a knife attack on a train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday evening. They are among 10 people injured on the train during the mass stabbing.Footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on a LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were attacked at around 20:00 GMT.Mr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.Mr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and has been operated on, his club said.Anthony Williams, 32, has been remanded in custody following the incident and is charged with 11 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident.'Incredible bravery' of train crew and passengers saved livesWhat do we know about Cambridgeshire train stabbings?Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Mr Crean's left hand could be seen heavily bandaged and he still had blood in his hair. He is one of the train passengers the 32-year-old is accused of attempting to murder.Mr Crean described how he \"tussled\" with the man who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.He said he first saw people running down the train shouting that there was a man with a knife. As people ran to the buffet car he said he wanted to make sure passengers were safe.\"I saw him coming towards me - a guy with a rucksack and he's obviously got something in there.\"Everyone's gone towards the buffet, and that is on the verge of being full up. There's no-one else getting in there. I wasn't even going to bother pushing to get in.\"There's young women and they need to get them in. I confronted this guy, because I've got to make sure that the door's locked and I've looked around to save a bit of time.\"But then he started, he pulled this thing out. It was an over large blade thing\".Mr Crean said the man asked him: \"Do you want to die? Do you want to die?\" \"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms with him and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and must have caught me on the head.\"Scunthorpe UnitedScunthorpe United football player Jonathan GjosheMr Crean says it's nice to hear that people are calling him a hero but that he wasn't the only one.\"It's lovely to hear. But I'd say there are other heroes like the police and the guys that got me off the train and the ambulances and the hospital staff, they're probably real heroes.\"And the train guy that's really badly injured. So, you know, it's a big shout to call someone a hero, but it's nice.\"He says he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the buffet door. \"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"Stephen Crean still had blood in his hair when he spoke to the BBC",

It’s also triggered a number of conspiracy theories online about the presidential bunker that sits underneath the East Wing of the White House.\nAnd, Sarah and Marianna speak to White House historian and First Lady specialist Katherine Sibley about the historic significance of the East Wing, what’s being lost in its demolishment, and what Melania Trump might think about losing her office in the complex.\nHOSTS:\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\nGUEST\n• Katherine Sibley, White House historian\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve, Alix Pickles, Kris Jalowiecki and Rufus Gray.

    "body": "53 minutes agoGetty ImagesA search and rescue operation is continuing for the rest of the group, which includes other foreign nationals and local guidesKathryn Armstrong and Diwakar Pyakurel,BBC Nepali in KathmanduAt least three climbers, including a French national, have died after being hit by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak in north-eastern Nepal, police say. The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. Those killed were part of a group of 12 trekkers and local guides that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told the BBC. They include two Italians, a German and a Canadian.Five Nepali guides who returned to the base camp were injured but not critically. Rescue efforts are continuing. Local Deputy Superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato said a rescue helicopter had landed on Monday in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yelung Ri base camp.Efforts to locate those still missing have been hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, according to local media reports. The Yalung Ri mountain is located in Nepal's Dolakha districtSeparately, attempts to rescue two Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari mountain in western Nepal are continuing.Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week. The third member of the group, named in media reports as Velter Perlino, 65, has since been rescued. Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal last week, stranding trekkers and tourists in the Himalayas. Two British and one Irish woman were among a group that had to be rescued after being trapped for several days in the western Mustang region. ",

    "body": "Strictly Come Dancing's Amy Dowden has announced she is to undergo \"another mastectomy this week\".The 35-year-old said the surgery was \"not to treat a new cancer diagnosis\" but came following an appointment with her \"incredible\" medical team, adding that she wanted to be \"clear\" and \"open\" with her followers.In a post on Instagram, accompanied by a video of her stroking her dog, the Welsh star said: \"They're [the medical team] confident that, all going well, I can expect a straightforward recovery.\"Once I have healed I look forward to rejoining my Strictly family.\"She added that she would \"of course\" miss not being part of the show as much but would be \"watching from home and look forward to cheering everyone on\". \"Thank you always for all the support,\" said Dowden.The dancer revealed she had been diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2023 after finding a lump in April, the day before going to the Maldives on her honeymoon with fellow professional dancer Ben Jones.After her diagnosis, Dowden had a mastectomy and underwent chemotherapy, with her treatment preventing her from being able to compete with a celebrity partner on the BBC dancing programme that year.Dowden documented her cancer experience online, and revealed in February 2024 that \"no evidence of disease\" was found at her latest health check.She returned to the dancefloor a few months later, partnered with former JLS star JB Gill.However, she was forced to pull out of Strictly midway through the 20th anniversary series due to an injury and was replaced by Lauren Oakley.Dowden returned once again in this year's series where she was partnered with former Apprentice contestant and social media star Thomas Skinner, being eliminated in week two.Her cancer treatment and experience with Crohn's disease have been depicted in the BBC documentaries Strictly Amy: Cancer And Me and Strictly Amy: Crohn's And Me.She was formally made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) earlier in the year for services to fundraising and raising awareness of the inflammatory bowel disease.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter BBCKemi Badenoch said the Conservative Party nearly ran out of money when she took over as leader, following their worst-ever election defeat.Badenoch said she inherited a party facing internal problems, with donors considering pulling funding after the loss of 250 seats in last year's general election - the worst result in Conservative history.Speaking to the BBC's Newscast to mark her first year as Conservative Party leader, Badenoch said she spent her first months \"working furiously behind the scenes\", leading to some thinking her team \"were not doing anything\".But Badenoch defended her position arguing: \"Without money, a party can't survive.\"Asked if there was risk that the Conservatives could have gone bankrupt, Badenoch said: \"Yes, there was.\"Badenoch would not say how near the party came to going running out of money, but admitted there was a moment when donors could have walked away.Speaking to the BBC, she said keeping donors on board \"actually took quite a lot of quite a lot of my time\" which she wished she had spent \"out there a bit more\".Badenoch insists the party is now on a firmer footing and has begun to set out a new policy agenda, thanks to the groundwork she laid in the first few months. That work culminated in a policy announcement blitz during her party conference speech in October, where she outlined plans to end stamp duty and pull Britain out of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).In a wide-ranging interview, Badenoch spoke about learning on the job, including thinking of Prime Minister's Questions \"like a panto\" rather than a cross-examination. The Conservative leader admitted she initially spent a day preparing arguments and statistics, only to find that people were not following what she was saying.No matter how much she prepared, Badenoch said Sir Keir Starmer would simply dismiss her points as \"rubbish\".\"I just thought this isn't working,\" she said.\"It is more theatre than it is a prosecution or interrogation.\"\"It is the nature of British politics that we will have a panto\" while political debate in other countries will have other \"culturally appropriate analogies\", she argued.Focusing instead on one thing during PMQs and \"peeling it back like layers of an onion\" had allowed her better scrutinise the prime minister.Badenoch also dismissed talk of rivals plotting against her.Several senior figures, including former leadership rival Robert Jenrick and rising star Katie Lam, have attracted headlines with interventions on issues such as banning the burka and deporting migrants.From today, backbench MPs can launch a vote to potentially topple Badenoch, as the grace period stopping them from submitting letters expressing no confidence in her expires after her first year in office.But Badenoch claimed she had told colleagues \"go on instinct\" and post what they liked on social media to rally support ahead of the party's first conference. \"Just make sure that if it's something that is a new policy line that you check it just so we don't end up going off in different directions,\" she added.Ahead of this month's Budget however, Badenoch said she was instilling greater focus among her colleagues on the party's economic pitch. Despite Reform UK's commanding poll leader, Badenoch denied Nigel Farage was the government's main opposition, arguing she had forced major policy shifts on grooming gangs and the Winter Fuel Allowance.Reform was \"an existential threat\" to every party, she said, adding: \"It is very clear that Reform is hoovering up a lot of discontent, but discontent is not a policy for government.\"She accused Farage's party of chasing headlines rather than substance, arguing Reform's policies \"do not stand up to scrutiny\".Her comments came as Farage rowed back on his party's previous promise to deliver tax cuts worth £90bn a year.Speaking on Monday, Farage said \"substantial tax cuts\" were not currently \"realistic\" because of the \"dire state\" of the public finances.",

    "body": "Private baby scan clinics 'putting expectant mothers at risk'16 hours agoJim ReedHealth reporterGetty ImagesSome high-street clinics are putting lives at risk by allowing unqualified non-specialists to carry out baby scans, the Society of Radiographers (SoR) has warned.The trade union says its members have seen examples of pregnant women being incorrectly diagnosed with serious health conditions and given dangerous advice.Other expectant mums have been sent to hospital after being told an abnormality meant they would need to end the pregnancy only to find their baby was completely healthy.It is concerned that anyone using an ultrasound machine can call themselves a sonographer and offer the service - often sold as a reassurance, souvenir or sexing scan - ahead of the routine 20-week NHS check.\"One time, we had a lady referred [to hospital] from a private clinic, who was eight or nine weeks pregnant,\" says Elaine Brooks, Midlands regional officer at the SoR.\"The sonographer at the private clinic said there was no heartbeat and that the baby was very, very malformed, and they sent her in for an induced miscarriage.\"We started scanning the lady, who was in tears, and on the scan there was a clearly beautiful nine-week pregnancy with a heartbeat. It was absolutely fine.\"A BBC investigation in 2020 uncovered similar failures in the diagnosis of serious medical issues during private baby scans.It heard reports of women who were bleeding and in pain being accepted for scans, rather than being told to contact their doctor.Bad practice and sexual misconductThe trade union, which is also the professional body for medical imaging, says it has seen other examples of bad practice by some private clinics including:Major foetal abnormalities such as spina bifida or polycystic kidneys being missedEctopic pregnancies, where the fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, either not being diagnosed or being falsely diagnosedA radiographer continuing to work as a private sonographer despite having been struck off and banned from working for the NHS due to sexual misconduct The president of the SoR, Katie Thompson, said there were some \"really great\" private services offering checks with properly trained staff, but she was particularly concerned about the growth of pop-up clinics in shopping centres and on high streets selling souvenir images or scans to reveal the sex of the baby.She said she was aware of another case where a private scan late in pregnancy did not record the baby was still breech or lying bottom first in the uterus. The mother was not immediately referred to the NHS and the baby later died. Getty ImagesPrivate clinics often offer reassurance or sexing scans before the standard NHS anomaly scan which is normally offered between 18 and 21 weeks into the pregnancyThe SoR is now calling for sonographer to become a protected job title in the UK in the same way as dietician, podiatrist, art therapist or radiographer.That would mean only those who are properly qualified and registered with a regulatory body would be allowed to use that job description.Safety checks and tipsMany private sonographers are already qualified midwives or radiographers, and  dedicated training courses are also available, although this is currently not a legal requirement.Thompson says mums-to-be should ask a private clinic if their staff have been through a course accredited by the Consortium of Sonographic Education (CASE). Patients can also carry out other basic checks - asking how long the clinic has been operating, for example, whether it has been registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England and when it was last inspected by the regulator.Thompson also suggests checking reviews and asking around for advice and recommendations from friends, family, midwives and GPs.Individual sonographers can decide to join the Register of Clinical Technologists, which the public can then search to see if certain standards have been met but, again, participation is voluntary.The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care recently carried out a public interest test of that register and has written to the government to say the \"risks appear sufficiently high\" that it should consider if stronger regulation of sonographers may be needed.The CQC said many clinics were providing good quality care, but it \"remains concerned that some are not\" with worries over staff training, consent policies and procedures for escalating unusual findings. Where its inspections identify concerns it said it would \"hold providers to account and make clear that action is required to ensure staff are adequately trained\".In a statement, the Department of Health said the safety of patients was paramount and the regulation of all healthcare professionals was kept under review.\"We will carefully consider any proposals from professional bodies regarding this,\" added a spokesman.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analyst, JerusalemIDFMajor General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned on Friday, admitting her role in leaking the videoThe former top lawyer in the Israeli military has been arrested, as a political showdown deepens over the leaking of a video that allegedly shows severe abuse of a Palestinian detainee by Israeli soldiers.Maj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned as the Military Advocate General of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last week, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak.On Sunday, the story took a darker turn when she was reported as missing, with police mounting an hours-long search for her on a beach north of Tel Aviv.She was subsequently found alive and well, police said, but was then taken into custody.The fallout from the leaked video is intensifying by the day.Broadcast in August 2024 on an Israeli news channel, the footage shows reserve soldiers at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel taking aside a detainee, then surrounding him with riot shields to block visibility while he was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object.The detainee was subsequently treated for severe injuries.Five reservists were subsequently charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee. They have denied the charges and have not been named.On Sunday, four of the reservists wore black balaclavas to hide their faces as they appeared at a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Jerusalem along with their lawyers, who demanded the dismissal of their trial.Adi Keidar, a lawyer from the right-wing legal aid organisation Honenu, claimed his clients were subject to \"to a faulty, biased and completely cooked-up legal process\".Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe leaked surveillance video was filmed at the Sde Teiman military base in southern IsraelOn Monday, it emerged the detainee at the centre of the case was released to Gaza in October as part of an exchange with Hamas of convicted prisoners and detainees held without charge by Israel for hostages held by Hamas since 7 October 2023. Last week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leaking of the video.Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was put on leave while the inquiry took place.On Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said she would not be allowed to return to her post.Shortly after that, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned.In her resignation letter, she said she took full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from the unit.\"I approved the release of material to the media in an attempt to counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities,\" she said.That is a reference to efforts by some right-wing political figures in Israel to claim that the allegations of severe abuse of the Palestinian detainee had been fabricated.She added: \"It is our duty to investigate whenever there is reasonable suspicion of acts of violence against a detainee.\"After her resignation, Katz issued a fierce condemnation of her conduct.\"Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army's uniform,\" he said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed his defence minister's words on Sunday, saying that the incident at Sde Teiman was \"perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the State of Israel has experienced since its establishment\".Hours later, the first reports began appearing in the Israeli media that Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was missing, sparking fears that a political scandal had taken a turn towards tragedy.A massive search effort was launched. Several hours later, she was found \"safe and in good health\" in the coastal area of Herzliya, Israeli police said.Overnight, a police spokesperson announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of \"leaking and other serious criminal offences\" as part of an investigation.Israeli media reported that the pair were Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi and the former chief military prosecutor, Col Matan Solomosh.ReutersIsraeli forces mounted an hours-long search for Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi when she went missing on SundayThe Sde Teiman incident has been a lightning rod for the division between the left and right in Israel.On the right, the leaking of the video is denounced as a defamation of the Israeli military, all but amounting to an act of treason.After Israeli military police went to Sde Teiman to question 11 reservists over the incident in July 2024, far-right protesters - including at least three lawmakers from Netanyahu's governing coalition - broke into the facility to show their support.On the left, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi's decision to enable the footage to be released is seen as the one time she lived up to the responsibilities of her post.The video is regarded by the left as concrete evidence backing up multiple reports of abuse of Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.Last October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been \"subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence\".Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was \"fully committed to international legal standards\". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint.",

    "body": "Drones have been seen flying over a Belgian military base near the Dutch border for a third night in a row, according to the country's defence minister said.A helicopter was deployed to the Kleine-Brogel base after drones were spotted - they then flew off towards the Netherlands, national broadcaster VRT reported.Defence Minister Theo Francken said an investigation was under way, calling it \"a clear mission targeting Kleine Broge\".Francken told Belgian radio on Monday that it looked like an espionage operation, but said he would not speculate on who could be behind it.\"I have some ideas, but I'm going to be cautious,\" he added.Drones were also spotted flying above other military air bases - the Leopoldsburg, in central Limburg province, and Marche-en-Famenne in the south-east of the country.  VRT reported over the weekend that drones were also seen close to coastal Ostend and Antwerp's Deurne airports.It marks the latest incident involving drones disrupting European airspace in recent months. In October, unconfirmed drone sightings forced Germany's Munich airport to suspend operations twice in 24 hours.The month before, Denmark said drones flown over its airports appeared to be the work of a \"professional actor\".At the time, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said there was no evidence to suggest Russia was behind the incursion.The Russian embassy in Copenhagen denied \"absurd speculations\" of its involvement.Also in September, Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members, after around 20 Russian drones crossed into Poland and Russian MiG31 jets entered Estonian airspace.Russia denied violating Estonia's airspace and insisted the Polish incursion was not deliberate.The European Commission has since proposed four defence projects, including a counter-drone system, as part of plans to get the continent ready to defend itself by 2030.",

    "body": "The Maldives has banned young people born on or after 1 January 2007 from smoking tobacco, becoming the only country in the world to enforce a nationwide generational tobacco prohibition.The archipelago's health ministry announced on Saturday that it would be illegal for younger generations to use, buy or sell tobacco within the country.The ban \"reflects the government's strong commitment to protecting young people from the harms of tobacco\", the ministry said. Ahmed Afaal, vice chair of the archipelago's tobacco control board, told BBC World Service's Newshour programme that the country's general vaping ban last year had been a \"good step towards a generation of tobacco-free citizens\". The new ban \"applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale\", the health ministry said, adding that it aligned with the Maldives' obligations under the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.According to the UN's health body, this convention \"provides a global response to a global problem – namely, the tobacco epidemic\".Mr Afaal said the country's crackdown on vaping had been an important first step because \"these new stylish gadgets are tactics of the industry to approach the younger generations to uptake addictive processes, which definitely harms their health\".Last year, the Maldives made it illegal for anyone to import, sell, possess, use or distribute electronic cigarettes and vaping products, regardless of age.Tourists coming to visit the Maldives' islands will also have to adhere to the law, but Mr Afaal argues the smoking ban will not have a detrimental impact on tourism.\"People don't come to the Maldives because they're able to smoke. They come for the beaches, they come for the sea, they come for the sun, and they come for the fresh air,\" he added.Quoting tourism data, Mr Afaal argued that despite the new regulations there had been no tourist cancellations and the number of arrivals had grown in the past year.\"We're projecting more than 2m [tourists] in the next year,\" he said. Plans by New Zealand to pass a generational smoking ban were scrapped in 2023 after a new government took power.The move was seen as a blow to many health experts and Māori people in particular, who have one of the highest smoking rates.Last year, the UK's then-Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, had hoped to introduce a law that would ban young people born on or after 2009 from smoking.A new version of the legislation, introduced by the current government, has passed through the Commons and is now at the committee stage at the House of Lords - nearing its last hurdles before it gets royal assent.",

    "body": "I'm the luckiest man alive, but also suffering, says Air India crash sole survivor9 hours agoNavtej Johal,Midlands correspondent, Katie Thompson and Sophie WoodcockViswashkumar Ramesh breaks down in tears as he talks about the loss of his brother in the crashThe sole survivor of the Air India plane crash, which killed 241 people on board, has said he feels like the \"luckiest man\" alive, but is also suffering physically and mentally.Viswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the wreckage of the London-bound flight in Ahmedabad in extraordinary scenes that amazed the world.He said it was a \"miracle\" he escaped but told how he has lost everything, as his younger brother Ajay was a few seats away on the flight and died in the crash in June.Since returning to his home in Leicester, Mr Ramesh has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), his advisers said, and has been unable to speak to his wife and four-year-old son.Flames engulfed the Boeing 787 flight when it went down shortly after take-off in western India.Shocking video shared at the time showed Mr Ramesh walking away from the aftermath with seemingly superficial injuries, as smoke billowed in the background. Speaking to BBC News, an emotional Mr Ramesh, whose first language is Gujarati, said: \"I'm only one survivor. Still, I'm not believing. It's a miracle.\"I lost my brother as well. My brother is my backbone. Last few years, he was always supporting me.\"He described the devastating impact the ordeal has had on his family life.\"Now I'm alone. I just sit in my room alone, not talking with my wife, my son. I just like to be alone in my house,\" Mr Ramesh said.Watch: The moment Viswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the crashHe spoke from his hospital bed in India at the time, describing how he had managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out of the wreckage, and met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while receiving treatment for his injuries.Of the passengers and crew killed, 169 were Indian nationals and 52 were Britons, while 19 others were killed on the ground.A preliminary report into the crash, published by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in July, said fuel supply to the engines was cut off just seconds after take-off. Meanwhile, an investigation is ongoing and the airline said care for Mr Ramesh, and all families affected by the tragedy, \"remains our absolute priority\".This is the first time the 39-year-old has spoken to the media since he has been back in the UK. Several news organisations were invited for an interview and a documentary crew was also filming in the room.The BBC had detailed discussions with his advisers around his duty of care before the interview.When asked about his memories of the day of the crash, he said: \"I can't say anything about that now.\"'I'm suffering'Flanked by local community leader Sanjiv Patel and spokesman Radd Seiger, Mr Ramesh said it was too painful to recall the events of the disaster, and broke down during parts of an interview at the home of Mr Patel in Leicester.Mr Ramesh described the anguish he and his family are now living through.\"For me, after this accident... very difficult.\"Physically, mentally, also my family as well, mentally... my mum last four months, she is sitting every day outside the door, not talking, nothing.\"I'm not talking to anyone else. I do not like to talk with anyone else.\"I can't talk about much. I'm thinking all night, I'm suffering mentally.\"Every day is painful for the whole family.\"Mr Ramesh also spoke about the physical injuries he suffered in the crash, which saw him escape his seat - 11A - through an opening in the fuselage.He says he suffers pain in his leg, shoulder, knee and back, and has not been able to work or drive since the tragedy.\"When I walk, not walk properly, slowly, slowly, my wife help,\" he added.Sanjiv Patel said he was supporting, advising and protecting the familyMr Ramesh was diagnosed with PTSD while he was being treated in hospital in India but has not received any medical treatment since being back home, his advisers said.They described him as being lost and broken, with a long journey of recovery ahead, and are demanding a meeting with Air India's executives, claiming he has been treated poorly by the airline since the crash.\"They're in crisis, mentally, physically, financially,\" Mr Patel said.\"It's devastated his family.\"Whoever's responsible at the highest level should be on the ground meeting the victims of this tragic event, and understanding their needs and to be heard.\"'Put things right'Air India has offered an interim compensation payment to Mr Ramesh of £21,500, which has been accepted, but his advisers say this is not enough to meet his immediate needs.The family fishing business in Diu in India, which Mr Ramesh ran with his brother before the crash, has since collasped, his advisers said.Spokesman for the family Mr Seiger said they had invited Air India for a meeting on three occasions, and all three were either \"ignored or turned down\". The media interviews were the team's way of reissuing that appeal for the fourth time, he said.Mr Seiger added: \"It's appalling that we are having to sit here today and putting him [Viswashkumar] through this.\"The people who should be sitting here today are the executives of Air India, the people responsible for trying to put things right.\"Please come and sit down with us so that we can work through this together to try and alleviate some of this suffering.\"In a statement, the airline, which is owned by Tata Group, said senior leaders from the parent company continue to visit families to express their deepest condolences.\"An offer has been made to Mr Ramesh's representatives to arrange such a meeting, we will continue to reach out and we very much hope to receive a positive response,\" it said.The airline told the BBC that this offer was made before the media interviews with Mr Ramesh.More on this story",

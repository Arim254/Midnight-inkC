    "body": "Dominican Republic suffers nationwide power cut after 'cascade of failures'3 hours agoBen HattonAFP via Getty ImagesThe country was recently battered by Hurricane Melissa (file photo)The Dominican Republic has experienced a nationwide power cut which officials said was linked to a failure in the electricity transmission system. At 13:23 local time (17:23 GMT), an issue at a substation caused a nationwide interruption to power services, the state-owned Dominican Electricity Transmission Company said, citing the country's energy minister Joel Santos Echeverría.Approximately 33% of the national power demand had been restored as of Tuesday evening, and authorities said they were working to restore full service as quickly as possible.Home to around 11 million people, the Caribbean nation had been experiencing smaller blackouts in recent weeks, the AFP news agency reports. Officials at the state-owned power company said generation units in two major power plants had shut down, causing \"a cascade of failures\" in other parts of the grid.Local media reported the metro and cable car in the capital, Santo Domingo, had stopped working and people had to be evacuated during the national blackout on Tuesday. There have also been reports of chaotic scenes on the country's roads. Social media users reported power outages in various parts of the country, but electricity and internet were operational in some places, reports say.Last month, Hurricane Melissa was blamed for four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, after the category five storm blasted through the region.The Caribbean nation is a major tourist destination. Once ruled by Spain, the Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, a former French colony.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaReform UK has said it will no longer co-operate with a BBC documentary about the party following a row over how a speech by US President Donald Trump was edited.The BBC had commissioned an outside production company, October Films, to make the programme, which was due to air in January. The company was involved in the Panorama documentary about Trump which has triggered a major row at the broadcaster, though was not responsible for the editing of the speech, which was done by BBC staff.An internal Reform email seen by BBC News said the production firm had \"conducted themselves professionally\" on the project but advised members to decline to participate with filming going forward.October Films has been approached for comment, while the BBC said it does not comment on in-development projects.The documentary was due to be called The Rise of Reform, and was to be presented by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Its makers had been given \"unprecedented access\" to senior figures in the party, the internal Reform email said.It is unclear whether the documentary will proceed without the party's co-operation.The email referred to the Panorama edit of Trump's speech from 6 January 2021 as  \"disinformation\", and said a decision had been made to \"cease engagement\" with the documentary as a result.It continued: \"We want to be clear that October Films have always conducted themselves professionally, and there is no suggestion from our side that they would maliciously misrepresent Reform UK. \"However, following the Panorama documentary the trust has been lost, and both BBC and the production company will have to do a lot of hard work to regain that trust.\"The email advised party members to \"politely decline to participate\" if approached by the documentary team, and to withdraw consent for footage already filmed to be used.One of the documentary's subjects, Kent County Council leader Linden Kemkaran, said in a social post that she had \"rescinded all permission\" for footage gathered over several weeks to be aired.The BBC has come under intense scrutiny over a Panorama documentary, titled Trump: A Second Chance?, which aired shortly before the 2024 US presidential election.An edit included in the documentary spliced together parts of a speech made by Trump on 6 January 2021 in a way that made it look like he was explicitly urging people to attack the US Capitol.In his speech in Washington DC, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"However, in the Panorama edit he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The two sections of the speech were delivered nearly an hour apart -  with the \"fight like hell\" comment taken from a section where Trump discussed how \"corrupt\" US elections were. In total, he used the words \"fight\" or \"fighting\" 20 times.The documentary aired last year but came to prominence this month when a leaked internal BBC memo which raised concerns about the edit was published by the Telegraph newspaper. The memo was written by Michael Prescott, an external editorial advisor to the BBC's editorial standards committee. It said Panorama had produced a \"distortion of the day's events\" which would leave viewers asking: \"Why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?\"The fallout to the memo's emergence has led to BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigning from their positions.Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£760m) unless he receives a full retraction, apology and compensation.On Monday, BBC chair Samir Shah apologised for an \"error of judgement\" over the documentary.",

    "body": "Scientists have unearthed Australia's oldest known crocodile eggshells which may have belonged to \"drop crocs\" - creatures that climbed trees to hunt prey below.The discovery of the 55-million-year-old eggshells was made in a sheep farmer's backyard in Queensland with the findings published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.The egghells belonged to a long-extinct group of crocodiles known as mekosuchines, who lived in inland waters when Australia was part of Antarctica and South America.Co-author Prof Michael Archer said \"drop crocs\" were a \"bizarre idea\" but some were \"perhaps hunting like leopards - dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner\".Prof Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales, said mekosuchine crocodiles - which could grow to about five metres - were plentiful 55 million years ago, long before their modern saltwater and freshwater cousins arrived in Australia about 3.8 million years ago.The \"drop croc\" eggshells were discovered several decades ago but only recently analysed with the help of scientists in Spain.\"It's a bizarre idea,\" Prof Archer said of the \"drop crocs\",  but some were probably \"terrestrial hunters in the forests\".The findings add to earlier discoveries of younger mekosuchine fossils - found in 25-million-year-old deposits in another part of Queensland.\"Some were also apparently at least partly semi-arboreal 'drop crocs',\" Prof Archer said.Since the early 1980s, he has been part of a group of scientists excavating a clay pit in Murgon, a small regional town about 270km (168 miles) north-west of Brisbane.Over the decades, it has become known as one of Australia's oldest fossil sites as it used to be surrounded by a lush forest. \"This forest was also home to the world's oldest-known songbirds, Australia's earliest frogs and snakes, a wide range of small mammals with South American links, as well as one of the world's oldest known bats,\" Dr Michael Stein, a co-author of the report, said.Prof Archer recalls how in 1983, he and another colleague \"drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard\".\"After explaining the prehistoric treasures that might lie under their sheep paddock and that fossil turtle shells had already been found in the area, they grinned and said 'of course!'.\"And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we've already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesA decision to reject compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age will be reconsidered by the government.Campaigners say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in state pension age to bring them into line with men. Last year, the government apologised for a 28-month delay in sending letters, but rejected any kind of financial payouts.A document was not shown to Liz Kendall, who was Work and Pensions Secretary at the time of the decision, but had since come to light and needed to be considered, the government has now said.There is no guarantee any payout will be made, but campaigners said the move was a major step forward. Current Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told the Commons that retaking the decision would not automatically lead to compensation.\"Retaking this decision should not be taken as an indication that government will necessarily decide that it should award financial redress,\" he said.The undisclosed evidence involved was a survey from 2007, and McFadden said that checks would be made to ensure other documents and surveys had not been missed. No timescale has been given for the work to be done.\"I understand that people are impatient for this matter to be resolved,\" he said.\"It is important that we give it full and appropriate consideration.\"Angela Madden, who chairs Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi), said: \"The government now knows it got it wrong and we are pleased they are now trying to do it properly.\"We hope they also try to do it quickly.\"She added that the \"only correct thing to do\" was to compensate those affected immediately.Compensation recommendedEarly last year, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between £1,000 and £2,950 for each of those affected.While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it and the government rejected it.Ministers said there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision, and that Labour did not believe that paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to £10.5bn would be \"fair or proportionate\" to taxpayers.The Waspi campaign had called for payments of at least £10,000 each.It is pursuing a judicial review of the government's decision not to pay compensation. Campaigners raised money for the legal challenge and a court capped the contribution to the government's legal fees if they were unsuccessful.The case was scheduled to go to the High Court in December. The government has now informed the court of its latest decision.The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.The increases have been controversial. Campaigners say women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterThe Liberal Democrats are calling for a 5% cut in VAT in  this month's budget to support the UK's ailing hospitality sector and their hard-pressed customers.Deputy leader and Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper has called on the Chancellor to cut VAT from 20% to 15% to boost footfall in Britain's pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues.She said the government should step in to help people obtain \"small joys\", such as a meal in a restaurant.This could be funded by a new windfall tax on big banks, originally proposed by the IPPR think tank, which Cooper claimed could raise around £30bn in total between now and 2030. More than half of people think going out to a pub or restaurant was now unaffordable for, according to recent polling from More in Common.Cooper said: \"People are working with their nose to the grindstone all month and have next to nothing left over after sky-high bills and spiralling food prices.\"In years gone by people knew they could look forward to fish and chips with their family on a Friday night or a weekend trip to the cinema. \"Now those small joys – the ones that make life worth living – are becoming an unaffordable luxury for too many.\"Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to break Labour's manifesto commitment not to increase income tax, VAT or National Insurance in her Budget later this month, and has suggested she will ditch the two child benefit cap.She is not expected to cut VAT. The Treasury has been contacted for a response to the Lib Dem policy proposal.The Lib Dems are also calling on the chancellor to cut energy bills by about £90 a year through axing the main renewables levy, which she claimed would bring energy bills down to the second lowest level since the energy crisis began in 2022.The Liberal Democrats say their two-pronged approach could be put in place immediately for the next 18 months and would save the average family £270 a month between now and April 2027.The package would cost £12bn, the party said, with the VAT cut costing £7.5bn and replacing the current renewables obligation levy £4.5bn. The windfall tax on big banks is estimated to bring in about £7bn a year to the Treasury.Cooper also called for the big bank levy to fund £2bn of capital investment for a new Energy Security Bank, which would include funding for green energy home loans.The Lib Dem sources said their Energy Security Bank would need two years to set up, taking its launch to the 2027-28 financial year, and use some of the remaining £18bn raised by the levy between April 2027 and April 2030.Reducing energy bills is a key focus of all the main parties, and the Liberal Democrats have now joined the Conservatives in calling for an end to the renewables obligation.The Green Party, like Labour, is firmly focused on ending the use of oil and gas, but Reform UK wants to scrap clean energy targets altogether, tax renewable energy, and go back to using fossil fuels and fracking.Labour is focused on expanding renewables to meet its manifesto pledge to cut energy bills by \"up to £300 by 2030\" and end the UK's reliance on fossil fuels, especially from countries like Russia.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "UK toy sales up as 'kidults' buy Lego and Pokémon4 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentDaniel Knighton/Getty ImagesThe popularity of brands such as Lego have driven salesToy sales have risen for the first time since the pandemic, analysts say, as brands aim to appeal to children and adults.The value of sales rose by 6% in the year to September compared with the same period last year, according to research company Circana.Film releases such as Stitch, sports like Formula 1 and the popularity of brands such as Lego have driven sales.With so-called \"kidults\" responsible for a third of sales, many manufacturers and sellers are targeting a sweet spot of products that different generations want to play and collect.\"The products that are doing really well at the moment, such as Lego and Pokemon, are the ones that have that cross-generational appeal,\" said Melissa Symonds, UK toys director at Circana, which tracks toy sales.\"It is a really difficult balance to hit, and some won't be able to make it. Some will focus on just the pre-school market, and some on adults - but the real trick is getting the balance between the two age groups.\"Sales of toys and games saw a big lift during Covid as more families spent time at home during lockdowns, but sales had fallen since 2021 until this year.The kidult market - which is toys and games for those aged over 12 - has been growing, particularly as adults buy toys for themselves.Melissa Symonds says toys are offering some light relief to peopleThe Toy Retailers Association, which represents sellers, has launched the latest of its annual DreamToys series, which lists what it anticipates to be some of the big sellers this Christmas.Some of this year's picks clearly target more than one generation.The Hot Wheels F1 racing circuit has a higher-priced set for older collectors, with more accurate livery on the cars.However, nostalgia also plays a part. Emma Bunce, from Pokemon, said that many parents collected the cards when they were children up to 30 years ago.They now wanted to introduce something similar to their own children, she said, while having some lighthearted relief from the world around them.The list includes an interactive dinosaur that breaks out of an egg, selling for £65, dolls from the stage and screen show Wicked, and a game in which players have to feed themselves mini marshmallows with tiny hands.The manufacturers of that game said it was deliberately analogue, with no batteries or internet connectivity required. However, they are encouraging players to post videos of the game on social media - an example of the line the toy industry is navigating between physical and online play.Price is another issue for parents, many of whom are still struggling with the cost of living. Ms Symonds said that the average price of a toy last December was £13.43, with the £10 to £20 price range the most dominant in the sector.Overall, annual sales in the UK toy sector have reached nearly £4bn, she said.",

    "body": "'This animal spared my life': Biologist bitten in head by shark hopes to meet it again12 hours agoRafael AbuchaibeBBC News MundoMauricio HoyosMauricio Hoyos has spent 30 years studying the behaviour of different shark speciesMauricio Hoyos still remembers the pressure that the jaws of a female Galapagos shark, over 3m (10ft) in length, exerted on his skull.The animal had lunged at him with astonishing speed, giving him barely enough time to duck his head in a last ditch effort to protect his jugular vein.\"When it closed its jaw, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then, after what I think was a second, it opened it again and it let me go,\" Hoyos told BBC Mundo from his home in Baja California, Mexico, a little over month after surviving the incident.Hoyos, a marine biologist with over 30 years of experience studying sharks in their natural habitat, was on a research trip in Costa Rica when he was attacked by the shark in September.Less than two months on, and still bearing the scars from the attack on his face, he describes his recovery as \"incredible\" - and says he even hopes to encounter his assailant again.Hoyos calls the shark bite \"a battle scar that looks like gills\"For Hoyos, what happened to him that day in the waters off Cocos Island is the result of normal animal behaviour when confronted with a perceived threat. \"In this case, this bite was like a dog's,\" he says.\"Have you ever seen how dogs, when another dog gets too close, throw a quick bite? It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"Hoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.It was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".He then entered the water and began his slow descent.Getty ImagesGalapagos sharks can grow 3m in lengthHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"But Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"Hoyos and his colleagues tag sharks with probes like this oneHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.The Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.He had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.In addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo. \"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"Bleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"Mauricio HoyosHoyos had to use all the lessons he had learned during years of diving to survive the attackAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.Hoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"When they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.Hoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"It could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"Mauricio HoyosSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.And he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"Pointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"Meanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred.",

    "body": "The Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have ordered female patients, caretakers and staff to wear a burka – a full Islamic veil - to enter public health facilities in the western city of Herat, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) says.MSF said the restrictions came into effect from 5 November.\"These restrictions further impede women's lives and limit women's access to health care,\" Sarah Chateau, the agency's programme manager in Afghanistan, told the BBC. She said even those \"in need of urgent medical care\" had been affected.A spokesman for the Taliban government has denied MSF's account. Reports say restrictions have been partially relaxed since the alarm was raised.MSF, which supports paediatric services at Herat Regional Hospital, said it had observed a 28% drop in admissions of patients whose conditions were urgent during the first few days of the new enforcement.Ms Chateau said Taliban members had been denying entry to women without the burka by standing at the entrance of the health facilities. A burka is a one-piece veil that covers the face and body, often leaving just a mesh screen to see through.A Taliban spokesperson for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry, which enforces strict religious doctrines, dismissed reports that women were being forced to wear the burka.\"This is totally false. The position of the vice and virtue ministry is generally on the wearing of hijab,\" Saif-ul-Islam Khyber said.Hijab means covering up generally but also describes the headscarves worn by Muslim women.  The Taliban official also rejected reports that women were banned from medical centres for not wearing the burka.At the same time, the Taliban official said: \"Hijab is interpreted differently in different parts of the country, most of which are in conflict with Sharia [law].\"Activists have also alleged that Taliban guards have been enforcing the wearing of burkas for women to enter key facilities for the past week.One female activist from Herat province told the BBC that the dress code was applicable for those who want to enter hospitals, schools and government offices.There has also been criticism on social media over the Taliban's reported decision to impose the burka in Herat.An Afghan activist posted a video on X showing some women setting fire to the garments in protest at the Taliban's rule. The BBC has not independently verified the video.The Taliban enforced the burka during their first stint in power in the 1990s.Since seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban government has imposed numerous restrictions, particularly for women, in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.In 2022, the Taliban issued a decree ordering women to wear an all-covering Islamic face veil in public.  Taliban officials then described the face veil edict as \"advice\".\"Even though the veil edit was announced earlier, this is the first time we are seeing the enforcement of the burka in Herat. In the past few days more and more women are coming to the hospital with burkas,\" Ms Chateau said.Since returning to power, the Taliban have barred women from most workplaces and universities and girls from secondary schools. The UN has repeatedly urged the Taliban to end what it describes as \"gender apartheid\".Last week, the UN said it had suspended operations at a key border crossing between Afghanistan and Iran because of restrictions on Afghan women staff working at the border.Islam Qala, in Herat province, has been the main crossing point for hundreds of thousands of Afghans forced to leave Iran in the past year.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterThe UK government will allow tech firms and child safety charities to proactively test artificial intelligence tools to make sure they cannot create child sexual abuse imagery.An amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill announced on Wednesday would enable \"authorised testers\" to assess models for their ability to generate illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM) prior to their release.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the measures would \"ensure AI systems can be made safe at the source\" - though some campaigners argue more still needs to be done.It comes as the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said the number of AI-related CSAM reports had doubled over the past year.The charity, one of only a few in the world licensed to actively search for child abuse content online, said it had removed 426 pieces of reported material between January and October 2025.This was up from 199 over the same period in 2024, it said.Its chief executive, Kerry Smith , welcomed the government's proposals, saying they would build on its longstanding efforts to combat online CSAM.\"AI tools have made it so survivors can be victimised all over again with just a few clicks, giving criminals the ability to make potentially limitless amounts of sophisticated, photorealistic child sexual abuse material,\" she said.\"Today's announcement could be a vital step to make sure AI products are safe before they are released.\"Rani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at the NSPCC, welcomed the measures for encouraging firms to have more accountability and scrutiny over their models and child safety.\"But to make a real difference for children, this cannot be optional,\" she said.\"Government must ensure that there is a mandatory duty for AI developers to use this provision so that safeguarding against child sexual abuse is an essential part of product design.\"The government said its proposed changes to the law would also equip AI developers and charities to make sure AI models have adequate safeguards around extreme pornography and non-consensual intimate images.Child safety experts and organisations have frequently warned AI tools developed, in part, using huge volumes of wide-ranging online content are being used to create highly realistic abuse imagery of children or non-consenting adults.Some, including the IWF and child safety charity Thorn, have said these risk jeopardising efforts to police such material by making it difficult to identify whether such content is real or AI-generated.Researchers have suggested there is growing demand for these images online, particularly on the dark web, and that some are being created by children.What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?Earlier this year, the Home Office said the UK would be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison.Ms Kendall said on Wednesday that \"by empowering trusted organisations to scrutinise their AI models, we are ensuring child safety is designed into AI systems, not bolted on as an afterthought\".\"We will not allow technological advancement to outpace our ability to keep children safe,\" she said.Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips said the measures would also \"mean legitimate AI tools cannot be manipulated into creating vile material and more children will be protected from predators as a result\".",

    "body": "New consoles used to come out every five years – so where's the PlayStation 6?4 hours agoTom GerkenTechnology reporterGetty ImagesYou used to be able to count the number of years between game consoles on one hand.The original Sony PlayStation came out in the UK in September 1995. Five years later, the PS2 was released and brought with it significant changes.It was a similar story for other consoles but, of late, things seem to have slowed down - which might explain why, as the PS5 hits its fifth anniversary, a potential PS6 is nowhere in sight. According to PlayStation's business boss, Eric Lempel, that's because there's plenty of life in the old dog yet.\"I would say we're really hitting our stride now,\" he told BBC News.Given there remains \"a lot of great content\"  the company is \"just going to continue with PS5\" he explained.Mr Lempel oversaw the launch of the console, which was plagued by supply chain issues upon its release as a result of a global chip shortage.The supply problems were resolved after three years, and the console has gone on to sell more than 84 million units worldwide.And, as it turns five, he said the title which would become the PS5's biggest seller hadn't even been released yet.\"I'm not gonna tell you which one, but I think it's still to come,\" he said.Team AsobiPlayStation has had several hits this generation, with 2024 exclusive Astro Bot winning the Game of the Year at the Game AwardsThere are plenty of high-profile games in the works.Marvel's Wolverine, made by the same team behind the successful Spider-Man series, is set for a 2026 release - while Intergalactic, the upcoming game from Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog, is in development.Industry expert Christopher Dring said Naughty Dog's schedule went some way to explain why consoles were lasting longer - because it takes more time to make games for them than it used to.\"During the PS3 generation, Naughty Dog released four games,\" he said. \"During the PS4 generation, that dropped to three games - so far during the PS5 generation, it's not released one.\"Games are taking so much longer to make that, in some cases, their development schedules are longer than it takes new hardware to come out.\"And he said this story was repeated \"across the industry\", with Grand Theft Auto 6 - which will be on both PlayStation and Xbox - recently delayed to November 2026.But if the big hitters are coming more slowly, Mr Dring said, another factor might also explain the longevity of a console like the PS5 - gamers are more willing to try new things.\"We're seeing on average people are playing 50% more games than they did last generation, and they're really branching out to different types of games,\" he said.\"They'll play the hits, but they'll also play smaller games or unique games that they've never heard of before.\"LocalThunkThe indie poker-like game Balatro was a surprise hit in 2024, winning several awards despite being made by a single person.One of the reasons the firm may not rush to unveil new hardware is the PS5 remains ahead of its rivals, outselling Microsoft's Series X and S consoles - at least in the home console space.The same can't be said when it comes to handholds though.The Nintendo Switch - a handheld console which connects to a TV to play games on a big screen - is the third-best selling console in history.Its sequel the Switch 2, which released in June 2025, has already sold 10 million units in its first few months.It's not a fight PlayStation is giving up though.\"We're always about new innovation in the category,\" Mr Lempel said.The success of Nintendo's hardware perhaps inspired Sony to release the PlayStation Portal, an accessory which lets you stream from a PS5 you already own.Getty ImagesUnlike a bespoke handheld console, the PlayStation Portal cannot download games onto the device - it just displays games you stream.Mr Lempel said Portal was \"performing really well\" and though he did not reveal exact sales figures, he said it had \"exceeded our expectations\". \"It's been a very successful product for us,\" he said.Mr Dring said he believed there was another difference in the way games were being released now which might contribute to the length of time between hardware releases.\"Some of the biggest games today are still playable on PS4, and for the first three years it was relatively rare to see any PS5-only releases,\" he said.\"The games dominating the most played charts are titles like Fortnite, Roblox and Call of Duty: Warzone... games that are, in some cases, over 10 years old and are playable on much older devices.\"So it might be we are going to get a new console in 2027 - but the likelihood is that most of the games that will be launching alongside that device will be fully playable on existing hardware, too.\"",

    "body": "Image source, PA / Owen HumphreysByElizabeth RizziniLead Weather Presenter There is a good chance of seeing the Northern Lights in the early hours of Wednesday or on Wednesday night in many parts of the UK.That is because the Sun is going through an active phase experiencing a number of eruptions, called Coronal Mass Ejections. These send solar particles towards the Earth.It is the interaction of these particles with the Earth's atmosphere that create the stunning light displays we see in the night sky.According to the UK Met Office Space Weather forecast, the best chance of seeing the Northern Lights or aurora will be across the northern half of the UK. But there is also a chance in clear skies further south.Image source, BBC Weather Watcher / olly79Image caption, Portmahomack in the Highlands captured last weekWhat is a geomagnetic storm? Geomagnetic storms are disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field that last minutes or hours and are caused by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and solar flares.It has been reported that there are three CMEs heading towards Earth from the Sun.The National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), who measure the strength of these storms, say that there is chance of a Strong G3 or even Severe G4 geomagnetic storm being triggered especially on Wednesday into Thursday.Although dangerous for astronauts, geomagnetic storms are not harmful to humans as Earth's atmosphere protects us from the radiation.However, these storms can sometimes disrupt satellites and also different forms of electronic devices, such as phones.For example, in 2017 two massive solar flares fired out from the surface of the Sun disrupted devices such as GPS navigation systems on Earth.And the Victorians also struggled with the effect of space weather in 1859 when a huge solar eruption caused a geomagnetic storm that interfered with railway signalling and telegraph lines. This was known as the Carrington Event.The KP index is an alternative measure of geomagnetic activity extending from KP1 to KP9. It can be be used to denote the southern extent of the aurora. This storm is classed as a rare KP8. This means the aurora could be visible across many parts of the UK including the south in the nights to come.There may be effects on power grids and satellite navigation.What is a Coronal Mass Ejection?Image source, NASA via ReutersImage caption, A NASA image of the Sun showing solar eruptionsCoronal Mass Ejections are huge bursts of charged plasma travelling at millions of miles an hour that explode out of the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona.They spew light, energy and solar material into space, sometimes towards Earth, which is the case this week.The solar material, or plasma, is charged. These charged particles can interact with gases in the Earth's atmosphere, particularly near the poles, leading to the displays of aurora. These ejections can sometimes take days to reach the Earth.In addition on Tuesday, the US National Weather Service Space Weather Prediction Center reported seeing a massive solar flare on the Sun - likely the strongest of the current cycle.Solar flares are bursts of electromagnetic radiation that travel from the Sun at the speed of light, reaching Earth in just over eight minutes. These can also cause aurora.Clear skies for the aurora?Image source, BBC WeatherTo see the aurora find a dark spot with minimal light pollution and a good view of the northern horizon. The aurora is sometimes more clearly viewed through a camera lens.You will also need clear skies. So what is in the forecast?On Tuesday night there will always be the risk of some cloud around but clear skies should develop in southern and north-eastern Scotland as a weather front clears southwards. Northern England and Northern Ireland will also see some clear skies in the second half of the night. There could also be some clearer spells developing across Wales, the Midlands and perhaps south-west England later in the night.We are less likely to see clear skies overnight on Wednesday although there could be some early on for East Anglia and later for northern Scotland. If you are not lucky enough to catch the Aurora Borealis this time, keep an eye out for further alerts here at BBC Weather. ",

Everyone is very nice, we're having a very nice time.\"It's great being here in Manchester because it has real character, we're proud to be part of it.\"The skyscraper has been designed by architect Ian Simpson.Salboy was created by the Salford bookmaker Fred Done.'Booming'The Nobu brand was launched by De Niro with film producer Meir Taper and celebrity chef Nobu Matsuhisa.They opened their first restaurant in New York in 1994 and they have since expanded their hospitality empire to dozens of cities around the world.Manchester will become Nobu's second UK location, 35 years after it opened in London.Salboy managing director Simon Ismail said: \"Manchester's been booming for over 10 years now and the population just continues to grow.\"To entice the likes of Nobu and what they bring in terms of quality and brand and exposure - it's enormous and I think this is a catalyst to really push on and do more in the city.\"Actor Robert De Niro spoke at a press conference on Tuesday The planned Nobu Manchester scheme will feature a second building on Great Bridgewater Street, which will stand at 23 storeys tall and have 133 apartments aimed at the affordable homes market.Manchester City Council leader Bev Craig said the plans were a \"symbol that international businesses are choosing Manchester\". She added: \"It's not everyday you watch Robert De Niro take out an apartment in Deansgate is it?\"\"It is a boost - we've said for a long time we wanted to be a world-class city and if you want to be a world-class city you've got to get global names.\"The fact we are seeing global names - not just actors - but global businesses that only go to cities where they will be successful is a big boost for Manchester.\"The first phase of Nobu Manchester - a 40-storey tower with 362 apartments built above a series of Victorian railway arches - was completed in 2024 on the site of the  old Manchester Central station.The first phase of the Viadux scheme includes a swimming pool underneath the former Manchester Central stationRelated stories",

    "body": "4 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesGlobal girl group Katseye. Top row L-R: Lara, Daniela, Sophie. Bottom row L-R: Yoonchae, Manon, MeganThe girl group Katseye say they have received multiple online death threats since they made their debut last year.The six-piece, who were recently nominated for best new artist at the Grammy Awards, told BBC News that the messages, which have also targeted their families, \"can get really heavy\".\"I try to tell myself it doesn't matter, but if 1,000 people are sending you death threats, it's jarring,\" said singer Lara Raj. \"Even if it's not going to happen, it's heavy.\"Raj, who is a US citizen with Tamil Indian heritage, has also been subjected to racist comments, and was falsely reported to ICE for \"working and residing in the United States without legal authorisation\".The 20-year-old said she had \"deleted Twitter\" (now known as X), to avoid seeing negative comments.\"I realised I am not the audience for other people's opinions,\" she said.Katseye did not specify the nature of the threats they have received; but aggressive and inappropriate behaviour is depressingly common amongst fan communities.Last year, Chappell Roan criticised the \"many nonconsensual physical and social interactions\" she had had with fans, including people harassing her family and friends.The pop band Muna chastised some of their supporters for \"spreading falsehoods about us and our loved ones for clout and attention\"; while Doja Cat called out \"creepy\" behaviour from a section of her fanbase.\"Our career has been really short, but I feel like we've gotten a lot of things already said to us, to our families,\" said Katseye singer Sophia Laforteza.\"We know that we signed up for being so public. We know it's a part of fame. But it doesn't change the fact that we are human.\"Raj also pointed out the sexist nature of the comments the band have received.\"People see us as women to rank. They'll grade us based on how pretty we are, our singing skill, dancing skill, and then add it up and give us a percentage.\"That's so dystopian.\"\"I feel like it's very terrorising on the mind,\" added her bandmate Manon Bannerman.Getty ImagesThe band, who were formed in 2023, were trained in the K-pop system but take a more Western approach to their musicDespite the online negativity, Katseye are having a remarkable year.Their second EP, Beautiful Chaos, peaked at number two in the US album charts, thanks to the gratingly brilliant lead single, Gnarly, and the Charli XCX-penned follow-up, Gabriella.An advert they filmed for the clothing brand Gap went viral in August, racking up 400 million plays and 8 billion social media \"impressions\" (\"Isn't there only 7 billion people in the world?\" asked singer Megan Skiendiel when presented with the statistic).Last month, they won best performance at the MTV Awards. Five days ago, they became only the third girl group in history to receive a best new artist nomination at the Grammys, following SWV and Wilson Phillips.The six members, who range in age between 17 and 22, are truly international. Daniela Avanzini is a Venezuelan-Cuban American from Atlanta. Raj is an Indian-Sri Lankan American from New York. Bannerman is a Ghanaian-Italian from Zurich. Megan Skiendiel is a Chinese-Singaporean American from Honolulu. Laforteza is from Manila in the Philippines. And Yoonchae Jeung was born and raised in South Korea.The band spoke to BBC News in the middle of a whistle-stop European tour, just two weeks before launching their first, sold-out, tour of the USThey were hand-picked to form Katseye on The Debut: Dream Academy, a reality show created by Korean entertainment giant Hybe – the label behind BTS and Le Sserafim - and America's Geffen Records, home to Olivia Rodrigo and Guns N' Roses.Thousands applied, but only 20 made it through to the training and development stage – a gruelling, two-year bootcamp of daily dance lessons, vocal practice and brutal feedback.Rehearsing one dance routine, they were scolded for their lack of synchronisation: \"It's got to sound like one person walking down the stairs. It can't sound like a group of people falling down the stairs.\"Those days are long behind them. The sextet learned the intricate, aerobic choreography for their Gap advert in just one day.\"The longer we're together as a group, the shorter it takes,\" said Skiendiel. \"One day of rehearsals and we're really in sync. Then we nitpick the rest.\"GAPThe band's Gap advert was seen more times in three days than the brand's four prior releases combinedLast year's SIS (Soft Is Strong) EP established the band with a confident, slick pop sound. But it was Gnarly that really put them on the map.Released in April, the song is two minutes and seventeen seconds of aggressively chaotic beat drops, juddering synths and gang vocals. It instantly divided opinion: \"Genuinely atrocious\" was one of the kinder comments. “But people kept coming back for more. At the time of writing, it's been streamed more than half a billion times. No less than The New York Times called it “the future of K-pop”. \"When we first heard it, we knew it was going to be shocking,\" said Avanzini.\"That was so exciting, the idea of making people upset,\" agreed Raj. \"Not giving them something that's just okay - we were really giving something thrilling.\"It may have been polarising - but Gnarly turned Katseye from a pop curiosity to a burgeoning cultural phenomenon. One early fan was Melanie C, who hosted a showcase for the band in London last month.Speaking on stage, she said Katseye reminded her of the Spice Girls.\"Something about the Spice Girls was so many people felt they could identify with one of us,\" she said. \"And I think that's so beautiful about [the diversity of] your band: You open that door even further for so many people.\"\"We pride ourselves so much that our group is so diverse,\" Bannerman told the BBC.\"It's our number one priority to show the girlies out there to be proud of where they come from, no matter what they look like.\"And, despite the online pushback she's received, Raj encourages musicians from diverse backgrounds to pursue their dreams.\"Please do it,\" she told the BBC. \"You cannot feel held back. \"Our skin colour, our culture is our power. Use it and own it.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris Mason,Political editor and Henry Zeffman,Chief political correspondentAllies of the prime minister are making it clear he would fight any challenge to his leadership from Labour MPs.There are fears from those loyal to Sir Keir Starmer that his job might be under immediate threat, perhaps as soon as shortly after the Budget in a fortnight's time.Critics say it is evidence that Downing Street is \"in full bunker mode\" which \"won't help the government out of the hole we're in.\"Friends of Sir Keir are deeply worried about what they see as plotting going on to try to replace him and are seeking to make clear what they see as the grave risks of a leadership challenge.Those names being discussed by Labour MPs as potential candidates to displace Sir Keir include some of his closest cabinet allies, especially Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. Some also speculate about the ambitions of Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, and backbenchers including the former transport secretary Louise Haigh.\"He will fight this,\" one minister said, before making reference to a key by-election in 2021 which Labour lost to the Conservatives, prompting Sir Keir to consider resigning as Labour's leader.\"This is not a Hartlepool moment,\" they added.\"He is one of only two people alive who have won a general election for Labour. It'd be madness to run against him after 17 months.\"For months now, plenty in the Labour Party have acknowledged that the government faces a likely crunch point after devolved elections in Scotland and Wales and local elections in many parts of England next May.Labour is widely expected to do badly in those elections, but there are growing concerns from some in the party that it can't wait until then to contemplate a change of leader.Downing Street is aware of the potential imminence of such a threat to them.One senior Labour MP told us: \"It's all very well to say wait for the locals, but that's my activist base I'm sending into the gunfire. I can't lose all my councillors.\"Another Labour source said: \"The list of reasons for people to move after the Budget are growing by the day. \"If Wes is brave and moves he may well be rewarded by being prime minister by Christmas.\"The ambition of Streeting is seen with particular suspicion from some loyal to the prime minister.A spokesman for Streeting told the BBC \"these claims are categorically untrue\". \"Wes's focus has entirely been on cutting waiting lists for the first time in 15 years, recruiting 2,500 more GPs, and rebuilding the NHS that saved his life,\" he added.The health secretary is due to do a round of interviews on Wednesday morning which were due to be focused on his plans for shaking up the NHS in England.A government source said Downing Street \"has gone into full bunker mode, turning on their most loyal cabinet members for absolutely no reason\". \"Unfortunately there is a pattern of Keir's team briefing against his own people - they did it to Angela, Lisa, Lucy, now it's Wes's turn,\" the source added.\"A circular firing squad won't help the government out of the hole we're in,\" a government source said - referring to the former and current deputy leaders, Angela Rayner and Lucy Powell respectively, and the Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy.The prime minister's supporters are telling Labour MPs they should be careful what they wish for. They argue a leadership contest would plunge the party into the chaos associated with the final years of the Conservative Party's stint in office which came to an end last year, and install a leader who does not have their own mandate from the country.They are trying to convince their colleagues that a contest could destabilise the international markets too, and would jeopardise the good relationship the prime minister has established with President Trump.But others, including some ministers, fret about what they perceive to be the desperate position the government is in.\"It's terrible. He [Starmer] is hated out there. It is worse than it got under Corbyn. I don't see how this is sustainable until May,\" one minister said.Opinion polls suggest Sir Keir is deeply unpopular, perhaps even the most unpopular British prime minister in the history of modern opinion polling. Polls also suggest the Labour Party has commanded the support of no more than a fifth of the electorate in recent months. A cabinet minister who is supportive of the prime minister sums up the mood among their colleagues as they see it: \"There are those who see it as a choice between this Labour government and perfection. \"The closer they can nudge us towards the policies they see as perfect, the happier they are. \"But the choice isn't between us and perfection, it's between us and Reform.\"The rise of Reform UK has concentrated minds in Downing Street in recent months.The prime minister sees Labour's battle with Reform leader Nigel Farage as generation-defining – and the prospect of losing to Reform at a general election as vastly worse than Labour losses to the Conservatives.He believes he has the energy and wherewithal to take on and defeat Farage.But a growing number of his colleagues are not convinced.\"We are not like the Tories. We're not going to change leader more than once in a parliament,\" one Labour MP first elected last year told us.",

    "body": "How an Afghan child bride became one of Europe's top bodybuilders5 hours agoMahjooba NowrouziBBC News AfghanBBCRoya Karimi (centre) was once a child bride - now she is a top bodybuilderThe woman standing on stage glistens in a crystal-studded bikini.Her glowing, tanned skin shows off each of her well-defined muscle lines, the result of hours of weight training in the gym.Roya Karimi's perfectly-applied make-up and hair highlighted blonde wouldn't look out of place in the finals of Miss Universe.It is hard to imagine that just 15 years ago, she was a teenage mother in Afghanistan, married off as a child bride, before she escaped to her new life.Now aged 30, she is one of Europe's top bodybuilders, and will be competing in the World Bodybuilding Championships this week. Her rise has been meteoric – she only took up the sport professionally less than two years ago.None of this looked likely when Roya fled Afghanistan with her mother and young son. Back then, she sought refuge in Norway where she made a new life for herself, continuing her education and becoming a nurse, while meeting her new husband, who also bodybuilds.Bodybuilding helped her break free from the mental and social limitations that had been imposed on her for years, she says.\"Every time I go to the gym, I remember that there was a time in Afghanistan when I wasn't even allowed to exercise freely,\" Roya told BBC News Afghan.Roya spoke to BBC News Afghan from her home and gym in Norway Roya's life story has been one of fighting against restrictive traditions and rebuilding her identity - and trying to inspire women in her home country who face widespread restrictions.Some of those restrictions existed when Roya lived in Afghanistan - a result of social norms. But they have got worse since 2021, when the Taliban returned to power. Now, women in Afghanistan are banned from attending school beyond the age of 12, getting most jobs, unable to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and required not to raise their voices in public.\"I was lucky to be able to get out of that situation, but many women still don't have their most basic human rights, such as education. It's really sad and heartbreaking,\" says Roya.Searching for a different futureBut years before the Taliban returned to power, Roya decided she \"didn't want that life\".Her decision to flee Afghanistan in 2011, leaving her then husband behind, carried many risks for a woman in traditional Afghan society. It is not a time she likes to remember - and does not want to talk about it.In Norway, Roya faced a completely different environment. She had to adapt to a new, more liberal culture, find a job to support herself and her family and learn Norwegian.It was difficult to juggle all the demands in the early days, but her efforts eventually paid off.Roya studied nursing and worked at a hospital in the capital, Oslo.Roya only became a professional bodybuilder 18 months agoRoya's introduction to bodybuilding was the next turning point in her life. Attending gyms wasn't just about physical exercise; it was also a way to rebuild her self-confidence and redefine her personal identity.It was also where she met her second husband, fellow Afghan Kamal Jalaluddin. He had a long history in bodybuilding and is one of Roya's main supporters.\"Before I met Kamal, I was doing sports, but not at a professional level,\" she explained.\"His support gave me the courage to choose a competitive and taboo-breaking path. I believe that if a man stands by a woman, amazing things can happen.\"Death threats and insultsEighteen months ago, Roya decided to leave her nursing career and enter the world of bodybuilding professionally. It was a risky decision, although the main challenge for her was not changing jobs. Instead, she said it was more about adapting to freedoms after the restraints she had experienced in Afghanistan.\"Our biggest challenge was to break through the boundaries and frameworks that others had set for us - the unwritten rules that were imposed on us in the name of tradition, culture, religion or whatever,\" she said. \"But when you decide to innovate, you have to free yourself from those frameworks.\"It has also not come without its problems.The bikinis, flowing hair and heavy make-up she wears on stage are a million miles away from the social norms - and now official restrictions - which dictate how women dress and present themselves in her home country.It is perhaps not surprising then that her social media accounts have been bombarded with criticism, often including threats of violence and even death.She dismisses the comments. \"People only see my appearance and my bikini. But behind this appearance, there are years of suffering, effort and perseverance. These successes have not come easily.\"But social media is far from a negative for Roya: it allows her to speak to women back in Afghanistan, talking to them about the importance of physical health, self-confidence and rebuilding one's identity.Roya's husband, Kamal Jalaluddin, is also a bodybuilder - and one of her biggest supportersNow Roya is preparing to compete in the world bodybuilding championships - which start on Thursday in Barcelona - where she is hoping to build on successes she had earlier this year.She won gold in the Wellness category at the Stoperiet Open bodybuilding competition in April - a category which places special emphasis on natural fitness, healthy appearance and unobtrusive beauty, rather than large muscle mass.Her victory was quickly followed by another at the prestigious Norway Classic 2025, which attracts athletes from all over Scandinavia.From there, it was onto the European championships - which clinched her a spot in the world championships.\"I feel a deep sense of happiness, pride and honour within me,\" she said as she prepared to compete in the Spanish city. \"It's been an incredibly tough journey throughout the year, but step by step, I managed to achieve gold medals along the way.\"From the sidelines, her husband and son are always cheering her on.\"Seeing Roya on stage was the fulfilment of a dream we built together,\" enthuses Kamal.But for Roya, this contest in particular is for more than just her and her family.\"I feel mentally strong and fully ready to give my all, hoping to make history by setting this record in the name of Afghan girls and women for the very first time.\"",

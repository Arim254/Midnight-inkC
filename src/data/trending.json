    "body": "8 hours agoBen MilneandJames Percy,BBC NewsBBCThe first non-European Pope in more than 1,000 years, the Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, a soul legend and one of the world's most famous designers - here are some of the well-known faces no longer with us.Among those we remember are Hollywood stars Robert Redford, Diane Keaton and Gene Hackman, and theatrical dames Joan Plowright and Patricia Routledge.Robert RedfordGetty ImagesRobert Redford's acting career spanned more than 50 films and won him an Oscar as a director. For many filmgoers though, he was simply the best-looking cinema star in the world - once described as \"a chunk of Mount Rushmore levered into stonewashed denims\". As well as leading roles in hits such as All The President's Men, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Way We Were, Redford also launched the Sundance Film Festival to champion independent filmmakers.Read moreDiane KeatonGetty ImagesLos-Angeles-born Keaton shot to fame with her role in The Godfather, but enjoyed a long creative partnership with Woody Allen. Annie Hall, a comedy based on their off-screen relationship, earned her a Best Actress Oscar and they collaborated on several other films. She was nominated for three further Oscars - all in the best actress category - for her work in Something's Gotta Give, Marvin's Room and Reds.Read morePrunella ScalesGetty Images\"BASIL!\" - the unmistakable sound of Sybil Fawlty admonishing her pompous and incompetent husband, is probably how Prunella Scales will best be remembered.  Apart from starring in sitcom Fawlty Towers, she played many other roles on screen and stage, including Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett's play, A Question of Attribution. She also enjoyed an unlikely hit late in life with Channel 4's Great Canal Journeys, travelling waterways in the UK and elsewhere with her husband, the actor Timothy West.Read moreDavid LynchGetty ImagesPerhaps the most avant-garde filmmaker ever to make it big in Hollywood, David Lynch brought surrealism to the big screen in films including Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet. However, his groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks remained for many his greatest work - portraying an idyllic American small town encroached by a chaotic unconscious world.Read moreMalcolm-Jamal WarnerGetty ImagesBest known for his role as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show, Malcolm-Jamal Warner starred in the hugely popular US sitcom from 1984-1992. He had been handpicked for his breakout role on the final day of a nationwide audition - \"I was literally the last person they saw,\" he recalled in a 2023 interview. More recently, Warner appeared in several television programmes including Malcom & Eddie, and The Resident.Read moreGene HackmanGetty ImagesAs New York cop Popeye Doyle in the 1971 film The French Connection, Gene Hackman's cemented his reputation as one of Hollywood's great tough guys. That role won him his first acting Oscar (the second was for the 1992 Western, Unforgiven). Hackman also showed a gift for comedy in The Royal Tennenbaums and Young Frankenstein, among others.Read moreDharmendraGetty ImagesDubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\", Dharmendra was one of India's most famous film stars, with a career that spanned seven decades and more than 300 films. He could turn his hand to romance, action roles or comedy. One of his most popular films was the 1975 blockbuster, Sholay, where he played a petty criminal hired by the police to capture a villain. Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Read moreDame Joan PlowrightGetty ImagesBorn in Lincolnshire, Joan Plowright became a leading lady in London's West End in the 1950s. She appeared opposite Sir Laurence Olivier - the man she later married - in John Osborne's The Entertainer at the Royal Court in 1957. Her career lasted more than 60 years, earning her awards for both stage and screen roles. In 2004, she was made a Dame of the British Empire.Read moreVal KilmerGetty Images\"The most unsung leading man of his generation,\" according to one movie critic, Val Kilmer starred as Tom Cruise's rival in Top Gun, Jim Morrison in The Doors and (less happily) Batman, taking over the role from Michael Keaton. In the early 2000s, the starring roles dried up, and in 2014, Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation left him with a tube in his trachea and difficulty breathing - something that was written into his final role, reprising his \"Iceman\" character in the 2022 Top Gun sequel.Read moreTerence StampGetty ImagesA stalwart of swinging London in the 1960s, Terence Stamp became famous for a string of films including Billy Budd, Modesty Blaise and Far From The Madding Crowd - as well as dating icons of that decade, Julie Christie and Jean Shrimpton. In the 1970s he took a break from acting, before returning as Superman villain General Zod, and later starring as a transgender woman Bernadette Bassenger in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Read moreBrigitte BardotGetty ImagesFrench actress who swept away cinema's staid 1950s' portrayal of women and personified a new age of sexual liberation. On screen, Brigitte Bardot was a cocktail of kittenish charm and continental sensuality, but it was an image she grew to loathe - eventually abandoning her career to campaign for animal welfare. Later, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.Read moreClaudia CardinaleGetty ImagesTunisian-born, Claudia Cardinale had a six-decade-long career, rising to fame during the golden age of Italian cinema. She shot to fame in 1963 when she appeared in Federico Fellini's Oscar-winning 8 1/2 and Luchino Visconti's epic period drama The Leopard. She also worked in Hollywood in the 1960s, starring in The Pink Panther, where co-star David Niven paid her the best compliment she said she ever received: \"Claudia, along with spaghetti, you're Italy's greatest invention.\"Read moreDame Patricia RoutledgeDame Patricia Routledge was best known as Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced \"Bouquet\") in the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances. \"She's an absolute monster and I enjoyed playing her enormously,\" said the actress. Other comic roles included her monologues as Kitty in Victoria Wood: As Seen On TV (\"I could've married, I've given gallons of blood and I can't stomach whelks, so that's me for you\"). Success in TV followed a long career on stage, both in the West End and on Broadway.Read moreGraham GreeneGetty ImagesCanadian actor Graham Greene is best remembered for his role as Kicking Bird in the 1990 Western, Dances With Wolves. It was a part for which he received an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category. In real life, Greene was a member of the Oneida Nation, part of the Six Nations Reserve in southern Ontario. Greene had several jobs, including draftsman and steelworker, before becoming an actor in the 1970s. Other films he appeared in included The Green Mile, Die Hard With A Vengeance and Maverick.Read morePauline CollinsGetty ImagesAs Shirley Valentine, the frustrated Liverpool housewife who finds romance on a Greek island, Pauline Collins achieved international fame and an Oscar nomination. The Devon-born actress was already a well-known face on British TV before the 1989 film, starring for several years in the hit ITV series Upstairs Downstairs (and its spin-off, Thomas And Sarah) alongside her real-life husband, John Alderton.Read moreStanley BaxterGetty ImagesA big star on British TV for several decades, Stanley Baxter starred in a number of hit series between the 1960s and the 1980s. The Glaswegian comic actor specialised in parodies of television and Hollywood films, where he played most of the parts. He also appeared in the ITV children's show Mr Majeika before retiring from television in 1990, but he continued to appear as a panto dame in Scotland for several more years.Read moreRob ReinerGetty ImagesOne of Hollywood's best known filmmakers, responsible for a string of much-loved films across a range of genres. Reiner's work encompassed the classic comedies This Is Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally, the courtroom drama A Few Good Men, and the tense thriller Misery. His directing career followed a successful spell as a TV star in the 1970s US sitcom, All In The Family.Read moreActors and performers who also died in 2025 include:Jean Marsh - Upstairs Downstairs actress and co-creatorRichard Chamberlain - star of Dr Kildare, Shogun and The Thorn BirdsThe Vivienne - drag queen and winner of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019Michelle Trachtenberg - Gossip Girl and Buffy The Vampire Slayer actressTony Slattery - British actor and comedianTatiana Schlossberg - climate journalist and granddaughter of John F KennedyJohn Stapleton - British journalist and TV presenterThis year saw the deaths of former US Vice-President Dick Cheney, the Conservative politician Norman Tebbit, and the influential political activist Charlie Kirk.Dick CheneyGetty ImagesOne of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, Dick Cheney served two terms under George W Bush, from 2001 to 2009. After the 9/11 attacks, Dick Cheney was one of the main driving forces behind the \"war on terror\" that followed, and central to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Although known as a drier-than-dry conservative, he was a bitter critic of President Donald Trump, arguing in 2024 that there had \"never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic\".Read moreLord Norman TebbitGetty ImagesAs one of Margaret Thatcher's closest political allies, Norman Tebbit revelled in his combative reputation (he was once described as \"a semi-house-trained polecat\" by a Labour opponent). He also gave the 1980s one of its most memorable political soundbites when he described how his father \"got on his bike to look for work\".He left the Conservative Cabinet in 1987 to care for his wife, who had been left disabled by the Brighton bomb attack three years earlier.Read moreBaroness Jenny RandersonPA MediaLiberal Democrat politician Jenny Randerson became the first female Liberal Democrat minister anywhere, when she was appointed Wales's Minister for Culture, Sport and the Welsh Language in 2000. She held the position for three years, and was also acting Deputy First Minister in the Welsh Assembly (now the Senedd) from July 2001 to June 2002.Read moreCharlie KirkGetty ImagesRight-wing American activist and influencer who co-founded Turning Point USA, a student organisation focused on spreading conservative ideas on college campuses. Kirk became known for inviting students to challenge his world-view. Clips of these exchanges built him a huge following - more than five million followers on X and seven million on TikTok - that helped him mobilise the youth vote for President Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election.Read moreBaroness Helen NewloveGetty ImagesHelen Newlove's career in politics was driven by the death of her husband Garry, who was murdered by three youths in 2007. She served as Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, a role she was appointed to twice. She was made a Conservative peer in 2010 and also served as deputy speaker in the House of Lords.Read moreJean-Marie Le PenGetty ImagesAn unrepentant extremist, Jean-Marie Le Pen succeeded in pushing his far-right views into mainstream French politics. In 1972 he founded the Front National, a party committed to stopping immigration. Le Pen's attempts to win the presidency foundered, although he finished runner-up in 2002. In 2015 he was expelled from his party by its new leader - his daughter, Marine Le Pen - after repeating a claim that the Holocaust was merely \"a point of detail\" in World War Two.Read morePolitical figures who died in 2025 also included: Dame Annette Brooke - The longest-serving female Liberal Democrat MPRaila Odinga - Former prime minister of KenyaMia Love - First US black Republican congresswomanIon Iliescu - Romania's first post-Communist presidentOur look back includes Beach Boy Brian Wilson, singer Marianne Faithfull, and reggae pioneer Jimmy Cliff.Marianne FaithfullGetty ImagesMarianne Faithfull rose to fame in 1964 at the age of 17, scoring a top-10 UK hit with As Tears Go By, co-written by her then-boyfriend, Mick Jagger. But early success as a singer and actor was cut short by heroin addiction.

    "body": "6 minutes agoTom BennettReutersA passenger has described \"chaos\" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.\"I saw staff running around and people crying and people on the floor and chaos erupted,\" he said. \"We got off the train and I saw people bleeding with very severe injuries.\"A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu Picchu\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoThomas MackintoshWatch: The weather forecast for New Year's Eve in the UKThe UK is gearing up to mark the end of 2025 and celebrate the New Year at midnight as forecasters warn of cold snaps across large parts of the country.Yellow warnings have been issued by the Met Office for snow and ice across England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland; they will be in force between midnight and noon on 2 January.Chilly conditions are expected to have an impact on transport, with people urged to prepare for longer journey times by road, bus and train services if travelling for New Year firework displays in London and Edinburgh.Colder Arctic air will spread across the UK from New Year's Day with significant snowfall expected in northern Scotland, according to BBC Weather.Follow live: Nations around the world welcome the new year Chaos, fun and fireballs: Working the Hogmanay night shiftFireworks and first-footing: Your guide to Hogmanay in EdinburghFive New Year traditions you (probably) didn't know aboutMeanwhile, the Met Police has warned people not to try to go to the Mayor of London's fireworks event, centred around the London Eye and Big Ben, as tickets have sold out.National Rail has said a number of train companies will be running extra services after midnight on New Year's Eve as events in London start to draw to a close.Primrose Hill in Camden - a popular vantage point offering panoramic views of the capital - will be closed after the Royal Parks charity decided to shut the park from 20:00 GMT on 30 December until 06:00 on New Year's Day.There had been concerns about the safety of celebrations at the park after 16-year-old Harry Pitman was fatally stabbed there during the New Year's Eve fireworks viewing in 2023.Getty Images2023 was the last time Edinburgh held an official celebration, as \"extreme weather\" forced a cancellation in 2024.Forecasters say there will be strong northerly winds too with an additional Met Office yellow warning for wind in north-east Scotland and the Northern Isles from 21:00 GMT Wednesday to 09:00 Thursday.On Friday an area of snow showers will move across Northern Ireland, Wales, southern areas of North-West England, the Midlands and into southern England.The cold spell is likely to last over a week with amber cold health alerts issued across the whole of England by the UK's Health Security Agency (UKHSA).Cold health alerts from the UKHSA have been upgraded to amber for the whole of England and will be in place until 12:00 on 6 January.The alerts warn of a rise in deaths particularly among elderly and vulnerable people.The Met Office has warned of injuries due to slips and falls on icy surfaces, which will develop quickly as sleet and snow clears.New snow and ice warning is in place for a large swathe of England and Wales, including Chester and Greater Manchester down to London and Kent.Elsewhere, final preparations are being made ahead of huge firework displays in Edinburgh and in London.Getty ImagesSome fireworks from last year's cancelled event will be used tonight in EdinburghIn Edinburgh, tens of thousands of revellers from across the world will be attending the city's famous Hogmanay street party which culminates in the traditional firework display above Edinburgh Castle at midnight.Organisers will be saving money this year as they will be using some of the fireworks bought for last year's event which was cancelled.Will Evans, director of Titanium Fireworks, told the BBC this year there would be a six-minute show, involving about 10,000 fireworks, accompanied by a bespoke soundtrack.Will it snow on NYE?The last ScotRail trains on Hogmanay will depart earlier than normal and no trains will run on New Year's Day, the rail firm has said.Elsewhere in Scotland, Stonehaven's Hogmanay fireballs event will be go ahead, with about 10,000 people expected to attend.",

    "body": "Gold and silver have seen a rollercoaster end to a year in which their prices are on track to record their biggest annual gains since 1979.The price of gold soared by more than 60% this year to hit a record high of more than $4,549 (£3,378) an ounce before falling after Christmas to stand at about $4,330 on New Year's Eve.At the same time, silver was trading at about $71 an ounce after hitting an all-time high of $83.62 on Monday.This year's gains were driven by several factors including expectations of more interest rate cuts, but experts warned sharp increases over the year could lead to a drop in gold and silver prices in 2026.\"Gold and silver prices are experiencing a notable rise due to the interplay of several economic, investment, and geopolitical factors,\" said Rania Gule from trading platform XS.com.The main driver of the price rises of precious metals, she added, are expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in 2026. Prices of gold and silver were also buoyed by gold purchases by central banks and investors buying so-called \"safe haven\" assets due to concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investment platform AJ Bell, said soaring gold and silver prices had been driven by investors \"latching onto precious metals in response to concerns over inflation\" as well as volatile stock markets.\"The market backdrop looks unchanged as we move into 2026,\" he added.Mr Coatsworth said high government debt in the UK and US, as well as Donald Trump's tariffs and nerves over a potential AI bubble, would encourage investors to \"stay bullish on gold and silver\".But he warned sharp gains for the assets in 2025 make them vulnerable to a sharp pullback next year.He said: \"If financial markets go through a difficult patch, investors looking to liquidate positions might first reach for assets that have delivered strong gains in the past year or so, or ones that are easy to sell. Gold ticks both boxes.\"Ms Gule said she expects gold to continue to rise in 2026 but \"at a more stable pace compared to the record highs observed in 2025\".Also this year, central banks around the world added hundreds of tons of gold to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council trade association.Daniel Takieddine, co-founder of investment firm Sky Links Capital Group, points to \"supply tightness and industrial demand\" for helping to push up the price of silver.China, which is the world's second biggest producer of silver, has said it would restrict the export of the precious metal.In October, China's Ministry of Commerce announced new restrictions on exports of silver as well as the metals tungsten and antimony to \"to step up the protection of resources and the environment\".Responding to a post on social media about Chinese government restrictions on silver exports, Tesla boss Elon Musk said: \"This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes.\"Mr Takieddine also highlighted the large amounts of money that have flowed into the precious metals market through investments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).ETFs are baskets of investments that trade on a stock exchange like a single stock. They can be seen as a convenient way to trade precious metals as investors do not have to take possession of physical bullion.Silver also has the potential to rise again in the coming year, said Mr Takieddine. But he warns \"rallies may be followed by sharper corrections.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoRebecca Morelle,Science EditorandAlison Francis,Senior Science JournalistTony Jolliffe/BBC NewsThe mini factory will make semiconductors in spaceIt sounds like science fiction - a factory, located hundreds of kilometres above the Earth, churning out high-quality materials.But a Cardiff-based company is a step closer to making this a reality.Space Forge have sent a microwave-sized factory into orbit, and have demonstrated that its furnace can be switched on and reach temperatures of around 1,000C.They plan to manufacture material for semiconductors, which can be used back on Earth in electronics in communications infrastructure, computing and transport.Tony Jolliffe/ BBC NewsSemiconductors made in space will be up to 4,000 times purer Conditions in space are ideal for making semiconductors, which have the atoms they're made of arranged in a highly ordered 3D structure.When they are being manufactured in a weightless environment, those atoms line up absolutely perfectly. The vacuum of space also means that contaminants can't sneak in.The purer and more ordered a semiconductor is, the better it works.\"The work that we're doing now is allowing us to create semiconductors up to 4,000 times purer in space than we can currently make here today,\" says Josh Western, CEO of Space Forge.\"This sort of semiconductor would go on to be in the 5G tower in which you get your mobile phone signal, it's going to be in the car charger you plug an EV into, it's going to be in the latest planes.\"Tony Jolliffe/BBC NewsVeronica Viera said seeing the images of glowing plasma from space was amazing  The company's mini-factory launched on a SpaceX rocket in the summer. Since then the team has been testing its systems from their mission control in Cardiff.Veronica Viera, the company's payload operations lead, shows us an image that the satellite beamed back from space.It's taken from the inside of the furnace, and shows plasma -  gas heated to about 1,000C - glowing brightly.She told us seeing the image was \"one of the most exciting moments of my life\".\"This is so important because it's one of the core ingredients that we need for our in-space manufacturing process,\" she explains.  \"So being able to demonstrate this is amazing.\"Space ForgeThe heat shield will need to be tested to see if it can safely return the materials The team is now planning to build a bigger space factory - one that could make semiconductor material for 10,000 chips.They also need to test the technology to bring the material back to Earth.On a future mission, a heat shield named Pridwen after the legendary shield of King Arthur will be deployed to protect the spacecraft from the intense temperatures it will experience as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.Other companies are also looking skywards -  to make everything from pharmaceuticals to artificial tissues.\"In-space manufacturing is something that is happening now,\" says Libby Jackson, head of space at the Science Museum.\"It's the early days and they're still showing this in small numbers at the moment.\"But by proving the technology it really opens the door for an economically viable product,  where things can be made in space and return to Earth and have use and benefit to everybody on Earth. And that's really exciting.\"",

After initially saying the disruption was expected to last until mid-morning, National Rail later said passengers were likely to face problems all day. Services run by Northern, including local services in South Yorkshire and trains running from Doncaster to Hull and Scarborough, are among those affected.CrossCountry services between Edinburgh and Birmingham New Street, which call at Sheffield, Wakefield, Leeds and York, have also been affected.TransPennine Express services running between Liverpool Lime Street and Cleethorpes, which call at Doncaster, have been hit as well.'Delayed or revised'A spokesperson for Northern said services were able to run between Doncaster and Swinton again from about 09:30 GMT onwards, although they warned that \"fewer trains will be able to operate along this route while this issue continues\". They also said that trains between Sheffield and Doncaster/Adwick \"may be delayed or revised\". \"Northern train ticket restrictions have been lifted in the affected areas, including advance and peak restrictions, during this disruption,\" they added.A National Rail spokesperson said: \"Theft of signalling cables between Doncaster and Sheffield means trains must run at a reduced speed on all lines. \"As a result, services operating between Doncaster and Sheffield may be cancelled, delayed by up to 25 minutes, revised or diverted.\"Disruption is expected until the end of the day.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "Mali and Burkina Faso say they will bar US citizens from entering their countries in response to a similar move by the Trump administration.The two West African states were recently placed under full entry restrictions under US President Donald Trump's expanded travel ban.In separate statements, they said they would apply the same measures on US nationals. Burkina Faso's foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré said his government was acting on the \"principle of reciprocity\", while Mali's foreign ministry called for \"mutual respect and sovereign equality\". The latter said it regretted the US's move, adding that \"such an important decision was made without any prior consultation\". Mali and Burkina Faso's decision comes days after Niger's state news agency reported that Niger had imposed a similar travel ban on US citizens, though no official statement has been issued by its foreign ministry to confirm this.  The three countries are ruled by military juntas which seized power in coups. They have formed their own regional bloc, and have pivoted towards Russia after relations with other West African states and Western powers became strained.Earlier this month, the White House said that full-entry restrictions would be imposed on people from the three countries, as well as South Sudan, Syria and Palestinian Authority passport holders. The decision would come into effect on 1 January,  and was intended to \"protect the security\" of the US, it said.The administration also moved Laos and Sierra Leone, which were previously subject to partial restrictions, to the full ban list, and put partial restrictions on 15 other countries, including Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.The White House said the restrictions would remain in place until affected countries show \"credible improvements\" in identity management, information-sharing and cooperation with US immigration authorities.A number of exceptions apply and the ban will not affect lawful permanent residents, many existing visa holders, diplomats, or athletes travelling for major sporting events. Officials said case-by-case waivers would also be available where travel is deemed to be in the national interest.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAleem MaqboolReligion editorBBCAs incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally says she has received many letters of support\"One of the wonderful things over the last couple of months is I've had hundreds and hundreds of letters of support,\" says the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury.Dame Sarah Mullally - who will be the first woman to hold the position - says many of the letters she has received have been from women, who talk of the way her nomination to lead the Church of England has had an impact on them.\"I had a wonderful letter from an ordained woman who said the announcement of my appointment was the first time that she felt affirmed as a priest,\" she told BBC Radio 4.Dame Sarah was in conversation with former Prime Minister Theresa May, guest editor of the Today Programme for New Year's Eve.There had been \"difficult moments\" in the Church as a woman, Dame Sarah acknowledged, just as she experienced in the NHS and in government - in her position as chief nursing officer for England.A ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral in January will see her election confirmed, and in March she will be formally installed as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at Canterbury Cathedral.There is some opposition not just to a woman leading the Church, but to women becoming priests at all in the wider Anglican Communion, both in the UK and abroad.Dame Sarah told Theresa May her approach has always been to encourage clergy in their ministries, even if they were theologically opposed to the ordination of women.\"I believe that, for this time particularly, we do need leaders who are collegiate, who are collaborative,\" she said, adding that part of her preparation for her new role was to listen.Dame Sarah Mullally (r) spoke to former Prime Minister Theresa MayThe Church should take a similar listening approach to divisions in wider British society, she said, particularly around immigration and identity.\"People do feel insecure, their identity has been challenged and we shouldn't ignore that, but churches, I think, have the opportunity to listen to that,\" said the incoming archbishop.\"Churches are [also] very good at trying to create that sort of interfaith conversation in the community.\"Dame Sarah has long-voiced strong opposition to any legalisation of assisted dying - and remained unequivocal on the issue during her Radio 4 interview.Her view is informed by sitting alongside \"many people who have died\", in her roles as both a nurse and a priest, said Dame Sarah - who has had a seat in the House of Lords since becoming Bishop of London in 2018.Amendments to proposed legislation are currently being considered - but Dame Sarah told Theresa May that nothing would make the bill safe enough to \"protect the most vulnerable in our society\".\"Those who support the bill talk about choice. I'm not sure we have choice - we don't properly fund palliative care, we don't properly fund palliative-care research,\" she said.\"I'm worried that people may make a decision for assisted dying because they're not having the right palliative care or the right social care.\"While her fellow senior bishops in the House of Lords appear united in having a similar outlook, recent polls suggest that view is out of kilter with the majority of the British public who support assisted dying in some circumstances. A survey commissioned by one lobby group in favour of such a move suggests 69% of Christians support a change in the law. What's happening with the assisted dying bill?Baroness May went on to ask about safeguarding in the Church of England, and Dame Sarah said \"we are truly sorry\" for the \"significant safeguarding failures\" within the institution.\"Reaching out to the marginalised, the vulnerable, being safe, is at the heart of what I believe in terms of my Christian faith,\" said the incoming archbishop.Baroness May asked Dame Sarah about safeguarding in the Church of EnglandIt was Theresa May who announced the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), while she was home secretary in 2014. The seven-year inquiry was highly critical of the Church of England in its findings.The previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, stood down a year ago after being accused of failing to follow up information about abuse. The Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, has been interim Church leader since, but he too has faced questions over his handling of an abuse case.The Church is now considering a complaint against the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury over her handling of an abuse allegation during her tenure as Bishop of London.In her Radio 4 interview, Dame Sarah said progress had been made on safeguarding in the past decade - she also spoke of her support for the future introduction of some independence into Church safeguarding procedures.\"I think that we still have to work to restore trust in us and I think that [independent safeguarding professionals] would be a significant step.\"",

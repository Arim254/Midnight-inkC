    "body": "Three players, 57 goals - who is the best striker?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe are all in irresistible form this seasonByEmlyn BegleyBBC Sport journalistHe is a striker in form, netting well over a goal a game, scoring in almost every match this season. He is leading his club's title charge and taking his country to the brink of the World Cup.Usually this would be a remarkable introduction for any one player.But this season it applies to not one, not two, but three of Europe's leading strikers.Kylian Mbappe has hit 17 goals in 13 matches for Real Madrid and France this season. But the 26-year-old is only Europe's third-most prolific striker.Harry Kane, 32, has bagged 19 goals in 12 matches for Bayern Munich and England.And Erling Haaland, 25, leads the way on 21 goals in 12 games for Manchester City and Norway. As you do.It is early in the season but it already seems to be a three-horse race for the European Golden Shoe - awarded on a points system to the top striker in European club football.And only about half their goals have come in the league.The three are currently far above any of their European competitors.Paris St-Germain's Ousmane Dembele, who won the Ballon d'Or recently, has only played five times this season because of injury.Alexander Isak has not found full fitness yet after missing the start of the season at Newcastle as he tried to force through his £125m move to Liverpool.And Robert Lewandowski, now 37, has more substitute appearances than starts for Barcelona this season.Viktor Gyokeres has not been able to keep pace either. Last season, he won the Gerd Muller Trophy - unlike the Golden Shoe, awarded solely on goals rather than a points system - scoring 63 goals for Sporting and Sweden. But he was never going to match those numbers playing at a higher domestic standard with Arsenal.How do the three compare this season?Haaland has been the most prolific of the trio this season with his 21 goals in 12 games coming at an average of one every 47 minutes.Kane's total of 19 in 12 equates to one every 52 minutes, and Mbappe is averaging one every 67 minutes with his 17 goals in 13 games.Mbappe has four assists, with the other two notching three each.In a comparison of their general play, the stats show - as you might expect - Kane and Mbappe are involved a lot more than Haaland.Mbappe (772) has touched the ball more than Kane (445) and Haaland (257) combined.A much higher percentage of Haaland's touches come in the penalty area too.Haaland has only created six chances for team-mates, compared to Mbappe's 38 and Kane's 27.It is a similar story when comparing the number of passes completed by each forward - 97 by Haaland, 456 by Mbappe and 231 by Kane.The Norwegian has won 25 aerial duels - with 12 for Kane and three for Mbappe.Kane is the most lethal goalscorer of the three this season with 42% of his 45 shots resulting in a goal, followed closely by Haaland's 39% of 54 shots - while Mbappe has netted 22% of his 77 efforts.In club football, Kane has been the most prolific this season - as he has just one goal for England, with Haaland netting nine for Norway and Mbappe scoring three times for France.All three nations are top of their World Cup qualifying groups with maximum points.Now BBC Sport will look at all three separately - and assess what records they could break.Media caption, 'Astonishing' Kane & Mbappe reaching record levelsKane chases league scoring recordEngland's top goalscorer Kane has notched 18 goals for Bayern in 10 games this season, including 11 in the Bundesliga and four in the Champions League - plus that one goal for his country.He has netted 47% of Bayern's 38 goals this season.Only Augsburg and amateurs Andorra have kept him out in his 19 matches for club and country so far.He has hat-tricks against Leipzig and Hoffenheim.If Kane kept this Bundesliga scoring rate up all season, he would end on 62 goals. Nobody has ever scored that many in any of Europe's major leagues.The Bundesliga record is the 41 that Lewandowski netted for Bayern in 2020-21.Tottenham's all-time top scorer has won Germany's version of the Golden Boot in both seasons for Bayern, with 36 goals and then 26 goals, to add to his three Premier League awards.A repeat this time around would make him only the second person to win three in a row in the Bundesliga after Lewandowski (who won five in a row).That would also put him joint third on the list of award winners, along with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Ulf Kirsten.Lewandowski and Bayern icon Gerd Muller won seven each. As Kane is 32, he is unlikely to reach that figure.Mbappe going for eighth consecutive Golden BootMbappe has struck 14 times in 10 matches for Real this season - and three in three for France.That is 54% of Real's 28 goals in all competitions. Only against Mallorca has he failed to strike - and he has one hat-trick in the Champions League against Kairat Almaty.If Mbappe kept up his scoring rate of nine goals in eight games in La Liga, he would end up with 42 goals.Only Lionel Messi (twice) and Cristiano Ronaldo have ever scored more in a Spanish top-flight season.He is chasing an eighth consecutive league Golden Boot after winning six in a row in Ligue 1 for PSG (for whom he is their all-time top scorer) and then last year's La Liga one at Real.In the Champions League, he has netted five goals in two games. That goal rate is clearly unsustainable over a whole season but it gives him a chance of hunting down Ronaldo's record of 17 in a Champions League season (2013-14).If Real were to get to the final (and not need the knockout rounds play-off) Mbappe would have another 13 matches in the competition.He will also hope to be France's all-time top goalscorer by the time this season is out. He has scored 53 goals, only four off Olivier Giroud's record.Hundred for Haaland?Even by Haaland's very high standards, this season has been something else.Norway's all-time leading goalscorer has scored 12 goals in nine games for City. Tottenham are the only team to keep him out.But for Norway, it is a sensational nine in three matches (including five against Moldova and three against Israel) to take them to the brink of a first World Cup since 1998, before he was born.He has scored 12 times during the whole World Cup qualifying campaign so far, twice as many as any other European player.He is the joint top scorer in qualifying worldwide - along with Qatar's Almoez Ali. Ali has played 13 games - to Haaland's six.Haaland has set the bar so high that his total of nine goals in the first seven Premier League games of the season is only his third best at this stage in his four seasons in England.He had netted 11 by now in 2022 and 10 last season.His current league scoring rate over the course of the season would bring him 49 goals. The Premier League record is the 36 he scored in 2022-23.Dixie Dean's record of 60 top-flight goals for Everton in 1927–28 will probably never be broken.If we only count his City stats this season, he is on course to score about 70 club goals in all competitions if they reach the Champions League final (without him even playing in the Carabao Cup or FA Cup).If you allow us to get a bit silly and including his overall goalscoring rate for club and country, he could end the season on more than 100 goals...Who do people think is the best?With three players in such good form, opinion on the best is bound to be divided.Former Scotland, Chelsea and Everton winger Pat Nevin, a BBC Sport pundit, said: \"It is no denigration of Erling Haaland, who is one of the great players in world football. \"In England, they admire Harry and all the rest of it, but he also should be considered one of the greats in world football. Maybe he's not seen as that in England, but he is.\"When you are watching a game when Haaland is at his best, your eye is always drawn to him. It seems like there are 21 footballers out there and Haaland.\"If you go and watch Harry Kane at Bayern, one of the top teams in the world, it is Kane and 10 others. He is a force of nature. And not just in Bundesliga games. I am talking Champions League games. He is a colossus.\"Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague, meanwhile, thinks Mbappe and Barcelona winger Lamine Yamal are the best two players of any position in the world right now.While Manchester City team mate Nico Gonzalez believes Haaland is \"the best striker in the world\".So what do you think?",

    "body": "A man has been charged with stalking after allegedly targeting leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey and his family over a period of several months.Inigo Rowland, who is also charged with possession of a flick-knife, is accused of turning up at the Kingston and Surbiton MP's south-west London home \"unannounced\" and on \"numerous\" occasions between June and October, according to a court list.The 58-year-old from Surbiton appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on 7 October and was remanded into custody, the Met Police said.Sir Ed, 59, and his wife Emily have a 17-year-old son called John, who has a neurological condition and learning difficulties, and a daughter, Ellie.Sir Ed won the south-west London constituency of Kingston and Surbiton in 1997 and lost his seat in 2015. He regained it in 2017 and became party leader three years later.A Met Police spokesperson said Mr Rowland was arrested on 6 October in relation to offences alleged to have taken place between June and October.He is due to appear again at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said: \"We cannot provide any details at this time; Ed's number-one priority is the safety of his family.\"",

    "body": "A mass shooting at a crowded bar in the southern US state of South Carolina has left four people dead and at least 20 injured, officials said. Hundreds of people were gathered at the popular bar on St Helena Island in the early hours of Sunday morning when gunfire broke out, leading multiple victims and witnesses to run to nearby businesses for shelter, according to the Beaufort County Sheriff's office. Four people were declared dead at the bar and at least 20 were injured, including four who were sent to local hospitals in critical condition, the sheriff's office said. The incident is still under investigation, and the sheriff's office is looking into possible suspects, it said. When police and first responders arrived, they found several people suffering from gunshot wounds, the sheriff's office said in a statement. It's not clear if the shooting was random or targeted, and a spokesperson for the sheriff's office declined to share more details. Robert Adams, who lives up the street from the bar, told the Island Packet, a local outlet, that he heard automatic gunfire that sounded \"like a machine gun\". A cook who works at the bar told the outlet he \"heard a lot of shots\" fired. The bar where the shooting took place, Willie's Bar and Grill, offers Gullah-inspired cuisine and says on its website that it aims to spread the \"heartwarming spirit of the Gullah Geechee culture\". The Gullah Geechee people are descendants of Africans who were enslaved on plantations along the south-eastern US coast, including in South Carolina. Willie's did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. \"COMPLETELY HEARTBROKEN to learn about the devastating shooting in Beaufort County,\" South Carolina Republican Representative Nancy Mace wrote on X. \"Our prayers are with the victims, their families, and everyone impacted by this horrific act of violence.\"Congressman James Clyburn, a Democrat of South Carolina, wrote on X that he's \"devastated\" by the \"senseless tragedy\".In 2022, there was another shooting at the same location, then the Island Grill, that left two people with non-life-threatening gunshot wounds, according to the Island Packet. Earlier this month, two separate shootings at South Carolina State University, about 100 miles (160km) north of St Helena Island, left one person dead and another injured. ",

    "body": "US Vice-President JD Vance has warned of further workforce cuts in addition to the thousands of jobs already axed if the government shutdown is not resolved.\"The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,\" Vance told Fox News. \"To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful.\"Democrats said Republicans were punishing people by refusing to attach health insurance subsidies to the spending bill.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are already on leave without pay as the shutdown approaches its third week. No congressional vote is scheduled that could reopen the government.  The standoff began on 1 October after Democrats rejected a short-term funding bill. They want the budget to include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The Trump administration announced on Friday that seven agencies, including the CDC, had started firing over 4,000 staff.But some of those CDC layoff notices were sent in error, a spokesman for the US health department, which oversees the CDC, told the BBC.Those CDC employees \"have all been notified that they are not subject to the reduction in force\", Andrew Nixon said.Out of about 1,300 CDC workers who were fired on Friday, around 700 were reinstated on Saturday, the employees' union told CNN.Essential workers like federal law enforcement officers and air traffic controllers are required to continue working without pay. But the Trump administration is making an exception for some essential workers: US service members.Trump directed Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to find available funds to get troops their wages this week - and Hegseth delivered.The Department of Defence is taking about $8bn (£6bn) from \"unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds\" to pay military personnel on 15 October if the funding lapse is not resolved, a Pentagon official told the BBC.Senator Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, stood by the Democratic line on Sunday, saying on NBC's Meet the Press that he won't back down from his party's demand to reinstate federal healthcare subsidies in the budget now, not later. And as for the layoffs, Kelly said Republicans \"don't have to do this, they don't have to punish people\".Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC's Meet the Press that he will not vote to extend the subsidies. Vance blamed the Democrats when speaking to Fox, saying: \"This is not a situation we relish, [these layoffs] are not something we're looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.\"As lawmakers continue battling over the budget, more government services are feeling the effect of the shutdown. Several Smithsonian museums, research centres and the National Zoo in Washington DC closed on Sunday after funding to keep them open ran out. ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump is considering sending Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, saying it would provide \"a new step of aggression\" in its war with Russia.When asked on Air Force One if he would send Tomahawks to Ukraine, Trump replied \"we'll see... I may\".It follows a second phone call at the weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks against Russia.Moscow has previously warned Washington against providing long-range missiles to Kyiv, saying it would cause a major escalation in the conflict and strain US-Russian relations.Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach for Ukraine.Trump spoke to reporters as he flew to Israel. He said he would possibly speak to Russia about the Tomahawks requested by Ukraine. \"I might tell them [Russia] that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, we may not, but we may do it.\"\"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,\" the president said.Kyiv has made multiple requests for long-range missiles, as it weighs up striking Russian cities far from the front lines of the grinding conflict.In their phone calls Zelensky and Trump discussed Ukraine's bid to strengthen its military capabilities, including boosting its air defences and long-range arms. Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have come under repeated heavy Russian bombardment with drones and missiles. Russia has particularly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing power cuts.Last month, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg suggested the US president had authorised strikes deep into Russian territory, telling Fox News \"there are no such things as sanctuaries\" from attacks in the Russia-Ukraine war.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, downplayed the chances of Tomahawks changing the course of the war.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said last month: \"Whether it's Tomahawks or other missiles, they won't be able to change the dynamic.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulAt least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.Masked Hamas gunmen exchanged fire with clan fighters near the city's Jordanian hospital, witnesses said.A senior official in the Hamas-run interior ministry said security units surrounded them and engaged in heavy fighting to detain them. The ministry said eight its members were killed in \"an armed assault by a militia\".Medical sources said 19 Dughmush clan members and eight Hamas fighters had been killed since fighting began on Saturday.Eyewitnesses said the clashes erupted in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in southern Gaza City after a Hamas force of more than 300 fighters moved to storm a residential block where Dughmush gunmen were entrenched.Residents described scenes of panic as dozens of families fled their homes under heavy gunfire, many of them displaced multiple times during the war. \"This time people weren't fleeing Israeli attacks,\" one resident said. \"They were running from their own people.\"The Dughmush family, one of Gaza's most prominent clans, has long had a tense relationship with Hamas, and its armed members have clashed with the group on several occasions in the past.The Hamas-run interior ministry said its forces were seeking to restore order, warning that \"any armed activity outside the framework of the resistance\" would be dealt with firmly.Both sides traded accusations over who was responsible for triggering the clashes.Hamas earlier said Dughmush gunmen killed two of its fighters and wounded five others, prompting the group to launch an operation against them.However, a source from the Dughmush family told local media that Hamas forces had come to a building that once served as the Jordanian Hospital, where the family had taken refuge after their homes in the al-Sabra neighbourhood were destroyed in the recent Israeli attack.The source claimed that Hamas sought to evict the family from the building to establish a new base for its forces there.Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.Reports suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying \"fighters in the streets\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent andNick Edserbusiness reporterDonald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is \"a typical example of US double standards\", China's government has said.A commerce ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the US president carries out his threat, adding it was \"not afraid\" of a possible trade war.On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for rare earths exports, accusing it  of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping later this month.But on Sunday, Trump wrote: \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\" \"Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!\" Trump said in a post on social media, without elaborating further. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China.In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries.This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff.China's response - released by the commerce ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions - echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict.They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as \"normal actions\" to safeguard national security and that of all nations.The spokesperson said that for \"a long time\", the US had \"overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures\" and \"adopted discriminatory practices against China\".\"Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,\" the spokesperson said.\"China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.\"Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing.This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones.The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks.It is unclear whether a meeting between Trump and Xi, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",

    "body": "11 hours agoSammy Awamireporting from Madagascar andFarouk ChothiaAFP via Getty ImagesSome troops joined protesters in the capital on SaturdayThe office of Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has said an attempt to seize power illegally and by force is under way in the country.Hours later, an army unit known as CAPSAT claimed that it had taken over the leadership of the military command, and was now in control of all the armed forces - land, air, and naval.This is the same unit that played a crucial role in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which helped Rajoelina rise to power.Madagascar was first hit by youth-led protests on 25 September against water and power cuts, but they have escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis.Rajoelina's whereabouts are unclear, but in a statement he said \"there is an attempt to seize power at this time in the territory of the Republic, in complete violation of the Constitution and democratic principles,\" in a translation.He condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" what he called an attempt to destabilise the country. He also called on all of the nation's key forces to unite in defending the constitutional order and national sovereignty.CAPSAT said it had appointed a new army chief of staff, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, according to a statement issued on its Facebook page.AFP news agency reports armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo has accepted the appointment.\"I give him my blessing,\" the minister was quoted as saying at a ceremony to install Gen Pikulas to the post.My one-month-old grandson was killed by police tear gas during Madagascar protestsProtesters have gathered at the main square in the capital, Antananarivo, for the second consecutive day. This is a significant development, as they had failed to reach May 13 Square, the focal point of previous uprisings, until now.  A protester told the BBC that they had \"finally conquered May 13 Square - the Square of Democracy\". \"We're happy and relieved. It's a great victory. We won't stop the struggle until President Rajoelina resigns,\" the protester added.Protesters have been celebrating their success in reaching the main square in AntananarivoThe success of the demonstrators came after they received unexpected support from CAPSAT on Saturday, when some of its troops left their barracks to join the demonstration. CAPSAT had condemned the use of force  against protesters by other security units. There were reports of a shoot-out at a CAPSAT camp on Sunday, following similar reports on Saturday. CAPSAT said one soldier was shot by gendarmes on Saturday, and died.Air France said it had suspended its flights to Antananarivo until at least Tuesday because of the security situation. The African Union said it was deeply concerned by the latest developments in Madagascar, and urged sides to resolve the crisis through dialogue.The protest movement, known as Gen Z Mada, has been rallying support mainly through social media, posing the biggest challenge to Rajoelina since his re-election in 2023.Some of the protesters have been wearing T-shirts and holding banners with a symbol - a skull with a straw hat from the Japanese manga series \"One Piece\" - used by youth-led demonstrators in other countries, including Indonesia and Peru.On Saturday, a statement from the presidency had assured the nation that Rajoelina and the new prime minister - an army general he appointed last week - were in control of the situation.AFP via Getty ImagesSome soldiers left their barracks to throw their weight behind the protest movementUN human rights chief Volker Türk previously urged security forces to stop using \"unnecessary and disproportionate force\" to quell the unrest. He said at least 22 people were killed and 100 others injured.Rajoelina disputed the figure last week, saying there were 12 confirmed deaths and \"all of these individuals were looters and vandals\".Madagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina come to power.Rajoelina governed for four years and then returned to power after the 2018 election.Despite its natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.Only about one-third of Madagascar's 30 million people have access to electricity, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).EPA / ShutterstockThe security forces have been accused of using excessive force against protestersMore on Madagascar's crisis:Behind the Gen Z protesters who want to force Madagascar's president from powerArmy general named as Madagascar PM to quell Gen Z protestsGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "The prime minister has arrived in Egypt ahead of an international peace summit where the peace plan for Gaza is due to be signed.Sir Keir Starmer will pay \"particular tribute\" to US President Donald Trump at the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh, Downing Street has said.A ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal brokered by Trump, with the next phases still to be negotiated.  The US president will lead Monday's summit alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with leaders from more than 20 countries in attendance, a spokesman for Sisi said.Under the deal, Hamas has until 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday to release all Israeli hostages - including 20 who are believed to be alive, and the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages.Israel should also release around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Strip.Many details for the later phases, which would be negotiated after the successful completion of phase one, could be hard to reach agreement on - such as the governance of Gaza, the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarming of Hamas.On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the UK had \"played a key role behind the scenes in shaping\" the Gaza peace plan.Britain had been involved in \"complex matters of diplomacy\", she told Sky News, without providing further detail.Appearing later on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson was asked to spell out the UK's role, and responded: \"We do have a role, but of course the role of the US has been critical in this - we can all recognise that.\"However, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, called Phillipson's comments \"delusional\". Posting on X, he added: \"She can thank [Trump] anytime just to set the record straight.\"Israel's deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel further criticised the UK's claims on Sunday.Also appearing on Sky News, she was asked whether the UK had played a key role, and said the \"opposite\" was true.Haskel said decisions by the UK government - including the one last month to recognise Palestinian statehood - had \"actually pushed Hamas to embolden their position\".Monday's summit in Egypt will involve a \"signing ceremony\" for the peace plan, \"marking a historic turning point for the region after two years of conflict and bloodshed\", Downing Street said. Sir Keir will thank Egypt, Qatar and Turkey for \"bringing us to this point\" as well as Trump, before calling for continued coordination to secure \"swift progress towards phase two\" of the truce.No 10 added in its statement: \"He will offer the UK's steadfast support and engagement with international partners as we look to secure the ceasefire, get urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza and secure a basis for a lasting peace and security.\"French President Emmanuel Macron will also attend, the Elysee Palace confirmed on Saturday, where he will \"express his full support for the implementation of the agreement\". Confirming the summit late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Egypt's presidency said it was intended to \"end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen peace and stability efforts in the Middle East, and open a new page in regional security and stability\".Trump had told reporters at the White House on Friday that he would be travelling to the region on Monday, addressing Israel's parliament the Knesset, before heading to Egypt.He said: \"We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too, they've been invited.\"Egypt's foreign ministry had also said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed arrangements for the summit with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the prime minister's visit to Egypt for the Sharm El-Sheikh summit would be a \"photo opportunity\" and the government has \"had no role whatsoever\" in the Gaza ceasefire.\"I think it's extraordinary that Keir Starmer is apparently going to Egypt tomorrow when we've got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving,\" she told Kuenssberg. The ceasefire came into effect after the Israeli government approved the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal on Thursday, following three days of indirect talks in Egypt.The Israeli military said it had partially withdrawn troops from parts of Gaza and pulled back to an agreed position within the territory - though troops still occupy half of the Strip. The UK has already said it has \"no plans\" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the latest ceasefire from Israel.The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the region to what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, officials have said, alongside forces from Arab and Muslim countries including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey.Downing Street said that the UK will also host a three-day summit from Monday to discuss Gaza's recovery and reconstruction. Attendees will include representatives from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and the Palestinian Authority.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Friday the UK would continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza.Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 18,000 children, the Hamas-run health ministry says.A previous ceasefire agreement that began in January collapsed after two months when Israel resumed its military offensive, having never got past the first stage of a three-stage plan.",

    "body": "'In an instant, they were gone' - small town mourns after Tennessee explosives factory blast10 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduBucksnort, TennesseeBBCMourners gather for a vigil at the Maple Valley Baptist Church in Tennessee in memory of 16 people presumed dead after a blast at an explosives factoryIn Bucksnort, Tennessee, residents have spent a chilly autumn night heeding a simple message spraypainted on a concrete barrier by the side of the road: \"Pray for the AES families\". Community members gathered on Saturday for a candlelit vigil outside the Maple Valley Baptist Church after a blast at local explosives factory Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) left 16 people presumed dead.This community of Hickman and Humphreys Counties is \"not huge, so that's a lot of people to lose in an instant,\" Deacon Danny Bates said to the approximately 40 attendees, who comforted each other and sang hymns such as \"It Is Well With My Soul\".\"It was just another day at work, and then in an instant, they were gone. We have unanswered questions\".A concrete barrier on the side of a road reads \"Pray for AES families\".Vigil-goer Jerri Newcombe said her friend of more than 20 years was among the victims. The two met when Newcombe's granddaughter and the victim's daughter became close as little girls.\"They grew up together - we were in each other's homes,\" Newcombe told the BBC at the vigil. \"We celebrated birthdays together. It's just surreal, because she's gone and her babies are hurting,\" she said, referring to the victim's children and grandchildren. Local police have not publicly identified any of the unaccounted-for victims, who authorities presume have all been killed.Her friend was \"full of life\", Ms Newcombe said. \"She was the type of person that could make you laugh over anything, but you didn't cross her either, or she would tear into you,\" Ms. Newcombe added amid tears and laughter, as her granddaughter comforted her.Bucksnort is a close-knit town where the cell service is spotty and a gas station - adorned with a Confederate flag centrepiece - is the local watering hole, residents say. This tragedy has hit the area hard as the community mourns family, friends, neighbours and coworkers.The town had been holding out hope for good news after the explosion on Friday morning shook homes across the area, clouded the skies with smoke and drew a surge of hundreds of state and national first responders to an otherwise sleepy community tucked behind forests along a busy motorway.But after nearly two days with no sign of survivors and the explosion site still considered dangerous for first responders, even the previously optimistic Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said the time had come to switch to a recovery - rather than rescue - strategy.\"At some point in time, we have got to rip off the Band-Aid,\" Davis, who has held back tears at news conferences, said. \"We are dealing with remains.\"Hickman County Sheriff Jason Craft told the BBC on Saturday night that rapid DNA analysis was still ongoing, but that after a search by 300 first responders, authorities had enough confidence in their assessment of the scene to notify families that their loved ones were likely deceased. No cause of the blast has yet been identified, and agents from the national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are investigating. It could take as long as a month for federal investigators to reach the main site of the explosion, ATF official Brice McCracken told the BBC. The volatile nature of the explosive materials has also hampered the emergency response, officials said, as controlled detonations to render the site safe are also expected in the coming days.Watch: Tennessee town comes together to confront tragedyTiffany Story says her cousin was also among the victims, along with four other people that she knew, including someone she once used to babysit for.\"Everybody knows everybody here,\" an emotional Mrs Story told the BBC. \"With everybody being so close, it's very comforting to have family. That's what we are - whether [by] blood, not blood, this whole community is family.\"\"There's probably never gonna be any answers\" to the tragedy, she said.Janie Brown said she also knew victims at the site. \"They were loved by their families and by the community,\" she said outside another prayer vigil at the Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church in nearby McEwen. \"It's just a sad, sad day,\" she said.Residents told the BBC the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) company employed about 80 workers, and is one of the only private well-paying jobs around in these counties. For many here, the plant was known as a reliable first job for themselves or close friends.A recent job opening advertised a $19-per-hour salary for an entry-level manual labour job, more than double the state's minimum wage of $7.25.The factory has seen other difficulties, but none at such a scale as this.In 2014, an explosion at the company killed one person, and a 2019 workplace safety inspection led to relatively minor financial penalties, which the company settled, according to online records. Residents who spoke to the BBC had mostly positive feelings towards the company, and local police say they had no previous reports of unsafe working conditions.Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church Pastor Tim Ferris praised his congregation's response to the tragedy.\"One thing about a small community is that when something like this happens, they rally around each other, and they come close to be the hands and the feet of Jesus, to administer to these people, to care for them, provide for them. And that's a wonderful thing,\" he said.",

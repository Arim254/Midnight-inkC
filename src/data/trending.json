This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn probably sometime next week.\"The BBC has said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\".The BBC apologised but said it would not pay financial compensation.The controversy led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.\"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"He said he had not raised the issue with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer but that Starmer had asked to speak to him, and Trump would call him over the weekend.Earlier this week the US president's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apologised and compensated him.Searches of public court record databases earlier showed no legal action had been filed so far.Federal and state courts in Florida, where a case would likely be filed, are now closed for the weekend. In an interview aired on GB news on Saturday and recorded before Trump confirmed he would take legal action, the US president said: \"I've been doing this for a long time, I've never seen anything like that. That's, that's the most egregious. I think that was worse than the Kamala thing with CBS and 60 Minutes.\"In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with Trump regarding an interview it broadcast on CBS with former vice-president Kamala Harris. \"I think I have an obligation to do it,\" he said. \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC wrote to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.",

It is not clear if there were passengers on board. The incident occurred near the Royal Institute of Technology university.Images from the scene show rescue crews appearing to help people trapped underneath the double-decker bus.A witness who owns a shop on the street told SVT the bus hit a pole in front of the bus shelter. They said several people ran into the shop crying.A woman told the local Expressen newspaper that the bus \"mowed down an entire bus stop queue\". She said people were screaming and trying to help the injured, while dead people lay on the ground.\"There must have been more people under the bus,\" she said.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.\"People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones,\" he posted on X.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including as acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "The Screen Actors Guild Awards, the marquee awards ceremony honouring actors, is getting a new name.Known colloquially as the SAG Awards, the awards show will now be dubbed the Actor Awards presented by Sag-Aftra, the labour union representing US film, television and radio actors. \"Since the beginning, our statue has been called 'The Actor' and we're a show that's entirely about actors, so this new name is a perfect next step in the show's evolution,\" the show's executive producer said on Friday.The rebrand comes ahead of the 32nd edition of the star-studded ceremony, which is set for 1 March 2026.The award show's executive producer Jon Brockett told the BBC that the name change - which was announced at a board meeting on Friday - gives viewers in more than 190 countries \"an immediate understanding of who we are and what we're about\" - a show about actors honouring actors.\"Now that our global audience is really growing, people don't always understand what the union name is,\" added awards committee chair JoBeth Williams.\"But 'the Actor Awards' they recognize and they know they're going to see their favourite actors when they tune in,\" Ms Willams said.The Actor trophy also gives a boon to its winners in the run up to the Academy Awards, better bringing the Oscars race into focus each year. The Oscars, much like the Emmys, Grammys and Golden Globes, are better known by the monikers derived from their respective trophies instead of the organisations and professional academies that back them.The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Aftra) merged in 2012 and represent about 160,000 members. The new show name now allows the organisation to fully recognize that merger and align it with the name of the statuette, the union said.The name change comes weeks after Sag-Aftra elected The Lord of the Rings star Sean Astin as its new leader.Astin succeeds The Nanny series star Fran Drescher, who steered the organization through the Hollywood strikes of 2023 during her four-year tenure.",

    "body": "6 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorAfter weeks of wondering will she, won't she, and recent heavy hints that she would indeed raise income taxes in the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has now decided against the manifesto-breaching move.Amid the fog of Budget speculation, here is what we do know.That plan, to raise income tax rates by 2p but compensate workers with a 2p National Insurance cut was sent to the OBR as an option earlier this month to be costed, to help fill what was then a £30bn gap in the public finances, mainly caused by a downgrade to productivity.The so-called \"2 up, 2 down\" plan, pioneered by the Resolution Foundation think tank, would have raised several billion pounds, mainly from non-wage income such as landlords and savings.Newer assessments from the OBR appear to have increased the projected strength of wages and tax receipts in the coming years and offset several billion pounds of that gap, taking it closer to £20bn in total.As a consequence, the plan to raise income tax rates has not been advanced in the latest set of measures sent to the OBR to analyse. While this \"iterative\" process is part of the normal forecasting round that precedes a Budget, on Monday of this week the chancellor suggested very strongly that tax rates would go up in a BBC interview. Health Secretary Wes Streeting on Friday appeared to confirm the shift away from anything that could be seen to break election promises:\"It is really important that we keep our promises and we stand by our manifesto. The fact that there's been speculation about income tax shows how difficult the situation is with public finances and secondly that the chancellor is determined to stick to her fiscal rules,\" he said.There is some irony in the health secretary making these comments, given suggestions from Downing St about leadership bids and claims about the unique power of the prime minister and chancellor over the bond markets.By the end of the week the bond markets were more than nervous as a result of the hokey cokey over income tax.It is always questionable to assume a singular motive behind the awesome financial power of the debt markets, but let me try to divine what happened over the past 24 hours. After the Financial Times' scoop about the dropping of the tax rate plan, there was a notable spike up in the effective borrowing cost for the Government. It was up 0.12% points for a 10-year gilt. Markets had been reassured by the tough fiscal talk by the chancellor over the past month. Much of this was driven by expectations of lower Bank of England interest rates amid a weakening jobs market. The willingness by the chancellor to take political pain, in the form of breaking tax rate manifesto promises, in order to restrain borrowing in a straightforward way, is a plus for the bond vigilantes. But this week's developments, including the dropping of other kites being flown - from extra tax on partnerships, and entrepreneurs leaving the UK -  injected doubt about the appetite to trade political pain for lower bond yields.Even when it was confirmed that better - or less bad - economic forecasts had helped reduce the budget gap, and create room to avoid the tax rate hike, the markets only calmed briefly, before they crept up to even higher effective rates by the end of the day. The jitters are back.Insiders said that the chancellor's Budget strategy  \"remains the same\" to increase the buffer or \"headroom\" on meeting her borrowing rules significantly higher from the current £10bn a year,  to tackle cost of living pressures, and to make \"fair choices\" on tax. That would appear to mean an extension in the £40bn a year freeze on tax thresholds - which raises an extra £8bn a year as more worker's salaries creep into the higher tax brackets  .Ministers point to how they are planning to raise tax, as well as the amount, suggesting a squeeze on wealth, capital and income from those sources, rather than long-suffering pay packets.There are real questions about the loose lips around Whitehall, floating all sorts of significant tax reform, and the impact in markets.It's worth noting too that final decisions on the Budget have not yet been made, and the process continues. everyone will hope it is smoother from here until the big speech on November 26 .",

But not Gavin and Stacey, she said.The King met TikToker Lewis Leigh, whose parents Neil and Kerry Anne from Merthyr Tydfil said they were feeling \"really proud\" of their son.\"We are so proud that he will be recognised for some of the hard work he's done with cancer awareness and school visits,\" said Neil.Love Island star Liam Reardon joked with the King about going to the gym.\"I'm opening a gym next week, so if you fancy a little session, let me know,\" said Reardon.Watch: Gun salutes in Green Park and Tower of London mark King's birthdayAndrew Lewis, head teacher at Gwaunfarren Primary School, said pupils were \"super excited\" to see the visit. \"We broke the news at the start of the week. It's a once in a lifetime experience for our children.\"Noah, aged 10, said about the King's visit: \"I think he'll like the castle, it's really big and it has loads of stuff inside.\"Millie Pilkington/ Buckingham PalaceA new picture was published for the King's birthday, showing him at SandringhamDuring the trip to south Wales, Queen Camilla heard pupils reading poetry at Cyfarthfa Primary School.And King Charles officially opened the South Wales Metro Depot in Taff's Well, near Cardiff, and tried his hand at driving a tram-train.The trip to south Wales is a sign of the King's determination to keep working, even though he is still receiving regular cancer treatment.PA MediaThe King was offered a high five by pupils at an event near CardiffThe King's visit coincided with the heavy rain brought by Storm Claudia.It's been a stormy few weeks for the royals too, with the removal of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's title and his status as prince, over links to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The scandal has cast a shadow over what otherwise has been a busy autumn schedule for the King, with the state visit by US President Donald Trump, the King's historic meeting with Pope Leo at the Vatican and this week's annual Remembrance events.Although this is only the third year of his reign, Charles at the age of 77 is now in fifth place in the longest-lived British monarchs.He recently overtook George II, who in 1760 died a few days short of his 77th birthday.The longest living monarchs were Elizabeth II, Victoria, George III and Edward VIII - who abdicated in 1936.",

    "body": "Cardi B welcomes fourth child, her first with boyfriend Stefon Diggs6 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesGetty ImagesUS rap star Cardi B has welcomed her fourth child - her first with American footballer Stefon Diggs.The Grammy winner shared news of the baby boy's arrival on Instagram, writing: \"I brought new music and a new album to the world! A new baby into my world, and one more reason to be the best version of me, one more reason to love me more than anything else or anyone else.\"Last month, Cardi B released her long-awaited sophomore album - Am I The Drama? - issuing a public plea for people to buy it so she can afford nappies.The hip hop superstar - real name Belcalis Almánzar - shares three children with her estranged husband Offset. She filed for divorce from the Migos rapper in July 2024.Representatives for Cardi B did not immediately respond on Friday to the BBC's requests for comment. Cardi B did not share details about the child's birth, but her spokesperson told People magazine on Thursday that Cardi had a baby boy and is \"healthy and happy\". Diggs, whom the rapper has been dating for about a year, revealed the child's sex during a red-carpet event earlier this month.\"It's a boy. That's enough for me,\" the New England Patriots wide receiver told People at the time. \"I can't wait to make him do push-ups and sit-ups and run around.\"This is the second child for Diggs, who has a 9-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.Watch: Cardi B announces pregnancy with boyfriend Stefon DiggsSharing a clip from her single Hello on Instagram, the 33-year-old alluded to starting over after her last chapter.

    "body": "4 hours agoRobin Levinson-King and Eloise AlannaSubmitted photoThe first thing Lana Ponting remembers about the Allan Memorial Institute, a former psychiatric hospital in Montreal, Canada, is the smell - almost medicinal. \"I didn't like the look of the place. It didn't look like a hospital to me,\" she told the BBC from her home in Manitoba.That hospital – once the home of a Scottish shipping magnate – would be her home for a month in April 1958, after a judge ordered the then-16-year-old to undergo treatment for \"disobedient\" behaviour.It was there that Ms Ponting became one of thousands of people experimented on as part of the CIA's top-secret research into mind control. Now, she is one of two named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit for Canadian victims of the experiments. On Thursday, a judge denied the Royal Victoria Hospital's appeal, paving the way for the lawsuit to proceed.According to her medical files, which she obtained only recently, Ms Ponting had been running away from home and hanging out with friends her parents disapproved of after a difficult move with her family from Ottawa to Montreal.\"I was an ordinary teenager,\" she recalled. But the judge sent her to the Allan. Once there, she became an unwitting participant in covert CIA experiments known as MK-Ultra. The Cold War project tested the effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD, electroshock treatments and brainwashing techniques on human beings without their consent. Over 100 institutions – hospitals, prisons and schools – in the US and Canada were involved.At the Allan, McGill University researcher Dr Ewen Cameron drugged patients and made them listen to recordings, sometimes thousands of times, in a process he called \"exploring\".The Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal is where the CIA-backed experiments were conducted in CanadaDr Cameron would make Ms Ponting listen to the same tape recording hundreds of times.\"It ran over and over again, you're a good girl, you're a bad girl,\" Ms Ponting recalled.The technique was a form of \"psychic driving,\" says doctoral student Jordan Torbay, who has researched his experiments and their ethical implications.\"Essentially the minds of patients were manipulated using verbal cues,\" she says, adding he also looked at the effects of sleep drugs, forced sensory deprivation, and induced coma.Medical records show Ms Ponting was given LSD, as well as drugs like sodium amytal, a barbiturate, desoxyn, a stimulant, as well as nitrous gas, a sedative known as \"laughing gas\".\"By April 30th, the patient had explorations… she had become quite tense and extremely violent when given the Nitrous Oxide, throwing herself half out of bed and starting to scream,\" Dr Cameron wrote in one of her medical files, which Ms Ponting has obtained through a freedom of information request.The harsh truth about the MK-Ultra experiments first came to light in the 1970s. Since then, several victims have tried to sue the US and Canada. Lawsuits in the US have largely been unsuccessful, but in 1988, a Canadian judge ordered the US government to pay nine victims $67,000 each. In 1992 the Canadian government paid C$100,000 (about $80,000 at the time) to each of 77 victims – but did not admit liability.Ms Ponting was not among them, because she did not yet know that she was a victim, she saysWatch: The CIA's secret pursuit of 'mind control'Listen: The Woman Who Resisted Mind ControlFor decades, Ms Ponting said she felt something was wrong with her, but she did not learn of the details of her own involvement in the experiments until somewhat recently.She says she had little memory of what happened at the Allan, or in the years that followed. Ms Ponting eventually married and moved to Manitoba, where she had two children whom she is still close to. Now, she's a grandmother to four grandchildren. But she says she has suffered life-long repercussions from her time at the Allan. \"I felt it all my life, because I was wondering why I would think this way, or, you know what happened to me,\" she said.She says she's had to be on a cocktail of medications her whole life to deal with mental-health issues, which she attributes to her time at the Allan, as well as recurrent nightmares. \"Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night because of what happened,\" she said.The Royal Victoria Hospital and McGill University declined to comment as the case is before the courts. The government pointed the BBC to its previous settlement, in 1992, which it said was done for \"humanitarian\" reasons and did not accept legal liability. For Ms Pointing, the lawsuit is a chance to finally get some closure.\"Sometimes I sit in my living room and my mind goes back, and I can think of the things that happened to me, you know,\" she says. \"Every time I see a picture of Dr Cameron, it makes me so angry.\"Although Dr Cameron's work has since become synonymous with MK-Ultra experiments, Ms Torbay says her research shows he didn't know he was being funded by the CIA at the time. His work with the US intelligence agency ended in 1964, and he died shortly after, of a heart attack, in 1967.But regardless of whether he knew of where the money was coming from, Ms Torbay says he should have known the experiments he was conducting were not ethical.She says she hopes the lawsuit goes forward, and the victims get some sense of justice. \"It isn't really about giving the patients back what they lost, because that's not possible, but sort of almost making sure their suffering wasn't in vain, that we do learn from this,\" she says.",

It led to what some saw as the unjustified cancellation of a prize-winning writer and teacher - but to others, was a long overdue reckoning for the world of publishing. It grew into a culture war about race, class, and who has the right to say what.\nAnatomy of a Cancellation explores a range of different perspectives to consider how people now view one of the most controversial literary rows in recent memory.\nPresenter: Katie Razzall\nProducer: Charlotte McDonald\nAdditional production: Octavia Woodward\nProduction co-ordinators: Sophie Hill and Katie Morrison\nSound design and mix: James Beard\nStory editing: Meara Sharma\nSeries producer: Matt Willis\nSenior news editor: Clare Fordham\nCommissioning executive: Tracy Williams\nCommissioning editor: Dan Clarke\nIt was a BBC Long Form Audio production for Radio 4.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

The Government says the legislation is designed to protect the mental wellbeing of Australian children and teens – but it’s already proving controversial, not least among American tech companies and some politicians who see the ban as a threat to free speech.  \nIn today’s episode, we are joined by Katy Watson, the BBC’s Australia correspondent, to discuss how the country became a global test case for a bold new policy – and crucially, whether it will succeed.  \nProducers: Cat Farnsworth, Aron Keller and Xandra Ellin\nMix: Travis Evans\nSenior News Editor: China Collins\nPhoto: A teen using her phone ahead of social media band for users under 16.

    "body": "20 minutes agoShiona McCallumSenior technology reporterGetty ImagesDisney has agreed to invest $1bn (£740m) in OpenAI as part of a deal which will let people use many of its iconic characters in the chatbot ChatGPT and video-generation tool Sora.It is the first major studio to license parts of its catalogue to the tech giant, in a move which could have major implications for the studio's future plans.It means fans will be able to generate and share pictures and videos of more than 200 characters from Disney's franchises, including Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.The move comes as OpenAI faces mounting questions about how its rapidly advancing tech is used - and as anxiety in Hollywood increases over the impact of AI on the creative industries. According to a blog post announcing the news, the list of eligible characters include those from Disney films Zootopia, Moana and Encanto - as well as characters like Star Wars' Luke Skywalker and Marvel's Deadpool.It of course also includes Mickey and Minnie Mouse.But quite how the characters will sound remains unclear, as Disney said the agreement \"does not include any talent likenesses or voices\".\"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry,\" Disney boss Bob Iger said.\"Through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling.\"People are expected to be able to begin making the videos and images in Sora and ChatGPT in early 2026. Sora's hyper-realistic videos have proven to be popular in the US, but there have been significant criticisms from those claiming it has also led to some people creating offensive deepfakes of dead public figures.In October, OpenAI paused the video tool's ability to generate images of Dr Martin Luther King Jr after the app produced \"disrespectful\" depictions of the civil rights leader. The firm acknowledged the need for stronger safeguards after clips emerged showing him saying offensive things, prompting a public outcry.Other similar videos of President John F. Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth II and physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking also circulated widely. In some cases, family members called on OpenAI to stop allowing videos to be made.Zelda Williams, daughter of the late comedian Robin Williams, urged people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father.",

Avon and Somerset PolicePolice have released an image of four men they want to speak to after more than 600 artefacts were stolenStolen items include military badges and pins from the East India Company. \"The theft of many items which carry a significant cultural value is a significant loss for the city,\" Det Con Dan Burgan, of Avon and Somerset Police, said.\"These items, many of which were donations, form part of a collection that provides insight into a multi-layered part of British history, and we are hoping that members of the public can help us to bring those responsible to justice,\" he added.He said so far police have carried out \"significant\" CCTV inquiries, forensic investigations and have been liaising with the victims.The jewellery taken includes necklaces, bangles and rings. Carved figurines and other decorative items are missing as well as items of natural history, including geological specimens. GoogleThe items were taken from an archive building While the artefacts were not on display in the Bristol Museum, Mr Walker said they helped form an important link between the city and its history.\"These artefacts were part of a collection that documents the links between Britain and countries formerly part of the British Empire from the late 18th Century to the late 20th Century,\" said Mr Walker.  \"The collection is of cultural significance to many countries and provides an invaluable record and insight into the lives of those involved in and affected by the British Empire.\"Avon and Somerset PoliceThe men are described as being white and were all wearing jackets and baseball capsPolice are keen to speak to anyone who recognises the men captured on CCTV, or who may have seen possible stolen items being sold online.All of the men are thought to be white. The first was described as of medium to stocky build and was wearing a white cap, black jacket, light-coloured trousers and black trainers.The second was described as being of slim build and was wearing a grey, hooded jacket, black trousers and black trainers.Avon and Somerset PoliceThe items were taken from a building in the Cumberland basinThe third was wearing a green cap, black jacket, light-coloured shorts and white trainers. Police said he appeared to walk with a slight limp in his right leg.The fourth was described as being of large build and was wearing a two-toned orange and navy or black puffy jacket, black trousers and black and white trainers.A city council spokesman said police decided to delay a public appeal about the thefts until it had undertaken thorough initial inquiries. He added it had also taken time for archive staff to audit thousands of items held within the stores to establish what was missing. ",

    "body": "Police apologise to family of first child killed in Troubles 2 hours agoPacemakerNine-year-old Patrick Rooney was hit in his bedroom by one of the shots fired by police in west Belfast to disperse rioters at Divis flats in August 1969Police have apologised to the family of the first child killed in the Troubles in Northern Ireland.The family is also to receive \"significant compensation,\" the High Court heard on Thursday.Nine-year-old Patrick Rooney, the oldest of six, was shot in front of the rest of his family while taking shelter in a bedroom in the Divis flats in August 1969.Outside, Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers had opened fire from vehicle-mounted machine guns to to disperse rioters. The settlement was announced in the legal action taken by the boy's 88-year-old mother against the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).She was not able to attend court due to ill health.The judge called on the authorities to fast-track the undisclosed settlement, and an apology was issued for the hurt and suffering and loss caused to the family.Patrick had taken shelter along with his five siblings and their parents in a bedroom at their home.Up to 200 high velocity rounds were discharged by police, striking a number of properties in the tower.Patrick was shot through the head.His parents were unable to secure medical assistance at the scene and his father and other members of the public had to carry him from the area to reach an ambulance.'Sincerely apologise'The family's lawyers said the RUC took steps to prevent an adequate or effective probe into the circumstances surrounding the shooting. A police ombudsman report in 2021 into the killing of Patrick and three others found that officers were never held to account due to investigative failings. The ombudsman also stated the use of vehicle-mounted machine guns by officers to deal with rioting in Belfast in 1969 was \"disproportionate and dangerous\".No former officers were prosecuted due to a lack of evidence.His mother Alice sued the PSNI chief constable over both the shooting and the failure to conduct an effective inquiry or discipline the officers responsible.Damages were sought for negligence, breach of statutory duty, assault and battery, conspiracy to commit an unlawful act, and misfeasance in public office.Under the terms of the resolution an apology was read out in open court. It stated: \"As a result of negotiations, the plaintiff Mrs Rooney, has agreed a satisfactory full and final settlement of this action with the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\"The PSNI acknowledges the hurt and suffering caused to the family and wishes to sincerely apologise for the loss they endured.\" Formal authorisation for the undisclosed damages is still to be obtained from the Policing Board, along with the Department of Justice and Department of Finance at Stormont.'They petrified us'\"The trauma this must have resulted in (for the family) is just unimaginable,\" Mr Justice Rooney said.Speaking outside court, Patrick's brother, Con, said: \"It was never about the money, you can't put a price on life, but the police must be apologising for something.\"\"My daddy died in 2013, and on his death bed he asked us to keep going and don't let this go,\" he said.He added: \"It was horrific that night, I was eight years old and imagined (the police) kicking the door in to line us up and shoot us.\"We were frightened out of our lives, they petrified us.\"The family's solicitor, Katie McAllister of Madden and Finucane, said it had taken 56 years for a chief constable to offer an apology for the unlawful death.\"This occurred in the most violent, indiscriminate and in fact avoidable circumstances,\" she stressed.\"Patrick was killed in his own bedroom, the very place that he should have been most safe from danger.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoBethany BellVienna correspondent Austria has passed a law banning headscarves in schools for girls under the age of 14.The conservative-led coalition of three centrist parties, the ÖVP, the SPÖ and the Neos, says the law is a \"clear commitment to gender equality\", but critics say it will fuel anti-Muslim feeling in the country and could be unconstitutional.The measure will apply to girls in both public and private schools.In 2020, a similar headscarf ban for girls under 10 was struck down by the Constitutional Court, because it specifically targeted Muslims.The terms of the new law mean girls under 14 will be forbidden from wearing \"traditional Muslim\" head coverings such as hijabs or burkas.If a student violates the ban, they must have a series of discussions with school authorities and their legal guardians. If there are repeated violations, the child and youth welfare agency must be notified.As a last resort, families or guardians could be fined up to €800 (£700).Members of the government say this is about empowering young girls, arguing it is to protect them \"from oppression\".Speaking ahead of the vote, the parliamentary leader of the liberal Neos party, Yannick Shetty said it was \"not a measure against a religion. It is a measure to protect the freedom of girls in this country,\" and added that the ban would affect about 12,000 children.The opposition far-right Freedom Party of Austria, the FPÖ, which voted in favour of the ban, said it did not go far enough.It described the ban as \"a first step\", which should be widened to include all pupils and school staff.\"There needs to be a general ban on headscarves in schools; political Islam has no place here\", the FPÖ's spokesperson on families Ricarda Berger said.Sigrid Maurer from the opposition Greens called the new law \"clearly unconstitutional\".The official Islamic Community in Austria, the IGGÖ, said the ban violated fundamental rights and would split society.In a statement  on its website, it said  \"instead of empowering children, they will be stigmatised and marginalised.\"The IGGÖ said it would review \"the constitutionality of the law and take all necessary steps.\"\"The Constitutional Court already ruled unequivocally in 2020 that such a ban is unconstitutional, as it specifically targets a religious minority and violates the principle of equality,\" the IGGÖ said.The government says it has tried to avoid that.\"Will it pass muster with the Constitutional Court? I don't know. We have done our best,\" Shetty said.An awareness-raising trial period will start in February 2026, with the ban fully going into force next September - the beginning of the new school year.",

    "body": "Sir Chris Hoy says he is on crutches and \"hobbling about\" after breaking a leg in a cycling crash which he described as the \"worst\" of his life.Six-time Olympic champion Hoy announced in October 2024 that his cancer is terminal, but the 49-year-old has continued to ride his mountain bike since entering \"a bit of a stability period\" in his treatment.However, in an interview with Sky Sports, the Scotsman said: \"I've smashed my leg up, that's the worst thing that's happened recently. You just don't bounce like you do when you're younger.\"It was a big one. I'm doing better now, I'm still on crutches, hobbling about.\"Worse things happen. I've been riding bikes for 43 years and it's the worst crash I've ever had. I'm pretty lucky that's the worst one I've had in all those years of riding.\"Hoy, whose seven Olympic medals also include one silver, is Britain's second-most decorated Olympic athlete behind fellow track cyclist Sir Jason Kenny (seven golds).He also claimed 11 World Championship golds and 34 World Cup titles before retiring in 2013.\"I want to live my life and I want to make the most of it. None of us are here forever so you want to make the most of the time you have and do the things you enjoy,\" said Hoy.\"I've just had an unfortunate spill and it's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm doing alright now, I wasn't doing so well in the immediate aftermath of it, but looking forward to Christmas.\"Hoy announced in February 2024 that he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. He confirmed in October 2024 that his diagnosis was terminal after the primary cancer spread to his bones, with doctors giving him between two and four years to live.Hoy said his terminal cancer diagnosis has improved his life \"in some ways\" because it has changed his outlook.\"It's changed my life without question, but I think in some ways it's improved my life,\" Hoy told BBC Sport in November.\"It's changed my outlook on a lot of things. I'm not as bothered by small things. I think I try and focus on the here and the now, enjoying the moment, making the most of today, and trying to find something positive in any situation.\"I'm doing well. I'm able to keep doing all the things that I enjoy, spend a lot of time with my family, and I hope to be around for a lot longer yet.\"",

Lawrence, who became a household name playing Katniss, previously said she'd be \"totally\" up for coming back as the character.And last month, Hutcherson told US magazine Variety he'd \"be there in a heartbeat\" if he was asked to come back.\"It would not take any convincing at all,\" he said.Hunger Games fans were ecstatic at news the beloved characters would be making a new appearance.One wrote: \"For non-Hunger Games fans this is like Rihanna returning to music.\"Another added: \"It's basically Jesus returning to Earth.\"But there were some who weren't happy to see the information revealed, saying it could have been kept an \"emotional\" surprise.Getty ImagesThe Hunger Games is a global best-selling franchise which still lasts in popular culture todayThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping also stars McKenna Grace, Maya Hawke and Ralph Fiennes and is due to hit cinemas in November 2026.Author Suzanne Collins' book of the same name sold more than 1.5 million copies worldwide during its release week earlier this year - the biggest debut for one of her books.The Hunger Games series has reportedly made $3.3bn since the release of the first movie in 2012, and a theatre version recently launched.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the latest peace plan draft for Ukraine has been presented to US President Donald Trump - including a proposal on territorial concessions Kyiv may be prepared to make.But Merz highlighted the territorial issue was \"a question that must be answered primarily by the  Ukrainian president, and the Ukrainian people.\"\"We also made this clear to President Trump,\" Merz pointed out.In recent weeks European leaders have worked closely with Ukraine to come up with a new iteration of a peace plan that addresses Kyiv's interests and concerns.Trump appears to have grown frustrated with the intricacies of the question of sovereignty over Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. Because his negotiating team has previously worked closely with Moscow, Kyiv's European allies fear the US president might eventually seek to impose a Russian-led solution on Ukraine.\"It would be a mistake to force the Ukrainian president into a peace that his people will not accept after four years of suffering and death,\" Merz said in a joint news conference with Nato chief Mark Rutte.He added that in Wednesday's \"constructive\" phone call with Trump, he, France's Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had \"made it clear\" that Europeans needed to have their interests heard too.For his part, Trump said the participants had \"discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words\" and added that he was yet to decide whether to attend a meeting in Europe. \"We don't want to be wasting time,\" he said.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has long signalled he would be prepared to talk to Trump directly to discuss the sticking points of a deal, but the US president has suggested all issues had to be ironed out before such a meeting could take place.The territorial question is one of the thorniest. Russia demands that Ukraine withdraws entirely from the parts of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions which it still holds - something Kyiv refuses to do, both on principle and because it fears it would allow Moscow a foothold for future invasions. \"We have no legal right to [cede territory], under Ukrainian law, our constitution and international law,\" Zelensky said earlier this week. \"And we don't have any moral right either.\"Zelensky is set to hold more talks with his allies today as he co-chairs a coalition of the willing call alongside Merz, Macron and Starmer.As high-level, frantic diplomatic activity of the last few weeks has taken place among US, European and Ukrainian officials, with frequent statements from all sides, Moscow has remained remarkably tight-lipped.Any comments from Russia have sought to cement the impression that Moscow and Washington are aligned on their hopes for the terms of a peace deal.On Thursday Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trump for trying to broker a deal and said the recent meeting between Vladimir Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin had \"eliminated\" the \"misunderstandings\" which had arisen since last summer's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska.At the time, Russia and the US agreed Ukraine should return to a non-aligned, neutral, and nuclear-free status, Lavrov stated.The foreign minister also batted off suggestions that Kyiv could be given security guarantees in the form of foreign troops stationed in Ukraine. \"This is yet another return to the sad logic of Zelensky's so-called peace formula,\" Lavrov said, adding that Moscow had handed the US \"additional\" proposals on collective security and that Russia was ready to give legal guarantees not to attack Nato or EU countries.Yet Kyiv and its European allies believe that without security guarantees any peace settlement could be rendered meaningless.But because Russia has previously violated ceasefire and truce deals, neither Ukraine nor Europe are likely to take any promise by Moscow at face value. In recent weeks European and Ukrainian officials have pushed for the US to be involved in guaranteeing that Kyiv doesn't become the target of renewed attacks.Earlier this week Zelensky said he was ready to hold elections if the US and European countries could guarantee Ukraine's security during the vote. His five-year term as president was due to end in May 2024, but elections have been suspended in Ukraine since martial law was declared after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.Not for the first time, Nato chief Mark Rutte said on Thursday that too many of the alliance's allies did not feel the urgency of Russia's threat in Europe. \"We are Russia's next target,\" he warned, adding that Nato had to make all efforts to prevent a war that could be \"on the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured\".",

    "body": "The Queen has recorded a special radio broadcast with the BBC racing commentator John Hunt, whose wife and two daughters were murdered at their home last year.Louise Hunt, 25, her sister Hannah Hunt, 28, and their mother Carol Hunt, 61, were killed by Louise's ex-partner Kyle Clifford at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 9 July last year. Mr Hunt and his daughter Amy were invited by Queen Camilla to Clarence House as part of a special edition of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which will be broadcast on New Year's Eve.A fundraising gala for the Hunt Family Fund, set up in the memory of Carol, Louise and Hannah, will take place on Thursday evening. At Cambridge Crown Court in March, Clifford, 27, was sentenced to a whole life order, after pleading guilty to the murders and his conviction for raping Louise. The announcement of the special broadcast coincides with the final day of the UN's 16 days of activism against gender-based violence. Recorded on 27 November, the broadcast was chaired by the BBC's Emma Barnett and included former prime minister Baroness Theresa May, who will guest edit the Today programme on 31 December.Earlier this year, Mr Hunt and his daughter said they were both keen to keep the spirit of their loved ones alive. Mr Hunt said: \"From the moment I wake up, I say good morning to each of them.\"Sometimes I say out loud to Hannah and Louise: 'Girls, sorry I can't be with you, I'm with your mum at the moment'. As I close my eyes at night, I chat to them as well.\" Ms Hunt said: \"My mum, Hannah and Louise became a statistic. \"They became victims of Kyle Clifford.\"I want to breathe life back into my mum, Hannah and Louise as fully rounded people.\"",

It’s a notable shift in position from the president, who’s come under increasing pressure from Republicans and Democrats to release all files held by the Justice Department on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Will Trump be able to turn this into a victory, and will he be able to repair the rift that’s been growing among sections of his MAGA base?\nJustin, Sarah and Marianna take a look at what we know so far about Epstein’s relationships with powerful figures in the US, and what we can expect to see from the Epstein Files once they’re released into the public domain.\nAnd we assess just how significant a moment this is in Donald Trump’s second term as president, the tactics he may deploy to turn it into a political victory, and why he told one female reporter to be ‘quiet, piggy’ when asked about the Epstein Files on Air Force One.\nHOSTS:\n- Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent\n- Sarah Smith, North America editor\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby, Grace Reeve and Laura Cain.

Get Me Out Here!The late entrants were revealed on Wednesday night's instalment of the ITV show, and will be shown entering the camp on Thursday's episode.Williams said taking part in the series was a \"massive life experience\", adding that she doesn't normally go \"out of my comfort zone\".Read Wilson said he initially felt \"abject terror\" about taking part but is now \"feeling excited\" about entering the Australian jungle.The pair join fellow campmates, including Martin Kemp, Ruby Wax, Jack Osbourne and Kelly Brook, who have been in the jungle since the show's launch on Sunday.Williams, who is married to former Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, said: \"I always thought I wouldn't do it, because I've gotten too comfortable in my life. I like to have eight hours of sleep, I like to eat nice things, I like to just chill out and I never put myself out of my comfort zone.\"Then when I turned 40, I started to get scared of ridiculous things. I didn't want to be this person. Doing this is such a massive life experience and it is not something you can pay to do.\"So now I am 40, I think it will be pretty cool to do I'm A Celebrity.\"The mother-of-three said she was \"very worried about missing the kids\" while in camp.\"I have never been away this long before and I spend such a huge amount of time with them,\" she explained. \"It will be my biggest struggle.\"ITVRead Wilson, who was also a contestant on the fifth series of The Voice UK in 2016 and then runner-up on Celebrity Best Home Cook in 2021, said he was \"feeling excited\" about entering the jungle.\"My first thought when they approached me about taking part was abject terror,\" said the 39-year-old. \"But I have got a very strict rule in life. If the only reason that you don't want to do it is fear, you must do it, whatever it is.\"I'm fearful as a porcupine and I am very nervous that my grey cells [brains] won't dance properly in camp, too. At home, I do a cryptic crossword every day, I always have a book on the go and I am a bit worried that my frontal lobes will drop off if I don't have a lubricant for it.\"He continued: \"I can be vague at times and I don't want to scatter brain cells over the camp.\"His role as a receptionist and client coordinator on Celebs Go Dating sees him greet the celebrities upon their arrival to the dating agency.He is also well known for his wide vocabulary and published a book about language in 2022.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterEPAAlbania's prime minister accused Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood of \"ethnic stereotyping\" after she singled out Albanian families in a speech about abuses of the asylum system.Edi Rama criticised Mahmood for telling MPs around 700 Albanian families were \"living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims\" as she announced major reforms on Monday.Rama called the number a \"statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain's challenges\".Official data show the UK has deported more than 13,000 people to Albania since a returns deal was signed in 2022. Rama called the deal one of \"Europe's most successful partnerships on illegal migration.\"Mahmood's comments came as she announced major changes to the UK's \"out of control and unfair\" asylum system.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"The reforms will make refugee status temporary, extend the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20, and allow the removal of families with children who have no right to remain. Alongside tightening access to refugee status, the UK would create new legal routes to the UK, with an annual cap on numbers.As part of her speech, Mahmood told MPs \"we must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are\".\"There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims - despite an existing returns agreement, and Albania being a signatory to the European convention on human rights,\" she added.Posting on social media, Rama said: \"How can a Labour Home Secretary so poorly echo the rhetoric of the populist far-right – and single out 700 Albanian families, a statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain's challenges – precisely at a moment when the UK and Albania have built one of Europe's most successful partnerships on illegal migration?\"\"Let us also be clear: Albanians are net contributors to the British economy, and the number of Albanians receiving UK benefits is very low relative to other communities. \"To single them out again and again is not policy - it is a troubling and indecent exercise in demagoguery.\"Official policy should never be driven by ethnic stereotyping. That is the very least humanity expects from the great Great Britain.\"Rama has repeatedly clashed with British politicians over their descriptions of Albanian nationals. In May, Sir Keir Starmer travelled to the Albanian capital Tirana only to be told by Rama he would not host UK \"return hubs\" for failed asylum seekers from other countries.During the same press conference, Rama accused the previous Conservative government of \"stigmatising\" Albanians and warning that \"cursing the Albanians was not a good idea, because the curse went back and they are now out of the parliament\".A combative figure on social media, Rama has also previously invited Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to come to Albania to debate his claim one in 50 Albanians in Britain were in prison. Rama dismissed the figure as \"bonkers\" and accused Farage of peddling \"post-truth Brexit playbook\" politics. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoThe activity of a Russian spy ship in the North Sea leads several front pages, with the Mirror quoting Defence Secretary John Healey in its headline. He tells reporters the Yantar \"dangerously\" directed lasers to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters. \"We see you, we know what you're doing,\" he warns Moscow.The Independent also leads with Healey in its headline, characterising his quotes as a \"stern threat to Putin\". Russia's Embassy in London says it is not undermining UK security and it has condemned Healey's statement as provocative. The Sun says the incident is causing tensions with Russia to escalate, as \"more damning revelations\" surface about a British man facing a war crimes charge for spreading what the paper calls \"sick Putin propaganda\".The i Paper reports local authorities in London and the South East will be allowed to raise their council tax without a public vote. The paper says the hikes are part of a \"major funding overhaul to protect services\" and suggests Whitehall grants will be diverted to areas in the North and the Midlands with \"greater needs\".Trans people could be banned from single-sex spaces based on how they look, according to an exclusive report in the Times. The paper says the guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission was handed to ministers three months ago, but is yet to be published.\"Starmer calls on Farage to address racism claims,\" says the Guardian, following its reporting on Wednesday which alleged the Reform UK leader had made racist comments when he was in school. Farage has denied making any of the comments and actions attributed to him by former pupils at Dulwich College, in south London, in the 1970s.Officials have spoken to the Daily Telegraph about a secret deal that has been \"thrashed out\" between the US and Russia in a recent \"flurry\" of talks. Sources familiar with the 28-point plan tell the paper Ukraine could be forced to cede control of the eastern Donbas region to Russia but retain ownership. Moscow would pay the nation an undisclosed rental fee. The Daily Mail says that public confidence in the economy under the Labour government is at \"rock bottom\", just one week out from the Budget. They lead with results from a YouGov poll, which finds only 4% of those surveyed rated economic conditions as \"fairly good\".Budget speculation also reaches the front page of the Daily Express, which says new analysis offers proof that the pension triple lock \"must stay\". The paper says that millions of people will suffer \"pensioner poverty\" if Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"bows to pressure and allows pensioners' incomes to be whittled away\".\"Home investors pull £26bn from top London stocks despite blistering rally,\" declares the Financial Times, warning that the Budget is fuelling nervousness in investors amid a \"heightened sense of impending doom\". However, the paper says that the FTSE 100 is on course for its best year since its rebound from the financial crisis in 2009.The Metro alleges that a prestigious fertility clinic has been hacked by a group with links to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The paper says the ransomware gang, Qilin, is believed to have infiltrated the clinic's computer systems last month.Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsey are pictured on the front page of the Daily Star, after the Olympic swimmer said his family were \"encouraging false claims\" ahead of the pair's upcoming nuptials.Officials familiar with the US plan to end the war in Ukraine tell the Daily Telegraph  that it would see Kyiv receive a \"rental fee\" in exchange for Russia taking control of the Donbas region. The report says Russian would also be made an official language, and Ukraine's military would be halved. But one insider tells the paper that US officials are being \"strung along\" by Moscow. The Financial Times quotes a source as saying the deal is \"very comfortable\" for Russian President Vladimir Putin, while an official in Kyiv says it would be a \"non-starter\" for Ukraine.What's described as a \"North Sea stand-off\" is the lead in the Daily Mirror, after a Russian spy ship on the edge of UK waters was accused of targeting RAF pilots with lasers. The Guardian describes the move as \"part of a pattern of Russian incursions into Nato-controlled territory\". According to the Sun, tensions are escalating amid \"mounting fury\" at Moscow. The paper's headline is: \"Ship hits the fan\".\"Trans guide to protect women is left in limbo\", says the front page of the Times. It says it has seen new guidance, which suggests that places such as hospitals and gyms should be able to ban transgender people from single-sex spaces, based on how they look or behave. The paper accuses ministers of \"sitting on the plan\" from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, reporting that some in Whitehall are \"concerned that Labour is delaying publication\". But a government source dismisses that as \"total nonsense\".The i Paper reports that ministers are planning to allow local authorities in London and south east England to raise council tax above the 5% cap without a public vote, to help them cover losses from what it calls a \"funding shake-up\". The paper says an overhaul will see grants diverted to areas with higher spending needs, mainly in the Midlands and north of England.Ahead of the Budget next week, the Daily Express calls on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to keep the pension triple lock. The report highlights figures which suggest millions more pensioners could be plunged into poverty if the measure is scrapped. The Daily Mail, meanwhile, leads with a different set of statistics which it says deliver \"an excoriating verdict\" on Reeves. The paper says a \"shock\" YouGov poll has found that 0% of those surveyed believe the economy is in a \"very good state\".Related Internet Links",

It affects a number of platforms which also include TikTok, YouTube, X and Reddit.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the \"world-leading\" ban was aimed at \"letting kids be kids\". Meta and other firms oppose the measure but said they would comply.

The company said it was asking young users to update their contact details so they could be notified when they became eligible to open an account. They can download and save their posts, videos and messages before their accounts are shut down.Meta said that teens who said they were old enough to use Instagram, Facebook and Threads could challenge the restriction by taking a \"video selfie\" to be used in facial age scans.They could also provide a driver's licence or other government issued-ID.All these verification methods were tested by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) earlier this year, in a report commissioned by the Australian state.While the ACCS said that all methods had their merits, it added: \"We did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases, nor did we find solutions that were guaranteed to be effective in all deployments.\"Social media platforms which fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to block under-16s face fines of up to A$50m (£25m). \"While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process,\" Antigone Davis, vice-president and global head of safety at Meta, told Reuters Financial.Meta wants to see a law where under-16s have to get parental approval before they download a social media app. The firm told Australia's Seven News: \"Teens are resourceful, and may attempt to circumvent age assurance measures to access restricted services.\"But it said: \"We're committed to meeting our compliance obligations and are taking the necessary steps to comply with the law.\"Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said the ban was aimed at protecting teens \"from pressures and risks they can be exposed to while logged in to social media accounts\".In a move seemingly to avoid being included in the ban, gaming platform Roblox this week announced that children under 16 would be unable to chat to adult strangers.Mandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January.The e-safety commissioner has published a list of which social media platforms will be impacted by the age ban.They are: FacebookInstagramKickRedditSnapchatThreadsTikTokX (formerly Twitter)YouTubePlatforms not included are:DiscordGitHubGoogle ClassroomLEGO PlayMessengerRobloxSteam and Steam ChatWhatsAppYouTube Kids",

We want a fairer system for all drivers.\"The Chancellor has been reported to be considering a new pay-per-mile charge for electric vehicles from 2028.Ms Brankin told the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast: \"That [policy], in the face of really fragile demand for electric vehicles, is just another brake.\"The admin task of calculating their mileage would put potential EV owners off making the switch, she says.\"It's really easy to sell people things they want,\" she says. \"It's hard to sell people things they don't want. \"Electric vehicles in some instances have gone from being a great thing to being something that we're trying to push people into.\"ReutersThe chancellor has been reported to be considering a new pay-per-mile charge for electric vehiclesFord sells the UK's most popular vehicle, the Ford Puma, while its commercial van the Transit holds the second-most-sold ranking.For years its Focus model was the UK's most-popular, but the US company axed the hatchback and the last Ford Focus rolled off factory lines in Germany last week.It employs around 6,000 people in the UK, with an engine plant in Dagenham and a transmission factory in Halewood. It hasn't manufactured a vehicle here since 2013.Ford like other car makers is under pressure to meet the UK's net zero plan, 80% of new car sales must be EVs by 2030 or face fines. The government has reinstated a grant worth up to £3,750 to encourage drivers to buy electric vehicles.Ford would not be able to reach that 80% target without government help, such as the grant, Ms Brankin said.Sales figures from car industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show how far car makers have to go to reach the target.Fully-electric vehicles made up around 22.4% of total new car sales, data for 2025 up to 31 October shows. This time last year it was 18.1%.In September, the UK new car market experienced its best performance since 2020, driven by a surge in EV sales which hit a record high, according to SMMT figures.However, Ms Brankin pointed to heavy discounting across car sales forecourts as well as a lower resale value in the second-hand EV market as indicators that the market was \"distorted\".\"When that [target] was set a number of years ago, the outlook for demand around electric vehicles was buoyant and there seemed to be momentum behind electric vehicles. What we're seeing now is that customer demand is not in line with that ambition,\" Ms Brankin said.A large share of new EVs are sold to businesses for their employees and they benefit from lower rates of \"company car tax\" compared with diesel or petrol-fuelled options. Ms Brankin has urged the Chancellor to retain this tax benefit of companies \"greening\" their vehicle fleets.The shift to EVs could have consequences for the close-to 1,800 staff at the Ford diesel engine plant in Dagenham, which was the largest car factory in Europe when it was first built.Ms Brankin said Ford was yet to make any decisions about the future of the plant, which will build diesel engines up until 2030.\"We're working really hard on and what the next life of Dagenham looks like, \" she said but there was \"nothing that we've settled on at the moment.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterSir Keir Starmer/InstagramSir Keir Starmer has said it is \"not easy\" for young men \"growing up in this day and age\", in an open letter to his son to marking International Men's Day.The prime minister urged men to talk openly about their mental health, reflecting on his strained relationship with his own father who he \"never really  spoke\" to.His comments come as the government launched England's first men's health strategy, aimed at tackling issues predominantly faced by men such as suicide, alcohol abuse and problem gambling.In the letter to his 17-year-old son, who he has not publicly named, Sir Keir said there were \"pressures on young men that are difficult to talk about\".Sir Keir also spoke about his experience of not having \"a very close relationship with my own dad\" shaped his relationship with his own children.The prime minister has made much of his background, repeatedly mentioning in speeches his father was a toolmaker and his mother a nurse, who suffered from a debilitating form of arthritis known as Still's disease.In his letter, Sir Keir wrote that he and his father \"never really spoke\" and \"never really got to know each other\".The prime minister said spending time with his son was \"one of the highlights of my week\".\"You've grown into a confident, kind, wonderful young man. And I'm so proud of you,\" he wrote.\"If there's one hope I have, it's that we keep talking, keep learning from each other, keep helping each other.\"Sir Keir also acknowledged the strain his job places on family life, saying he is acutely aware of the \"huge sacrifices\" made by his wife and children since he entered Downing Street. \"The reason I do the job I do, and I know that means huge sacrifices for you, for your sister and your mum, is because I want the world for tomorrow's generation to be better,\" he said.In his letter, Sir Keir wrote that watching Adolescence, the hit Netflix series about a 13-year-old arrested for stabbing a classmate, with his son had helped shaped his perspective on the problems facing young men.The prime minister previously invited the shows creators to a Downing Street meeting to discuss the influence of toxic material online.Sir Keir also used his weekly Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) session to mark International Men's Day.He praised fellow Labour MP Luke Charters for sharing his mental health battle after nearly losing his wife in the traumatic birth of their first child, saying others would \"be inspired to talk openly about their experiences\".PMQs however was dominated by preparations for what is looking to be a bruising Budget for the prime minister.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the government's Budget is unravelling before it has even been delivered, after the chancellor appeared to back away from raising income tax rates following weeks of damaging stories.Sir Keir has also been forced to deny he authorised attacks on cabinet colleagues after a flurry of briefings to the press claimed ministers, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting, were plotting leadership bids.As part of the new men's health stratergy, the government has promised £3.6m over the next three years to suicide prevention projects for middle-aged men in local communities where they are most at risk of taking their own lives.Suicide is one of the biggest killers of men under 50 and three-quarters of all suicides are in men.A three-year partnership with the Premier League will also embed mental health messaging into football matches and fan spaces. The Department of Health said men are less likely to seek help and more likely to smoke, drink, gamble and use drugs than women.Under the plans, a new levy will be charged on betting companies - while the government will trial ways to reduce cocaine and alcohol-related deaths, including workplace pilots to bring health checks into male-dominated industries.",

    "body": "Senior Pentagon officials have arrived in Ukraine to \"discuss efforts to end the war\" with Russia, the US military has said.The team, led by US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Thursday when he returns from a trip to Turkey.Reports began surfacing on Wednesday that the US and Russia had prepared a new peace plan, containing major concessions from Ukraine. Neither Washington nor Moscow has officially confirmed the plan.Earlier in the day, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine's western city of Ternopil, officials there said. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \"Secretary Driscoll and team arrived this morning in Kyiv on behalf of the administration on a factfinding mission to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,\" Army spokesman Col David Butler said in a statement.Driscoll is joined by the US Army's chief of staff Gen Randy George, top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue, and Srg Maj of the Army Michael Weimer.Driscoll and Gen George are the most senior US military officials to hold talks in the Ukrainian capital since President Donald Trump took office in January.An image on Wednesday showed Driscoll meeting and shaking hands with Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal.In a post on X afterwards, Shmyhal said: \"We focused on the next steps for implementing the historic defence agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump\".He also thanked Washington for \"approving the sale of a support package for the PATRIOT air-defence system worth approximately $105m (£80m)\".Earlier, a Ukrainian official told CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that talks on the trip would focus on the military situation on the ground - as well as plans for a possible ceasefire. The official - who was not named - said: \"Presidents Zelensky and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees\".It comes as a number of outlets are reporting that the US and Russia have privately drawn up proposals on how to end the war.Citing people familiar with the matter, Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the plans call for Kyiv to give up some territories and weapons, as well as to significantly cut Ukraine's Armed Forces.Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian leader Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev are believed to have been involved in working on the 28-point peace plan.The BBC has asked the White House and a representative for Witkoff to comment.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to downplay the reports.\"In this case, we have no additional innovations to what we call 'the spirit of Anchorage',\" he told Russia's state-run media on Wednesday - referring to the August summit between Putin and Trump in the US state of Alaska.Any agreements reached during the one-day meeting have not been made public.President Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Russia.Kyiv and its Western allies, including the US, have been calling for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line, but Moscow has ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including ceding territory, tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out two months before the full-scale invasion.Meanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the BBC that special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg will leave his post in January.He reportedly decided that this would be a natural end to his time in the post, which requires Senate approval beyond 360 days.Kellogg has been seen as an important advocate for Ukraine in the White House during a time when Trump has often appeared to side with Russia in the conflict.

    "body": "10 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentRoyal Navy/ PAThe Royal Navy tracking the Russian ship YantarTo Russia, the Yantar is an oceanic research vessel - to others, including the UK, it's a spy ship, and a worry for Britain's defence chiefs.The vessel has long been suspected of secretly mapping out Britain's undersea cables, where more than 90% of our data, including billions of dollars of financial transactions, are transferred.But now, a new escalation, with revelations the Yantar's sailors targeted Royal Air Force pilots in patrol planes with lasers.Shining lasers into a pilot's eyes is provocative, and to use the Defence Secretary John Healey's words, \"deeply dangerous\". It's illegal in the UK and can lead to a prison sentence.Healey's direct message to Russia and its leader Vladimir Putin was stark: \"We see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.\" By that, he is implying should the Yantar cross inside Britain's 12-mile maritime boundary there would be a military response.This isn't the first time the Yantar has popped up near Britain's shores - at the start of the year a Royal Navy submarine made the highly unusual move to surface right in front of the ship as a sort of deterrent measure.The concern is that this is part of an ongoing operation by the Kremlin to locate and map all the vital undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world.It is also part of a wider pattern of Russian activity, as it tests Nato's reactions, resolve and defences. We've seen similar moves with the recent drone incursions across Europe, and Russian warplanes flying into Nato airspace.When three Russian fighter jets entered Estonian skies without permission in September, Italy, Finland and Sweden scrambled jets under Nato's mission to bolster its eastern flank. This is all interesting intel for Russia.Ministry of DefenceAs an island nation, Britain is heavily reliant on its network of undersea cables that carry data. There are also vital oil and gas pipelines connecting Britain to North Sea neighbours such as Norway. These cables and pipes are largely undefended and apparently of great interest to Russia's research vessels.Nato has identified deep-sea cables as part of the world's critical infrastructure. But they are also strategic pressure points, it says, warning that adversaries could exploit them through sabotage or hybrid warfare, threatening both civilian and military communications.Retired Royal Navy Commander Tom Sharpe made clear what the spy ship could be doing: \"The most obvious one is they sit above our cables and our critical undersea infrastructure and they nose around in the cables that transfer up to $7tn worth of financial transactions every day between us and America alone\".SPUTNIK/KREMLIN/EPA/ShutterstockPutin gave little away while he visited an AI conference in Moscow on WednesdayThe Yantar may be described by Moscow as a research vessel, but it is part of Russia's secretive Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research, or GUGI, which reports directly to the defence ministry.And while the ship bristles with hi-tech communications equipment, it's what we can't see that is of most concern.It can operate remotely-piloted miniature submarines that can dive down to sea beds many thousands of metres below the surface. These are capable of mapping the locations of cables, cutting them or planting sabotage devices that could, potentially, be activated in a time of war.The Royal Navy is experimenting with various means of combating the threat, such as a new vessel called Proteus, but critics fear much of the damage to Britain's coastal security may already have been done.Any foreign vessel operating in British waters must comply with UK national laws and international maritime conventions.The cornerstone of these complex rules is the UN Convention on the Law of The Sea (UNCLOS). This allows foreign ships to navigate through coastal waters provided that their passage is \"innocent\" - meaning it doesn't threaten the peace or security of a coastal nation like Britain.President Putin was at an AI conference in Moscow on Wednesday, and gave no immediate reaction on the situation unfolding north of Scotland.Russia's Embassy in London says it's not undermining UK security and it has condemned UK Defence Secretary Healey's statement as provocative. But all this is happening while war rages in Ukraine, a conflict Putin blames on the West and which seemingly he has no intention of stopping soon.

    "body": "1 hour agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterReutersChief executive Jensen Huang said sales for some of Nvidia's AI components were \"off the charts\"Chip giant Nvidia beat Wall Street's expectations for revenue and upcoming sales, easing investor concerns about heavy artificial intelligence (AI) spending that have unsettled markets.In its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, the firm said revenue for the three months to October jumped 62% to $57bn, driven by demand for its chips used in AI data centres. Sales from that division rose 66% to more than $51bn.Fourth-quarter sales forecasts in the range of $65bn also topped estimates, sending shares in Nvidia about 4% higher in after-hours trading.Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, is seen as a bellwether for the AI boom.Chief executive Jensen Huang said in a statement that sales of its AI Blackwell systems were \"off the charts\" and that \"cloud GPUs [graphics processing units] are sold out\".\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" he said, on a call with analysts.\"We excel at every phase of AI.\"The chipmaker's quarterly report garnered even more attention than usual on Wall Street amid mounting concern that AI stocks are overvalued - fears that may persist despite Nvidia's blockbuster results.Those fears had fuelled four consecutive daily drops in the S&P 500 index leading up to Wednesday, as questions swirl about returns on AI investments. The benchmark index has fallen nearly 3% so far in November.The bar was high heading into Nvidia's results.Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said the question was not whether the company would beat expectations, \"but by how much\".Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"While AI valuations are dominating the news feeds, Nvidia is going about its business in style.\"He said valuations for certain areas of the AI sector \"needed to take a breather, but Nvidia is not in that camp\".Mr Huang had previously said he expected $500bn in AI chip orders through next year. Investors were looking for details about when the company expects those revenues will come to fruition, and how it plans to fulfill the orders.Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, told analysts the company would \"probably\" be taking more orders on top of the $500bn that had already been announced.But she also expressed disappointment about regulatory limits that stymie the company's ability to export its chips to China, saying the US \"must win the support of every developer\" including those in China.She said Nvidia was \"committed to continued engagement\" with the American and Chinese governments.Earlier on Wednesday at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, Mr Huang joined Elon Musk to announce a massive data centre complex in Saudi Arabia that will have Musk's AI company, xAI, as its first customer.The facility will be outfitted with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips.The Wall Street Journal reported the US Commerce Department has approved the sale of up to 70,000 advanced AI chips to state-backed companies in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, reversing an earlier decision.The agreement was brokered following talks between US President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who visited the White House this week.EPA/ShutterstockLast month Nvidia became the first company to be valued at $5tnThe titans of the technology sector are ramping up their spending on AI, as they rush to reap the benefits of a boom that has pushed stocks to record highs.Earnings reports from Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft last month reaffirmed the colossal amounts of money these firms are shelling out for everything from data centres to chips.Sundar Pichai, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet, told the BBC that while the growth of AI investment had been an \"extraordinary moment\", there was some \"irrationality\" in the current AI boom. His comments came amid other warnings from industry leaders.Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, said there were some parallels with the dotcom bubble 25 years ago, when valuations skyrocketed before the market crashed in 2000.\"The issue is not so much these big cash generative companies like Nvidia, but it's the wider part of the tech ecosystem, quite a lot of which isn't currently profitable,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.Nvidia, which makes chips that are crucial for AI data centres, is at the heart of a web of deals among key players in the AI space such as OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI.The deals have drawn scrutiny for their circular nature, as AI firms increasingly invest in one another. The agreements include Nvidia's $100bn investment in OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT.Additional reporting by Lily Jamali, North America Technology Correspondent, San Francisco",

    "description": "6 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Brandon DrenonHarvard University professor Larry Summers is taking leave while the school investigates his and others'",
    "body": "6 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Brandon DrenonHarvard University professor Larry Summers is taking leave while the school investigates his and others' ties with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a spokesperson confirmed.The former US treasury secretary and onetime Harvard president will stop teaching and step back as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.A spokesperson told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that Summers believes \"it's in the best interest of the Center\".Recently released emails indicate that Summers corresponded with Epstein until the day before the financier's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors. In a statement to The Harvard Crimson, the university said it was \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents\". The BBC has contacted Summers for comment on Harvard's new review.On Tuesday, Summers addressed his communication with Epstein to students in a class he had been teaching at Harvard.\"Some of you will have seen my statement of regret, expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein. And that I've said that I'm going to step back from public activity,\" Summers told his students, according to a video recorded by a student. \"I think it's very important to fulfill my teaching obligations. So with your permission, we're going to go forward and talk about the material in the class.\"But on Wednesday night, Summers spokesperson Steven Goldberg said in the statement provided to CBS that \"co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester\".The public fallout for Summers began after Congress released over 20,000 pages of documents from the so-called Epstein files last week, which included multiple emails between Epstein and Summers.Time stamps from the emails showed the two communicated up until the day before Epstein's arrest - a decade after he pleaded guilty for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.A married father of six, Summers messaged Epstein in November 2018 seemingly asking for romantic advice related to his interest in someone he said viewed him as an \"economics mentor\".\"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor,\" Summers wrote in one exchange where Epstein referred to himself as Summers' \"wing man\".\"Am I thanking her or being sorry re my being married. I think the former,\" he wrote in another email.The emails also indicated that Summers and Epstein dined together frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. No Epstein survivor has accused Summers of misconduct, and there is no publicly available evidence indicating that he was involved in any of Epstein's crimes.Summers announced earlier Wednesday that he was leaving the board of OpenAI, and the artificial intelligence company said it respected Summers' decision to resign. \"We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board,\" OpenAI said. He joined the board of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, in 2023 - following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive, Sam Altman. Summers said in a statement to the BBC about the move that he was \"grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress\".After the emails were shared with the public, Summers said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\". He added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".Summers held senior posts under two Democratic presidents; serving as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, and as director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama. He led Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and remains a professor there. The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, also has confirmed that Summers is no longer affiliated with the organisation.Both chambers of Congress agreed on Tuesday to pass a measure to require the US justice department to release its files on Epstein, setting up the possible release of tens-of-thousands more documents. President Donald Trump signed the bill on Wednesday, after reversing his position on the issue following pushback from his supporters. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterHome secretary: It's \"often better value for the taxpayer\" to give migrants cash to leave UKHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said she is willing to consider \"a big increase\" in payments to failed asylum seekers to persuade them to leave the UK voluntarily.She told the BBC this was often \"better value for money for the taxpayer\" than the cost of people remaining in the country.Mahmood also defended her plans to start deporting families who have been rejected for asylum, even where this includes children.The proposals are part of a major overhaul of the UK's asylum system, which was announced in Parliament this week and has attracted criticism from some Labour MPs and peers.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Mahmood was asked whether paying failed asylum seekers to leave was the right thing to do with taxpayers' money.She argued looking after failed asylum seekers currently costs the taxpayer £30,000 per individual, per year, making cash payments \"value for money\", even if sums increase past the current upper limit, understood to be £3,000.\"I've already asked my officials to pilot a small programme where we offer more than we currently do, just to see how that changes behaviour,\" she said. \"I haven't alighted on the full sums involved yet but I'm willing to consider a big increase on what we currently pay and that's because... that's often better value for money for the taxpayer.\"I know it sticks in the craw of many people and they don't like it but it's value for money, it does work and a voluntary return is often the best way to get people to return to their home country as quickly as possible.\"One aspect of the government's plans which has proved controversial with some backbench Labour MPs is a change in attitude towards removing families with children.The government does not currently prioritise deporting families who have been rejected for asylum but under the proposals they could be forcibly removed if they refuse to leave the UK voluntarily.On Tuesday Labour peer Lord Dubs, who came to the UK from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia on the Kindertransport, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mahmood was \"weaponising children\" and should think again.In response to his comments, the home secretary said: \"I always listen carefully to what he says but on this occasion I do disagree.\"Insisting she \"would never use children as a weapon\", Mahmood said she had a duty to get rid of reasons for putting children on dangerous small boats crossing the Channel.She said: \"There is a perverse incentive there to still travel with your children, maybe put your children in danger, if you know that we would never ever remove a family with children when they have failed in their claim.\"Acknowledging there were specific concerns around the removal of children that needed careful consideration, Mahmood explained she also needed to be fair to British taxpayers \"who are footing that bill\". She added: \"It is right that if you're a failed asylum seeker, the fact that you have a child under 18 is not a reason why you should remain here in supported asylum accommodation forever more.\"Another issue that has caused concern is reports that asylum seekers could be stripped of jewellery at the border when they arrive. Mahmood insisted asylum seekers would not have any items of sentimental value, such as wedding rings, taken away.However, she said individuals with a \"flashy Rolex\" watch, e-bike, car or other high-value assets \"should make a contribution\" towards the cost of their stay.She gave the example of an asylum seeker who was being given £800 a month by his family and had bought an Audi.\"He was not required under any of our rules to contribute towards the cost of his asylum accommodation,\" Mahmood said.\"Now most British citizens have to contribute towards the cost of accessing the benefit system, and if they have assets that is taken into account when they seek social security money. \"So what I'm trying to do with that change is put asylum seekers on the same sort of playing field that British citizens are on.\"Listen to the full interview with Shabana Mahmood on BBC Radio 4 at 17:30 GMT on Saturday or on BBC Sounds.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

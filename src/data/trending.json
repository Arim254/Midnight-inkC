The CMA said part of the reason it had allowed a rise was because interest rates on those loans have risen, making it more expensive for the firms to carry out their plans.</p><p>Troubled firm Thames Water also appealed for higher price rises, but has deferred its case until late October while it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn82pm40915o\">tries to fix a rescue bid</a>.</p><p>Water firms have been told by authorities to fix outdated infrastructure which has been found to be the cause of much river and water pollution. The Environment Agency said serious pollution incidents by water firms <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5zl75dmm0o\">went up by around 60% in a year.</a></p></div><div><p>It will lead to an increase on average of \"£1 per household, per month\" for customers of the water firms that appealed, said David Henderson, chief executive of Water UK which represents water firms.</p><p>When asked by the BBC's Today programme why the firms themselves can't pay for the needed upgrades, Mr Henderson said shareholders had already invested a lot their own money, and eight water firms had made a loss in 2024.</p><p>\"They [investors] don't have to put money into this sector, they don't even have to put money into this country,\" he said, adding that many \" haven't made a profit in years. This isn't an industry awash with cash. It is an industry providing vital infrastructure\".</p></div>",

This is a major diplomatic victory for someone who wants to be seen as the man who ended the war – and, in the process, be rewarded for it.</p><p>Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly Israeli civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. </p><p>Israel's military offensive has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and including more than 18,000 children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies. It has destroyed most of the territory and led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p><p>What has been agreed is the first phase of a plan the president announced at the White House last week alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been accused of sabotaging efforts for a deal in the past. </p><p>This time, Trump, reportedly impatient and irritated with Netanyahu, appears to have used the power only the Americans have to influence Israel, leaving the prime minister with no option other than to engage with the process.</p></div><div><p>Threatened by Trump with \"complete obliteration\", Hamas was under intense pressure too. Arab and Muslim countries embraced the president's plan, and there was heavy involvement from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey in the negotiations.</p><p>Details of the deal have not yet been published but the outline is that the remaining hostages will be freed – the 20 believed to be alive at once, possibly as soon as Sunday, while the remains of up to 28 deceased captives will be returned in stages. </p><p>Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails, Israeli troops will withdraw from parts of Gaza, and there will be an increase in humanitarian aid entering the territory.</p><p>Trump has publicly expressed his desire to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced on Friday, a deadline that could have guided the negotiations. On social media, he employed his usual hyperbole, calling it a \"historic and unprecedented event\" and the \"first steps toward a strong, durable and everlasting peace\".</p></div><div><p>This is, without a doubt, a significant moment but it gives no certainty that a peace deal for Gaza will happen, as crucial details still need to be worked out. They include the key Israeli demand that Hamas must disarm, the extent of the Israeli withdrawal and a plan for who will govern Gaza.</p><p>In Gaza, Palestinians celebrated the announcement in the middle of the night, hoping that this will bring an end to their suffering. In Tel Aviv, people gathered in Hostages Square, which has become a symbol of the ordeal of the captives.</p><p>Hamas knows that, by releasing the hostages, it will lose the leverage it has in negotiations. It has demanded guarantees that Israel will not resume the fighting once they have been freed - but has reasons to be suspicious: in March, Israel broke down a ceasefire and returned to war with devastating air strikes.</p><p>In Israel, however, a country exhausted by the conflict, polls have consistently suggested that most people want the conflict to end. </p><p>But Netanyahu still faces political hurdles. He relies on the support of ultranationalist ministers who have threatened to quit the coalition in the case of a deal, which could lead to the government's collapse, a concern that many suspect has led him to prolong the war. He has promised to achieve \"total victory\" against Hamas, and any deal will have to allow him to say he has done that.</p><p>Netanyahu has called the announcement a \"diplomatic and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel\". Notably, unlike Hamas, his statement did not say it would end the war.</p></div><div><p><span>More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

Israel says there are 48 hostages still held in Gaza, up to 20 of whom are believed to be alive.</p><p>In confirming the announcement, Hamas said it would \"end the war in Gaza\", \"ensure the complete withdrawal\" of Israeli forces, allow the entry of humanitarian aid, and implement an exchange of the hostages for Palestinians in Israeli jails.</p><p>Israeli and Hamas negotiators did not speak directly to each other - the talks were mediated by Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and senior officials from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump says Middle East deal ‘very close’ after being passed note by Marco Rubio</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>What happens next?</h2><p></p><div><p>Israel's government is due to vote on the deal on Thursday. </p><p>If ministers formally approved it, Israel must withdraw its troops from Gaza to the agreed line, a senior White House official told BBC's US partner, CBS News. The withdrawal would likely happen within 24 hours, the official said.</p><p>After that happened, they added, a 72-hour clock would begin where Hamas must release the living hostages.</p><p>The release of the hostages would likely begin on Monday, according to the official.</p></div><p></p><h2>What do we not know?</h2><p></p><div><p>What's been announced so far represents only part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70155nked7o\">the 20-point peace plan</a> unveiled by Trump last week, which Israel had accepted and Hamas had partly agreed to.</p><p>The announcements did not cover <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c930v44dg2ro\">some thorny issues</a> both sides have not reached a resolution on.</p><p>Notably, no details surround the disarmament of Hamas - a key point in Trump's plan. Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so when a Palestinian state had been established.</p><p>The future governance of Gaza is also a sticking point. Trump's plan states that Hamas will have no future role in the Strip and proposes it be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\", before being handed over to the Palestinian Authority.</p><p>Netanyahu appeared to push back on the Palestinian Authority's involvement last week, even as he accepted Trump's plan.</p><p>Ultranationalist hardliners within Netanyahu's ruling coalition, many of whom want to reconstruct Jewish settlements in Gaza, are also likely to object to this point.</p><p>Hamas, in response, said it still expected to have some role in governing Gaza.</p><p>In addition, as of Wednesday night, Hamas had not yet received the final list of Palestinian prisoners that Israel plans to release in exchange for the hostages in Gaza, a Palestinian source told the BBC.</p><p>The 20-point plan states that 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1,700 Gazans who were detained after 7 October 2023 will be released.</p></div><p></p><h2>What's

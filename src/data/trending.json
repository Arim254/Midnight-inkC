    "body": "5 hours agoJames Waterhousein Córdoba, SpainBBC/Moose CampbellYamilei's brother-in-law Victor was among the victims of Sunday night's crashEduardo Morán, a doctor at Córdoba's Reina Sofía Hospital, suspected it was serious.He and his wife, also a medic, had been asked to head to work after reports that two high speed trains had collided nearby.\"We were preparing different parts of the hospital,\" he recalls. \"Not just the emergency room, but the intensive care unit, all the surgery theatres and the regular floor. Everybody was there.\"As the patients arrived, their injuries ranged from scratches to missing limbs. Staff prioritised who to treat. Some were operated on, others monitored.Eduardo had never seen such an influx of casualties in his 20-year career, and yet the hospital was not overwhelmed.\"We were expecting more,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, there were a lot of people who didn't make it and died on the railway.\"Social MediaAmong the victims was María del Carmen Abril, returning from a surprise birthday partyIn dense woodland 36 miles from Córdoba lies the tangled wreckage of the two trains that collided on Sunday evening.A gap in the straight section of track is thought to be what investigators are focusing on.At least 43 people lost their lives here, and as sniffer dogs weave between the empty seats and shattered windows, there is still a hunger to unearth answers as to what caused Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.As officials called for patience, news broke of a second derailment in almost as many days.Unlike Sunday night's disaster, the train that crashed near Barcelona was not a high-speed model, and the accident involved a wall that collapsed onto the track in heavy rain.Nevertheless, it has led to the Spanish train drivers' union calling a strike over the \"unacceptable constant deterioration of the railway\".For the families and friends of those missing and killed in southern Spain, these events have only added to their unanswered questions.BBC/Moose CampbellJose Manuel Muñoz lost his friend Abril in Sunday's high-speed rail crashThroughout Saturday afternoon and into the night in Córdoba, Jose Manuel Muñoz and his friends were holding a surprise 50th birthday party for María del Carmen Abril, a teacher.The party was barely over when Abril, as she is known, made her way back north to Madrid. She thanked her hosts on their WhatsApp group, and they later frantically replied to see if she was OK.Abril was sitting on one of the carriages that came off the tracks into an oncoming train. Her death was confirmed the next day.Carlos Alvarez/Getty ImagesAn Iryo train was the first to derail at Adamuz, crashing into an oncoming train\"It's very difficult to explain the contrast of emotions,\" says Muñoz, sitting in the tranquil surroundings of Córdoba's Jardines de la Victoria, a park next to his workshop where he makes picture frames.\"We spent one day celebrating life with our friend, then there were two days of uncertainty, without knowing anything about what happened to her, then we get the confirmation that she's dead.\"He describes Abril as a \"lovely, generous, affectionate person who loved flowers and was always trying to solve other people's problems\".And yet Muñoz does not blame anyone for her death; instead, he puts it down to bad luck.Under the low winter sun and next to the city's bull ring is Córdoba's Civic Centre. Outside are two makeshift tents where the families of the missing give DNA samples in the hope their relatives can at least be identified.BBC/Marianne BaisnéeYamilei shows a picture of her brother-in-law, Victor Luis TeránBecause of a last-minute change in travel plans, Jamilet's brother-in law, Victor Luis Terán, took an earlier train and became caught up in the crash as he travelled south from Madrid to Huelva.It was not until Tuesday night that confirmation came that Victor, a Bolivian national, was among the 43 victims.Yamilei is looking for answers: \"That's all we want. Because we can't do it any more.\"The truth she seeks is likely to take weeks to arrive, and official calls for patience have only been hampered by a devastating three days on Spain's rail network.Additional reporting by Marianne Baisnée and Marta Jimenez",

She was replaced by Lady Caroline Waldegrave.Alison Hammond and Noel Fielding are the current Bake Off presenters, but Dame Prue has also appeared with previous hosts Sandi Toksvig and Matt Lucas.Paying tribute to his co-star, Hollywood wrote on Instagram: \"You're the best Prue!\"Dame Prue said: \"Bake Off has been a fabulous part of my life for the last nine years, I have genuinely loved it and I'm sure I'll miss working with my fellow judge Paul, Alison and Noel and the teams at Love Productions and Channel 4.\"But now feels like the right time to step back (I'm 86 for goodness sake!), there's so much I'd like to do, not least spend summers enjoying my garden.\"She added: \"Whoever joins the team, I'm sure they'll love it as much as I have. I feel very lucky to have been part of it.\"Dame Prue was hired for Bake Off after the series jumped from the BBC to Channel 4 in 2016.She replaced Dame Mary, who left the show along with presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins after the move.Channel 4's chief content officer Ian Katz said Dame Prue had been \"a joyous presence in the tent, pairing absolute culinary authority with great generosity and empathy for the bakers\". \"We are grateful for her passion, her wit, her ineffable style, and all the summers she spent in the tent.\"He added: \"She leaves an indelible mark on the show and all its bakers. We will miss her wry, gentle judgement but look forward to working with her on new projects.\"Former contestants also commented on Instagram to share their tributes to Leith.Jasmine Mitchell, who won Bake Off in 2025, wrote: \"Prue, you're amazing and we will miss you so very much.\"Dr Rahul Mandal, who won in 2018, added: \"We will miss you so much. It was a joy and privilege to be in the tent with you. You are kind, funny passionate and always inspired us.\"",

    "body": "44 minutes agoKaty AustinTransport correspondentGetty ImagesThe rail regulator has admitted it \"did not have all the facts\" when it decided to not allow passengers on a peak-time train service between Manchester and London.The Office of Road and Rail (ORR) said it was missing \"critical points\" when it made a decision that would have turned the service into a 'ghost train' running daily for months.ORR chief executive John Larkinson said his organisation did not know the train would be \"fully crewed\", would leave from Manchester Piccadilly rather than a depot, and that it had to get to Euston to become the 09:30 GMT service to Glasgow.\"The information that later became available to us meant that our assumption turned out to be incorrect,\" he said.It comes after the ORR in November faced a backlash over its decision to allow the popular 07:00 train to run, but carrying only staff.The decision, which would have taken effect from mid-December, was quickly reversed after significant criticism, including from Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander.The ORR had justified the decision by saying the service had to run empty so its slot could be used as a firebreak - a planned gap in the timetable in case of delays.But, in a letter to the chair of Parliament's Transport Committee, Ruth Cadbury, Larkinson said the facts which later came to light meant the slot could no longer be considered an effective firebreak.Larkinson said the ORR team assessing the application didn't ask Avanti for further information, which would have made the points clear.He said if the ORR team had contacted Avanti, its decision \"may have been different, but they were stretched and trying to close out multiple interacting decisions\".He added that the ORR was dealing at the time with 82 \"complex and competing\" applications for track access.Even when the train operating company complained in early November, the points they made were not \"escalated appropriately\", his letter said.Larkinson described it as \"an unusual case, but nevertheless one we will learn from\".He added: \"I take full responsibility for what happened and we are strengthening our processes to reflect the lessons we have learned.\"A statement in response from Cadbury, the Labour MP for Brentford and Isleworth, said: \"The public was understandably baffled by the ORR's decision not to allow the 7am fast service from Manchester to London to carry passengers when a fully crewed train was running anyway.\"On the face of it, this was a strange decision - especially when the train was popular and profitable - and one that the Transport Committee had a number of questions about.\"Now we have some answers, a detailed explanation for why this happened and a welcome recognition of responsibility.\"She said the committee will look for ways to avoid similar instances in the future as the government establishes Great British Railways.",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has agreed to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein cases.Committee chairman James Comer, who is leading the investigation, says Maxwell will speak to the committee virtually on 9 February. Maxwell's legal team has previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity. Comer, previewing the deposition, said, \"her lawyers have been saying she is going to plead the Fifth,\" referring to the US Fifth Amendment right to decline to speak to authorities.The announcement from the  House Oversight and Government Reform Committee  comes as the Trump administration continues to come under fierce scrutiny for its handling of the Epstein case.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking  teenage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein.  In July, the committee declined to offer Maxwell legal immunity in exchange for her testimony.In August, the committee issued legal summons to Maxwell, requiring her to submit evidence under oath. Maxwell's legal team said that requiring her to both testify from jail, and without any legal immunity, were \"non-starters\".The lawyers said she \"cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity\" as speaking from prison \"creates real security risks and undermines the integrity of the process\".House lawmakers cannot force Maxwell to waive her Fifth Amendment protections.Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021, had appealed against the conviction to the  Supreme Court last October but the top court declined to hear the former British socialite's appeal.Her only route to leave prison early would be a presidential pardon. The White House has denied that Trump is considering granting her clemency, however, Trump has also said he has not ruled it out.Separately, the Department of Justice faced a deadline of 19 December last year to release all remaining Epstein files in their possession. So far only a fraction of them have been made public.The department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the number of redactions in the files, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations.Meanwhile, the House committee is also meeting to discuss former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton's refusal to appear before the panel to answer questions related to the investigation into Epstein.The committee has said it is considering filing contempt charges against the two.

    "body": "11 minutes agoThomas MackintoshandRachel HaganThe US military has begun the transfer up to 7,000 Islamic State (IS) group detainees from prisons in north-eastern Syria to Iraq, as Syria's new government takes control of areas long run autonomously by Kurdish-led forces.US Central Command (Centcom) said it had already moved 150 IS fighters from Hassakeh province to a \"secure location\" in Iraq.It said the move aimed to prevent prisoners breaking out and regrouping.The transfer follows a ceasefire agreement that has brought much of Syria's north east under Damascus control, after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) withdrew from key areas, including detention sites holding thousands of IS suspects and their relatives.CENTCOM said its commander Admiral Brad Cooper discussed the transfers with Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, stressing the need for Syrian forces to uphold the ceasefire and avoid any action that could interfere with what he described as an \"orderly and secure transfer\" of detainees.Rights group Reprieve warned that detainees transferred to Iraq could face torture and execution and urged the UK government to establish whether any British nationals were among those being moved.The charity said it believed there were no more than 10 British men held in the prisons, though exact numbers were unclear. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said.Despite the ceasefire there have been fresh clashes, with Syria's defence ministry saying seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack in Hassakeh on Wednesday, describing the incident a violation of the ceasefire.The SDF denied carrying out the strike and accused Damascus of also launching attacks, including near the town of Kobane on the Turkish border.The government and SDF had earlier blamed each other over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh.Syria's interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following \"the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists\" from the prison. It said security forces later recaptured 81 of the fugitives.The SDF said it had lost control of the prison following clashes with \"Damascus-affiliated factions\", warning of a \"serious security catastrophe\".SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members may have escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency. The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is also holding IS members and leaders.The SDF helped US-led forces defeat IS during Syria's 13-year civil war and, backed by the US, went on to jail around 12,000 IS members, including thousands of foreigners, while detaining tens of thousands of relatives in camps across the north east.However US special envoy Tom Barrack has said the US alliance with the SDF had \"largely expired\" and that his country was currently focused on securing IS detention facilities and facilitating talks between the SDF and al-Sharaa's government.\"This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime,\" he wrote on X.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandRichard Wheeler,Political reporterPeers in the House of Lords have been urged to vote in support of a ban on social media for under-16s in the UK.Lord Nash, a former schools minister, has proposed a change to a bill, which would raise the age limit for users of social media. The legislation is being debated on Wednesday evening.It comes amid calls for the UK government to follow Australia in imposing a social media ban for young people - the world's first - last year.But some campaigners and children's charities have opposed the move, which Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out.Earlier this week, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall announced a \"swift\" consultation on measures to \"keep children safe online\" and seek views on the effectiveness of a ban.It will assess the merits of a ban for under-16s, as well as overnight curfews and actions to prevent \"doom-scrolling\".It would also look at whether more robust age checks could be implemented by social media firms, which could be forced to remove or limit features \"which drive compulsive use of social media\".And England's education inspectorate, Ofsted, will give tougher guidance to schools to reduce phone use - including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.Conservative peer Lord Nash argued there was no need for a consultation, partly because polling showed \"the vast majority of parents want it\".\"There is a huge volume of evidence in academic studies around the world that show quite clearly that excessive use of social media is damaging to children's health,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.He said his amendment proposed \"highly effective age verification\".\"The social media companies are perfectly capable, and have told me this, of putting in place highly effective age verification.\"He added: \"We're just asking for a few more years for children to mature so that they do have to deal with social media at 16, they're more likely to distinguish fact from fiction and they can make better judgements.\"Lord Nash's amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill has been co-sponsored by Labour peer Baroness Berger, Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Benjamin and independent crossbench peer Baroness Cass.However, if the amendment passed in the Lords, it could be overturned in the House of Commons by MPs at a later stage.On Sunday, more than 60 Labour MPs wrote to the prime minister saying they backed a ban with the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey also calling on the government to act.Baroness Kidron, an online safety campaigner who founded and chairs the 5Rights Foundation, said there had been a \"growing call\" for a social media ban for under-16s.The independent crossbench peer said support from more than 60 Labour MPs for a ban was \"crucial\" should the Lords approve the amendment.Baroness Kidron told the BBC's Politics Live programme: \"It means that there's at least 60 people on the government benches who are not willing to just walk through [the division lobbies] and overturn it.\"So that's why it's become a huge thing.\"Baroness Kidron said the government had brought forward a \"hastily created consultation\".She said she was \"absolutely furious\" because \"the consultation is not really on the main point of child safety, it's actually a bit of party management trying to deal with their own backbench revolt\".Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy defended the \"short and sharp\" three-month consultation, noting there were \"mixed views that have been put forward about how you tackle this\".She said: \"I just want to say to anybody listening at home, because like them I have a little boy and it keeps me awake at night thinking about some of the things he is exposed to online, I do want to say that we are consulting on what we do not whether we do something.\"We will tighten the law, we will introduce greater enforcement powers and we will introduce other measures as well, and we're consulting on how we best go about that in order to take swift action to deal with what is a problem for every single family in this country.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it was in power.\"The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,\" she said.The Liberal Democrats have called for film-style age ratings to protect children.Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said there was \"no time to waste in protecting our children from social media giants\" and \"this consultation risks kicking the can down the road yet again\".",

    "body": "Oldest cave painting of red claw hand could rewrite human creativity timeline4 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentA stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say.It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination.The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain.The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue.Over the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there.Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science.Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done.Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery, published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved.\"When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain\".The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University.\"We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years\".The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock.One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world.Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say.Ahdi Agus OktavianaMore recent elongated hand stencils found elsewhere in Suluwesi shows how prevalent the red claw image was among these ancient artists.After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is \"a very us thing to do\".  He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method.Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region.Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed \"hundreds of new rock art sites\" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years.Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived.For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN).\"It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia.\"Many archaeologists once argued for a European \"big bang\" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before.Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News.\"What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that\".",

    "body": "59 minutes agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorGetty ImagesI was in the room and saw President Trump enter and it's fair to say he got a good welcome from the crowd, certainly at the beginning. A standing ovation.On top of that, there was an astonishing scrum to try to get in, with many turned away - even heads of state.And the security was unbelievable, not letting even some of the most famous attendees in or out of the hall.But, minutes into the speech, Trump was keeping his cool - even dropping in phrases about wanting the UK \"to do great\".What some thought would be the day on which the US president laid down the laws of his new global economy was filled more with grandfatherly advice.It was far from the mildly menacing tone of his social media posts claiming that Greenland will be America's.But which one is the real Donald Trump? Has he heard how badly some of his rhetoric has gone down?As I entered, I was told of an astonishing event last night where Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told the audience that, in terms of Europe's economy, \"you're dead\".There was a walkout. Might there have been one today? He seemed to be trying to avoid that.Live coverageThe Speech goes rather darkAt first, I thought Trump was trying on a diplomatic front, perhaps having heard some of the significant criticism levelled against him and trying to sound mellow.He talked in friendly terms about the western allies that had been most perturbed by his social media posts.He even acknowledged that he probably shouldn't speak about the controversial issue of Greenland - which he has repeatedly vowed to take over.But, almost as though he could not help it, the speech seemed to take a dark turn.First he described America's role helping Greenland in the past, including being friendly to Denmark.But he then insulted Europe's biggest economy, saying everyone in the hall \"would be speaking German\" if it wasn't for the US. And then it came.He announced he was seeking immediate negotiations for the USA to acquire Greenland.A negotiated settlement he said. No force required. But the US needed \"full title\".\"We want this land\" to build the \"greatest Golden Dome ever built\" he said.And he warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about his words a day earlier, though stressing that he would also use Greenland to defend Canada.\"I'm asking for a piece of ice.. it's a very small ask.\"It was incredible to see this said out loud.Mixed reactions in the roomThere was high security, high stakes and high tension in the Alps for the arrival of the would-be sheriff of the world, brandishing his new rules.The reaction in the room ranged.The president's attempts at charm seemed to win him polite applause. But as he went from rigged elections to his annoyance at other leaders' Davos speeches, some sat in disbelief.Even though he promised not to invade Greenland, many were stunned by his attempts to persuade Europe to hand over the territory.Gavin Newsom, the Democrat Governor of California said the speech was TACO Tuesday, a reference to the \"Trump always chickens out\" catchphrase used to mock the president.He argued Trump had backed down after robust pushback from President Macron and Mark CarneyA key Republican senator, Thomas Tillis, said the president's pursuit of Greenland, even a negotiated annexation, would not have the backing of Congress.So while Trump attempted to dial down tensions, he still criticised allies - including personal attacks on leaders.And while he promised not to invade Greenland, he still said it will be part of the new America - and that the world should thank him for it.The speech may have eventually come to an end, but we will be talking about it for a long time to come.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJohn SudworthJerusalemBBC NewsThe Aida Youth Centre's pitch sits next to the barrier separating the occupied West Bank from IsraelIsrael has postponed the demolition of a Palestinian children's football club in the city of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank.It said the Aida Youth Centre's pitch was constructed without the necessary permits. It said the demolition was necessary for security reasons. An international campaign to save it, including a petition with more than half a million signatures, appears to have forced the authorities to reconsider. The club, however, said it had not yet received any official notification.It is barely a 10th of the size of a full-scale football field, there are patches of rust on the goalposts and, towering over the length of one of the touchlines, the architecture of conflict looms large in Israel's concrete security barrier.But while it may not rank high up among the world's iconic sporting venues, this children's football club has found itself at the centre of a hard-fought international campaign for its survival.And despite the asymmetrical odds as it took on the Israeli state, that campaign appears - for now at least - to have worked.The club has won a reprieve against the threat of demolition by the Israeli military, which claimed that the pitch was far too close to the barrier.On the very northern edge of Bethlehem, construction of the pitch began in 2020 with the aim of providing a place to practise football for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp.The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.The notice was followed by a demolition order, issued at the end of December.\"We don't have anywhere else to play, 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.\"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.\"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\"The community fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures as well as the reported interventions of senior officials from some of football's global and regional governing bodies.In its latest statement, the Israeli military repeated its claim that the football pitch, built so close to the wall, posed a security issue.But the BBC understands that a political decision has been made to postpone the demolition order \"for the time being\".Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.It says it is vital for Israel's protection and that it has dramatically cut the number of attacks.Palestinians, however, say that it has become a tool of collective punishment, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.For them, the fight over the football pitch highlights a wider injustice.While they are being denied the right to keep a small sporting facility on the boundary of one of their cities, Israel is approving vast new settlements across the occupied West Bank and which are considered illegal under international law.The immediate threat may now have been averted for the football pitch.But the club is taking nothing for granted.Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me that they feared that the threat might come back when the club is out of the spotlight.\"We're going to continue to campaign,\" he told me.",

    "body": "Photos leaked to BBC show faces of hundreds killed in Iran's brutal protest crackdown14 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,correspondent, BBC Verify,Shayan Sardarizadeh,senior journalist, BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,senior journalistBBCWarning: this story contains graphic content which some readers might find distressingHundreds of photos revealing the faces of those killed during Iran's violent crackdown on anti-government protests have been leaked to BBC Verify.The pictures, which are too graphic to show without blurring, reveal the bloodied, swollen and bruised faces of at least 326 victims - including 18 women. The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.Getty ImagesProtesters on a street in Tehran on 9 January BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as \"seditionists\".Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out.Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify.We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said.Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. Crowds of anti-government protesters in TehranThe slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.",

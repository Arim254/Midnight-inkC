    "body": "Just nowHelen Catt,Political correspondent and Ottilie MitchellThe Home Office has \"squandered\" billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on asylum accommodation, according to a report by a committee of MPs.The Home Affairs Committee said \"flawed contracts\" and \"incompetent delivery\" left the department unable to cope with a surge in demand and it relied on hotels as \"go-to solutions\" instead of temporary stop-gaps.The MPs said expected costs had tripled to more than £15bn and not enough had been done to recoup excess profits.A Home Office spokesperson said the government was \"furious about the number of illegal migrants in this country and in hotels\", and reiterated its pledge to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.Around 32,000 asylum seekers are currently living in 210 hotels whilst their applications are processed, costing the government around £5.5m a day.The report said the current system for housing people seeking asylum - with its reliance on hotels - was expensive, unpopular with local communities and unsuitable for the asylum seekers themselves.The report said the contracts drawn up for accommodation providers under the Conservatives had been flawed and that \"inadequate oversight\" had meant failings went \"unnoticed and unaddressed\".Expected costs for hotel contracts from 2019-2029 have risen from £4.5bn to £15.3bn, while two accommodation providers still owe millions in excess profits that the Home Office has not recovered, the report found.Chair of the committee Dame Karen Bradley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We just ended up with more people than the contracts ever thought there could be and that's meant that the costs have absolutely rocketed.\"\"The government has only just started looking at claiming back those profits, auditing the accounts to see what is due back to the taxpayer,\" Dame Karen said.The said \"failures of leadership at a senior level\" were among reasons the Home Office was \"incapable of getting a grip on the situation\".Dame Karen said the department had \"neglected the day-to-day management of these contracts\" and has focused on \"short term, reactive responses\".\"The skills needed to manage these contracts simply were not present in the Home Office when they were drawn up,\" she added.External factors, including the pandemic and the \"dramatic\" increase in small boat arrivals, have meant the Home Office has had to accommodate \"a growing number of people for longer periods of time\" the report said. Choices made by the previous Conservative government, including to delay asylum decisions as it pursued the scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda, factored into this, MPs added.While the report acknowledged the \"challenging environment\" in which the Home Office was operating, it said \"its chaotic response has demonstrated that it has not been up to the challenge\".The MPs said they had heard too many cases of inadequate asylum accommodation and unaddressed safeguarding concerns for vulnerable people.Housing Secretary Steve Reed accused the previous government of \"pouring taxpayers' money down the drain\".He added that Labour ministers were continuing to look at housing asylum seekers on disused military bases, as they are the \"least expensive option available\", alongside longer-term rental accommodation options.Two former military sites - MDP Wethersfield, a former RAF base in Essex, and Napier Barracks, a former military base in Kent - are already being used to house asylum seekers after being opened under the Conservatives.Dame Karen welcomed the government's pledge to shift away from asylum hotels and invest in larger sites like military bases.But she said past failings, like moving people into accommodation too quickly, must not be repeated.\"On large sites, once the lessons have been learned, facilities are much better, people are in much more suitable accommodation and it can be better for everybody,\" she said.In response to the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"We have already taken action - closing hotels, slashing asylum costs by nearly £1 billion and exploring the use of military bases and disused properties.\"Several protests and counter-protests over asylum hotels have taken place across the UK this year, notably in Epping over the summer after an asylum seeker being housed at The Bell Hotel was charged with two sexual assaults.",

    "body": "Prisons begin extra checks after migrant released in error15 minutes agoTabby WilsonPA MediaExtra checks will be carried out in prisons across England and Wales from Monday after a migrant sex offender was released in error last week.The government has ordered governors to carry out new procedures to avoid a repeat of Hadush Kebatu's mistaken release from HMP Chelmsford on Friday, which led to a manhunt and his eventual arrest in London on Sunday.Justice Secretary David Lammy will face questions on Monday after updating Parliament on an independent inquiry into how Kebatu was set free rather than deported.The extra checks have been criticised by senior prison staff, who told BBC News they will increase workload and put more pressure on a system already struggling to cope.Kebatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area of north London at 08:30 GMT on Sunday, ending a 48-hour manhunt.He was sentenced last month for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in July in Epping, Essex, where he had been living in an asylum hotel since arriving in the UK on a small boat.Kebatu, whose arrest triggered protests, was due to be taken to an immigration detention centre ahead of his planned deportation when he was mistakenly told he could walk free by prison staff on Friday.On Sunday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said an investigation was already under way to \"make sure this doesn't happen again\".Kebatu is due to be deported later this week, Lammy has said.A prison officer at HMP Chelmsford has been suspended from active duties but a senior prison employee told BBC News the release was \"down to a series of mistakes probably because staff are overworked and in short supply\".Watch: Moment Kebatu is arrested in Finsbury ParkA report from His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service said 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 in the previous 12 months.Charlie Taylor, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"something is going badly wrong\" with the prison system, pointing to the rising number of mistaken releases.Asked about the new checklist prison staff will need to follow before releasing an inmate, Mr Taylor said it had not been shared with him in full so he could not say if it was proportionate.But he said inexperienced staff were being left with large caseloads of work due to the high \"churn\" of people coming through the prison system, adding the situation was made more difficult by the implementation of various early release schemes rolled out in recent years.Asked why figures for wrongful releases were rising, Lammy said the Labour government \"inherited a system that was collapsing [from the Conservatives]\".Watch: Kebatu expected to be deported this week, Lammy saysOn Sunday, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the Prison Service was under enormous pressure, but added that \"even against that backdrop it doesn't explain or excuse the release of people on our streets who have no business being there\".Former Conservative Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said an inquiry was necessary in order \"to learn lessons\", and suggested the incident was symptomatic of wider problems with the prison system.He told BBC Breakfast on Sunday: \"The entire annual budget of the Ministry of Justice is spent by the Department for Work and Pensions in two weeks.\"My constant plea is to try to ensure the prison service gets the resources it requires to ensure we are recruiting and retaining people with skills and experience to make sure these problems don't happen.\"The Liberal Democrat MP for Chelmsford, Marie Goldman, said Kebatu \"must now be deported\" and also pushed for a national inquiry.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the incident showed that the UK's \"once-trusted institutions\", including the police and prisons, were \"disintegrating before our eyes\".",

And we hope that it is peacekeeping, because if it's peace enforcing, nobody will want to touch that,\" said King Abdullah.In an exclusive interview for BBC Panorama, he said that Jordan and Egypt were willing to train Palestinian security forces.\"Peacekeeping is that you're sitting there supporting the local police force, the Palestinians, which Jordan and Egypt are willing to train in large numbers, but that takes time. If we're running around Gaza on patrol with weapons, that's not a situation that any country would like to get involved in.\"The King's comments reflect concern from the US and other nations about being dragged into a continuing conflict between Hamas and Israel, or Hamas and other Palestinian groups.King Abdullah said he would not send Jordanian forces into Gaza because his country was \"too close politically\" to the situation. More than half of Jordan's population is of Palestinian descent, and over decades, the country has taken in 2.3 million Palestinian refugees fleeing earlier wars with Israel - the largest number in the region.Asked if he trusted Hamas to keep its promise to give up any political role in Gaza, he replied: \"I don't know them, but those that are working extremely close to them - Qatar and Egypt - feel very, very optimistic that they will abide by that.\"If we don't solve this problem, if we don't find a future for Israelis and Palestinians and a relationship between the Arab and Muslim world and Israel, we're doomed.\"This year, 253 sick and wounded children, including Habiba - whose two arms and leg were amputated - have been evacuated from Gaza to JordanThe main mediation efforts during the war have been carried out by Qatar and Egypt working with the United States.The Jordanians have been part of an international effort trying to deliver aid to Gaza and evacuating sick and wounded children. The King has flown over the territory on three missions parachuting aid supplies.\"Looking over the back ramp was just shocking,\" he said. \"The devastation of that part of Gaza was just a shock to me.\"I've seen it myself, and how we, as the international community, are allowing this to happen is mind-boggling.\"The King asked for President Trump's support to evacuate 2,000 seriously ill Palestinian children from Gaza. In a White House meeting with the Jordanian monarch in February, Trump called it a \"beautiful gesture\".Since then, 253 children have been evacuated to Jordan. In all, more than 5,000 have been medically evacuated, most to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. More than 15,000 Gazans are still awaiting evacuation, including about 3,000 children, according to the World Health Organization.To get children and their guardians out of the territory they must undergo a comprehensive security check by Israel and host countries. The World Health Organization has described the process as \"excruciatingly slow\". The Israeli military group which oversees aid for Gaza - Cogat - insists it places \"great importance\" on facilitating humanitarian aid to Gaza, including the evacuation of patients with \"complex medical conditions\". It stresses the necessity of security checks on individuals travelling through Israeli territory.Queen Rania praised President Trump for pressuring Israel and negotiating a ceasefireIn her interview for Panorama, Jordan's Queen Rania criticised the international community for, as she put it, failing to stop the war for two years.\"You know what it's like to be a parent over the last two years? To watch your children suffering, starving, shaking in terror, and to be powerless to do anything about it, and to know that the whole world is watching and not to do anything about it. That nightmare, it's the nightmare of any parent, but that nightmare has been the daily reality for Palestinians for the last two years.\"The Queen, who is of Palestinian descent, praised President Trump for his efforts to bring about the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. She said he had used America's diplomatic, military and financial support as leverage on Israel.\"To his credit, Trump was the first president in a long time to actually apply pressure on Israel. Beforehand, when they crossed lines, the US president would just maybe just say a few words of rebuke or they just get a slap on the wrist. President Trump actually got [Israeli PM Benjamin] Netanyahu to actually agree to a ceasefire. And I hope that he continues to be engaged in this process.\"Abdelrahman (r) was treated in Jordan after losing his left leg following an Israeli air strikeIsrael repeatedly accused Hamas of prolonging the war with its refusal to release Israeli hostages, and said the organisation - proscribed as a terror group by the UK, US and EU - used civilians as human shields in Gaza. According to the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory, more than 68,000 people have been killed since Israel invaded Gaza.Israel's invasion followed the 7 October attack by Hamas in which more than 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, were killed and 251 taken hostage into Gaza. Since then, arrest warrants for alleged war crimes have been issued by the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as the military commander of Hamas, Mohammed Deif, although Hamas later confirmed he had been killed in an air strike.The signing of the Trump ceasefire agreement also saw the release of 20 living Israeli hostages from Gaza with continuing efforts to recover the remains of the dead. Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis, and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge.When I asked Queen Rania if she believed a lasting peace was possible, she said hope for this was not naive, but a form of defiance.\"I truly believe that Palestinians and Israelis can exist side by side,\" she said. \"In the current atmosphere, there's too much animosity, too much anger and grief and hatred and cynicism between the two peoples to actually forge a peace on their own. I'm not being naive here. But I think with the push of the international community, that is the only way.\"So many times during the past two years, hope had felt elusive. Choosing hope was not easy… it's hard, it's heavy. But it's the only path that doesn't deny Palestinians or betray their struggle or our humanity.\"With additional reporting by Alice Doyard, Suha Kawar, David McIlveen and Liam Connell.",

    "body": "10 hours agoOrla GuerinGoktay Koraltan/BBCWives and children of suspected Islamic State group fighters are detained in tented campsIn the complex mosaic of the new Syria, the old battle against the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) continues in the Kurdish-controlled north-east. It's a conflict that has slipped from the headlines - with bigger wars elsewhere.But Kurdish counter-terrorism officials have told the BBC that IS cells in Syria are regrouping and increasing their attacks.Walid Abdul-Basit Sheikh Mousa was obsessed with motorbikes and finally managed to buy one in January.The 21-year-old only had a few weeks to enjoy it. He was killed in February fighting against IS in north-eastern Syria.Walid was so keen to take on the extremists that he ran away from home, aged 15, to join the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). They brought him back because he was a minor, but accepted him three years later.Generations of his extended family gathered in the yard of their home in the city of Qamishli to tell us about his short life.\"I see him everywhere,\" said his mother, Rojin Mohammed. \"He left me with so many memories. He was very caring and affectionate.\"Walid was one of eight children, and the youngest of the boys. He could always get around his mum.\"When he wanted something, he would come and kiss me,\" she recalls. \"And say 'can you give me money so I can buy cigarettes?'\"The young fighter was killed during days of battle near a strategic dam - his body found by his cousin who searched the front lines. Through tears, his mother calls for revenge against IS.Goktay Koraltan/BBCWalid was killed in February fighting against the Islamic State Group in north-eastern Syria\"They broke our hearts,\" she says. \"We buried so many of our young. May Daesh (IS) be wiped out completely,\" she says. \"I hope not one of them is left.\"Instead, the Islamic State Group is recruiting and reorganising - according to Kurdish officials, taking advantage of a security vacuum after the ousting of Syria's long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad last December.\"There's been a 10-fold increase in their attacks,\" says Siyamend Ali, a spokesman for the People's Protection Units (YPG) - a Kurdish militia, which has been fighting IS for over a decade, and is the backbone of the SDF.Goktay Koraltan/BBC\"I see him everywhere,\" says Walid's mother, Rojin Mohammed\"They benefited from the chaos and got a lot of weapons from warehouses and depots (of the old regime).\"He says the militants have expanded their areas of operation and methods of attack. They have graduated from hit-and-run operations to attacking checkpoints and planting landmines.His office walls are lined with photos of YPG members killed by IS. For the US, the YPG militia is a valued ally in the fight against the extremists. For Turkey, it is a terrorist group.In the past year, 30 YPG fighters have been killed in operations against IS, according to Mr Ali, and 95 IS militants have been captured.Kurdish authorities have their hands - and jails - full with suspected IS fighters. Around 8,000 - from 48 countries including the UK, the US, Russia and Australia - have been held for years in a network of prisons in the north east. Whatever their guilt - or innocence - they have not been tried or convicted.The largest jail for IS suspects is al-Sina in the city of Al Hasakah - ringed by high walls, and watch towers.Through a small hatch in a cell door, we get a glimpse of men who once brought terror to around a third of Syria and Iraq.Detainees in brown uniforms - with shaven heads - sit silent and motionless on thin mattresses, on opposite sides of a cell. They appear thin, weak and vanquished, like the \"caliphate\" they proclaimed in 2014. Prison officials say these men were with IS until its last stand in the Syrian town of Baghouz in March 2019.Goktay Koraltan/BBC Al-Sina, located in the city of Hasaka, is the largest jail for IS suspects Some detainees wear disposable masks to prevent the spread of infection. Tuberculosis is their companion in al-Sina, where they are being held indefinitely.There's no TV or radio, no internet or phone, and no knowledge that Assad was toppled by the former Islamist militant, Ahmed al-Sharaa. At least that's what the prison authorities hope.But IS is rebuilding itself behind bars, according to a prison commander who cannot be identified for security reasons. He says each wing of the prison has an emir, or leader, who issues fatwas - rulings on points of Islamic law. \"The leaders still have influence,\" he said. \"And give orders and Sharia lessons.\"One of the detainees, Hamza Parvez from London, agreed to speak to us with prison guards listening in.The former trainee accountant admits becoming an IS fighter in early 2014 at the age of 21. It cost him his citizenship. When challenged about IS atrocities including beheadings, he says a lot of \"unfortunate\" things happened.\"A lot of stuff happened that I don't agree with,\" he said. \"And there was some stuff that I did agree with. I wasn't in charge. I was a normal soldier.\"He says his life is now at risk. \"I'm on my deathbed... in a room full of tuberculosis,\" he said. \"At any moment I could die.\"Jailed IS fighter Hamza Parvez, from London, has been stripped of his British citizenshipAfter years in jail, Parvez is pleading to be returned to the UK.\"Me and the rest of the British citizens who are here in the prison, we don't wish any harm,\" he said. \"We did what we did, yes. We did come. We did join the Islamic State. It's not something that we can hide.\"I ask how people can accept he is no longer a threat. \"They are going to have to take my word for it,\" he says with a laugh.\"It's something that I can't convince people about. It's a huge risk that they will have to take to bring us back. It's true.\"Britain, like many countries, is in no hurry to do that.So the Kurds are left holding the fighters and about 34,000 of their family members.The wives and children are arbitrarily detained in sprawling desolate tented camps that amount to open-air prisons. Human rights groups say this is collective punishment - a war crime.Roj camp sits on the edge of the Syrian desert - whipped by the wind, and scorched by the sun.It's a place Londoner Mehak Aslam is keen to escape. She comes to meet us in the manager's office - a slight veiled figure, wearing a face mask and walking with a limp. She says she was beaten by Kurdish forces years ago and injured by a fragment of a bullet. After agreeing to an interview, she speaks at length.Goktay Koraltan/BBCKurdish troops patrol the area around the camps where IS detainees are heldAslam says she came to Syria with her Bengali husband, Shahan Chaudhary, just \"to bring aid\", and claims they made a living by \"baking cakes\". He is now in al-Sina prison, and they have both been stripped of their citizenships.The mother-of-four denies joining IS but admits bringing her children to its territory, where her eldest daughter was killed by an explosion.\"I lost her in Baghouz. It was an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] or a small bomb. She broke her leg, and she was pierced with shrapnel from her back. She died in my arms,\" she says, in a low voice.She told me her children had developed health problems in the camp, including her youngest, who is eight. But she admits turning down an offer for them to be returned to the UK. She says they didn't want to go without her.\"Unfortunately, my children have pretty much grown up just in the camp,\" she said. \"They don't know a world outside. Two of my children were born in Syria, they have never seen Britain, and going to family who again they don't know, it would be very difficult. No mother should have to make the choice of being separated from her children.\"But I put it to her that she had made other choices like coming to the caliphate where IS was killing civilians, raping and enslaving Yazidi women, and throwing people from buildings.\"I wasn't aware of the Yazidi thing at the time,\" she said, \"or that people were being thrown from buildings. We did not witness any of that. We knew they were very extreme.\"She said she was at risk inside the camp because it is known that she would like to go back to Britain.\"I have already been targeted as an apostate, and that's in my community. My kids have had rocks thrown at them at school.\"I asked if she would like to see a return of an IS caliphate. \"Sometimes things are distorted,\" she said. \"I don't' believe what we saw was a true representation, Islamically speaking.\"After an hour-long interview, she returned to her tent, with no indication that she would ever leave the camp.The camp manager, Hekmiya Ibrahim, says there are nine British families in Roj - among them 12 children. And, she adds, 75% of those in the camp still cling to the ideology of IS.There are worse places than Roj. The atmosphere is far more tense in al-Hol - a more radicalised camp where about 6,000 foreigners are being held.We were given an armed escort to enter their section of the camp.As we walked in - carefully - the sound of banging echoed through the area. Guards said it was a signal that outsiders had arrived and warned us we might be attacked.Goktay Koraltan/BBCAbout 6,000 foreigners are being held in al-Hol camp Veiled women - clad head to toe in black - soon gathered. One responded to my questions by running a finger across her neck - as if slitting a throat. Several small children raised an index finger - a gesture traditionally associated with Muslim prayer but hijacked by IS. We kept our visit short.The SDF patrol outside the camp and in the surrounding areas. We joined them - bumping along desert tracks. \"Sleeper cells are everywhere,\" said one of the commanders. In recent months, they have been focused on trying to break boys out of the camp, \"trying to free the cubs of the caliphate\", he added. Most attempts are prevented, but not all.A new generation is being raised - inside the razor wire - inheriting the brutal legacy of the IS.\"We are worried about the children,\" said Hekmiya Ibrahim back in Roj camp. \"We feel bad when we see them growing up in this swamp and embracing this ideology.\" Due to their early indoctrination, she believes they will be even more hardline than their fathers.\"They are the seeds for a new version of IS,\" she said. \"Even more powerful than the previous one.\"Additional reporting by Wietske Burema, Goktay Koraltan and Fahad Fattah",

    "body": "Argentina's Milei wins big in midterms with 'chainsaw' austerity3 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentGetty ImagesJavier Milei won nearly 41% of the vote in Argentina's midterm electionsArgentina's president Javier Milei has led his party to a landslide victory in Sunday's midterm elections, after defining the first two years of his presidency with radical spending cuts and free-market reforms.His party, La Libertad Avanza, won nearly 41% of the vote, taking 13 of 24 Senate seats and 64 of the 127 lower-house seats that were contested.His gains will make it much easier for the president to push ahead with his programme to slash state spending and deregulate the economy.Before the vote, Milei's ally Donald Trump made it clear that the US's recently announced $40bn lifeline for Argentina would depend on Milei keeping political momentum.Milei's supporters welcomed that, though critics accused Donald Trump of foreign interference in Argentina's elections.In a nod to his North American ally, Milei told cheering supporters: \"We must consolidate the path of reform we have embarked upon to turn Argentina's history around once and for all… to make Argentina great again.\"Before these elections his party had just seven Senate seats and 37 seats in the lower house.That meant his programme of spending cuts and reforms faced various political obstacles.His vetoes of bills to boost funding for state universities, people with disabilities and children's healthcare were all overturned by opposition lawmakers.After Sunday's result, hundreds of his supporters gathered, cheering, outside a hotel in Buenos Aires where he was watching the result.\"Milei didn't have 15% of Congress in his favour. Now, with many more deputies and senators, he'll be able to change the country in a year,\" one young voter Dionisio said.\"Our province was devastated by previous governments,\" another voter Ezequiel said.\"Now, thank God, freedom has won. We want our daughter to grow up in this beautiful country. What happened in previous years is regrettable.\"Getty ImagesHundreds of Milei's supporters gathered in the streets to celebrate the election resultThese elections were the first national test of President Milei's popularity since he took office in 2023, pledging to shrink state spending by taking a metaphorical \"chainsaw\" to it. He brandished a real one during his campaign rallies.He's since cut budgets for education, pensions, health, infrastructure, and subsidies, and laid off tens of thousands of public sector workers.Supporters, including Trump, hail him for taming inflation - which hit triple figures annually before he took office - cutting the deficit, and restoring investor confidence.His critics, though, argue the price has been job losses, a decline in manufacturing, crumbling public services, a fall in people's purchasing power and an imminent recession.Juliana, who works with children with disabilities in Tucumán province, is concerned that a law to increase funding for people with disabilities - which Milei vetoed, before being overturned - could be \"in danger\" with the president's position strengthened in Congress.\"Our salaries are low, it remains the same, while other things are increasing. We still don't see a change,\" she added.Veronica, a retired police officer, has been hit by Milei's pension cuts.\"You see a lot of poverty,\" she said. \"It's very hard: for retirees, for people with children with disabilities, for young people. There's a lot of unemployment. Many factories have closed.\"Milei has also kept inflation down by propping up the peso, leaving it overvalued and draining reserves ahead of $20bn of debt repayments next year.This had caused alarm that Argentina could be hurtling towards an economic crisis.That, coupled with a poor election result in Buenos Aires province in September, spooked the financial markets that Milei's cost-cutting agenda may not be politically sustainable.Getty ImagesMilei's took office in 2023 with a pledge to shrink state spending by taking a metaphorical \"chainsaw\" to itThese factors prompted the US to step in to help. It has now offered Argentina a potential $40bn lifeline via the combination of a currency swap, buying pesos and arranging private investment.\"If he wins, we're staying with him. If he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Trump had threatened.Before this election, doubts had grown about Milei's political future due to some voters tiring of his austerity programme, as well as a series of corruption scandals that had rocked his party.This election turnout was 67.9%, the lowest in a national election in decades, representing widespread apathy with politicians of all stripes.Some voters backed him reluctantly.\"Milei has two years left and should try to do what he can,\" said Dardo, a business owner in Buenos Aires. \"I think we're on the right path, but the middle and working classes are suffering too much.\"He is sceptical the support from the US will help, saying \"we're going to have to pay for it at some point\".Others, like political science student Thiago, said they understood the need for fiscal balance but questioned Milei's means.\"There's a lack of investment in hospitals, infrastructure, in people with disabilities,\" he said. \"There's a certain false hope.\"This election result, though, shows that many Argentines remain unwilling to return to the Peronist model Milei blames for decades of economic mismanagement. \"Argentines showed that they do not want to return to the failed model, the model of inflation… the model of a useless state,\" he declared.Financial markets are expected to rally after the win: a sign that, for now, Milei's political survival has also kept his economic experiment alive - and US support in place.His new mandate gives him the power to implement more radical changes ahead of the next presidential election in 2027, when his name could be on the ballot once more.The question now is whether ordinary voters start feeling better off, or if the pain of some of his cuts tests people's patience once more.For now, it appears a significant proportion of voters are – once again – prepared to give him time.",

    "body": "Health leaders are warning that NHS services and jobs in England will have to be cut unless up to £3bn more in funding is allocated to cover unexpected costs. The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers, representing trusts and other health organisations, said in a joint statement that the cost of covering redundancies and strikes, along with paying more for medicines, was not included in the budget this year and will need extra cash from the Chancellor.Talks between the Department of Health and the Treasury are ongoing, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has confirmed. Responding to the statement, the Department of Health said the government was committed to \"properly funding\" the NHS.Cuts to NHS services and jobs could mean fewer tests, appointments and operations being carried out. Senior managers say that demands from the government for significant job cuts in regional health boards and NHS trusts have been made without any promise of extra funding to cover at least £1bn of redundancy payments. The merger of NHS England and the Department of Health will also involve staff reductions which have to be paid for.The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers say that the doctors' strike in England in July led to £300m of costs for NHS trusts, including covering rota gaps. The cost is likely to be the same again during the next planned strike in November, they claim. They go on to argue that a likely deal with the United States over higher medicine prices could cost the NHS around £1.5bn. The US administration and major pharmaceutical companies have been pushing the UK government to raise the amount paid for drugs. The drug companies argue that investment in UK research and development of new medicines could be cut if a deal is not agreed.Health leaders have also warned that progress on reducing waiting lists will be affected if there is no Treasury help in making up the financial shortfall. Some argue that uncertainty over redundancy plans is distracting staff and managers from the task of turning round the NHS.Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \"The threat from un-budgeted redundancy payments, higher drug prices and renewed industrial action risks derailing progress on key waiting time targets and the wider reforms that are essential to getting the NHS back on track.\"Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \"Redundancies cost money, making it harder to make long-term savings without government support. \"As the government prepares its Budget it's time for an honest assessment and discussion about what the NHS can really achieve this year in these challenging financial circumstances - and about what is 'doable'' to meet ministers' ambitions in their 10-year plan for health.\"A Department for Health and Social care spokesperson said: \"This government has delivered a record-breaking £29 billion investment in our NHS – including up to £10 billion on digital and technology transformation and £750 million for urgent capital repairs – demonstrating our unwavering commitment to properly funding the health service that we all rely on.\"However investment alone isn't enough - it must go hand in hand with reform. That is why we're doing things differently: not just fixing the NHS but moving it forward through our Plan for Change\"",

    "body": "'No doubt' Trump wants to topple our government, Venezuelan official tells BBC6 hours agoTabby WilsonAFP via Getty ImagesTarek William SaabThere is \"no doubt\" that US president Donald Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government, the country's attorney general has told the BBC.Tarek William Saab, a close ally of President Nicolás Maduro, says Trump wants to turn Venezuela into a \"colony\" of the US.Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that a US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time Trump opponent from power.The US says it has killed at least 43 people in strikes on alleged drug boats off South America, and Trump has said the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".When asked about the possibility of a land invasion of Venezuela, Saab told the BBC's Newshour programme that \"it shouldn't happen, but we are prepared\".He added that Venezuela was \"still ready to resume dialogue\" with the US, despite its \"illegitimate\" fight against drug trafficking.The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.But Saab said the US wanted regime change in Venezuela, accusing it of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.US Congress members on both sides of the political aisle have raised concerns over the legality of Trump's strikes on boats and his authority to order them.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Sunday that future land strikes were a \"real possibility\", and that Trump told him he plans to brief members of Congress on future military operations when he got back from Asia.Over the past two months, the US has been steadily building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking and \"narco-terrorists\".Many analysts believe this is also part of a wider intimidation campaign seeking to remove President Maduro from power.The Venezuelan leader has accused the US of \"fabricating war\" after it also ordered the deployment of the world's largest warship to the Caribbean, the USS Gerald R Ford, which is yet to arrive.On Sunday, guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely arrived in Trinidad and Tobago, a dual-island nation just off Venezuela's coast, as part of the US's largest military deployment to the Caribbean Sea in decades. It is officially visiting until Thursday to conduct joint training and exercises.Venezuela's government has since issued a statement condemning what it called \"a military provocation by Trinidad and Tobago in coordination with the CIA\".Venezuela also claimed that they had captured a \"mercenary group with direct information from the US intelligence agency\", and alleged that a \"false flag attack is underway\" in the waters between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago.A false flag operation is a political or military action carried out with the intention of blaming an opponent for it.Venezuela's President Maduro has made accusations of false flag attacks before, including a plan to plant explosives in the US embassy in Caracas in early October.Additional reporting by Ione Wells",

    "body": "2 hours agoEthirajan Anbarasan,Global Affairs reporter and Koh EweDirect flights between India and China have resumed as relations between the countries appear to be thawing.IndiGo flight 6E 1703 from Kolkata landed in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Monday, carrying about 180 passengers.Flights between the two countries were first suspended during the Covid pandemic in early 2020 and did not restart after a deadly clash in a disputed Himalayan border area escalated tensions.But the two countries have been steadily rebuilding relations, and last year they reached a landmark agreement on border patrols.The Indian government had said the resumption of direct flights would \"facilitate people-to-people contact\" and help \"the gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges\" in a statement announcing the development earlier this month.It is part of a series of developments that indicate a gradual normalisation of ties between the neighbours.In August, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the first time in seven years, meeting President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Earlier that month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had visited India and discussed \"de-escalation, delimitation and boundary affairs\" with officials in Delhi.In July, India had also restarted issuing visas for Chinese tourists.According to travel data provider OAG, the two countries operated around 2,588 scheduled flights in 2019 before services were suspended.At the Kolkata airport on Sunday evening, airline staff lit brass oil lamps to mark  the resumption of direct flights as IndiGo passengers checked in.A senior Chinese consular official, Qin Yong, told reporters at the airport that it was a \"very important day for the India-China relationship\".Passengers expressed happiness that the time taken to reach China would now reduce. Krishna Goyal, who said he was travelling for business to China, told ANI news agency that direct flights would boost trade and relations between the countries.\"Earlier, we had to change two or three flights [to reach China]. We used to go to Singapore from Kolkata and from there to China,\" he said.China Eastern Airlines is set to launch a flight connecting Shanghai and Delhi next month. It will fly three times a week from 9 November, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in India posted on X.Additional reporting by Neyaz Farooquee in Delhi",

    "body": "12 hours agoAndré Rhoden-Paul and Frank Gardner,Security correspondent , Jerusalem EPA/ShutterstockEgyptian equipment crosses into the Gaza StripTeams from Egypt and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have been allowed to search for bodies of deceased hostages taken during the 7 October attacks, Israeli authorities have confirmed.The Israeli government said the teams have been permitted to search beyond the so-called \"yellow line\" in the area controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza.Separately on Sunday, Israeli media reported that Hamas members had also been allowed to enter the IDF-controlled area of Gaza to aid the search, alongside the ICRC teams.Hamas has transferred 15 out of 28 deceased Israeli hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which requires it to hand over all hostage bodies. The group said it is now coordinating with Egyptian authorities.Donald Trump has warned Hamas to start return the bodies \"quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action\".An Israeli spokesperson said the Egyptian team has been permitted to work with the ICRC to locate the bodies, and would use excavator machines and trucks for the search beyond the \"yellow line\". The \"yellow line\" marks the boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza that Israel withdrew to, as part of the first stage of the ceasefire deal.  Until now, Israel has not approved the entry of such teams.Egypt, along with Qatar and Turkey, is a key signatory of the Trump-brokered Gaza peace plan, which was signed in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh earlier this month.The news will be welcomed by relatives, desperate to give them a proper burial. The ICRC has already been heavily involved in the return of hostages. Hamas does not hand over its captives - living or deceased - directly to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but rather to the ICRC, which in turn escorts them through Gaza and hands them on to the IDF. But the arrival of Egyptian excavation teams inside the Gaza Strip is new. Watch: Egyptian machinery claws through sand in Khan Younis as search for hostage bodies continuesAfter more than two years of intense bombardment by Israel, the UN estimates that as much as 84% of the territory has been reduced to rubble.Hamas says it is doing its best to retrieve hostage bodies, but it faces difficulty finding them under rubble of buildings bombed out by the Israeli military in Gaza. It is now coordinating with the Egyptian authorities. On Sunday, an Israeli government spokesperson said that Hamas knew where the bodies were. \"If Hamas made more of an effort, they would be able to retrieve the remains of our hostages,\" the spokesperson said.Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Saturday that action would be taken if the bodies of the deceased hostages were not returned quickly. \"Some of the bodies are hard to reach, but others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not. Perhaps it has do with their disarming,\" he said. Trump added: \"Let's see what they do over the next 48 hours. I am watching this very closely.\"Gaza children dying as they wait for Israel to enable evacuationsRubio says lots of countries willing to join Gaza security forceNew images show Israeli control line deeper into Gaza than expectedOn Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would determine which foreign forces it would allow as part of a planned international force in Gaza to help secure the ceasefire under Trump's plan. \"We are in control of our security, and we have also made it clear regarding international forces that Israel will determine which forces are unacceptable to us, and this is how we operate and will continue to operate,\" he said speaking at the start of a cabinet meeting.On Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"a lot of countries\" had offered to be part of the force - but added Israel would have to be comfortable with participants.This appeared to be a reference to Turkey, amid reports Israel had vetoed the country's involvement. It remained unclear, however, how such a force could be deployed without an understanding with Hamas.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.At least 68,519 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

Philippe said he would take part in the talks, although Bruno Retailleau, from the right-wing Republicans, said he would only meet Lecornu one-to-one.</p><p>\"It's clear we're today in the middle of a political crisis that dismays and worries our fellow citizens,\" Philippe told RTL radio. \"This political crisis is bringing the state into decline... the authority and continuity of the state aren't being respected.\"</p><p>Philippe, whose Horizons party has been part of Macron's government throughout his second presidential term, rejected calls from political opponents for the president's immediate resignation - but said it was up to Macron himself to find a solution.</p><p>\"[Immediate resignation] would have a terrible impact and would prevent a presidential election taking place under good conditions,\" he told RTL on Tuesday.</p><p>However, he argued Macron should avert the crisis by naming a prime minister who could put through a budget, guarantee the continued workings of the state, and leave in an \"orderly and dignified manner\".</p><p>\"When you're head of state, you don't use the institutions, you serve them - and he should serve the institutions by finding a solution to this political crisis.\"</p><p>Macron's poll ratings have nose-dived in recent months and one survey of 1,000 French people conducted for newspaper Le Figaro suggested that 53% of them thought he should stand down.</p><p>Meanwhile, a van burst into flames on the same street as the prime minister's residence on the Rue de Varenne on Tuesday morning, in what commentators suggested was symbolic of the continuing political crisis.</p></div>",

She has taken several unusual moves in her career, most notably switching international allegiance from England – where she was born and who she represented at youth level – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60183943\">to Nigeria,</a> the nation of her paternal grandfather.</p><p>So when her father Tim, who is also her agent, told her of an approach by Al-Ittihad, she decided to give them a chance despite initial misgivings.</p><p>\"I spoke to some teams in the UK, US and Europe, then Dad said there was a team in Saudi Arabia who are interested in you,\" she told BBC Sport.</p><p>\"I was shocked. My initial reaction was 'no', but I wanted to give them a chance.\"</p><p>Plumptre was one of the first international stars to move to the SWPL, which was launched in 2022 as a fully professional competition.</p><p>There are 24 teams in the league pyramid, divided into three leagues of eight, and clubs are allowed to sign up to six foreign players.</p><p>The men's competition, the Saudi Pro League, has gained a reputation for splashing the cash to bring in major global names like Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Karim Benzema.</p><p>Plumptre's representatives declined to comment on her salary and contract at Al-Ittihad, and the player herself said the project was the main draw, rather than money.</p><p>According to the New York Times in 2023, the league is funded by the state's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and carries higher prize money than the WSL while overseas players' salaries range from $60,000-$120,000 (£44,000-£89,000) per year tax-free. In a 2022 survey, the BBC found the average WSL salary was £47,000, although some top players can earn far in excess of this figure.</p><p>\"I had an hour-long call with the coach and two people in the management staff, and I said to Dad, 'I have a really good feeling about this',\" said Plumptre.</p><p>\"We barely even spoke about football, but about ourselves and what we were passionate about.</p><p>\"I'm someone who goes off feeling and intuition. But I wanted to go out and visit - I wanted to see what it was really like.

Not only was she an international player in her prime moving to a league largely unknown to European audiences, but it also caused upset for some in a sport where LGBT people have typicaly been much more welcome than in the male equivalent.</p><p>Yet same-sex relations are illegal in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The nation's presence in women's football remains a controversial topic. Last year more than 100 professional female footballers signed a letter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c39l89dv90zo\">calling on Fifa</a> to end its sponsorship deal with Saudi­ Arabian oil company Aramco, accusing the national authorities of \"brutal human rights violations\".</p><p>Plumptre said she and her team-mates at Leicester were close with the club's LGBT supporters' group, and that she received negative comments following her decision to join Al-Ittihad. Asked about this reaction, it is clear she still feels their impact.</p><p>\"Especially when I moved out here, the reaction was not good at all,\" she said. \"That was difficult.</p><p>\"When I made this move there were people around Leicester - I remember some comments I received - it was like I was not the person they thought I was.</p><p>\"I had deeply hurt them because they feel like I am representing something which makes them not feel valued, and I understand that. I don't really know what to say.</p><p>\"It does not mean I condone certain things, even if the move means I am associated with certain things.\"</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Saudi-life-is-like-a-peace-bubble\"><span>'Saudi life is like a peace bubble'</span></h2><p></p></div><div><p>Like many expats in Saudi Arabia, Plumptre lives in a gated community known as a compound.</p><p>These residential compounds offer a lifestyle more like Western suburban areas and have gyms, pools, restaurants and other amenities in a self-contained area. Some even have unofficial bars which serve alcohol, which is banned in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Plumptre says she feels happier and safer as a woman living in Jeddah than she did in the UK.</p><p>\"I know international players, members of my family and friends who have come out here who genuinely feel safer here and calmer than in the UK,\" she said.</p><p>\"A friend of mine who was out here, we described it as being like a peace bubble.</p><p>\"I'll give an example. I had been to the supermarket and I had all these bags. I live in a compound. I had to take all these bags into the elevator, so I left my car out with the door open, engine on and keys in the car so I could take up my shopping.</p><p>\"In the UK I would never leave my car out with the keys in. Here I have no problem.</p><p>\"Naturally everyone is a bit fearful walking around at night, but I don't have to check my shoulder all the time. I know this is just the perspective of myself, not of everybody who lives here, but with the safety I feel I can't agree with some of the views the Western world have of this place.\"</p><p>As Plumptre says, this is just one perspective on life for a woman in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Some of the most notably unequal practices in the country are no longer in place. Women have been allowed to drive since 2018. A year later those over 21 could apply for a passport.</p><p>But the concept of guardianship, or 'wilaya', is central to Saudi culture. Traditionally every woman has a 'wali', a male guardian who makes decisions on her behalf.</p><p>There has been some reform - women over 21 no longer need approval to access healthcare or education - but reports from organisations such as Amnesty International say this is not always practically implemented and women are still heavily restricted in what they can do, wear and say.</p><p>Asked about how she has been treated since her move, Plumptre says: \"I don't feel threatened at all here.</p><p>\"Men are encouraged to treat women a certain way, and there are consequences if they do not.</p><p>\"Every woman can say there is a level of fear within them if they were to be out walking at night whether in the Saudi or in the UK, but there are levels of fear, and there are lower levels in Saudi based on the way men behave.\"</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id=\"We-dont-have-many-fans\"><span>'We don't have many fans'</span></h2><p></p></div><div><p>While the SWPL is not as star-studded as the men's Pro League, there are several major names who feature alongside Plumptre.</p><p>Two-time Women's Champions League winner Asisat Oshoala joined Al-Hilal this year, while France internationals Kheira Hamraoui and Amel Majri play in the SWPL.</p><p>And they get star treatment, including flights to games to avoid long travel times around such a big country.</p><p>But there are several obvious issues in the SWPL. One is the disparity in skill between the internationals and homegrown players. Another is the lack of fans at many of the games.</p><p>Plumptre admits there is plenty of catching up to do.</p><p>\"It's not something I will ever hide away from - the standard is not what I'm used to in the WSL or at international level, and I worried how that would impact myself and my development,\" she said.</p><p>\"One of my club and international team-mates, Francisca Ordega, said in Saudi we must do more. The pace is not as fast, so you must think in different ways, and push yourselves beyond boundaries that you didn't before. There is more responsibility on you.\"</p><p>Facilities, Plumptre says, are good for players. Al-Ittihad is not just a football club, but also has teams in swimming, volleyball and basketball, and Plumptre says they have adapted to the arrival of women's football since 2023, although the state-of-the-art facilities do go to the men.</p><p>Unlike in the WSL, the squad train in the evening when temperatures are cooler - something Plumptre prefers as it reminds her of training after school while at Leicester academy, as well as leaving her days free.</p><p>\"When I first came here, we were using the same gym the volleyball and basketball teams use,\" she said.</p><p>\"Now we are in the old men's gym. The men's team have a new facility. We have a medical clinic, access to ice baths, our own locker room. We train on the main field, separate to the men. When I got here the field was not great at all, so we pushed on that and people listened.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Low crowds in the Saudi Women's Premier League\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/17c4/live/72bc78f0-9f80-11f0-8978-23dd7eb26e73.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Low crowds are commonplace in the SWPL</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The biggest problem is attendances. Other than Al-Ula, every SWPL team play in a stadium with a capacity less than 15,000, and crowds are sparse.</p><p>\"We don't have many fans,\" Plumptre says.</p><p>She puts this down to an absence of community initiatives in Saudi Arabia to get children attending games with their families and giving out free tickets in schools. This has played a huge part in the WSL growing attendances and fanbases among children and families, and Plumptre says this is being worked on by Saudi clubs.</p><p>Matches are available to watch on TV in the Middle East on the Saudi Sports Company network and the Shahid streaming platform. Saudi-backed DAZN has the broadcast rights in Europe.</p><p>As for Saudi Arabian women's football on a global stage, there is plenty of work to be done. Hosting the men's World Cup in 2034 and Aramco's partnership with Fifa has led to speculation about a bid for the Women's World Cup soon.</p><p>Plumptre, however, feels the aims need to be more realistic.</p><p>\"In the near future I would say 'no' [to Saudi hosting a Women's World Cup], because everything takes time,\" she said.</p><p>\"I really care about helping these Saudi players develop and I don't want things to happen too soon.

If you put the Saudi team on a stage they are not ready for, it is unfair for them and women's football.\"</p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Ellen White, Jen Beattie and Ben Haines\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1920/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/09fe/live/05582b40-889e-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span></p></figure></div><div><p><i><b>Ben Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

Devoret and John M. Martinis for their work on quantum mechanics that is paving the way for a new generation of very powerful computers.</p><p>\"There is no advanced technology used today that does not rely on quantum mechanics, including mobile phones, cameras... and fibre optic cables,\" said the Nobel committee.</p><p>The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>\"To put it mildly, it was a surprise of my life,\" said Professor John Clarke, who was born in Cambridge, UK and now works at the University of California in Berkeley.</p></div><div><p>Michel H. Devoret was born in Paris, France and is a professor at Yale University while John M. Martinis is a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p>The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000).</p><p>The Nobel committee recognised breakthrough work performed by the three men in a series of experiments in the 1980s on electrical circuits.</p><p>In the words of the committee, \"the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit\".</p><p>Even for a field often considered dense, this discovery sounds bewildering.</p></div><div><p>But its implications have been profound and far-reaching. The electronic devices that most of us use rely on it, and the findings are being used to build extremely powerful computers.</p><p>\"This is something that leads to development of the quantum computer. Many people are working on quantum computing, our discovery is in many ways the basis of this,\" said Prof Clarke on the phone to the news conference moments after he was told he had won.</p><p>He appeared mystified that his work completed forty years ago is worthy of science's most prestigious prize.</p><p>\"I'm completely stunned. At the time we did not realise in any way that this might be the basis for a Nobel prize,\" he said.</p><p>Quantum mechanics relates to the behaviour of tiny things in a tiny world. It refers to what particles like the electron do in the sub-atomic world.</p><p>Professor Clarke and his team looked at how these particles appeared to break rules like travelling through energy barriers that conventional physics said was impossible - something called \"tunnelling\". </p><p>Using quantum \"tunnelling\", the electron manages to burrow through the energy barrier.</p><p>Their work demonstrated that tunnelling can be reproduced not only in the quantum world, but also in electrical circuits in the 'real world'.</p><p>This knowledge has been harnessed by scientists in making modern quantum chips.</p><p>\"This is wonderful news indeed, and very well deserved,\" said Professor Lesley Cohen, Associate Provost in the Department of Physics at Imperial College London.</p><p>\"Their work has laid the foundations for superconducting Qubits - one of the main hardware technologies for quantum technologies.\"</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>2 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Brian Wheeler</span><span>Political reporter</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The image of Nigel Farage has loomed over this party conference season, as the established parties scramble to come up with a response to the rapid rise of Reform UK.</p><p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats launched all-out attacks on Farage, portraying him as a threat to the very fabric of British society.</p><p>But here at the Conservative Party conference, the attacks have, in general, been more muted. Reform is not just an electoral menace to the Conservatives, but an existential one.</p><p>The party is leaking members, elected officials, and influence to Reform. In the past few hours, Farage's party has unveiled a further 20 Tory defectors on local councils.</p><p>The Tory leadership's strategy for dealing with this is to portray Farage as someone who does not have serious answers to the country's problems, who will say anything to get votes - including posing as a left-winger when it suits him.</p><p>At an event on Sunday evening, Shadow Housing Secretary James Cleverly branded Farage a \"socialist\" - the worst insult in the Tory lexicon.</p><p>The audience dutifully booed at the mention of the Reform UK leader's name but speaking to Tory members afterwards, it was clear many feel uncomfortable about these kind of attacks.</p><p>They view Farage as one of their own - a Tory at heart, who should be welcomed back into the Tory fold, rather than vilified. </p><p>Reform supporters are their friends and, in an increasing number of cases, former colleagues. They want to \"unite the right\" ahead of the next general election.</p><p>The fact that Farage has ruled out any kind of deal with the Conservatives is met with bewilderment. Equally, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has also ruled out a deal with Reform.</p></div><div><p>At a fringe meeting on Monday, former Brexit minister Lord Frost gave a brutal assessment of the Conservatives' prospects under its current leader.</p><p>\"I think the mood of this conference so far is far too positive. And I  think we have to be honest about the situation we find ourselves in,\" he told a tent packed with Tory activists.</p><p>The party had lost 10 million votes between the 2019 general election and 2024 and its dire opinion poll ratings appeared to be in free fall, he told them.</p><p>\"Everything is getting worse and it has done so consistently since November last year.</p><p>\"We were on 25% of the vote then, we are on 16% of the vote now.</p><p>\"So no prescription for the party works unless we accept that the situation is really bad and we are on the edge of ceasing to exist as a mainstream party.\"</p><p>He did not mention Badenoch by name but criticised the \"torpor\" of the party over the past year, since she became leader, which he said had made it more difficult to \"recreate a proper, strong Conservative Party\".</p><p>\"We need to stop rubbishing Reform or at least stop rubbishing people who vote for Reform,\" he said to cheers from Tory activists.</p><p>\"We look to the country like we've got some sort of right to votes. We look entitled.\"</p><p>Frost said the answer was a shift to the right on policy and a clearer definition of what the Tory party stands for, with no place in it for those who did not agree.</p><p>Frost's gloomy prognosis is not shared by other senior Tory figures, in public at least.</p><p>Former Brexit Secretary David Davis joked this week that Nigel Farage asks him to defect to Reform UK every time he sees him.</p><p>\"Oh, every time I see him and Lee Anderson. I mean, 'the doors always open, David', and because it's a daytime programme I won't say what I said,\" he told BBC Radio 5's Matt Chorley.</p><p>At a fringe meeting on Monday, Davis said he believed Kemi Badenoch was \"on the right lines\" and the party could win the next election.</p><p>He argued that the UK was on the brink of a financial crisis \"because there is no way out of the current financial circumstance that is available to the Labour Party\".</p><p>And this, he argued, will present \"enormous opportunities\" for the Conservatives, who he said are prepared to make the \"tough decisions\" needed to get the country's finances back on track. </p><p>Just as the run up to the 1979 general election was overshadowed by economic turmoil and decline, so it will be in 2029, claimed the veteran Tory MP. </p><p>\"As the only person here who actually served under Margaret Thatcher,\" he told the packed fringe meeting. </p><p>\"I can tell you that in the late 70s, she was being talked down too. </p><p>\"For precisely the same reasons. A bit too tough, a bit too hard edged, a bit too dangerous... but then we had a crisis and, suddenly, Thatcher was the right answer. </p><p>\"If we have another crisis, then Badenoch will be the right answer too.\"</p><p>It's not a message the Tory leader is likely to repeat in her conference speech on Wednesday - but how she calibrates her response to the threat of Farage and Reform will have a major bearing on whether she will survive long enough to test the theory out.</p></div>",

Those troops also can be deployed abroad, and some units specialise in fighting wildfires or securing the US border.</p><p>Though the National Guard ultimately reports to the Department of Defence, and the president can federalise troops in certain circumstances, requests for its support typically start at a local level. </p><p>The governor of a state makes the call to activate National Guard troops during an emergency, and can request additional help from the president or other states.</p><p>National Guard troops have limited power, however. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches. And a law called the Posse Comitatus Act limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p></div><p></p><h2>How is Trump trying to use the National Guard in cities?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump has tried to circumvent the normal process for deploying the National Guard several times now.</p><p>In June, he took control of the California National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, even though California Governor Gavin Newsom objected. California filed two lawsuits against the Trump administration.</p><p>One lawsuit challenged Trump's seizure of the National Guard, but an appeals court ultimately ruled in favour of the president. In a second lawsuit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ylyd9lkkqo\">a federal judge found </a>that Trump's use of the National Guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p><p>This summer, hundreds of National Guard troops arrived in Washington, DC because of what he called a \"situation of complete and total lawlessness.\" Trump cited homelessness and crime rates as justification.</p><p>Trump has now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">authorised the deployment of 300 National Guard to Chicago </a>following immigration protests, particularly outside detention facilities. Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, alleged Trump is trying to \"manufacture a crisis\" and has filed a lawsuit.</p><p>This week, Trump attempted to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, before a federal judge temporarily blocked the action late Sunday night.</p></div><p></p><h2>What legal basis does Trump use to deploy the National Guard?</h2><p></p><div><p>A little-known provision of US military law governs the president's authority to deploy the National Guard on his own. But up until now, presidents rarely used it.</p><p>10 US Code § 12406 allows the president to call National Guard troops from any state into service if the US is \"invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,\" or \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the US government.</p><p>Trump invoked this law to federalise 2,000 National Guard troops in June in order to support ICE missions.</p><p>Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also cited the law in a memo deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service on 28 September.</p><p>\"We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on 6 October. \"And we're very confident we will win on the merits of the law.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>Why does Trump want to use the National Guard in Portland?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump is again seeking to use the National Guard to respond to demonstrations, after protests near an ICE building in Portland over the weekend. </p><p>Federal officers, including with the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol agency, clashed with demonstrators who opposed Trump's mass deportation initiative.</p><p>The Portland Police Bureau said it arrested two people on 4 October who engaged \"in aggressive behaviour toward each other in the street\" and refused to follow orders. One person was in possession of bear spray and a collapsable baton.</p><p>Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that federal law enforcement fired tear gas and smoke canisters to break up the protest and made several arrests.</p><p>Trump has claimed the city is \"burning down,\" but Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said \"there is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has moved to send 200 California National Guard troops to neighboring Oregon to respond to the protests.</p><p>But US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, has temporarily blocked his action in a pair of back-to-back rulings.</p><p>On Saturday, Judge Immergut blocked Trump from federalising the Oregon National Guard. \"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" she wrote in her ruling.</p><p>The next day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c740elm70z7o\">she issued a temporary restraining order</a> against him deploying California's National Guard in Portland instead. </p><p>The Trump administration is expected to appeal.</p></div></article>",

reporter</span></p></span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The shadow justice secretary held up a wig as he spoke to conference delegates in Manchester</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Robert Jenrick has hit out at \"activist\" judges, as he set out Conservative plans to hand ministers a bigger role in filling judicial vacancies.</p><p>In his party conference speech, the shadow justice secretary claimed judges with links to pro-migrant charities had undermined public trust in the courts.</p><p>He pledged that if the Tories win the next election, they would reverse Blair-era changes that restricted ministerial involvement in judicial appointments.</p><p>Wielding a judge's wig as a prop, he promised the move would stop judges \"who blur the line between adjudication and activism\".</p></div><div><p>In an address that strayed outside his policy brief, Jenrick, who stood for leadership of the party last year and who continues to attract speculation about his ambitions, hit out at Labour's record in areas including climate targets and the economy.</p><p>In a traditional conference dig at his Labour opposite number, he poked fun at various incorrect answers given by Justice Secretary David Lammy during his 2009 appearance on Celebrity Mastermind.</p><p>But he also took aim at Sir Keir Starmer, telling delegates the prime minister was combining the leadership style of fictional office manger David Brent with the \"administrative grip of Blackadder's Baldrick\", and joked that that former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss, who was in office for just 49 days, would need \"paying by the minute\" to be in the Big Brother house.</p></div><div><p>In recent months, Jenrick has become increasingly critical of court rulings in immigration cases, particularly appeals against failed asylum applications.</p><p>In his address in Manchester, he told party activists he had found \"dozens of judges\" who had \"broadcast their open borders views\" on social media, or \"spent their whole careers fighting to keep illegal migrants in this country\".</p><p>He did not name anyone, but added that they dishonoured \"generations of independent jurists who came before them, as well as the \"vast majority\" of judges, who \"respect and revere\" the wig as a symbol of their role as an \"unbiased mediator\".</p><p>\"The public rightly ask: how independent are they?\" he added.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Proper role'</h2><p></p><div><p>Jenrick announced that if elected, the Conservatives would abolish the Judicial Appoints Commission, a body set up by New Labour in 2006 in a bid to boost the transparency and independence of judicial appointments.</p><p>Establishing the commission significantly curbed the role of the justice secretary in appointing judges in England and Wales, handing them a limited veto over nominees put forward by the commission.</p><p>Further changes under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition stripped them of their power to reject nominees for courts below the High Court.</p><p>Abolishing the commission, Jenrick argued, would \"restore the proper role of our judiciary, putting ultimate power back where it belongs, in the hands of Parliament, and ministers\".</p><p>He added that the the role of appointing judges would return to the justice secretary, a cabinet minister, who would be \"instructed to never permit activists of any political hue to don the wig, ever again\".</p><p>The party says it would also require judges to to publicly register their \"charitable affiliations,\" and give extra powers to the watchdog responsible for investigating professional behaviour among judges. </p><p>It has also announced plans to abolish another Blair-era body, the Sentencing Council, which issues sentencing guidelines to judges in England and Wales.</p><p>It follows a \"two-tier\" justice row earlier this year over guidance on pre-sentence reports for offenders from certain minority groups.</p><p>In response to that row, the Labour government said last month it would stop the Sentencing Council issuing new guidelines without the explicit approval of the justice secretary. </p><p>But Jenrick argued that the body was \"not fit for purpose, so it must be abolished altogether\". </p></div><div><p>Jenrick's speech comes on the third day of the party's conference in Manchester, where the Conservatives have faced questions about their flagging poll ratings and their direction of travel under the leadership of Kemi Badenoch.</p><p>Speaking to the BBC, Badenoch insisted her approach to changing the party would \"pay off eventually\".</p><p>At a conference event on Monday, Jenrick said there was not a leadership vacancy and he did not expect there to be.</p><p>\"My expectation is that Kemi will lead this party into the next general election,\" Jenrick said.</p></div></article>",

Because he's set out intentionally to draw on a particular issue - people's colour - to identify the point he wanted to make.\"</p><p>He added: \"It shows a lack of respect and understanding for those communities. </p><p>\"And I doubt whether or not if he went to a largely white community anywhere in the West Midlands he'd be making a comment similar to what he made about Handsworth.\" </p><p>Labour's Turley said: \"This weekend Kemi Badenoch said she stood against a politics that 'reduces people to categories and then pits them against each other'.</p><p>\"Robert Jenrick in his leaked comments reduces people to the colour of their skin and judges his own level of comfort by whether there are other white faces around. </p><p>\"His comments clearly cross a red line that his leader has rightly laid down.</p><p>\"People of colour should not have to justify their Englishness, or their Britishness, or their presence in this country, to Robert Jenrick or anyone else.</p><p>\"Robert Jenrick needs to urgently explain himself and why these comments are in any way compatible with what his party leader said.\"</p><p>Asked if the number of white people seen in an area is the right measure for integration on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Badenoch said: \"The right measure for integration is that people don't care what people look like.\"</p><p>She added: \"We are a multiracial country.

Hundreds of thousands of reservists in the armed forces, the IDF, want to get back to their lives after many months in uniform on active service. </p><p>More than two million Palestinians in Gaza are in a humanitarian catastrophe, caught between the firepower of the IDF and hunger and in some areas a man-made famine created by Israel's restrictions on aid entering the Strip.</p><p>The version of Hamas that was able to attack Israel with devastating force two years ago has long since been broken as a coherent military organisation. It has become an urban guerrilla force mounting an insurgency against the IDF in the ruins.</p><p>Hamas wants to find a way to survive, even though it has agreed to give up power to Palestinian technocrats. It accepts it will have to have to hand over or dismantle what is left of its heavy weapons, but it wants to keep enough firepower to defend itself against Palestinians who want to take their revenge for nearly two decades of brutal rule and the catastrophe the Hamas attacks brought down on them. </p><p>It is not saying so publicly, but an organisation that still has followers and a charter that seeks to destroy Israel will also want to emerge with enough left to rebuild its capacity to live up to its name, which is an acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement.</p><p>Israel would like to be dictating the terms of a Hamas surrender. But the fact that Hamas has a chance for a serious negotiation opens up more possibilities for it than looked likely just a month ago. That was when Israel tried and failed to kill the Hamas leadership in a series of strikes on a building in Doha where they were discussing peace proposals from Donald Trump. Their main target, the senior leader Khalil al-Hayya, is leading the Hamas delegation at the talks in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Al-Hayya's son was among the dead, though the leaders escaped with their lives.</p><p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a different kind of survival in mind. He wants to preserve his power, keep on postponing his trial for corruption, win elections due next year, and not to go down in history as the leader responsible for security blunders that led to the deadliest day for Jews since the Nazi holocaust.</p><p>To achieve that he needs a credible way to declare \"total victory\", a phrase he has used repeatedly. He has defined it as the return of the hostages, the destruction of Hamas and the demilitarisation of Gaza. If he cannot to do that, it will not be enough for him to point to the very real damage Israel has inflicted on its enemies in Lebanon and Iran in the last two years.</p><p>Hamas and Israeli negotiators will not meet face to face. Egyptian and Qatari officials will be the intermediaries, and the Americans who will also be there will be a major influence, perhaps a decisive one.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Hostages could be freed 'very soon', says Trump</figcaption><p></p><div><p>The basis for the talks is Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan. What it will not do, despite his insistent social media postings about permanent peace, is end the long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. It does not mention the future of the West Bank, the other part of the territories the UK and others have recognised as the state of Palestine.</p><p>The stakes are high in Sharm el-Sheikh. There is a chance to get to a ceasefire that could lead to the end of the most destructive and bloody war in well over a century of conflict between Arabs and Jews.</p><p>The first challenge is to work out conditions for the release of the Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians serving life sentences in Israeli jails and Gazans who have been detained without trial since the war started. That is not a simple task.</p><p>President Trump wants results, fast. He wants to revive his ambition to broker a grand bargain in the Middle East, at the centre of which would be a rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia. That cannot happen when Israel is killing huge numbers of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and imposing restrictions on humanitarian aid that are causing great suffering, and when Hamas is holding Israeli hostages. The Saudis have also made it very clear in a series of public statements that it also cannot happen without a clear and irreversible path to an independent Palestinian state.</p><p>Trump forced Netanyahu to sign up to a document that includes an admittedly vague and indeterminate reference to the possibility of Palestinian independence. In a statement afterwards Netanyahu chose to ignore that by repeating his pledge that Palestinians would never get a state. There is a lot in the Trump document that Israel wants in terms of ending the power of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza. </p><p>But Netanyahu has been used to getting his own way in the Oval Office. Instead, Trump forced him to read out a formal apology to Qatar's prime minister for the air strike that failed to wipe out the Hamas leadership. Trump needs Qatar on board to move ahead with his ambitions to remake the Middle East.</p><p>One question is why Hamas is prepared to give up the hostages without a strict timetable for Israel to leave Gaza and end the war. One possibility is that the Qataris have persuaded them that Trump will make sure that happens if they give him the chance to claim victory by repatriating all Israel's hostages, living and dead.</p><p>Even so Trump is still using language that Netanyahu needs Israelis to hear, like his threat to Hamas if they rejected the deal, promising \"my full backing\" for Israel to go ahead to destroy Hamas.</p><p>The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said it will take only a few days to work out if Hamas is serious. It will take longer to thrash out the nuts and bolts that would need to underpin a complex agreement. So far all they have is Trump's framework.</p><p>Two years after the long and unresolved conflict between Israelis and Palestinians exploded into the Gaza war it is a major challenge to end the killing and secure the immediate future for Palestinians and Israelis. It will take skilful diplomacy and prolonged engagement with detail, of which there is precious little in the Trump 20-point plan. Trying to find precise language that will fill in the gaps will provide plenty of potential stumbling blocks.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5110/live/2a6ab7f0-a355-11f0-b851-f9c6d6c288f7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5110/live/2a6ab7f0-a355-11f0-b851-f9c6d6c288f7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5110/live/2a6ab7f0-a355-11f0-b851-f9c6d6c288f7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5110/live/2a6ab7f0-a355-11f0-b851-f9c6d6c288f7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5110/live/2a6ab7f0-a355-11f0-b851-f9c6d6c288f7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5110/live/2a6ab7f0-a355-11f0-b851-f9c6d6c288f7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5110/live/2a6ab7f0-a355-11f0-b851-f9c6d6c288f7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5110/live/2a6ab7f0-a355-11f0-b851-f9c6d6c288f7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images An Israeli army soldier stands before the memorial of a victim of the 2023 October 7 attacks at the Nova Festival grounds\" /><span>AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Hamas's 7 October attacks killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>No one has a higher opinion than Trump himself of his ability to make deals. In foreign policy, the delivery so far has not matched his boasts. He hasn't settled a slew of wars; the exact count of how many he claims to have ended varies depending how he tells it. Most notoriously Trump did not end the Russia-Ukraine war within a single day of taking office, as he had predicted.  But one skill Trump does have, after a lifetime in real estate, is an innate instinct about how to apply pressure to get what he wants.</p><p>The indirect talks in Egypt are happening because Donald Trump was able to put pressure on both sides. Threatening Hamas with extinction if they refused to engage with his plan was the easy part. US presidents have led international pressure on Hamas since the group won a Palestinian election in 2006 and used force to take over Gaza from its Palestinian rivals Fatah the following year.</p><p>A big difference between Donald Trump and Presidents Clinton, Obama and Biden is that he is hitting back harder and more decisively at Benjamin Netanyahu's attempts to manipulate him than his Democratic predecessors were either willing or able to do.</p><p>Trump took Hamas's qualified \"yes but\" to his proposal as a solid yes for peace. It was enough for him to charge ahead. The news service Axios reported that when Netanyahu tried to persuade him that Hamas was playing for time Trump's response was \"why are you so f***ing negative\".</p><p>Israel is dependent on the United States. The US has been a full partner in the war. Without American help Israel could not have attacked Gaza with such ruthless and prolonged force. Most of its weapons are supplied by the US, which also provides political and diplomatic protection, vetoing multiple resolutions in the UN Security Council that were intended to pressure Israel to stop.</p><p>Joe Biden, who called himself an Irish Zionist, never used the leverage that comes from Israel's dependence on the US. Donald Trump puts his plans for America first, and used America's latent power over Israel to get Netanyahu to bend to his will, at least when it came to joining the talks. It remains to be seen whether that pressure continues. Trump changes his mind.</p><p>Both the Hamas and Israeli delegations have powerful critics at home who want the war to continue. Hamas sources told the BBC that the military commanders still in Gaza were prepared to fight it out until the end and take as many Israelis as possible with them. Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition relies on the support of ultra nationalist extremists who thought they were close to their dream of expelling Gaza's Palestinians and replacing them with Jewish settlers. </p><p>If the talks in Egypt fail, both endgames become possible.</p></div></article>",

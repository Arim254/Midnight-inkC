    "body": "1 hour agoSimon Jack,BBC Business EditorandLucy Hooker,Business reporterA climbdown on forthcoming increases to the business rates bills faced by pubs in England is set to be announced by the government in the next few days.The government is expected to say it will make changes to how pubs' business rates are calculated, resulting in smaller rises to bills.Treasury officials say they have recognised the financial difficulties facing many pubs after sharp rises in the rateable value of their premises.The move follows pressure from landlords and industry groups that included more than 1,000 pubs banning Labour MPs from their premises.The Treasury is also thought to be ready to relax licensing rules to allow longer opening and more pavement areas for drinking.At the moment it is unclear if the changes will apply to just pubs, or extend to other hospitality businesses - such as cafes and restaurants - as trade groups have called for. In her November Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves scaled back business rate discounts that have been in force since the pandemic from 75% to 40% - and announced that there would be no discount at all from April.That, combined with big upward adjustments to rateable values of pub premises, left landlords with the prospect of much higher rates bills.A campaign to dilute the impact of these rises has been gaining traction in recent weeks, with pub owners and industry groups lobbying for more support.On Wednesday Labour MPs called on the government to rethink its support for the industry.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, writing in The Telegraph, said she would abolish business rates for thousands of pubs altogether accusing the government of treating them \"like cash cows to milk\".To calculate a pub's business rate bill the rateable value of its premises is multiplied by a set figure: \"the multiplier\".The government had already offered some relief by reducing the multiplier for pubs, and may be about to reduce it further.Alternatively they could boost the £4.3bn \"transitional relief\" fund brought in to ease the impact of withdrawing support following the pandemic.Industry groups welcomed news there would be additional support.Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said it was \"potentially a huge win\" for the sector.\"This could save locals, jobs, and means publicans can breathe a huge sigh of relief,\" she said.Kate Nicholls, chair of UK Hospitality, representing the industry, said the support should apply not just to pubs, but to all hospitality businesses affected by rising rates, including cafes and restaurants.\"We need a hospitality-wide solution, which is why the government should implement the maximum possible 20p discount to the multiplier for all hospitality properties,\" she said.Unpicking the recent Budget would be seen by many as another U-turn following climbdowns on winter fuel payments, disability benefits and inheritance tax on farms and family businesses.Shadow business and trade secretary Andrew Griffith said the change showed Rachel Reeves' Budget was \"falling apart\".\"Labour were wrong to attack pubs and now have been forced into another screeching U-turn,\" he said.Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: \"This is literally the last chance saloon for our treasured pubs and high streets - so the government must U-turn, today.\"These businesses are worried sick, making decisions now, and can't wait a minute longer.\"The calculation of business rates is an issue that is devolved in all four UK nations.The discount on rates during the pandemic only applied to hospitality businesses in England.Scottish businesses are waiting for the Budget there next week to hear how the  Edinburgh government will approach the issue.Pubs there will hope the Scottish government follows the UK government in offering some relief.",

    "body": "Nasa considers whether to bring sick crew member back to Earth3 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentNASAFront row, from left: Pilot Mike Fincke and Commander Zena Cardman. Back from left: Mission Specialists Oleg Platonov and Kimiya Yui of the Japanese space agency JAXANasa is considering an early return of some crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS) because of a medical issue involving one member of a four-strong team.The unnamed crew member is described as stable, but the incident has already led to the last-minute cancellation of a spacewalk.Mission managers are now weighing whether the safest option is to bring the entire Crew 11 team back to Earth months ahead of schedule. Three members of another crew would remain on board.\"Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew 11's mission,\" said a Nasa spokeswoman.On Wednesday Nasa abruptly cancelled a spacewalk due for Thursday when two astronauts were set to step outside the ISS and announced that it was because one of the crew was unwell.\"The agency is monitoring a medical concern with a crew member that arose Wednesday afternoon aboard the orbital complex.\"Due to medical privacy, it is not appropriate for Nasa to share more details about the crew member,\" the space agency said.Nasa is likely to be determining whether the astronaut can safely remain in orbit or should come home early with their crewmates.\"Our top priority is the safe execution of our missions, and we are thoroughly assessing all possibilities, including the option of concluding Crew 11's mission ahead of schedule,\" the spokeswoman added.The four person Crew-11 team consists of Nasa astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui from the JAXA space agency, and a Russian cosmonaut, Oleg Platonov. They launched to the ISS in August 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon and were expected to remain in orbit for about six months and return around late February 2026, after being replaced by another four person crew a few days earlier. If Crew 11 leave together, the other crew on board would remain: Nasa astronaut Chris Williams and two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Kud Sverchkov and Sergei Mikayev.NASAThe ISS orbits Earth at an average height of about 400 km (250 miles) above the surface. The trip back to Earth typically takes around 12–20 hours from undocking to splashdownIf the mission were to end early all four astronauts on Crew-11 would be brought home, according to Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University.\"They would all come back together as a team, because, you don't want to leave one or more team member behind.\"The ISS has basic medical equipment, supplies and communication systems that let doctors on Earth talk privately with astronauts in space, assess their condition and advise treatment, much like a secure video or phone consultation with a GP.Returning the four-person crew early would delay some experiments and maintenance tasks until the new crew arrive, according to Barber.\"The space station is a big, complex feat of engineering, it's designed to be operated by a certain minimum level of crew,\" he said.\"If Crew-11 were to return early, what the remaining crew would have to do is dial back on some of the more experimental work and focus more just on the housekeeping and keeping the station healthy, waiting for the full complement of crew to be restored.\"",

    "body": "41 minutes agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterThe boss of Greggs said there was \"no doubt\" hugely popular appetite suppressing drugs have led to people looking for \"smaller portions\", affecting the businesses' bottom line.People are also looking for \"protein and fibre\", and generally healthier options, Roisin Currie said, adding the bakery has been introducing products to tap into that market.Greggs has previously said peoples' dietary changes led it to move away from its usual fare of hearty and high-fat pasties, cakes and pastries.Currie's comments come as the firm reported lacklustre profits and a muted forecast for the coming year.Currie said there was a \"broader health trend\" emerging with people demanding more protein.The bakery chain said in July it would target customers on weight loss drugs by rolling out smaller portions and protein-rich products, after which it launched its egg-pot alongside its popular \"eggs at Greggs\" ad campaign.Currie said the firm had \"to make sure that we've got some of the snack products that customers are looking for if they are on any of the GLP-1 drugs\".Several firms have said customers appetites are changing as a result of weight loss drugs.Tesco said on Thursday a trend towards healthier eating had contributed to growth in its fresh produce sales.Chief executive Ken Murphy said the group was watching customer habits \"very closely\" alongside the rise in weight loss medication and said the supermarket had a range of \"GLP-1 friendly\" products.\"Clearly our strongest source of growth this year has been in fresh food, and that is, by far and away, the best thing people can eat,\" he said. \"We also have a ... range of high protein products across a number of different categories that also work very well in that context. So I think we're well set to respond to any trends in healthier eating.\"Consumer analyst Clive Black, from Shore Capital, said the slight dip in the volume of groceries sold over Christmas compared with the year before was \"perhaps the clearest indication of the impact of glucagon-peptide (GLP) drugs upon the nation's eating habits?\"The effects of \"shrinkflation\" are also to blame for smaller portions, as firms make smaller portions of a product but keep the price the same in order to fit squeezed customer budgets.Recently, a ban came in to force across the UK banning adverts for junk foods before 9pm, which the government said was to help stem rising rates of obesity.",

'Horrific experience'At a previous hearing, prosecutor Rajni Prashar said a man was seen \"running up behind\" Teeton before he \"pulled the soldier to the ground\". He stabbed him \"repeatedly\" and drove away on a moped, she continued. Two knives were dropped at the scene and a further three were found stored on the bike, the prosecutor added.Brompton Barracks is the headquarters of the British Army's 1 Royal School of Military Engineering Regiment.Teeton is a chartered engineer working as a course manager in the Army's Corps of Royal Engineers, according to a LinkedIn page. Mark Teeton/FacebookTeeton thanked people for their generosity after the attackTeeton was discharged from hospital in August. An online fundraiser raised almost £50,000 to support him and his family.The officer, who has worked in various roles in the armed forces since 2001, earlier thanked the \"overwhelming\" generosity of strangers who had donated towards his recovery.\"We took strength and comfort from all the messages when we had just been through the most horrific experience,\" he said.\"Our family cannot thank those people enough.\"Esan is due to be sentenced at Maidstone Crown Court from 9-11 February.

In 2024, her twin boys were born using a surrogate.In 2020, her 2006 novel Half of a Yellow Sun was voted the best book to have won the Women's Prize for Fiction in its 25-year history.Speaking to the BBC last year around the release of her novel Dream Count, she stressed how she wanted her books to be read in Africa.She also explained how the writer's block she had experienced while pregnant with her first child was \"terrifying\".\"It's a really frightening place to be, because writing is the thing that gives me meaning,\" the acclaimed author told Emma Barnett.In 2022, in a BBC lecture on freedom of speech, the writer said young people were growing up \"afraid to ask questions for fear of asking the wrong questions\".Such a climate could lead to \"the death of curiosity, the death of learning and the death of creativity\", she said during one of the BBC's annual Reith lectures.\"No human endeavour requires freedom as much as creativity does,\" she added.",

    "body": "Anthony Joshua has paid tribute to close friends Sina Ghami and Latif \"Latz\" Ayodele, who were killed in a car crash in Nigeria, saying he is finding it \"tough\" to process their deaths.Ghami and Ayodele died when the vehicle they were in, alongside heavyweight boxer Joshua and another passenger, collided with a stationary truck on a major road near Lagos.Joshua sustained minor injuries in the crash before flying home to United Kingdom and attending the funeral at a mosque in London on Sunday.''Thank you for all the love and care you have shown my brothers,\" Joshua posted on Instagram on Thursday, external.\"I didn't even realise how special they are. I'll just be walking with them and cracking jokes with them, not even knowing God kept me in the presence of great men.\"100% it's tough for me, but I know it's even tougher for their parents. I have a strong mind, and I believe God knows their hearts. May God have mercy on my brothers.''Ghami was Joshua's full-time sport and exercise rehabilitation coach and worked with him for more than 10 years.Hours before the crash, Joshua posted a video on Instagram of him playing table tennis with his long-time friend Ayodele, a personal trainer.On Sunday, Joshua posted two pictures on Instagram, one showing him sitting alongside his mother and family members of the victims including the mothers of Ghami and Ayodele, and one with him holding a photograph of Ghami.Driver Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, was charged at Sagamu Magistrates' Court on Friday. Police sources told the BBC the charges included causing death by dangerous driving.The defendant was granted bail of 5m naira (£2,578) and remanded pending his bail conditions being met. The case has been adjourned until 20 January.Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site.The 2012 Olympic champion was on his way to visit relatives for new year celebrations in the town at the time of the collision, a family member told the BBC.The boxer had been spending time in Nigeria after his recent victory over American YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on 19 December.On Thursday, UFC fighter Kamaru Usman apologised after footage of his private video call with Joshua in hospital circulated online, saying he \"takes full responsibility\" for posting the clip on YouTube without properly checking the full video.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAsha PatelandLaura Hammond,NottinghamReuters/Peter CziborraDavid Coote returned to Nottingham Crown Court for sentencing on ThursdayFormer Premier League referee David Coote has been given a suspended prison sentence after a child abuse video was found on his laptop.The video, which showed a 15-year-old boy in a school uniform, was found on a device recovered by police in February last year.Coote, from Woodhill, Collingham, Nottinghamshire, admitted a charge of making an indecent image of a child in relation to the category A video, the most serious kind, at Nottingham Crown Court in October.The 43-year-old returned to the same court on Thursday and was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for two years. He was also given a sexual harm prevention order lasting 10 years.The court heard analysis of Coote's devices showed his Dell laptop had been connected to the hard drive and had made - in the sense of being downloaded and viewed on the screen - a category A moving image, which lasted two minutes and 11 seconds, on 2 January 2020.Judge Nirmal Shant KC told Coote: \"Those who commit this sort of offence must realise they involve a real child and that causes them damage.\"Getty ImagesCoote officiated his first match in the Premier League in 2018The charge of making an indecent image of a child refers to activities such as downloading, sharing or saving photos or videos containing abuse.The video came to the police's attention when Coote was being investigated by the Football Association (FA), and a number of devices were seized and analysed when he was arrested at his home, Nottingham Magistrates' Court was told in September.He admitted the offence the following month, after initially pleading not guilty.Defending Coote, Laura Miller said his actions on 2 January 2020 did not reflect him as a person, adding he was going through an \"internal struggle\" following the breakdown of a relationship.She added he had faced a period of media scrutiny, to which the judge responded: \"Some might say he has brought it on himself.\"Ms Miller told the court six years had passed since the offence and Coote, who is now working in an administrative job, was trying to \"rebuild his life step by step\".'Spectacular fall from grace'She said: \"His life is a far cry from where it was at the height of his career, he knows he will never get that back.\"Coote was also cautioned for possession of cocaine after police visited his home, the court heard.Addressing him ahead of sentencing, Judge Shant told Coote he had \"had a spectacular fall from grace\".Coote was sacked in 2024 when comments made in a video about former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp in 2020 came to light.In August last year, he was given an eight-week suspension by the FA over the Klopp footage.In addition, the ex-official is also banned by European football's governing body Uefa until 30 June this year after photographs emerged of him snorting a white powder through a bank note while in Germany for Euro 2024.Coote came out as gay in an interview with The Sun in January 2025 and said a lifelong struggle to hide his sexuality had contributed to the rant about Klopp.In addition to the suspended prison sentence and sexual harm prevention order, Coote was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.The judge added: \"If you breach this order in any way, if there are any further offences - particularly sexual offences - you will be subject to being brought back to court.\"Additional reporting by PA MediaMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoSanchia BergBBC NewsPA MediaHarry (left) and Roman (right) were abandoned as newborns years before ElsaA girl who was found abandoned as a newborn in a carrier bag in east London is to be adopted and will have regular contact with her two siblings as she grows up, a family court has heard.\"Elsa\" was left near a footpath in Newham on 18 January 2024, before being discovered by a dog walker. Subsequent DNA tests established she was the sibling of two other babies - a boy and a girl - each found nearby in similar circumstances in 2017 and 2019.Police say all enquiries to find the parents of the abandoned babies have now been \"exhausted\".On Thursday, East London Family Court heard Elsa was thriving, that she was already living with her new family, and has a loving relationship with them.All their adoptive parents have agreed that Elsa who is now nearly two, brother Harry, 8 and sister Roman, 6 should have regular meetings as they grow up. The children will see photos of each other, and have playdates twice a year.Judge Carol Atkinson said Elsa's story was \"extraordinary\" and it was \"fundamental to her existence that she shares that story with two full siblings\". She said she had seen photos of Elsa, who was a \"beautiful little girl\" - \"a raucous bundle of excitement and laughter\".The judge said had been told Elsa \"lights up the space around her\", adding that the three children's shared story was exceptional. Over ten years, between 2008–2018, only eight children were recorded as \"foundlings\" - those abandoned at birth - in England and Wales.She said the siblings shared something \"extraordinary\", adding: \"No-one they will meet in life is likely to understand what it is like to be a foundling. But they each know and understand.\"The three babies were all found near the Greenway in east LondonThe BBC has been following the hearings about baby Elsa for nearly two years.Elsa was left in a Boots shopping bag in January 2024, when she was less than an hour old.She was found on the coldest night of the year, so hospital staff named her after the character in the Disney film Frozen. In June 2024, the BBC revealed she was the third child abandoned by the same mother and father. Her name and those of her siblings have now been changed.After widespread media coverage, police stepped up their enquiries to find her parents.Working with the National Crime Agency, officers identified several hundred houses where they believed babies' parents might have been living. They knocked on more than 100 doors, spoke to local residents and took DNA samples.They also used the babies' DNA to try to identify relatives right across the UK, who they traced and spoke to.But despite these efforts, police have said the parents have still not been found.Det Supt Lewis Basford said enquiries were \"exhausted\" but officers would \"continue to review all information and intelligence made available to us\".He urged anyone who \"may be sitting on information\" to contact the police.PABaby Elsa was found inside a Boots bag on the Greenway, in Newham, east LondonProf Lorraine Sherr, a psychologist who has studied abandoned children, said Thursday's hearing was a \"turning point\" for Elsa. She said she now had a stable and permanent home, and the \"rare\" possibility of early and regular contact with her siblings.Sherr said the case marked a \"true precedent\" - that the courts, families, police and social services came together to support the child's best interests. She added that the \"intense public and media coverage ensured that processes worked smoothly\".",

    "body": "US Vice-President JD Vance says Greenland is \"critical\" for the defence of the US and the world against possible Russian or Chinese missile attacks - and that Europe and Denmark have \"not done a good job\" in securing the area.Vance told Fox News that they had not only under-invested in Greenland's defences, but also failed to engage with President Donald Trump's argument over the issue.US officials are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - the White House said on Wednesday, a day after suggesting military action to annex it to the US was also an option.Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance.Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale.Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.\"People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland,\" Vance said in his interview on Wednesday.\"If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. \"So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?' And the answer is obviously they haven't,\" he said. Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he would hold talks with Denmark next week.A day earlier, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement.Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were \"a clear threat\".\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she said.But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely and that instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he told the BBC. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"Saying that he did not have \"time for Trump\", he added that people were \"in need\". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen",

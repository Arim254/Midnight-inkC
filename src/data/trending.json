    "body": "11 hours agoGeorge WrightPA MediaThe going was tough on Monday along the A87 An Arctic blast has forced hundreds of schools to stay shut in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with widespread snow and ice causing delays throughout Monday to road, rail and air travel.Yellow warnings for snow and ice are in place across much of the country, with a warning of more widespread snow later this week.Sunday had the coldest night of the winter so far for England and Wales, with Shap in Cumbria experiencing -10.9C.Cold weather payments have been triggered for hundreds of thousands of people across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Pupils were unable to return to their classrooms on Monday after the Christmas break in many parts of northern Scotland such as Aberdeenshire, Shetland and Orkney, where schools will remain shut on Tuesday.Aberdeen City Council has said some schools, with staff living nearby, will be able to reopen.In Moray closures are being announced by schools themselves, on a school by school basis.In Wales, schools have been shut in Gwynedd, Anglesey, Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend county, Caerphilly and Pembrokeshire.The school gates also remain closed at more than 170 schools across Northern Ireland.Getty ImagesThese cars were completely covered after heavy snowfall at Dufftown in MorayReutersChildren in Ballymena made the most of the snow as schools remained shut after the Christmas breakFlights were grounded at Liverpool John Lennon Airport after its runway had to be closed due to snow and ice.Emily Ashall from Widnes was supposed to be flying to Berlin from there on Monday morning but her flight was eventually cancelled, despite passengers initially boarding the plane.She told the BBC that the airport had been \"packed to the brim\" before it was announced that no flights had been able to arrive or leave. \"It's a terrible situation but it is what it is,\" she added.The airport reopened its runway by mid-afternoon but said that \"flights are however subject to delay or cancellation\". Flights were also affected at Belfast International Airport while the runway at the City of Derry Airport closed to clear snow and ice.PA MediaScarborough has been covered for some days in a blanket of snowEurostar trains from King's Cross St Pancras have also been unable to reach the Netherlands due to the poor weather.Passengers travelling between London, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam are being advised to postpone their journey.\"Please don't come to the station if your train is shown as cancelled,\" a statement said on the Eurostar website. \"We regret that trains that can run will be subject to severe delays and possible last-minute cancellations.\"This follows Eurostar services being hit after a power supply problem caused significant disruption in the Channel Tunnel last week, leaving thousands struggling to travel ahead of New Year's Eve.Heavy snow is still causing disruption to trains across northern Scotland, with Network Rail Scotland warning \"exceptionally deep snow and severe weather conditions\" are limiting the progress of its snow ploughs.LNER has advised anyone travelling between Edinburgh and Aberdeen not to travel until 14:00 GMT Tuesday.Severe weather is also affecting services in Wales and trains are disrupted between Wales and Manchester Piccadilly as well as between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog.Stagecoach has suspended all bus services in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire until further notice \"in the interest of driver and passenger safety\".In Shropshire, firefighters trudged through half a mile of snow in the dark to deal with a chimney fire.Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service said a crew from Ellesmere was was called to a house near Oswestry on Sunday night and access was \"extremely challenging\".Richard SmithThis was the dramatic scene on Yr Wyddfa, also known as SnowdonCold weather payments are how being applied to hundreds of thousands of people across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.A payment of £25 is paid to a household on certain benefits for each seven consecutive day period when the average temperature in a local area is recorded as, or forecast to be, 0C or below.The money is paid automatically into a bank account within 14 days to those eligible.Cold Arctic air will remain across all parts of the UK on Monday. Further snow showers are expected for areas exposed to the northerly winds, especially northern Scotland, Northern Ireland, west Wales, south-west England and parts of eastern England.The Met Office has also issued a fresh yellow weather warning for most of Scotland which runs into Tuesday.Additional reporting by Rozina Sini and Kevin Peachey.",

    "body": "4 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesNestle has recalled some baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin which can cause food poisoning.The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies.It said the batches potentially contain cereulide, which can cause nausea and vomiting when consumed.The company said there had been no confirmed reports of illness associated with the products, but was recalling them \"out of an abundance of caution\".\"The safety and wellbeing of babies is our absolute priority,\" the firm said in a statement. \"We sincerely apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused to parents, caregivers, and customers.\"It stressed that all other Nestle products and batches of the same products that have not been recalled are safe to consume.Nestle promised refunds for affected customers and said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.Batch numbers of the affected products can be found on Nestle's website or through food.gov.uk.And customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas.Cereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of the Bacillus cereus bacteria that can cause food poisoning symptoms, which can be quick to develop and include vomiting, and stomach cramps. It is unlikely to be deactivated or destroyed by cooking, using boiling water or when making the infant milk, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned.The FSA's head of incidents, Jane Rawling, said parents, guardians and caregivers should not feed infants or young children the affected products.She added: \"I want to reassure parents, guardians and caregivers that we are taking urgent action, helping to ensure all of the affected product is removed from sale as a precaution.\"If you have fed this product to a baby and have any concerns about potential health impact, you should seek advice from healthcare professionals by contacting your GP or calling NHS 111.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCThe Daily Telegraph, and many of today's papers, leads with deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his words in a New York courtroom: \"I'm a prisoner of war\".The Times reports that as Maduro was making a \"defiant\" appearance in court, 2000 miles away his former deputy Delcy Rodríguez was being sworn in to replace him. At an emergency meeting of the UN security council, US ambassador Mike Waltz described the forceful removal of Maduro as a \"surgical law enforcement operation\". The Guardian also leads on Maduro's court appearance, highlighting its \"brevity and formality\" at \"barely 30 minutes\". This \"belied the far-reaching consequences of the US action,\" it says. Also, following Trump's comments that the US needs Greenland, the papers carries Denmark's warning that any US attack on the vast Arctic island would end Nato.A snap of Maduro hunched over and handcuffed alongside his wife Cilia Flores leads the Financial Times. Shares in US energy companies have surged meaning \"investors profit\" as he faces court, the FT says.After the \"swoop on Maduro\", the Metro asks \"who's next?\" It says world leaders have \"warned Donald Trump to keep his hands off their countries\". A photo of the US president speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One is captioned: \"chuffed\". The Daily Mail leads with the Danish warning that a \"Greenland raid will finish Nato.\" It is \"America's new world order\", the paper says, splashing a photo of Maduro \"shackled\". Trump has \"hinted\" Greenland could be \"next on his hit list\", it writes. But in a \"rare break with Washington\", British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he stood with Denmark.\"Tyrant captured by lunatic\" says the Daily Mirror, headlining with \"Mad Men\". Now that there is \"one president in cuffs\", there are \"fears Trump's set to launch new missions\", it says. The paper also highlights sacked Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim's \"brave face\" after leaving the club.The Independent describes Maduro as \"cuffed but defiant\". He told the New York court: \"I am a decent man. I am still the president of my country.\"The Sun leads with the sacking of Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim. \"When your trophies are nil and you've cost 30 mil... that's Amorim\", it writes, recalling a certain classic ditty. A photo of Trump in a Manchester United training jacket is splashed across the Daily Star's front. The club are dubbed \"Manbaby United\" as the paper asks to \"make red devils great again\".The i Paper reports that over-70s face a driving ban if they fail new eyesight tests. It says that cognitive testing for the age group is also \"under consideration\" as medical self-reporting declines.A new warning over the \"hidden\" danger of salt leads the Daily Express. The average working Briton eats as much salt as there is in 155 packets of crisps a week, it says.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "All 116 people injured in a bar fire at a Swiss ski resort have now been identified, officials have said.Forty people were killed when a fire tore through a busy venue in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, with victims' age ranging from 14 to 39 years old.While the dead had all previously been identified, work had been ongoing to establish who the injured are, some of whom remain in a critical condition. Swiss police confirmed on Monday that 83 people remained in hospital, with the injured including at least 12 nationalities.Most of the injured suffered severe burns, which in some cases meant they could not be identified, police have said.Investigators said 119 people had been injured but that number has been revised down in the latest update. A criminal investigation has been launched into the French couple who managed the Le Constellation bar - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling were the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Details have begun to emerge about some of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Among them was Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, who was a pupil at two UK schools. Her family wrote on social media: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.\"The mother of Arthur Brodard, 16, confirmed he had died in the fire.She said in a video message: \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light.\"Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as also being among the victims.Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".",

    "body": "New NHS online hospital to focus on eyes, menopause and prostates 3 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe new NHS online hospital service being launched in England next year will initially focus on menopause, prostate and eye conditions.The NHS has selected nine different conditions in total for the service which will be available through the NHS app in 2027.The service, which was first announced in September, will allow patients to have assessments, check-ups and follow-up appointments online and will have its own dedicated team of doctors.The aim is to carry out 8.5 million appointments in the first three years – four times more than the average NHS trust.But experts have questioned how it will be staff and paid for.The nine conditions that will be prioritised initially are:glaucomaconditions affecting the retina at the back of the eye (including age-related macular degeneration)cataractsinflammatory bowel diseaseiron deficiency anaemiaprostate enlargementraised PSA levels that are not suspected cancermenopausemenstrual problems which may be a sign of endometriosisThe expectation is more conditions will be added to this list in the future.No patient will be forced down this route though, NHS England said, as they can still choose face-to-face appointments.Patients will have the option of using NHS Online when a GP makes a referral for specialist care. Instead of having a physical site, patients will be able to receive care from doctors around the country, directly through the NHS App.Tests, scans or procedures that are needed will take place at healthcare sites close to patients' homes, while doctors review and assess their notes remotely.The government and NHS England believe the service will provide quicker access to care for patients and help relieve the pressure on in-person appointments, helping to cut waiting lists in the process.Professor Stella Vig, head of elective care at NHS England, said: \"The NHS's new online hospital will see a huge shift in the way we deliver care, giving patients the option to have an online appointment with a specialist anywhere in England.Regarding the nine conditions being prioritised, she said: \"We know that these conditions can be painful and difficult to cope with so providing faster, more convenient access to diagnosis and treatments will have a real and positive impact on people's lives.\"Questions remainPatients can already get test results on the NHS app and have online appointments.But this service builds on that by essentially offering a start-to-finish service digitally, building on some initiatives that have already been piloted.For example, University Hospital Southampton developed a virtual follow-up service for low-risk inflammatory bowel disease, enabling patients to access care and support remotely when they had flare-ups.It meant the NHS trust could cut back on routine follow-up appointments. Three quarters of patients were managed virtually and the initiative was credited in reducing waiting times by 58%.Meanwhile, Moorfields Eye Hospital in London has introduced a virtual system for managing non-emergency eye referrals. More than half ended up being treated in routine clinics without the need for specialist treatment at Moorfields.Moorfields Eye Hospital consultant Peter Thomas said: \"The impact is clear – patients are being seen more quickly in more appropriate settings, and the pressure on NHS services is being reduced.\"Dr Becks Fisher said, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the service will be helpful for some and focussing on menopause and menstrual health \"makes sense\" given the long waits for gynaecology services.But she added \"tricky questions remain\", including how the service will be staffed and paid for.She also said: \"NHS IT infrastructure could also pose a problem, as it will need to enable relevant information – like scan results – to be seen across different NHS organisations, something that is infamously difficult at the moment.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoJack Fenwick,Political correspondentandChris Mason,Political editorThe leaders of West Midlands Police and Birmingham City Council will be grilled by MPs later over a decision not to allow Israeli football fans to attend a match in the city last year.The decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a match against Aston Villa in November was criticised by the prime minister and other politicians, some of whom suggested it amounted to antisemitism.BBC News has obtained a letter from the Dutch police inspectorate in December, which appears to contradict claims made by West Midlands Police about Maccabi fans' previous behaviour, which were used to justify the ban.West Midlands Police maintains it banned fans because of concerns over the safety of local people.The decision to allow the match to go ahead without Maccabi fans was announced in October, three weeks before the fixture.Aston Villa said the decision had been made by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group, who deemed the match a \"high risk\" because of unrest during previous Maccabi matches.Despite criticism from government and opposition politicians, the match went ahead without any away fans present.Craig Guildford, the chief constable at West Midlands Police, and John Cotton, the leader of Birmingham City Council, will both be questioned by Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee on Tuesday.Guildford has been called back by the committee, after previously giving evidence last month.The row over why away fans were banned has been ongoing since October, when the Safety Advisory Group, which includes the council, the club and police, made the decision because of what they said were safety concerns.West Midlands Police have repeatedly mentioned the unrest surrounding a Maccabi match in Amsterdam in November 2024, as part of the justification for the ban.During meetings of the safety group in October, they claimed that 500-600 Maccabi fans had targeted Muslim communities the night before the Amsterdam fixture, saying there had been \"serious assaults including throwing random members of the public\" into a river.They also claimed that 5,000 officers were needed to deal with the unrest in Amsterdam, after previously saying that the figure was 1,200.In November, a representative for the police force in Amsterdam said they did not recognise the claims.Last month, West Midlands Police hit back when a senior officer suggested that Dutch police had only questioned the claims because of political pressure.But a body that oversees the Dutch police has now backed up the Amsterdam officers' account of what happened.In a letter seen by BBC News, the Dutch Inspector General, Liesbeth Huijzer, said \"we do not see any new facts or circumstances that would warrant revising these findings\".Conservative MP Nick Timothy, who asked the Dutch Inspector General to intervene, said they had \"confirmed what we have long suspected\".He added: \"The facts on the ground in Amsterdam do not remotely resemble what West Midlands Police has claimed.\"Leaked minutes from the safety group, first reported by the Sunday Times and seen by BBC News, also reveal that the police said it would favour a ban despite an \"absence of intelligence\".A summary of a closed doors meeting on 7 October said that the police's preference had been determined based on what one officer described as \"conversations with piers [sic] and my professional judgment\".Those present, including representatives from the council, police, fire service and Aston Villa, were reminded that it was a \"confidential discussion\" and \"must not be shared\".The Sunday Times reported that two days later, an official at Birmingham City Council asked the police to provide more evidence for how the ban would help ensure the safety of fans because of concerns that it \"may be wrongly considered as anti-Jewish sentiment\".At a further meeting of the safety group on 16 October, West Midlands Police claimed there was now \"significant intelligence indicating potential for disorder involving Maccabi Tel Aviv fans based on recent fixtures\".West Midlands Police has been approached for comment.",

    "body": "Electric car discounts are 'unsustainable' as sales climb, car group warns4 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness CorrespondentGetty ImagesGovernment discounts for electric vehicles are \"unsustainable\", a major motoring group has warned, as the number of new cars registered in the UK exceeded two million last year for the first time since the pandemic.Nearly 500,000 of the new cars sold were electric, according to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, welcomed what he called a \"reasonably solid result amid tough economic and geopolitical headwinds\".But electric car sales were still not increasing fast enough to meet official targets, he said, warning of a growing gap between consumer demand and the government's ambitions. Discounts worth thousands per vehicle were \"unsustainable\", he said.In total, 2,020,373 new cars were registered in 2025. This was the third successive year of growth, and the highest total since the pandemic.  However it was still well short of the 2.3 million sold in 2019.Electric cars accounted for 473,340 new registrations last year, giving them a market share of 23.4%.That was a significant increase on 2024, but still below the government's headline target of 28%, under what is known as the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate (ZEV Mandate).The mandate stipulates that carmakers which fail to sell enough electric cars, as a percentage of their overall sales, can face heavy fines.However, there are concessions built into the rules which can enable them to avoid penalties, for example by reducing emissions from other vehicles in their fleets, or by buying surplus 'emissions credits' from manufacturers which exceed their own targets.These 'flexibilities' were extended in April, following heavy lobbying by some manufacturers, while the fines for failing to comply were reduced.But Mr Hawes warned that even so, carmakers were having to offer hefty discounts in order to sell enough electric models. The SMMT estimates those discounts were worth more than £5bn last year, or some £11,000 for every electric vehicle sold.Mr Hawes said this was unsustainable, especially with manufacturers expected to meet a more arduous target of 33% this year. He called on the government to bring forward a planned review of the ZEV Mandate, due to be carried out in 2027.\"It is increasing the number of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) being sold,\" he said. \"The question is, at what cost?\"Such a review, he suggested, should look at factors which have changed significantly since the targets were first planned, including a marked increase in energy prices and higher costs for raw materials, which have made life more difficult for car manufacturers.He stopped short, however, of explicitly calling for the rules to be diluted further.\"Don't get me wrong – the industry is not diverting course,\" he insisted.\"It needs to sell these vehicles because it has invested so heavily in them. But you need to make sure the market reflects more closely the actual level of demand.\"Some commentators are more positive about the ZEV Mandate, however.Colin Walker of the Energy and Climate intelligence Unit, an environmental research group, welcomed the latest registration figures.\"2025 has been another bumper year for EV sales, with nearly one in four cars sold in 2025 being an EV,\" he said.\"This policy in turn will boost the UK's second-hand market where the majority of us buy our cars, easing cost of living concerns for drivers.\"The government has brought forward a number of measures to support the take-up of electric vehicles over the past year.They include the £1.3bn Electric Car Grant Scheme, which provides up to £3,750 towards the cost of buying an electric vehicle, as well as significant funding for charging infrastructureHowever, in the autumn budget, it also announced plans to introduce a 'per mile' tax on electric vehicles – a measure designed to offset some of the reduction in fuel duty revenues caused by the transition to electric vehicles.The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said the move was likely to result in 440,000 fewer electric cars being sold over a five-year period.\"This is one of the challenges we see,\" said Mr Hawes.\"To have a technological shift like this, you need consistent, coherent and compelling messaging and support… Even the announcement of a tax specifically on EVs will send a very conflicting message to consumers.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterHigh street retailers Claire's and The Original Factory Shop are being put into administration, risking 2,500 jobs.It comes amid a turbulent time for Claire's, popular with tweens for its brightly coloured accessories, which was seeking a buyer after its US owner filed for bankruptcy last year.Modella Capital, which owns both chains, said the retailers would enter insolvency proceedings across the UK and Ireland. The administration will give them breathing space to find a new buyer.Modella said tough trading conditions and \"alarming\" low Christmas trading left both in a \"vulnerable\" position.Claire's has 154 stores and 1,355 staff, while The Original Factory shop has 140 stores and 1,220 staff.Modella purchased Claire's in September, six weeks after its previous collapse into administration, in a deal which saw around 1,000 job losses at the retailer, while 145 stores closed.The investment firm has owned The Original Factory Shop since early last year.\"This has been a very tough decision,\" said Modella. \"We have worked intensively in an effort to save both businesses, having made last-ditch attempts to rescue them, but neither has a realistic possibility of trading profitably again.\"Modella said that the chains were \"highly vulnerable\" even before it bought them. It also blamed challenges including the climate on the high street, which it said \"remains extremely challenging\", and government policy.The two shops are the latest casualties of a tough trading environment which has seen high street sales fall as shoppers move online, ditching old favourites facing the high cost of maintaining brick-and-mortar stores.\"A combination of very weak consumer confidence, highly adverse government fiscal policies and continued cost inflation is causing many established and much-loved businesses to suffer badly,\" Modella said.The investment firm has become increasingly prominent on Britain's high streets, having bought WH Smith's high street chain last year and taken over arts and crafts retailer Hobbycraft a year earlier.Modella is the latest business to criticise measures by Chancellor Rachel Reeves which have seen operating costs rise, making trading even more difficult as high inflation - the rate at which prices rise - squeezes household budgets.Her last Budget hiked taxes, while her previous Budget increased the minimum wage and raised employer National Insurance contributions.One London pub owner warned he may have to close after tax rises announced in the last Budget. James Fitzgerald, landlord of the Thatched House in Hammersmith, said his costs have risen by £22,000 over the past year - with the increase in National Insurance a major factor.The Treasury was asked to comment.",

    "body": "The Cuban government says 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.It described the dead as members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies were killed \"in combat actions\", declaring two days of national mourning. The armed forces added the Cubans \"fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombardments of installations\"Cuba, a long-standing ally of Venezuela, has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail and has personnel throughout the Venezuelan military.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the country had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife \"at the request\" of Venezuela. US spies had been monitoring Maduro's movements for months before US forces struck, according to US General Dan Caine.Gen Caine said that they had learned where the former leader moved, lived, travelled, ate, and worked.The New York Times reported that the CIA had also recruited a \"Venezuelan source\"  who it says informed the Americans of Maduro's exact location.Many of those killed are believed to have been part of Maduro's close security detail, who were with him at the time. Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed, but its armed forces  have said that a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties.An official statement from the Cuban government read: \"Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism\".The total death toll - according to an unnamed Venezuelan official cited by the New York Times - stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the seizure of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\". He continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.\"On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a \"disaster\" run by \"incompetent, senile men\". \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor, Joe Biden, easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end \"economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people\".It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since. ",

The gold price saw its best annual performance last year since 1979 after rising by more than 60%, reaching an all-time high of $4,549.71 on 26 December.Those gains were driven by several factors including expectations of more interest rate cuts, major purchases of bullion by central banks and investor concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.Oil prices fluctuated on Monday as investors weighed whether Washington's intervention in Venezuela would affect crude supplies. Brent crude rose more than 1% to nearly $61.50 a barrel, still below highs seen in recent years, as analysts said ample global supplies would offset any disruption.Shares in Chevron, the only US company currently operating in Venezuela, rose 4%, while Spanish energy firm Repsol, among the other few Western energy firms with a presence in the country, gained 2%.Oil services firms also climbed, with Haliburton up more than 7%. US President Donald Trump has vowed to tap into Venezuela's vast oil reserves after seizing Maduro and said that the US will \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".But industry analysts have said the move is unlikely to have an immediate impact on how much people and businesses pay for energy.Experts have also said it would cost billions of dollars to fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure, which has been in sharp decline since the early 2000s.Venezuela's crude production has been \"lacklustre\" for years and now only accounts for around 1% of global oil output, said investment strategist Vasu Menon from OCBC bank.The former chief executive of BP, Lord Browne, told the BBC's Today programme that for Venezuela to revive its oil production would take \"a tremendous amount of skill investment and time\". While there might be a \"quick pick up\" of some production, he added, output might actually fall while the industry is reorganising.Shares in defence stocks across Europe rose sharply as investors reacted to the US actions in Venezuela.In the UK, shares in BAE Systems rose 5% while Germany's Rheinmetall jumped more than 8%.\"Heightened geopolitical tensions like the ones we've seen over the weekend would normally spook investors, but global markets have avoided a sell-off,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\"Defence stocks often move higher when there are heightened tensions between two countries as investors believe events could spur governments to spend more on military protection.\"It was only natural to see the sector in demand after Venezuela's leader was captured,\" he added.Mining firms also rose following the gain in precious metals prices, with Endeavour Mining and Fresnillo both up more than 4%. Share markets in Asia made gains as investors focused on news unrelated to developments in Venezuela.Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 3% on the first day of trading of the year and new data showed that manufacturing activity stabilised in December.Major indexes in South Korea and China were also higher.The jumps reflect confidence that the fallout from events in Venezuela will remain distant, said Zavier Wong from investment firm eToro.",

    "body": "A former contestant on TV show The Apprentice sent a string of antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media, a medical tribunal has been told.Dr Asif Munaf, who is from Sheffield, is said to have posted and reposted the \"seriously offensive\" comments from his X account on various dates between October 2023 and July 2025.He appeared on the 2024 edition of The Apprentice but was dropped from The Apprentice: You're Fired! after he was accused of posting antisemitic comments on social media.The 37-year-old, who has not attended the tribunal and is not legally represented, denied the posts were antisemitic at a previous hearing.On Monday the General Medical Council (GMC) outlined the misconduct allegations against the doctor, who is registered under his full name Mohammed Asif Munaf.According to the GMC, Munaf posted multiple antisemitic statements, including Holocaust denial, conspiracy theories and rhetoric equating Jews with Nazism.Harriet Tighe, lawyer for the GMC, said one post was accompanied by an image of a flag including the Star of David above a swastika.Munaf also reposted a comment which referred to boxer Floyd Mayweather using a derogatory racial slur.In a separate post, Munaf expressed sexist views, arguing that certain professions should be restricted by gender and criticised female empowerment.At a previous hearing, he said the posts were \"not befitting of someone as educated as myself and were said in the heat of the emotion\".He is also accused by the GMC of \"disappearing\" just hours into a locum placement as a cardiology specialist registrar at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust in January 2024 as he walked out without notice or good reason.In a separate allegation, he is said to have provided a sick note to a patient in November 2024 while he was suspended from practice.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing continues.Additional reporting by PA Media.",

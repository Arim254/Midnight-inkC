    "body": "11 hours agoKatya AdlerEurope editorBBCDowntown Munich is best-known for chic shops and flashy fast cars but right now its streets are bedecked with posters advertising next generation drones.\"Europe's security under construction\" boasts the slogan on an eye-catching set of sleek black-and-white photographs, festooned across a scaffolding-clad church on one of this town's best known pedestrian boulevards.Such an unapologetic public display of military muscle would have been unimaginable here just a few years ago, but the world outside Germany is changing fast, and taking this country with it.The southern region of Bavaria has become Germany's leading defence technology hub, focusing on AI, drones and aerospace.Advertisements such as these that say \"Europe's security under construction\" would have been unthinkable in Germany not long agoPeople here, like most other Europeans, say they feel increasingly exposed - squeezed between an expansionist Russia and an economically aggressive China to the east, and an increasingly unpredictable, former best pal, the United States, to the west.According to a recent Eurobarometer poll, more than two-thirds of Europeans (68%) feel their country is under threat.This autumn, Germany's Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance warned for the first time since the Cold War that war is no longer \"unlikely\". While emphasising that this is a safe country, it also recommends that Germans keep food supplies to last three to ten days at home. Just in case.Germany is the number one single donor of military and other aid to Ukraine, now that the US has halted any new direct aid. Opinion polls suggest voters here want to feel better protected at home too.AFP via Getty ImagesGermany is now the single biggest giver of aid to UkraineThe question for this country, along with others in Europe is whether traditional alliances with the US, in Nato and the EU can suffice, or whether they should be diversifying into ad-hoc coalitions alongside other like-minded nations such as Australia, South Korea and Japan?Precarious relationsBy 2029, the German defence budget will be higher than the UK and French equivalents combined, Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte pointed out to me.He described the €150bn they say they will spend on defence as \"a staggering amount\".It's something the United States notices and appreciates, he said. Donald Trump is far from the first US president to insist that Europe do more for its own security, though his tone has been noticeably more threatening than that of his predecessors.The precarious state of transatlantic relations was the main focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this weekend. It's the world's biggest annual defence meeting, bringing leaders, security experts and defence industries together.Mark Rutte (pictured speaking to Katya Adler), described the E150bn Germany will spend on defence \"a staggering amount\"While it's easy to dismiss speech-heavy get-togethers like this as wind-baggy talking shops, in the turbulent times we live in, they can make a difference - especially the informal private huddles between global decision makers, far away from the glare of the cameras.The most eagerly - and for some the most anxiously - anticipated speech at this year's conference was that of the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who represented the Trump administration here.European leaders and top diplomats were seriously on the edge of their seats. But why was a simple 30-minute address given so much importance?It's because Europe-US relations have never been so frayed as they are now, over the last 80 years since World War Two. And this isn't a bust-up between buddies that will easily blow over.Denmark still furiousIn the just over 12 months since Trump returned to the White House, he has at times insulted and undermined European leaders, slapped big tariffs on their exports, and most shockingly of all to his allies in Nato, threatened Danish sovereignty over its territory, Greenland, refusing for a while to rule out taking the island by force.Speaking at the MSC on Saturday, Denmark's still clearly furious prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Trump's designs on Greenland remained \"the same\" despite ongoing trilateral talks between representatives of Greenland, the US and Denmark.Trump has ruled out taking Greenland by military force for now, and he's backed away (for the moment, at least) from slapping economic sanctions on allies, including the UK, France and Germany, that were getting in the way of the US acquiring the Arctic island. But transatlantic trust was severely damaged.European powers see in Trump a truly transactional president who thinks nothing of leveraging security or economic relations with his closest allies to get what he wants. Just before being re-elected president, for example, he told Europeans that the US would not protect nations that didn't pay their way on defence.It is true though, that Europe has been coasting on America's security blanket for decades. Critics in the US argue that European nations have been able to run generous welfare states for decades while Washington picked up the tab for security spending.AFP via Getty ImagesThe speech by US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio (left) was the most eagerly anticipated at the conferenceGermany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, told me on Saturday: \"We got used to the strong support from the US;  we got used to our comfort zone in which we used to live. This time is over, definitely over,\" he said. \"Washington was right.\"But the crisis over Greenland and other actions by the Trump administration - such as when it temporarily paused intelligence-sharing with Ukrainian forces last March, leaving them blind on the battlefield, in order to pressure Kyiv into engaging in peace talks with Moscow - have left deep scars and a troubling sense of transatlantic wariness.Hence the trepidation in Munich before Rubio took the stage.In the end, his words were laced with a sense of historic kinship. \"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said. \"The two great wars of the last century serve for us as a constant reminder that ultimately our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"I found it telling that so many leading European figures in the audience jumped on the warmth of his words, rising to their feet to applaud the US Secretary of State. They were clearly relieved he hadn't threatened or berated Europe as the US Vice President JD Vance famously did at last year's MSC.But for those listening closely, Rubio's speech was loyal to themes close to the heart of the Trump administration and hard for many European leaders to swallow: anti climate action, sceptical of globalisation, multilateralism, migration and pro the building of a new era of Christian western civilisation.Rubio was clear: the US wasn't interested in allies clinging to the old status quo. It wanted to forge a new path, ideally alongside Europe, but only if it shared the same values.This US offer of close partnership was conditional and absent of a sense of compromise.\"A bit like a (psychologically) abusive partner,\" said one European diplomat, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity. \"He reminded Europe how wonderful the (transatlantic) relationship used to be, but he then switched to coercion: If you want things to be good between us in the future, you have to do as I say!\"Another diplomat pointed out that, while talking of shared values, it was telling, he said, that of all the European countries that Rubio could have gone to after making his speech in Germany, he chose to visit Slovakia and Hungary before heading back to the US.They are viewed by Brussels as two of the EU's most problematic members, both with Eurosceptic nationalist prime ministers who oppose sending military aid to Ukraine and who are tough on migration.A fragile new relationshipRubio's softer tone also divided European leaders who had recently spoken as one, in defence of Denmark, at the height of the Greenland crisis last month.The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, underlined a now fragile relationship with the US, despite Rubio's gentler rhetoric. \"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" she said. \"Europeans have suffered shock therapy.\"But will some countries in Europe grasp what warmness there was in Rubio's speech as an excuse not to rush to boost defence spending as promised? The coffers of most European governments are over stretched already and their voters tend to prioritise cost-of-living concerns over defence budgets.Reuters\"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" according to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der LeyenRachel Ellehuus, Director-General of defence think-tank RUSI told me she sees a rift opening up across the continent.On the one hand, you have the Nordic and Baltic nations that are geographically close to Russia, and also Germany and the Netherlands, which are all big defence spenders, she says, whereas in southern Europe, there's Spain, for example, that is absolutely unapologetic about refusing to increase defence budgets to the levels demanded by Donald Trump.France and Britain are both verbally committed to boosting defence spending, says Ellehuus, but are still looking for a \"political band aid\" to help them explain to voters the trade-offs that will involve - higher taxes, less welfare or more borrowing.\"Europeans need to get to work yesterday and to focus,\" she says. \"They have 5-10 years to stand on their own two feet in terms of conventional defence capabilities.\"Last week, U.S. Undersecretary of Defence Elbridge Colby couldn't have been more stark in his messaging at a meeting of Nato defence ministers he attended in Brussels: Europe was no longer a US priority, the Indo-Pacific was.\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are reprioritising the defence of our homeland and the protection of our interests in our Hemisphere,\" he said.While he emphasised that the US remained committed to Nato's mutual defence clause, where an attack against one member is viewed as an attack against all, Colby insisted the US would be reducing its capabilities in Europe, becoming \"a more limited and focused\" presence.Europe had to become a partner, rather than a dependent, he said, calling for a new \"Nato 3.0\". The old world order with the West at its core, has faded but the MSC this weekend made clear that what comes next for Europe and the US is still very much up in the air.Marco Rubio called for a new century of western civilisation, Elbridge Colby wants a re-vamped Nato, while the UK's prime minister appealed in Munich for the western alliance to be re-made.Starmer's nuanced approachIn stark contrast to Marco Rubio's insistence on greater national sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defence - to cut re-armament costs, though, he emphasised this did not mean the UK turning its back on the United States.Sophia Gaston, national security expert at Kings College London, told me that in Munich, Starmer was able to better articulate the nuance of Britain's strategic outlook.\"Other allies in Europe may be more willing to speak of divergence from Washington\", she says, \"but for Britain it remains a strategic imperative to triangulate within the Transatlantic relationship. There will also be times when Britain will have to make hard choices, and Starmer appeared more confident in confronting that reality.\"The key is to have a really strong grasp of the national interest and our instruments of power and influence. This requires a much more competitive approach that has not always felt natural to Britain, which has typically pursued much of its diplomacy in elegant, consensus-focused and invisible ways.\"PA MediaKeir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defenceIn these fast-moving, unpredictable times, Europe's leaders are increasingly turning to a la carte coalitions, alongside traditional organisations like Nato or the EU, which are larger and therefore often slower to react. These groupings also include non-European nations.Take, for example, the so-called Coalition of the Willing group of countries, led by the UK and France and formed to secure Ukrainian sovereignty in the case of an eventual peace deal with Russia. Turkey has attended coalition meetings, as have New Zealand and Australia.More from InDepthCanada is increasingly working alongside Nordic and Baltic nations that share geopolitical challenges and common values, they say, and want to promote stability and deterrence from the edges of the Baltic Sea, through the Nordic and Baltic states, through the North Atlantic, Greenland and across the Canadian arctic.One European policy-maker who asked not to be named joked to me that Canada was becoming \"more and more European by the day\". Japan and South Korea were increasingly seen as part of the \"like-minded family\" too, he said.Not just defenceThese ad hoc coalitions are not restricted to defence alone. France's President Macron has long called for Europe to increase what he calls its strategic autonomy, in traditional security terms but also energy security, supply chains and new technologies. In Munich he recommended Europe \"de-risk\" from all outside powers.This weekend even saw the president of the European Commission admitting that if the EU failed to move fast enough on improving competitiveness, \"a group of its member states would have to move forward alone\".Attempts by smaller pockets of European powers to work together to advance European strategic independence are by no means always successful. Take the current row between France and Germany over their joint attempt to come up with the next generation of fighter jet with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).You could also say that for all the talk of building European independence, this weekend's conference was also a reminder of just how dependent Europe remains on US security support - from its nuclear umbrella to intelligence sharing and command and control structures. It was also a reminder of how far Europe trails the US in high tech innovation.But more than short-term mechanisms designed to 'survive' Donald Trump, the changes we are witnessing in Europe, including closer alliances outside the continent, are liable to be longer lasting. The world now seems to dance to the tune of big power politics. And even slow-moving Europe is having to adapt.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu, 2026 slopestyle gold medallist Mathilde Gremaud and Canada's Megan Oldham. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "2 hours agoGeorge WrightReutersThe derailment happened near the village of Goppenstein - which is under an avalanche warningFive people have been injured after a train derailed in southern Switzerland, in an incident that could have been caused by an avalanche, police say.The derailment happened near the village of Goppenstein - which is under an avalanche warning - around 07:00 local time (06:00 GMT), officials said. All 29 passengers have been rescued, while one of the injured was sent to hospital, police said.Switzerland has experienced heavy rain and snow in recent days, and the country's Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research says the avalanche risk is very high across the alps.\"According to initial findings, an avalanche may have crossed the tracks shortly before the train passed,\" police stated, adding that the public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation.\"Five people were injured. One of them was taken to hospital,\" police added.The regional commuter train was on its way from Spiez to Brig when it derailed.Goppenstein, a key hub for road and rail transport, sits at the exit of the Lotschberg rail tunnel. The train derailed as it was exiting the tunnel, police said.The region is under its second highest avalanche warning - level four of five.Heavy snow also resulted in 50 people being evacuated from the village of Orsieres, near the French border.Skiers have been warned by authorities to stay on the marked slopes, and those walking in the mountains should also check avalanche bulletins before setting off.Last month, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing in the Swiss alps.",

The 16-year-old boy previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter.Woolwich Crown Court was told the teenagers believed Cashford, 49, was a paedophile after he met the girl by chance at an amusement arcade two days earlier and gave her his phone number.Using the alias Sienna, the three teenagers had messaged Cashford and arranged to meet him by the sea wall.Danny Robinson KC, defending the girl, told the court the texts started as a \"big laugh\" but might have become a wish to name-and-shame Cashford.\"It was a childish escapade that got out of hand very quickly with tragic consequences,\" he said.'Relentlessly pursued'Prosecutors said Cashford was chased and hit with rocks and a bottle before he was found lying face down in the mud.A post-mortem examination showed injuries to his face and head, bruises on his limbs and body, alongside a number of fractured ribs that had punctured his lung.The 16-year-old boy had earlier told the court how he and the others had discussed giving Cashford \"a slap\" before the attack.He claimed he attacked Cashford because he thought police \"wouldn't have done anything\" if they had reported the man for trying to meet up with the girl.\"This was a carefully pre-planned deliberate and violent attack on someone who was not expecting it and who could not defend himself,\" said Natalie Smith, senior crown prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service. \"Despite his best attempts to flee, he was relentlessly pursued and attacked, even when witnesses reported he was lying on the ground.\"The three teenagers – who cannot be named for legal reasons – were acquitted of murder on Monday.They are expected to be sentenced for manslaughter in April.\"These verdicts will change their lives forever,\" said the judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Team GB skeleton gold medallist says she discovered talent after Instagram ad5 hours agoElla KiplingPA MediaTabby Stoecker and Matt Weston celebrate after winning gold in the Skeleton Mixed Team FinalTeam GB gold medallist Tabitha Stoecker has said she discovered her talent for skeleton after seeing an advert on Instagram.Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Monday, she said she initially trained as a circus performer, before coming across skeleton by chance on social media in 2019.\"I did flying trapeze, acrobatics, and I absolutely loved the performance element of it all,\" she said.\"I saw an advert on Instagram for Discover Your Gold Talent ID process and got selected for skeleton, and I guess the rest is history.\"Stoecker has previously said how she did know what skeleton was at that point, but she was \"at that age where you're not sure about things, and I wanted to test some other stuff out\".Milan-Cortina is her first Olympics, with the athlete only making her international debut in December 2021.Stoecker, who finished fifth in the women's skeleton finals on Saturday, also told Radio 4's Today programme that the circus had definitely prepared her for the \"adrenaline\" of skeleton.Team GB skeleton medal winners who trained on concrete says 'it feels amazing' to win goldFollowing Weston's individual gold medal win on Friday - Team GB's first of the Games - some 4,000 people have signed up to the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association's (BBSA) talent ID campaign.More than 1,000 of the sign ups have been since the the team race on Sunday.\"We're delighted to see so many people wanting to try the sport and looking to emulate Matt and Tabby by becoming an Olympic Champion, said Natalie Dunman from the BBSA.\"Matt, Tabby and all our GB athletes started out in the sport by signing up in a similar way so we're confident there could be future Olympic medallists among them.\"Our athletes come from incredibly diverse backgrounds and that's one of the things that makes our programme so special.\"Weston told Today: \"The sport runs off people applying, giving it a shot and taking the opportunity with both hands. I didn't think I would ever be going to the Games competing in skeleton nine years ago … it's been an amazing journey.\"For those hoping to get into the sport, Stoecker advised: \"You need guts, and you need a dream.\"Weston said that anyone who fancies \"throwing themselves headfirst down a mountain\" should take the opportunity.He also began his athletic career focused on a different sport, and competed internationally in taekwondo, before a stress fracture in his back forced him to retire.However, Weston then broke his back doing skeleton about three years ago. He said: \"Skeleton isn't the safest of sports, but it's a hell of a lot of fun when you get it right.\"Weston and Stoecker make history as Great Britain win a third Olympic goldUnlike other countries, Team GB does not have its own ice track. Instead, skeleton athletes have to train on a push track at the University of Bath, which is the only one in the UK.Weston explained on BBC Breakfast: \"We don't actually have ice to train on. Some other nations like Germany have four tracks so during the winter they can train way more than we can and hone in on their equipment and skills, they have the opportunity to do that way more than us.\"So that fact that we can come to an Olympics and beat them, feels pretty amazing.\"Stoecker added: \"I'm sure it is a little bit shocking how amazing GB can be with such a disadvantage with the actual sliding side of things, but historically we have done so well.\"Skeleton is one of Team GB's most successful winter sports, with gold medals previously having been picked up in PyeongChang in 2018, Sochi in 2014, and Vancouver in 2010.Weston also said he is getting married in July - and Stoecker's boyfriend is the best man. \"Skeleton has brought us all together,\" she said.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoRichard WheelerPolitical reporterGetty ImagesThe government has abandoned plans to delay 30 council elections in England following legal advice.Local Government Secretary Steve Reed had approved delays for the ballots until 2027 to help deliver a major reorganisation which will see some local authorities abolished.Reform UK had launched a legal challenge against the plans to delay May's elections, which was due to be heard in the High Court on Thursday.The move was welcomed by opposition parties, who had branded the delays undemocratic.Reform leader Nigel Farage, writing on X, said: \"We took this Labour government to court and won.\"In collusion with the Tories, Keir Starmer tried to stop 4.6 million people voting on May 7th. Only Reform UK fights for democracy.\"The government has agreed to pay Reform's legal costs relating to the proceedings, which a party source said would be at least £100,000.In a letter to council leaders, Reed said the government had written to the High Court to confirm he had decided to withdraw the original decision. The statement said: \"The secretary (of) state invited the housing minister, who was not involved in the initial decision-making, to reconsider the position afresh on a very urgent basis recognising the pressing timescales involved. \"The housing minister has decided that the elections should proceed in May 2026.\"Reed said he recognised that many of the councils undergoing reorganisation \"voiced genuine concerns about the pressure they are under\" as part of the reforms.He added that the government would provide an extra £63m to the 21 areas affected.The proposed reforms to local government would replace the two-tier system of district and county councils that exists in many parts of England with new unitary authorities responsible for delivering all councils services in their area.There were originally 136 local elections across England that were scheduled for May.Of these, 63 were eligible to request a postponement due to local government reorganisation, and in January it was announced that 30 would be delayed.Polls in five of these areas had already been delayed from May 2025.The government had previously said some councils were concerned about their capacity to run the polls in May alongside the overhaul of town halls, as well as the cost to taxpayers of holding elections for councils that are due to be abolished.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"Following legal advice, the government has withdrawn its original decision to postpone 30 local elections in May.\"Providing certainty to councils about their local elections is now the most crucial thing and all local elections will now go ahead in May 2026.\"'Humiliating U-turn'Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party \"fought tooth and nail to stop this stitch-up and the government has been forced into a humiliating U-turn\". He added: \"We cannot allow the government to cancel elections on a whim ever again. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said it was \"predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions\".She said her party had opposed the \"unnecessary cancellations at every opportunity\", writing on X: \"This is the right decision.\"A one-year delay to allow new councils to be re-organised is one thing. Two years was always too much.\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski said he was \"pleased the government has done another U-turn\", describing the attempt to delay elections as \"part of a disturbing authoritarian trend of this caretaker prime minister\".Out of the councils that had originally been given permission to delay their elections, 15 were Labour-controlled, while four were led by the Conservatives, one by the Liberal Democrats and 10 were under no overall control.Here is the full list of councils where elections were due to be postponed but will now take place: Adur District CouncilBasildon Borough CouncilBlackburn with Darwen CouncilBurnley Borough CouncilCannock Chase District CouncilCheltenham Borough CouncilChorley Borough CouncilCity of Lincoln CouncilCrawley Borough CouncilEast Sussex County CouncilExeter City CouncilHarlow District CouncilHastings Borough CouncilHyndburn Borough CouncilIpswich Borough CouncilNorfolk County CouncilNorwich City CouncilPendle Borough CouncilPeterborough City CouncilPreston City CouncilRedditch Borough CouncilRugby Borough CouncilStevenage Borough CouncilSuffolk County CouncilTamworth Borough CouncilThurrock CouncilWelwyn Hatfield Borough CouncilWest Lancashire Borough CouncilWest Sussex County CouncilWorthing Borough Council",

He said it was \"a very hard blow\" for the region and for tourism.\"Nature as it created the bow, has taken it back\", he added.Passers-by first noticed the absence of the natural landmark on Sunday morning.Officials have suggested severe weather brought by a storm named Oriana - which has battered southern Italy in recent days - accelerated the rock's erosion, causing its collapse.\"We have lost one of our region's defining characteristics, a symbolic asset,\" Puglia's regional president Antonio Decaro told reporters at the site on Monday.\"Unfortunately, natural processes are often accelerated by meteorological phenomena, such as the tail end of storm Oriana\", he said.Decaro said authorities needed to concentrate on attempting to slow coastal erosion and preserving the coast.The Salento region, where the arch was located, is one of Italy's most popular tourist areas.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSimon King,Lead weather presenterandJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesYellow weather warnings for ice and snow have been issued in parts of the UKAnother blast of Arctic air is set to sweep across the UK this week, bringing frost, ice and snow warnings.Yellow weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued by the Met Office for much of Scotland as well as northern and eastern England from later on Monday. Periods of sleet and snow are expected through Monday afternoon, evening and overnight with the potential for travel disruption.A separate yellow ice warning is in force for all of Northern Ireland from 20:00 GMT on Monday until 10:00 on Tuesday.The Met Office warned commuters to remain vigilant due to the risk of black ice and slippery conditions.The yellow warnings include:Snow and ice for northern Scotland from 15:00 GMT on Monday through to 10:00 TuesdayIce for southern Scotland and much of northern and eastern England from 18:00 on Monday to 10:00 TuesdayIce for all of Northern Ireland from 20:00 GMT on Monday until 10:00 on Tuesday.Several snow and ice warnings were in place over the weekend as frosty Arctic air spread across the country. Monday will bring blustery showers and a few brighter spells for much of the UK, with wintry showers continuing across Scotland and snow settling over higher ground.By Monday night, colder Arctic air will spread south, lowering snow levels across Scotland and increasing the risk of ice. Some snow showers are also possible across the North York Moors.Tuesday is expected to be mostly dry and sunny for many, but with temperatures only reaching 3C (37.4F) to 6C (42.8F) and a brisk northerly wind, it will feel colder - particularly in eastern areas where wind chill could make it feel close to freezing.Temperatures are set to fall close to freezing for most of the UK on Wednesday morning. In parts of northern and north-east Scotland, temperatures could fall to -8C and -10C. Further ice warnings may come into force.Weather conditions will become more unsettled again on Wednesday with a band of rain pushing in from the south and west. This could bring a mix of rain, sleet and hill snow, according to the Met Office. The forecaster said the system is being monitored closely with the potential for further snow warnings.Later in the week, conditions are expected to turn drier and milder.Meanwhile, 75 flood warnings and 189 flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency across England - concentrated in the south and the Midlands - following a long spell of wet weather.Jonathan Day, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said more than 24,000 homes and businesses have been protected but about 330 have been flooded.With further heavy rain forecast for southern England and South Wales on Wednesday, and the ground already saturated, more flood warnings or alerts could be issued.Natural Resources Wales issued three flood alerts on Sunday - for South Pembrokeshire, Vyrnwy catchment and the Lower Severn catchment in Powys.More on this story",

    "body": "15 hours agoAlex ForsythPolitical correspondentReutersThe government is aware it can't afford to get SEND reforms wrongIn the next few weeks, the government is expected to outline its plan to overhaul the crucial yet complex system of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in England - and it could prove contentious.The SEND system is vital to hundreds of thousands of parents and children in England.Almost every MP will tell you it's an issue that regularly tops their inboxes; last month, the prime minister acknowledged SEND was probably raised with him more than any other topic in the House of Commons.Given the strength of feeling, it's perhaps no surprise that some Labour MPs have been nervous about what the government is planning, mindful of previous missteps on issues of public concern like winter fuel payments and welfare.With the prime minister's authority and judgement having been openly questioned by some in his own party in recent days, it's even more crucial for the government that they get this right.And SEND reform is an issue fraught with potential pitfalls.PA MediaStrength of feeling among parents runs high and MPs warn of an erosion of trust in the SEND system\"The problem is there's such a huge trust deficit between parents and government on this issue,\" one Labour backbencher said.\"They know the current system doesn't work, but they worry a new system won't make it better and might make it worse and there's not enough trust in the bank to be able to trade on that.\"Few would dispute the need to reform the SEND system. In recent years demand has spiralled upwards, with a record one in five children in England now requiring support.Many parents find themselves facing a system under strain, with provision patchy and families often locked in lengthy legal battles to get support for their children.Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that spending on special educational needs and disabilities will have more than doubled in real terms by 2028–29 as compared with 2015–16, and councils have been racking up debts as the cost of support outstrips budgets, leading to warnings of a \"total system collapse\".Sources close to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson say she is prepared to \"grasp the nettle\" and take the difficult but necessary decisions, driven by the belief that reform is essential to provide children with the support they need.But the government has been treading carefully. The schools white paper setting out SEND reforms was delayed last year, with ministers taking time to engage in a series of \"listening exercises\" with parents and professionals in the sector.The thinking within government is clear. Ministers favour inclusive mainstream education for more children with special educational needs, where from the early years they get the support they require within local mainstream schools, with specialist school places for those with complex needs.A series of recent announcements have been described as a \"downpayment\" on the government's approach and commitment to funding; in December, there was £3bn to create places for children with SEND in mainstream schools, followed this year by £200m to train teachers in supporting children with SEND and £1bn to create suitable spaces in mainstream school buildings.The government has also agreed to clear £5bn worth of debts that councils have built up, and take on responsibility for SEND funding from 2028.One backbench Labour MP said they were \"reassured\" by the announcements so far. \"It builds my confidence in the fact they're serious about what needs to be done at the get go on this,\" they said.But they said they were still waiting and watching for the detail of the government's wider plan.A potential flashpoint is what the government decides to do regarding Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) – the legal documents that underpin a child's right to support.Official government figures show the number of these plans increased by 166% between January 2015 and January 2025, from 240,000 to 639,000.There is a school of thought – articulated by parliament's education select committee in a report last year – that providing the support children need from the earliest stages in mainstream school settings will mean fewer parents need to go down the often difficult and adversarial route of pursuing an EHCP to access help.But MPs are aware that parents fear any erosion of legal rights, with an active campaign underway called Save Our Children's Rights petitioning the government.\"I think probably the key is if a parent can stand up and demonstrate they and their child have got fewer rights today than they had yesterday, that'll be the killer blow,\" said one Labour backbencher.\"This is where the trust problem comes. I can tell you we're going to put loads of support into mainstream and then it will get better, the trouble is we've lost so much trust and confidence with the public – not just this Labour government but the whole SEND system.\"The government has insisted current support and legal entitlements will not be removed, but has not ruled out future changes to the system.There are Labour MPs who feel encouraged, with one describing \"thoughtful thinking\" that is taking place in government.But even among those who are optimistic there is caution, given the complexity and scale of the issue, with repeated warnings that the government has to \"keep engaging\" with parents and people working in the sector.Some argue the government needs to go further. The County Councils Network has warned the government not to \"duck\" reforms, saying in order to improve outcomes for children, costs have to be \"tackled and curtailed\" and there should be legislative change to focus EHCPs on those most in need.Every party in Westminster has acknowledged the need to reform England's SEND system.The Conservatives and the Green Party have not set out clear policies.The Liberal Democrats have outlined fundamental principles including a \"fair funding system\" that incentivises schools to accept SEND pupils, while Reform UK is developing its own SEND policy after the party's deputy leader, Richard Tice, said some parents were \"abusing the system\" – limiting the support for those \"genuinely in need\".The challenge for the government is delivering reforms bold enough to improve a system under enormous strain without alienating parents or leading to a backlash from its own MPs – all within constrained budgets. It's no wonder they're treading carefully.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesDemonstrators in Paris carried flags calling for justice during a rally paying tribute to Quentin Deranque over the weekendFrance's radical left is under pressure after the killing of a student in Lyon was blamed on \"anti-fascist\" militants.Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student and nationalist activist, died on Saturday, two days after being beaten up on the street by a group of young men.State prosecutor Thierry Dran told a news conference on Monday afternoon in Lyon that a murder investigation has been opened into the death.He said that Deranque was kicked and punched by \"at least six\" individuals, and that the autopsy showed fatal damage to his skull and brain.On Thursday afternoon Deranque had given support to a hard-right feminist collective Némésis, which staged a small protest against a left-wing politician's visit to Lyon's Institute of Political Studies (IEP), commonly known as Sciences-Po.Mobile phone video footage taken a few streets away from the protest's location showed three young men being kicked and punched by a larger group. One person - believed to be Quentin - remained lying on the ground.According to Dran, there was an initial confrontation between two groups. A short time later Deranque was one of three nationalist activists who, having failed to get away, were cornered by the opposing group.Ministers from President Macron's centre-right government blamed \"far-left\" militants for the killing.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said: \"Manifestly it was the far-left that was at work … This was a mob-killing, with blows that the perpetrators probably did not intend to be fatal.\"According to Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, \"it is the far-left that killed him. Of that there is no question.\"Dran said investigations were continuing to identify the suspects but no arrests had yet been made.In a tense political atmosphere ahead of important municipal elections next month, all eyes on Monday were on the radical left party France Unbowed (LFI) and a banned security outfit La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) that in the past helped provide protection at its rallies.Members from the Némésis collective – whose demonstration Thursday was against a meeting given by LFI euro-deputy Rima Hassan - said they recognised activists from La Jeune Garde in the group that initially disrupted their protest. The group has denied involvement. Two of the seven Némésis protesters were attacked and hurt in that first confrontation, Dran said.Hassan on Friday condemned the incident and called for an investigation. In a post on X, she said LFI provided the only security protection for her during the visit and that they were \"in no way\" involved in the violence.The Deranque family's lawyer, Fabrice Rajon, said Deranque \"was not a security agent or the member of any kind of protection group.  \"He had never been involved in trouble … He defended his convictions in a non-violent way.\"Friends told French media that Deranque had rediscovered his Catholic faith in recent years and was active in nationalist politics.Alice Cordier, of Némésis, said Deranque was one of \"15 or so young boys\" who the collective asked to provide protection at their demonstration.\"It wasn't a professional security service, just friends who came to protect the girls.\"Dran told the news conference that after the beating Deranque was able to start walking home with one of his friends. But en route it became clear that he was in a deteriorating medical state, and the emergency services were called.Right-wing politicians were outspoken in their denunciation of LFI, saying it had a clear responsibility for encouraging violence by so-called \"antifa\" - anti-fascist militants.Euro-deputy Marion Maréchal - niece of National Rally leader Marine Le Pen - said: \"The militia of [LFI leader Jean-Luc] Mélenchon has killed and has blood on its hands.\"According to Laurent Wauquiez, parliamentary leader of the centre-right Republicans: \"Quentin fell beneath the blows of monsters guided by hate and blinded by violence.\"Bruno Retailleau, who last week declared himself a candidate for the Republicans in next year's presidential elections, said: \"Jean-Luc Mélenchon … contrary to what you claim, it is not the police that kills in France, it is the far-left.\"On Sunday Mélenchon said his party had \"nothing to do with this story. Those who accuse us are committing a libel.\"We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends. We have said dozens of times that we oppose all forms of violence.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterGetty ImagesIntermittent fasting may not help people who are overweight or obese lose weight, a large review suggests.The researchers say the popular practice of fasting on some days of the week and eating normally on others \"may make little to no difference to weight loss and quality of life\". But they say intermittent fasting could still improve overall health through helpful changes to some body functions, though more evidence is needed.Examples of intermittent fasting include the 5:2 diet and restricting eating to a short window - often about eight hours - every day.The research team looked at the results of 22 previous studies involving nearly 2,000 adults to find out if short-term intermittent fasting (over a period up to 12 months) was better at helping adults lose weight than standard dietary advice, or no advice at all.Intermittent fasting is a fairly new approach to losing weight, and has gained popularity in recent years. Different types include:only eating during a set period each dayfasting on certain days of the weekalternating between days of eating normally and days of eating very littleCompared to giving people traditional advice on dieting, such as reducing calorie intake and eating more healthily, the review found intermittent fasting made little to no difference to people's weight loss or quality of life. It also made little to no difference compared to those offered no advice or who were waiting for advice on weight loss, although the effect on quality of life was not clear.Although the researchers say they are \"moderately confident\" on these findings, they are less confident about the results comparing standard dieting and intermittent fasting.Most of the studies they looked at did not use the most robust methods and included small numbers of people, making it difficult to work out the true effects. Luis Garegnani, lead review author from the Universidad Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, said he was concerned by the online hype around fasting.\"Intermittent fasting may be a reasonable option for some people, but the current evidence doesn't justify the enthusiasm we see on social media,\" he said.But the researchers also agree that everyone is different and some people could benefit. \"Doctors will need to take a case-by-case approach when advising an overweight adult on losing weight,\" said senior review author Eva Madrid.The review, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, says more research is needed to look at the impact of intermittent fasting on other aspects of people's health, such as the status of their type 2 diabetes and other underlying health conditions, and how satisfied it made them feel.It also said there were many different types of intermittent fasting and more detail was needed on how they could impact men and women separately, in addition to those with different BMIs and from different countries.The studies in this review took place in Europe, North America, China, Australia and South America.'Public perception'Dr Baptiste Leurent, associate professor in medical statistics at University College London said, taken together, the individual studies \"provide a clear indication that intermittent fasting offers little benefit\".\"This is yet another example of a misalignment between public perception and the scientific evidence,\" he added.Prof Keith Frayn, emeritus professor of human metabolism at the University of Oxford, said intermittent fasting had been widely promoted as a means of achieving weight loss - often on the basis of claims it had \"special effects on metabolism\".\"This study shows that such claims can have little relevance,\" he said, adding that there were no \"quick fixes\" for those who are overweight or obese beyond reducing calorie intake.It is widely accepted that many people find intermittent fasting a good way to avoid putting on weight, although this wasn't researched in the review. Around 1.6 million adults in the UK are thought to be using injections such as Wegovy and Mounjaro to lose weight - mostly bought through private prescriptions rather than on the NHS.A recent study found people who stop using the weight loss jabs can put weight back on four times faster than those who stop conventional dieting and exercising.",

He said: \"Let's be clear, this isn't just the potential collapse of a brand, this is people's jobs, this is people's rent, how they pay their bills and their childcare and yet they are being informed about the sale of their employer through the press. That is morally unacceptable.\"We need clarity on jobs. If there are going to be redundancies, they need to be informed as soon as possible, legally and morally, because they cannot have job losses with consultation and without ensuring they get the maximum they are due.\"PA MediaThe company announced the closure of 10 bars across the UK last year. Brewdog was founded by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie in 2007 and now has bars and breweries around the world, including about 60 in the UK.The company sold a 22.3% stake to San Francisco-based private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners in 2017.That came a few months after job cuts were announced across the business after it posted a £37m loss.In recent years it has made headlines for its marketing campaigns and workplace culture.Brewdog faced backlash in 2024 after revealing it would no longer hire new staff on the real living wage, instead paying the lower legal minimum wage.",

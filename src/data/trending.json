    "body": "8 hours agoMengchen Zhang, Jack Lau and Ankur ShahBBC Global China Unit and Eye InvestigationsBBCWarning: This report contains details of physical and sexual abuse and discussion of suicide.Baobao's heart still races when she smells soil after morning rain.It takes her back to early military drills behind locked gates - and the constant fear that marked every one of her days at Lizheng Quality Education School.For six months, aged 14, she barely left the red and white building in a remote Chinese village where instructors tried to \"fix\" young people whose families considered them rebellious or problematic.Students who failed to comply were beaten so severely they could not sleep on their backs or sit down for days, she says.\"Every single moment was agonising,\" says Baobao, now 19 and speaking under a pseudonym for fear of retribution.She says she considered suicide, and knows other students who attempted it.'Raped and beaten'A BBC Eye investigation has uncovered multiple allegations of physical abuse in the school and others in the same network, and cases of young people being abducted and taken to the institutions.Corporal punishment has been banned in China for decades, but we have collated testimony from 23 former students who say they were beaten or forced to do extreme amounts of exercise. One says she was raped, and two others, including Baobao, say they were sexually assaulted or harassed, all by instructors.Undercover filming has exposed how staff pose as authorities to forcibly transfer young people to their institutions.Thirteen students say they were abducted, with parental consent, by employees pretending to be police or officials.The accounts - from interviews by the BBC World Service, statements gathered by activists, police reports and state media - relate to five schools. These are part of a network of at least 10 schools, all of which have been run by - or have close links to - a military veteran called Li Zheng.Baobao says every single moment at the school was \"agonising\"The centres are part of a booming industry promising anxious parents that military-style discipline will resolve concerns over young people's disobedience, internet addiction, teenage dating and depression, as well as gender and sexual identity. Some parents even send over-18s, who are legally adults.A series of abuse allegations have made headlines in China in recent years, in both Li Zheng schools and others.In a few cases, arrests have been made or institutions shut down, but schools can be quick to reopen with different names or in different locations because the sector has been difficult to regulate. The BBC understands that Mr Li was arrested earlier this year, but we have discovered his associates have recently opened a new school.Companies and individuals involved in the network could either not be reached or declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in the UK told the BBC all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations.'Deeply offensive' body searchBaobao says her mother took her to the Lizheng Quality Education School in Hunan province when she began skipping classes, triggering rows which made their already difficult relationship worse.Her mother left while she was being shown around the school, she says, and she then realised she was not allowed to leave: \"They said if I behaved well, I might be able to get out.\"Baobao initially tried to kick and punch the instructors, she says, but decided to comply when they tried to restrain her with her own shoelaces. Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the schoolA staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.\"They forcibly dragged me into the car. My parents stood by as I was taken away,\" she says.Enxu says she was beaten and raped at the disciplinary school she was taken to at the age of 19She was taken to Shengbo Youth Psychological Growth Training School in Hunan where she says she was beaten, leaving her with hearing loss in one ear, and later raped.In the undercover footage from the school Baobao attended, a staff member says there are no beatings: \"We change the behaviour of youngsters with military training and counselling.\"But Baobao and Enxu describe a very different experience.\"Corporal punishment is ever-present,\" says Baobao. \"If your dance routines or military boxing lack precision, or are poorly executed, you will be punished.\"She said the instructors would use a pipe, raising it overhead before \"bringing it down with force\" on her classmates. \"Where they hit you would turn black. You get severe bruising.\"Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessionsBaobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the handSocial pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.Viral lettersEnxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online. They went viral and as public pressure grew, the police intervened and she was allowed to leave.Twelve days later, authorities announced Shengbo school was closing, but made no reference to the abuse Enxu alleged, saying, however, that the school had violated administrative regulations.She says the police later told her Li Zheng had been arrested, accused of involvement in organised crime. The police did not respond to BBC requests for information about Enxu's case and Mr Li. The local education department have also not responded.Secret filmingUndercover footage shows students doing military-style drills at a new school set up by former employees of Li Zheng schoolsMr Li keeps a relatively low public profile. The BBC has analysed his network and found it operates disciplinary schools across four provinces through a complex set of companies registered to him or his close associates.He founded his first centre in 2006 and has owned four different education companies at different times.The website of one of his organisations says he is a graduate of a Chinese Air Force academy in southern China, and worked as a \"director of training\" and \"senior psychological counsellor\" at several schools from 2007.On local television in Hunan province, he once spoke about nurturing young people with \"love and patience\".Chinese authorities have intervened before, following allegations about schools in the network.An instructor at a different Li Zheng school was detained by police in 2019 after allegations he had beaten students with water pipes.Also, according to Chinese media reports, the school Baobao attended was ordered to stop admissions after a student suicide in 2020. She was there at the time and says it continued to operate over that period. It changed its name soon afterwards.Mu Zhou, an Australia-based volunteer who has been helping document allegations of abuse, says \"whenever there's public outcry, he [Li Zheng] would alter the name or change the legal representative\". He also says students are bussed between different sites to avoid inspections.'Huge profits'Two undercover researchers recently visited what may be the latest addition to the Li Zheng network.Posing as investors in the Hong Kong education sector, the researchers set up a meeting with three former employees of Li Zheng schools, in a new school they have set up in Fujian.\"The profits in this industry are huge,\" Li Yunfeng, the director of counselling at the new school, told them. He outlined how the business model could work in Hong Kong, suggesting fees of at least $25,000 (£19,000) per student annually.He declined to disclose the name of their boss, but said he was \"a veteran\".He appeared to distance himself from the network, however, telling the undercover researchers: \"There were some incidents. The parents lodged a complaint. The group... though not formally dissolved yet, it's teetering on the brink of collapse. That's why I stepped out.\"Secret filmingLi Yunfeng told undercover researchers the previous group was \"on the brink of collapse\" but he is helping open a new schoolThe BBC was not able to reach Li Zheng, Li Yunfeng and other schools and companies linked to Li Zheng and his associates for comment, despite multiple attempts.The staff member who provided a tour of the Quality Education for Teenagers school declined to comment. The education department which oversees the school could not be reached, despite multiple attempts.Regulating these disciplinary centres is difficult. Some are not registered as schools. The responsibility is split between local education, civil affairs and market regulation authorities, a Chinese lawyer familiar with lawsuits against such institutions, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC.Dr Rao says that with no centralised regulation over the disciplinary schools, the responsibility tends to fall to local government.He describes it as a \"shadowy industry that the state just tolerates\", adding that the state may not wish to give it legitimacy by providing regulation or guidelines.But, he adds, there is a \"spectrum\" of schools, with some incorporating psychotherapy for students and training for parents, or disciplining staff who carry out corporal punishment.The Chinese embassy in London said the government \"attaches great importance to the lawful operation of educational institutions and the protection of minors\". It says all educational institutions \"are required to comply with relevant laws and regulations\".'Terribly sad'Enxu and her friend Wang want to see all disciplinary schools shut down. They work to gather video evidence of abuse and abduction, believing this is crucial to get the police to investigate, sometimes posting it online.Wang often receives requests from students. He has helped with the logistics of escape attempts and by pressuring schools to allow students to leave.Baobao never returned to education, which she says makes her feel \"terribly sad\". She now makes a living through online streaming and gaming, but believes she might have gone to university if she had not been sent to the Lizheng Quality Education School.\"These schools are essentially scams,\" she says.\"The prevailing educational ethos is one of violence begetting violence… the very concept is fundamentally flawed,\" she says, adding that they \"simply shouldn't exist\".Details of organisations offering information and support with mental health, distress or despair, or sexual abuse or violence, are available at BBC ActionLine.Additional reporting by Alex Mattholie and Shanshan Chen",

The Trump administration has been defending its seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast.  In a dramatic video shared by the US Attorney General, armed camouflaged soldiers are shown swinging down ropes from low flying helicopters, and running along the vessel’s decks. \nThe US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".  The Venezuela government in response has called the seizure blatant theft, claiming Trump is after the country’s rich oil and energy resources. \nIn this episode, Sarah and Justin unpack how far Donald Trump is willing to go in his ongoing campaign against the Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.   In recent months, the US president has accused Maduro of “forcing” criminals into the US and facilitating drug smuggling, which Maduro denies.  And this week, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the killing of over 80 people in US military strikes on alleged drug boats as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere”.  \nThe Americast team also look at how this fits in with other South American countries, with Trump recently offering Honduran ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández a ‘full and complete pardon’.   \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "51 minutes agoVanessa ClarkeEducation reporterGetty ImagesThe government has promised to create 50,000 more places for children with special educational needs (Send) in mainstream schools in England.It plans to invest £3bn over the next three years, partly funded by cancelling the building of some planned free schools.Councils - who will receive the funding - have argued the money needs to be diverted to the right areas and to the people who know what is needed in their local communities.Nearly 1.7 million pupils receive support for special educational needs in schools in England, with the number rising every year.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the investment would lay the groundwork for the Send reforms announced in the schools White Paper early next year. The White Paper had been due to be published in the autumn, but was delayed.The government says it plans to cancel the building of 28 new mainstream free schools following a consultation and that it is reviewing a further 16 sites.\"We have made the decision not to go ahead with some schools where we've seen falling rolls because of pupil numbers and investing that money into provision for children with Send\", Ms Phillipson told the BBC. Councils will be able to use the money from the cancelled projects to adapt existing school buildings and create more specialist spaces, so pupils are less likely to have to travel far for their education.For example, they could create areas like breakout spaces for children who may need more support, or rooms to support children with autism or ADHD who may feel overstimulated in the classroom.There are also 77 proposed special free schools which local authorities can decide to build, or similarly, use the funding to create the equivalent number of specialist places elsewhere.The Conservatives described the cancellation of some planned free schools as \"education vandalism\".Shadow education secretary Laura Trott said Labour was \"taking away new schools which parents want. Free schools raise standards and outperform other state schools.\"And not content with that, the government has halted shovel-ready, worked-up special schools, and replaced them with a smaller pot of money and no plan.\"The Liberal Democrats welcomed the funding, but said it needed to be \"be matched by ambitious reforms to diagnosis and support\".Councillor Amanda Hopgood from the Local Government Association says the Send places needed to be in the right location.\"If we build a big school in the middle of nowhere that we have to transport everyone to, then that's money that isn't used on education\".\"And those children are not being educated in their local communities where they live with their friends\". Local authorities spent £1.5bn on transport for under-16s with Send in the 2023-24 financial year, about two-and-a-half times what it was in 2015-16.Headteachers' unions have welcomed the plans.However, the school leaders' union NAHT says investment in buildings is only one part of the picture, and that there would need to be sufficient teachers and leaders \"with the right level of specialist training\". At Ninestiles, an academy in Birmingham, just under 50 students with an education, health and care plan (EHCP) - a legal document outlining the support that a young person is entitled to - spend around 70% of their time in mainstream lessons. The rest of the time, they take part in bespoke lessons to support their needs, where they get access to specially-trained staff and a tailored curriculum. Demand for these places is high and the government says the extra investment means councils would be able to meet local need faster.But Principal Alex Hughes says \"the devil will be in the detail\" and in \"what it translates to\" for individual schools. Student Brendan, 14, who attends Ninestiles has access to the full curriculum but also can attend the resource hub, where he is supported by teachers. He has the \"best of both worlds\", according to his mum Laura Jerram who says the pastoral support he has received has been \"the key to keeping him in the school\".But Brendan's journey to get to this point has been \"really difficult\".He missed a lot of primary school before he came to Ninestiles and the process of getting an EHCP was \"a horrible journey\", Ms Jerram explains.\"It's a bit of a bun fight [to get an EHCP] and the most resourced families tend to come out on top, unfortunately.\"I feel that for Brendan, if he'd had support much earlier on, he may not have fallen out of education the way he did.\"Gemma Laister/BBCMum Laura Jerram says trying to get an EHCP for her son was a horrible journey and families need help much earlier onMany parents are unhappy and frustrated with the way the system is currently working with the National Audit Office (NAO) warning that despite increased investment, outcomes for students have not improved.The number of parents taking councils to court over issues with Send provision reached a record high in 2024-2025, figures by the Ministry of Justice revealed on Thursday.There were 25,000 Send appeals, up 18% from the previous year, with most disagreements over the content of EHCPs.The free schools which will not go ahead will now go through a consultation period. Plans by Eton College to open selective sixth-form centres in Dudley and Oldham have been approved, but its Middlesbrough proposal is earmarked for cancellation. Free schools are publicly funded but are privately run by academy trusts, universities, charities, or faith groups.Additional reporting by Kate McGough and Hazel Shearing",

    "body": "2 hours agoSima KotechaSenior UK correspondentGetty ImagesChanging attitudes among boys and young men will be at the centre of the government's strategy to tackle violence against women and girls, the BBC has been told.Next Thursday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will unveil the long-delayed plan about how to combat what ministers call a \"national emergency\".It comes after the publication of the strategy has been delayed three times over the last year.The Labour government has pledged to halve the rate of violence against women and girls over the next decade - but critics have questioned its commitment to combating the problem.There are also likely to be concerns as to why the strategy is being published on the day Parliament breaks up for its Christmas holiday.BBC News has been told the violence against women and girls (VAWG) strategy will be built around three goals: preventing radicalisation of young men, stopping abusers, and supporting victims.Over the coming week, the government will announce a policy blitz to tackle what government sources have called \"the scourge of violence that has left the lives of women and girls shattered\".As part of the strategy, ministers will focus on prevention and tackling the root causes of radicalisation of young men in their schools, homes and online. They will work with teachers to challenge misogyny and promote healthy relationships.Government sources say more support will be provided to parents so they can intervene early.They say that is because violence against women and girls is happening at younger ages. Nearly 40% of teenagers in relationships are victims of abuse, according to domestic abuse charity Reducing the Risk.Critics have questioned the Labour government after delays to the strategyOnline influencers are partly blamed for fuelling this. It's been reported more than one in five young men hold a positive view of the self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate.Over the last year alone, one in every eight women was a victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking, according to Home Office figures.The statistics also show that every day about 200 rapes are recorded by the police, and many more go unreported. Hundreds of thousands of children are estimated to be sexually abused every year.Earlier this week, MPs on the justice committee wrote to the government complaining about the strategy being delayed.The letter was signed by the committee's chair, Andy Slaughter MP, who said: \"Repeated delays in publications sends the message that tackling VAWG is not a government priority, despite the ambition to halve VAWG within the next decade.\"The strategy will have a cross-government approach including collaboration between the Home Office, Department of Health and Social Care, Ministry of Justice, Department for Education, and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, the BBC was told.\"There will also be a raft of new measures, so rapists and sex offenders have nowhere to hide.  We will track down abusers, empower police forces with the tools they need to do so and put abusers on a course to stop their offending\", a government source said.But it is not yet clear what these tools will be.'Proof in the pudding'Hayley Johns is a survivor of domestic abuse and said the \"proof will be in the pudding\".\"If you're going to be saying all these words, make sure it works. We're in absolute crisis when it comes to domestic violence. The actions must match your words otherwise it's pointless.\"There needs to be proof and statistics to show this strategy is working and in a year's time there needs to be a difference otherwise it's just rubbish.\"The government also wants to support victims who say failures by police and delays in court are worse than the offences themselves. More than half of rape and stalking cases collapse because victims drop out of the process.Many victims feel intimidated in their own homes and by economic abuse and coercive controlling behaviour, including stalking.The strategy will aim to better support them, while justice is done.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJoe McFaddenHealth reporterRose StokesRose Stokes is a freelance journalist and mother of twoAfter giving birth to her second child, Rose Stokes was exhausted all the time. \"I couldn't really do anything more than the bare minimum in terms of looking after my kids. I'd put them down at seven and have to get straight into bed,\" the freelance journalist says.Rose thought it was just what being a mum of two young children was like.But being tired wasn't the only problem. \"I also had other symptoms, like my hair was falling out.\"I had a funny, metallic taste [in my mouth] all the time. I kept getting tongue ulcers as well and [experienced] breathlessness and dizziness.\"I went to the doctor's a few times and every time was told, 'oh well, you're a mum of small children, what do you expect?' - but the level of exhaustion was just so intense,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.After several visits to her doctor, Rose requested a blood test which showed low levels of the protein ferritin.While Rose's first doctor initially dismissed her ferritin levels as, in her words, \"not being that low\", she managed to see another doctor who eventually gave her a diagnosis - iron deficiency.It's a relatively common problem, especially in women. Around 8% of women have it, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, while far fewer men are affected  – only 3% in the UK.Pregnancy - like Rose had just experienced - is a common cause.Rose's symptoms - tiredness, dizziness and tongue ulcers - are just some of the things to look out for.Other common symptoms can include shortness of breath, heart palpitations, paler than usual skin and headaches, while some people could experience rarer symptoms like tinnitus, restless legs syndrome and hair loss.For her deficiency, Rose was initially prescribed iron tablets - the most common form of treatment - but, despite trying three different ones, found none of them agreed with her.Dr Sue Pavord, a consultant haematologist at NHS Hospitals Oxford, says taking iron tablets first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a glass of water or some Vitamin C is the best approach - otherwise you risk them not working effectively. After she responded badly to tablets, Rose's doctor referred her for an iron infusion - a way of quickly getting iron into your bloodstream.This can be \"transformative for women with severe deficiency\", Dr Pavord says, but she also stresses that tablets can work \"extremely well\" so it's important to try them first.But what you eat can also help limit your risk of becoming iron deficient in the first place, according to Dr Pavord.She suggests foods which contain absorbable iron like red meat, chicken, liver and fish. Vegetables like spinach, kale and broccoli also contain iron, but the body doesn't absorb it from these sources as effectively as meat.Two-and-a-half months on from her infusion, Rose says she feels like \"a completely different person\".\"I can do stuff. Initially it was just like getting to the end of the day and being like, right, we can sit and watch some TV or being able to get up with the kids in the morning and not feeling like I was dying.\"",

    "body": "26 minutes agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterThe UK's economy shrank unexpectedly in October, according to the latest official figures.The economy contracted by 0.1%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, whereas economists had been expecting it to grow by 0.1%.Over the three months to the end of October the economy also shrank by 0.1%, as manufacturing output fell and services growth stalled, the ONS said.\"Within production, there was continued weakness in car manufacturing, with the industry only making a slight recovery in October from the substantial fall in output seen in the previous month,\" ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said.The government has made economic growth one of its key priorities.A Treasury spokesperson said the government was working to boost economic growth through reducing energy bills and major infrastructure investments. \"We are determined to defy the forecasts on growth and create good jobs, so everyone is better off, while also helping us invest in better public services,\" the spokesperson said.Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride blamed the Budget for the unexpected economic contraction.\"For months, Rachel Reeves has misled the British public. She said she wouldn't raise taxes on working people - she broke that promise again. She insisted there was a black hole in the public finances - but there wasn't.\"Over the three months to October, production output shrank by 0.5%, largely driven by a 17.7% fall in vehicle manufacturing.The cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover halted production at its plants across the UK for the whole of September, and there was a staged return to factory activity from early October.The resumption of vehicle manufacturing helped lift production output across the UK for that month, which grew by 1.1%.However, the ONS noted the rebound in vehicle manufacturing had been small, as it was still well below levels seen in August.The services sector, which includes areas such as professional services and retailing, did not grow at all in the three months to October.Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the surprise contraction in the economy strengthened the case for the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its meeting next week.\"It's striking that the economy has only grown in one of the past seven months,\" she said.Jack Meaning, UK chief economist at Barclays bank and a former adviser at the Bank of England, told the BBC's Today programme the figures showed the economy was \"unambiguously weak\".\"It's continuing the story we've seen more or less all the way through this year of growth decelerating from relatively strong numbers at the start to much weaker numbers now, and actually outright contraction,\" he said.\"Ultimately part of the story today is that we didn't see as much of a bounce-back of that Jaguar Land Rover closure as we had expected. We thought that would all bounce back pretty quickly; it looks like it might take a little bit longer.\"Mr Meaning added that data from Barclays indicated that the uncertainty ahead of the Budget weighed on the economy as people \"held off purchases and big spending decisions\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris VallanceSenior technology reporterGoogle has announced plans to team up with the UK to invite researchers to come up with uses for the tech giant's state-of-the-art quantum chip Willow.It is one of several firms competing to develop a powerful quantum computer - which is seen as an exciting new frontier in the future of computing.Researchers hope they will be able to crack problems in fields such as chemistry and medicine which are impossible for current computers to solve.Professor Paul Stevenson of the University of Surrey - who had no involvement with the agreement - told the BBC it was \"great news for UK researchers\".The collaboration between Google and the UK's national lab for quantum computing means more researchers will get access to the technology.\"The new ability to access Google's Willow processor, through open competition, puts UK researchers in an enviable position,\" said Prof Stevenson. \"It is good news for Google, too, who will benefit from the skills of UK academics.\"What is quantum computing, and will it be bigger than AI?Quantum devices work in a fundamentally different way to the computers powering our smartphones and laptops, solving problems using technologies based on the science of particle physicsBut the full potential of the technology has yet to be realised and the machines that currently exist have few practical applications and most are experimental.It is hoped giving UK researchers access to Willow would help \"uncover new real world applications\".Scientists will be able to submit proposals describing how they intend to use the chip, and they will work with experts from Google and the UK quantum lab to design and conduct experiments. When it was unveiled in 2024, Google's Willow chip was seen as a significant step forward in the field.Rival firms including Amazon and IBM are also developing their own tech.The UK has a significant quantum industry. Quantinuum, which has headquarters in Cambridge and Colorado, US, reached a $10bn (£7.45bn) valuation in September.Announcements of new developments from firms throughout 2025 have led some experts to believe powerful machines capable of having real-world impact will be developed within a decade.Dr Michael Cuthbert, Director at the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) said the partnership would \"accelerate discovery\".He said the cutting edge science it would support could ultimately lead to quantum computing being used in areas such as \"life science, materials, chemistry, and fundamental physics\".The NQCC already hosts seven quantum computers from British-based firms such as Quantum Motion, ORCA and Oxford Ionics.The government says it is committing £670m to support the tech, which is a priority area in the UK's Industrial Strategy. Officials believe quantum could contribute £11 billion to the UK economy by 2045.",

    "body": "7 hours agoA grim flu forecast for the UK in the lead up to Christmas is dominating the papers on Friday, with the Guardian describing it as the \"worst ever winter crisis\" as serious cases reach record levels. The NHS has warned that the outbreak is yet to peak and things will get worse in the days ahead, with GPs, hospitals and ambulance services already under \"intense strain\".The highest flu case numbers are being reported in children at school, according to the i Paper, with children under five particularly affected. The NHS is urging vulnerable people to get vaccinated, with the caveat that it takes two weeks following the jab to reach full immunity.The Express is condemning the \"reckless\" planned strike by resident doctors next week, and writes that Health Secretary Wes Streeting has urged medical professionals to focus on tackling \"rocketing\" flu cases.\"Strikes may force NHS to collapse\" warns the health secretary in the Times. In an article for the paper, Streeting says that it will be the most challenging winter for the NHS since the pandemic. A fresh offer has been put before the British Medical Association, which has agreed to poll their members to see if they are willing to call off the five-day walkout. The results of the vote will be announced on Monday.Ticket prices for the World Cup 2026 have been announced, prompting \"fan outrage, the Daily Mirror reports. Its headline reads \"World Cup of greed\", emblazoned over a photo of US President Donald Trump and FIFA chief Gianni Infantino grinning at the White House. The Financial Times leads with objections from China, and a number of European Union nations, to the planned exemptions for US multinationals from global tax obligations. According to the paper, this raises the risk of the Trump administration issuing a \"revenge tax\" on backers of the OECD's proposed tax regime.Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is quoted on the front page of the Independent, after he warned that Europe must prepare for a conflict with Russia \"on the scale our grandparents endured\". Speaking in Berlin on Thursday, Rutte urged European nations to rapidly boost defence spending as a deterrent to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Telegraph also focuses on defence spending, following its interview with Minister for Armed Forces Alistair Carns. He told the paper that Nato countries, including the UK, must increase their \"lethality\", and stop relying on US security guarantees.Comments from Carns are also cited in the Daily Mail's headline, which reads: \"Britain is on a war footing\". Echoing the remarks made by Mark Rutte, the minister said that the \"shadow of war was at Europe's door\". \"Pubs ban MPs in tax raid fury\" says the Sun, reporting on a campaign lead by Taxed Out, which is encouraging hospitality businesses to bar Labour ministers in protest against higher tax bills. Four alleged art thieves have been captured on CCTV and splashed across the front page of Metro, after 600 objects of \"significant cultural value\" were stolen from the Bristol Museum's warehouse in September this year. The items had been housed in the warehouse since 2012, and included artefacts \"linked to Britain's colonial past\".The Star's headline reads \"Runaway in a manger\", following reports of a man on the run found hiding in an Italian nativity scene. The sharp rise in the number of flu patients is the focus of many of the front pages. The Guardian says the NHS is \"bracing\" itself for its \"worst winter crisis\" with cases expected to surge in the next fortnight. The Sun calls it a \"super flu-nami\". The i Paper reports that health leaders are urging those who are vulnerable to get vaccinated. The Daily Express says resident doctors are coming under \"mounting pressure\" to call off a planned five-day strike, due to start in England next week, to avoid putting further pressure on the health service.The Daily Telegraph reports that the armed forces minister, Al Carns, has said Britain must stop relying on the United States when it comes to defence. He says the country has depended on US security guarantees for the last sixty years, but he's now warning that President Trump's White House may pivot away from Europe.According to the Financial Times, HSBC has closed a \"prestigious\" fast-track management scheme that dates back to the bank's founding 160 years ago. The International Manager programme was set up to develop the next generation of HSBC executives, but sources have told the paper it's been closed to new recruits to help cut costs.The outrage of football fans at ticket prices for next year's men's World Cup is the focus of the front page of the Daily Mirror. Its headline is \"World Cup of greed\", after it emerged that the cheapest tickets for the final in the USA cost more than £3000.And a couple of the papers pick up on a study which says pop music has become gloomier over the past fifty years. Researchers from the University of Vienna have analysed more than 20,000 songs which appeared in the American charts between 1973 and 2023. The Times highlights that recent songs were found to contain more words linked to stress, and that lyrics were simpler. The Telegraph sums up the headline \"pop takes a dark turn\".Related Internet Links",

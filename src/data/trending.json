    "body": "1 hour agoAlex ForsythPolitical CorrespondentBBCReform UK could win more seats than any other party at the next general election - perhaps enough to form a government. Or so suggest repeated opinion polls, released since May. That was also when Reform won control of 10 English local authorities - so what does their first six months at the helm at local level tell us about what a UK government led by them could look like?Listen to Alex reading this articleLast month a leaked video recording showed Linden Kemkaran, Reform UK's leader in Kent, swearing at councillors from her own party and telling them to \"suck it up\" if they didn't agree with her.The footage became national news - insights into tensions within local government are, after all, rarely made public, and Kent is Reform UK's self-professed flagship council.Plenty of critics seized on the incident.Reform suspends four councillors after video leakLabour MPs in Kent labelled her \"unprofessional\" and \"not up to the job,\" and local Liberal Democrat and Green groups claimed Reform's running of the council had descended into chaos.Five of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party amid the upheaval. Kemkaran, meanwhile, remains firmly in post. And she has declared that it is \"business as usual\" at Kent County Council.To some the fallout was undoubtedly damaging and has prompted questions about whether this insurgent party, that is consistently topping national opinion polls, really is a credible force ready to run the country - something they are trying to prove.Danny Kruger, who is one of Reform's five MPs, has his own take. Last month he described the party as a bit of a pirate ship with an \"ill-disciplined\" crew and a \"buccaneering\" captain, but added: \"A powerful ship with a dangerous broadside, a terror to its rivals…\"The job… is to help turn this pirate ship into His Majesty's Royal Navy ship, ready to enter the King's service and serve our nation.\"Gareth Fuller / PAFive of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party. Linden Kemkaran (left) remains in postReform's performance at local government level can help start to give some insight into this: it has been exactly six months since the local elections that saw them take outright control of 10 English local authorities, including six of 21 county councils.In all it won 677 seats - more than any other party, amounting to 41% of the total up for election.So what can we learn from Reform's performance during its time at the helm of these authorities about how they lead - and how well they have so far fared on delivering their promises?These are, after all, promises that are not dissimilar in nature to those they would need to keep if they were successful in their bid to reach Number 10.Reform's own version of DOGEBefore the elections, Nigel Farage addressed a packed rally in Birmingham promising his party would \"send in the auditors… get rid of the fraudulent contracts… cut spending\" if it won.Shortly after their success in the local elections, Reform launched a \"DOGE\" unit, based on billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to cut spending in the US with a Department of Government Efficiency.A photo call on the steps of Kent County Council followed, with a promise that a team of soft ware engineers, data analysts and forensic auditors would \"visit and analyse\" local authorities to identify \"wasteful spending\".But the unit has run into legal challenges in accessing sensitive council data. So far it is reported to have visited only a handful of the councils in England that Reform controls.AFP via Getty ImagesLocal elections saw Reform UK take outright control of 10 English local authoritiesZia Yusuf, Reform's head of policy who led the DOGE team until last month, acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming \"overwhelming demands\" from Whitehall. Nonetheless he insists that hundreds of millions of pounds in savings have already been identified.\"The reality is there's a lot of information that can be shared… because it's in the public domain already,\" he says. \"[DOGE] has been working with every single one of our councils on an ongoing basis.\"He points to certain decisions by Kent County Council, including halting a planned office move and stopping net-zero schemes, as examples of the savings he says Reform has found.Councils spend the bulk of their budgets on statutory services that they have to provide by law, and the cost of these services has spiralled in recent years.The County Councils' Network, which represents some of England's largest local authorities, says its members spend on average 69% of their budgets on adult social care and children's services, with some spending up to 76% - an increase from 63% a decade ago.Carl Court /Getty ImagesZia Yusuf, a former Reform chairman, led the DOGE team until last monthReform's argument is that there's still \"waste\" to be found, with Yusuf saying: \"This idea that… because social care is statutory there's no point in finding those savings - we don't buy that.\"But Stuart Hoddinott, an associate director at the Institute for Government think tank, believes that the savings Reform have identified so far are \"minuscule\" in comparison to the financial challenge facing the sector.\"They've found things that are just so tiny to be completely insignificant or are cutting programmes that might actually end up saving money in the longer run. \"It has just been a complete sort of mirage so far... It's like somebody who makes £30,000 worrying about losing 2p per year.\"Budget pressures and a 'broken' systemThe pressure on council budgets across the country has been well-documented. Ahead of this year's spending review, the Local Government Association estimated councils would face a funding gap of £8.4bn by 2028/29.The controversial Kent council meeting, in which tensions boiled over, was a private discussion that seemed to focus, among other things, on both budgets and local government reorganisation.It is another illustration of how, when it comes to setting a budget, Reform is now facing many of the same challenges as parties that preceded it.Stuart Hoddinott acknowledges that Reform has entered a \"broken\" system, given the pressure on funding for statutory services and cuts already made across the board - but he accuses the party of \"bluster\" and \"outlandish promises\".\"They have focused on culture wars, things like 'Oh we'll just cut DEI (diversity equity and inclusion) programmes from local authorities and won't run a Pride flag up the pole every June, then that will solve our financial problems,'\" he argues.\"They were also very naive to think that they would be the ones to solve it [budget pressures] given that you have had 15 years of 300-odd local authorities all battling this and trying to come up with solutions.\"More from InDepthReform's DOGE unit has now had a change of personnel.Richard Tice, the party's deputy leader, has taken over, a change he says was simply a \"natural evolution\" from Yusuf.He has said billions can be saved, and that his focus will be on local government pension schemes, property and \"waste-related contracts\". The party, he adds, will also make announcements on support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, which is a cost pressure for councils.\"You'll be hearing over the next few weeks in areas where we have achieved savings, we have identified savings – and where we need to have some serious discussions about what actually is sensible in certain areas,\" he has said.But these are thorny issues that will likely prove controversial.PA MediaZia Yusuf (pictured with Nigel Farage) acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming 'overwhelming demands' from WhitehallTony Travers, a professor in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics, argues that any benefits would likely take time to filter through.\"Reforming the pension system… might produce benefits for local government in the medium term, but it's probably not going to do it for next May, next April,\" he says.\"That's the trouble. With a lot of these things, they can't be done quickly or as quickly as Reform needs.\"He believes that Reform's cost-cutting narrative was, ultimately, \"never realistic\" - and in his view the party is now facing the \"dawning reality\" of an \"extraordinary period of financial constraint\" that other councils have faced before them.Future of council tax risesNow, as councils begin the process of setting budgets for next year, the picture looks bleak for many - including those led by Reform.Lancashire is facing a budget gap of £100m over the next two years; in West Northamptonshire the council has warned of \"tough choices\" as it tries to plug a £50m gap; while Worcestershire has asked residents for their views on a potential council tax rise of 10%, combined with millions of pounds of cuts.And Warwickshire council - led by George Finch, who was just 19 years old when he took office this summer - warned of \"difficult decisions to come\".Getty ImagesGeorge Finch was just 19 years old when he took office this summerEven though the government has increased the amount of funding available to councils this year and is introducing a new method of allocating funding from next year, claiming it is \"fixing a broken system\", this all still poses a challenge for Reform UK, if it is to fully meet its promises to cut costs and save money.Early indications are that Reform-led councils will raise council tax from April 2026 – something acknowledged by both Richard Tice and Zia Yusuf - though both say the focus is on keeping increases low.\"We never said we would cut council tax,\" Tice says. \"But if you can identify the savings, identify what you shouldn't be doing… then we can achieve lower increases than anybody else.\"Yusuf suggested the rises were unlikely to exceed inflation levels.\"I would expect certainly [in] most of our councils [for] council tax not to go up by more - it is their decision, but it will be a rise in line with inflation, as opposed to the council going into bankruptcy or a rise much more than 5%,\" he says.His comments came before Reform-led Worcestershire signalled the possibility of a 10% rise.Kent's Linden Kemkaran told the BBC in a statement that the council would \"do everything we can to avoid raising council tax by the full amount\" - usually 5% is the maximum allowed - and was not planning to cut services in its search for savings.But keeping council tax relatively low often entails spending cuts – which might not prove popular.And the question now is whether Reform really can prove to be better custodians of public money than their predecessors – and avoid the effective bankruptcy that has hit some other local authorities, while providing value for money.Scaling up the challengeAt the start of the year, Reform UK, Labour and the Conservatives were all averaging about 25% in opinion polls registering voting intention. But in May that all changed: for more than five months Reform's average poll result has hovered around 30%, while the two other parties have now fallen below 20%.Prof Travers believes the party would likely encounter challenges similar to those it is currently facing in councils were it to win the keys to Number 10. It had promised tax cuts, and an overhaul of government spending to increase efficiency, echoing its programme for local government.Already there are signs they are realising what is realistic, and what is not. Earlier this week Farage rowed back on his party's previous promise to deliver tax cuts worth £90bn a year. \"Substantial tax cuts\" are not currently \"realistic\" because of the \"dire state\" of the public finances, he said, proposing instead \"relatively modest\" changes, such as raising tax thresholds and scrapping inheritance tax for family-run businesses.\"The truth is, the constraints of real government would be just as real if they got in at Westminster,\" Prof Travers says.\"Could you really cut benefits for millions of people? It's not that easy… So all of this is the kind of local version of the fact that even political parties who attempt to cut or reduce NHS spending, find themselves increasing it. It's just a local version of that.\"Ben Ramanauskas, a senior research fellow in economics at the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, argues that Reform's instinct to look to cut back waste is right – despite the challenges. \"Definitely, any party should be looking for efficiency savings,\" he says. \"This is taxpayers' money being spent and the priority has to be essential public services. There are examples of where there is some waste going on.\"But it is a very tough job for local authorities and councillors,\" he adds. \"And I think any party in that position would possibly struggle, given just how our system operates.\"He argues it will be easier to \"scale up\" savings at a national level, with the ability to pull all the levers of power.Getty ImagesReform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promisesLooking ahead to the next general election, it would be logical to assume that the fate of Reform - and whether or not it will win enough support to make the leap to Downing Street - rests in part on how it fares at the helm of the councils with these gnarly financial challenges.After all, Reform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promises - so what are the consequences if they cannot deliver on their own pledges in local government?Luke Tryl, director of focus group and polling company More in Common, argues that this link is not necessarily as direct as it may seem.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesDissatisfaction with the economy, NHS and immigration is driving support for Reform\"If you look at the reasons people went and voted for Reform in the local elections, they were number one – overwhelmingly - migration, and Channel crossings in particular. And number two, general disillusionment with the main parties.\"I'm just not sure that Reform's failure to find savings necessarily helps with that.\"Instead, he believes that one of the main risks for Reform that could cost it supporters would be a significant failing in one of the councils – such as a crisis in social care, or bins, or bankruptcy.\"I don't say that the message of 'Reform has put your council tax up' is going to be deterring people in the general election,\" he added.Getty ImagesReform UK could be the biggest party in the next parliamentAs to whether Reform is ready, based on the evidence so far from their leadership of England's councils, in the six months since May, the jury is out.\"It's very difficult to say exactly that Reform councillors are more or less chaotic than other councillors,\" says Stuart Hoddinott.\"They get more attention. So these stories tend to blow a bit more. Having said that, there does seem to have been a lot of incidents since the election.\"Meanwhile, the party's performance in councils has arguably faced even more scrutiny than their political opponents.And while the party says it is making progress on its promises, it is clear it is grappling with the same set of challenges as the parties that came before.So far, it seems the solutions are not proving easy to find for anyone.Top image credits: Gareth Fuller/ PA - Jacob King/ PA and Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "32 minutes agoDr XandMorning Live doctorGetty ImagesPopcorn in moderation can be a more nutritious choice than crisps as it is a fibrous wholegrainScroll through social media or glance at the supermarket shelves and you'll see endless products claiming to improve your gut health.It seems everyone's talking about looking after their microbiome - the trillions of tiny organisms living in our digestive system – which influence everything from digestion and immunity to mood and sleep.Gut health is all about having the right mix of bacteria and enough fibre-rich food to keep everything moving and your body feeling its best.The key to keeping the microbes happy is feeding them the right food and it's easier than you think to maintain a healthy gut.Instead of reaching for pricey probiotic shots or snacks, I recommend making these five easy food swaps to give your gut a boost.Swap crisps for popcorn. Popcorn is a wholegrain so it's packed with fibre that feeds the good bacteria in your gut and it's also lighter and far less processed than a bag of crisps.Swap sweets for dried fruit. This can be a hard swap to make if you love sweets but dried apricots, raisins or dates can still hit that sweet spot whilst also delivering fibre, vitamins and natural sugars that your gut and your energy levels will thank you for.Add lentils or chickpeas to your bolognese. Pulses are full of prebiotic fibre which acts as food for your gut microbes and they can help bulk out your meal, making it go further while adding texture and extra plant-based protein so it's a great way to eat less meat without feeling like you're missing outSwap flavoured nuts for plain ones. Flavoured nuts are often loaded with salt and sugar while plain nuts give you healthy fats and fibre without the additives your gut could do without.Swap ice cream for frozen berries and kefir. Ice cream might make your taste buds happy, but frozen berries with kefir (a tangy fermented milk drink) give you natural sweetness, antioxidants and live cultures that can help your microbiome flourish.Of course there are many other foods you can consume to improve your gut health like drinking kombucha or eating fermented food such as kimchi or sauerkraut, but it's not necessary to focus on that too much.The most important thing for your gut and overall health is eating a range of whole foods that are rich in fibre like fruits and vegetables.And when it comes to supplements and probiotics, my advice is the same - there's no evidence it will do you any good and products like probiotic drinks and powders promising miraculous results can cost you hundreds of pounds which I see as a waste of money.Additional reporting by Yasmin Rufo",

    "body": "3 hours agoGetty ImagesChildren will be taught how to budget and how mortgages work as the government seeks to modernise the national curriculum in England's schools.They will also be taught how to spot fake news and disinformation, including AI-generated content, following the first review of what is taught in schools in over a decade.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the government wanted to \"revitalise\" the curriculum but keep a \"firm foundation\" in basics like English, maths and reading.Head teachers said the review's recommendations were \"sensible\" but would require \"sufficient funding and teachers\".The government commissioned a review of the national curriculum and assessments in England last year, in the hope of developing a \"cutting edge\" curriculum that would narrow attainment gaps between the most disadvantaged students and their classmates.It said it would take up most of the review's recommendations, including scrapping the English Baccalaureate (EBacc), a progress measure for schools introduced in 2010.It assesses schools based on how many pupils take English, maths, sciences, geography or history and a language - and how well they do.The Department for Education (DfE) said the EBacc was \"constraining\", and that removing it alongside reforms to another school ranking system, Progress 8, would \"encourage students to study a greater breadth of GCSE subjects\", like arts.The former Conservative schools minister, Nick Gibb, said the decision to scrap the EBacc would \"lead to a precipitous decline in the study of foreign languages\", which he said would become increasingly centred on private schools and \"children of middle class parents who can afford tutors\".Other reforms coming as a result of the curriculum review include:Financial literacy being taught in maths classes, or compulsory citizenship lessons in primary schoolsMore focus on spotting misinformation and disinformation - including exploring a new post-16 qualification in data science and AICutting time spent on GCSE exams by up to three hours for each student on averageEnsuring all children can take three science GCSEsMore content on climate changeBetter representation of diversityThe review also recommended giving oracy the same status in the curriculum as reading and writing, which the charity Voice 21 said was a \"vital step forward\" for teaching children valuable speaking, listening, and communication skills.However, the government is not taking up all of the review's recommendations.It is pushing ahead with the reading tests for Year 8 pupils reported in September, whereas the review recommended compulsory English and maths tests for that year group.Asked why she stopped short of taking up the review's recommendation, Phillipson told the BBC that pupils who are unable to read \"fluently and confidently\" often struggle in other subjects.And she addressed the claims that scrapping the EBacc could lead to fewer pupils taking history, geography and languages at GCSE, saying the measure \"hasn't led to improved outcomes\" or \"improvement in language study\".\"I want young people to have a good range of options, including subjects like art and music and sport. And I know that's what parents want as well,\" she said.She said ministers recognised \"the need to implement this carefully, thoroughly and with good notice\", adding that schools would have four terms of notice before being expected to teach the new curriculum.Prof Becky Francis, who chaired the review, said her panel of experts and the government had both identified a \"problem\" pupils experience during the first years of secondary school.\"When young people progress from primary into secondary school, typically this is a time when their learning can start falling behind, and that's particularly the case for kids from socially disadvantaged backgrounds,\" she told the BBC.Professor Becky Francis led the curriculum and assessment reviewShe said the approach to the review was \"evolution not revolution\", with England's pupils already performing relatively well against international averages. She said the call for more representation of diversity in the curriculum was not about \"getting rid of core foundational texts and things that are really central to our culture\", but was more about \"recognising where, both as a nation but also globally, there's been diverse contribution to science and cultural progress\".Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott said the changes \"leave children with a weaker understanding of our national story and hide standards slipping in schools\".\"Education vandalism will be the lasting legacy of the prime minister and Bridget Phillipson,\" she added.Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the review had proposed \"a sensible, evidence-based set of reforms\".But he said delivering a \"great curriculum\" also required \"sufficient funding and teachers\", adding that schools and colleges did not currently have all the resources they need.He said a set of \"enrichment benchmarks\" - which the government said would offer pupils access to civic engagement, arts and culture, nature and adventure, sport, and life skills - had been announced \"randomly\" and \"added to the many expectations over which schools are judged\".Additional reporting by Hope Rhodes",

    "body": "55 minutes agoJennifer MeierhansBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAdverts for LED masks that are not registered with the medicines regulator have been banned (stock photo)A number of adverts for LED face masks have been banned for making unauthorised claims they can improve acne and rosacea.The popularity of at-home beauty devices has surged in recent years with social media feeds filled with influencers unboxing and reviewing the masks as the latest skincare trend.However, dermatologists are divided over whether light-emitting diodes (LED) in at-home masks can deliver the results of medical-grade devices used in clinics. The advertising watchdog banned adverts for cosmetic devices which were not registered with the medicines regulator.LED therapy is thought to stimulate cells and improve the skin, but devices must be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to make medical claims about skin conditions like acne and rosacea.Devices registered with the MHRA can be searched on its Public Access Registration Database (PARD). Dermatologists have previously told the BBC there have not been clinical trials with large enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time to know the benefits of at-home LED masks.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) used AI to search for ads which might break the rules, and the bans followed that search.'My acne had disappeared'An advert on Project E Beauty's website showed before and after images of a woman's forehead with and without acne, with the words: \"By week three, my acne had disappeared\". The ad stated: \"Our most advanced LED mask for deeper skin renewal\". It claimed it \"treats acne\" and offered \"83% improvement in acne lesions in four weeks\".The ASA said \"no medical claims could be made for the product, whether or not such claims appeared in customer testimonials.\"Project E Beauty LLC said it had removed potential medical claims relating to \"healing\", \"treating acne\" and \"rosacea\".It also said it had amended the advert to state that any references to acne in before/after photos and reviews were testimonials based on personal experiences.Silk'nThis advert was banned for making a medicinal claim about acneA paid-for social media ad for Silk'n featured a video of a woman using an LED face mask with the caption: \"Finished with the blue light to help treat my acne and scars\".Invention Works BV, trading as Silk'n, acknowledged the term \"acne\" constituted a medical claim. It said the advert was created by a woman after prolonged use of the mask and the wording reflected her individual perception and results.The ASA told Silk'n the adverts must not appear again in that form.BeautaholicsBeautaholics agreed not to make claims about acne in adverts in futureOther adverts banned include one on the Beautaholics website for a RejuvaLux mask which stated: \"This mask provides targeted solutions for...acne...rosacea.\" Beautaholics said it would not make claims regarding the treatment or prevention of medical conditions in future.A paid-for social media ad for a mask by Luyors Retail Inc was also banned after it stated: \"It helps tackle everything from acne...with clinical precision.\"Luyors said it would ensure future advertising did not refer to \"acne\" or other terms that could imply a medicinal claim.Izzy Dharmasiri at the ASA said ads \"can have an influence on what people buy,\" so it was \"important that advertisers don't blur the line between cosmetic benefits and medicinal claims.\"She said advertisers \"need to have evidence to back up any claims they make in their ads\". She said the banning of the adverts was part of its work to protect vulnerable people \"seeking genuine solutions to medical problems\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterPost Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates has agreed a multi-million-pound compensation figure from the Post Office, sources close to the deal have confirmed to the BBC.The payout for Sir Alan comes more than 20 years after he started campaigning for justice for victims of the Horizon scandal which led a group of 555 sub-postmasters launching landmark legal action against the Post Office.The exact sum paid to Sir Alan has not been made public and he has not responded to requests for comment.Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT system indicated shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts.Hundreds more poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution.Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to serious health conditions, addiction and even premature death.A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We pay tribute to Sir Alan Bates for his long record of campaigning on behalf of victims.\"We can confirm that Sir Alan's claim has reached the end of the scheme process and been settled.\"As of September 2025, a total of £1.23bn had been awarded to more than 9,100 sub-postmasters.Sir Alan first received an offer of redress in January 2024, which he rejected, describing it as \"cruel and derisory\".He was made another offer in May 2024 which he said was around a third of what he had requested. In May of this year, he said that he'd received a third offer for less than 50% of his original claim.Sir Alan was part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, under which claimants can either receive £75,000 or seek their own settlement.Former sub-postmaster Tim Brentnall from Pembrokeshire had his conviction overturned after he was prosecuted for false accounting.Brentnall told BBC Radio Wales Drive that Sir Alan's \"tenacity and dogged spirit\" kept him and other sub-postmasters going over the past 20 years. \"We all owe him a great debt.\"The Post Office/Horizon scandal reached new heights in the public consciousness last year after Sir Alan's campaign for justice was portrayed in the ITV drama series Mr Bates vs the Post Office.The government adopted all but one of the recommendations of a report published following a public inquiry into the scandal.The inquiry detailed the full human impact of the scandal for the first time: the report said that more than 13 people may have taken their own lives as a result of what happened to them.Earlier this year, Sir Alan accused the government of putting forward a \"take it or leave it\" offer of compensation amounting to less than half of his claim.Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal help.Last month, the government announced that all victims who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers.There are three different compensation schemes, which are aimed at different groups of victims.Individual eligibility for compensation depends on the particular circumstances of each case.However, the schemes have been criticised for being too slow and complicated, with many of the worst-affected victims receiving far less than their original claims.Sir Alan told the inquiry that, as part of his plan to claim his own settlement, his lawyers had included compensation for his 20 years of campaigning for justice for other victims.He said: \"I'm trying to fight for everyone's financial redress in this but I've also got to  fight for my own as well.\"He said his lawyers added the 20 years' compensation to his claim without his knowledge.",

    "body": "Israel has received via the Red Cross in Gaza a coffin which the Palestinian armed group Hamas says contains the body of a deceased hostage, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.Israeli forces will now transfer the remains to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.Israel had allowed members of the group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since a US-brokered ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October.Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 270 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 18 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas before Tuesday, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Six of the eight dead hostages still in Gaza before Tuesday were Israelis, one was Tanzanian, and one was Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Earlier on Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.The Israeli military said its troops killed a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them.",

She said that while at the club she witnessed sexual harassment towards women and that public weight shaming of athletes was \"prolific\".Heather said she saw the men's squad asked to jump up and down topless, and \"if any of their body parts jiggled, they needed to lose it\".\"I felt it was important to be part of the investigation because I felt that a lot of the athletes might not feel able to speak out about their experiences,\" Heather said. She said she also feels that Oxford Brookes has \"glossed over\" issues around sexism, racism and bullying and that it has a duty to be transparent about \"the culture of the club and what they're doing to improve that.\"Oxford Brookes' boat house in Cholsey is home to one of the UK's top rowing programmesWhat did the investigation find? The independent investigation was conducted by the law firm Penningtons Manches Cooper, that interviewed 41 current and past athletes from OBUBC. A summary of the report was shared with the BBC by someone who contributed to the investigation and then requested its findings through a Freedom of Information request. Any individuals' names within the report had been redacted. The investigation found: \"Multiple and varied instances\" of sex discrimination and sexual harassmentRepeated breaches of British Rowing's Code of Conduct, including rules prohibiting coaches from having sexual relationships with athletesEvidence of bullying, \"personalised profanity\", and three incidents of \"racial slurs\"That there had been data protection breaches and it suggested that aspects of the club's finances should be auditedBreaches of British Rowing's Weighing GuidanceThat there had been \"repeated interference\" during the investigationThe report summary recommended that disciplinary action be taken against some OBUBC members, a Welfare Officer be appointed, and that there should be more Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training. A spokesperson for Oxford Brookes University said: \"When concerns were initially raised about coaching at the Oxford Brookes University Boat Club, we took swift action by launching the independent investigation that led to the production of this report.\"Respect, inclusion and the dignity of everyone who studies and works here are central to our culture.\"We have worked with British Rowing to address the issues raised in the report, with leadership and coaching changes and new, progressive structures now in place at the club.\"More stories from OxfordshireThe investigation began after the picture of a so-called \"toughness sheet\" circulated online.It included comments next to rowers' names including \"Put the pies down\", \"Get a haircut\" and \"Watching you row is like watching paint dry\".After the sheet was leaked, an unverified WhatsApp message from a senior member of the boat club referencing the \"toughness sheet\" was seen by the BBC. It asked someone to \"own up\" for posting a photo of it online, otherwise they would be \"tracked down\". In December 2024, Oxford Brookes University announced that an investigation would look at behaviour and culture at the club. Heather said she feels that methods like the \"toughness sheet\" are not effective in training athletes, and that \"success and wellbeing should come hand in hand\". Oxford Brookes is home to one of the UK's top rowing programmes, with eight members of its boat club selected to represent Team GB at the Paris Olympics.British Rowing said that they \"worked collaboratively with and supported Oxford Brookes University as it implemented the recommendations identified through its independent investigation into coaching practices at Oxford Brookes University Boat Club.\"More on this storyRelated Links",

She said a few years ago when people started calling her that, she had to \"pause and recognise if I rejected this, it would miss an opportunity for women scientists and technologists to be recognised this way\".\"Because men are pretty easily called godfathers or founding fathers.\"\"For all the young women I work with and the generations of girls to come, I'm okay now accepting this title,\" she added.Born in China, Prof Li emigrated to the US as a teenager and went on to excel in computer science. She is co-director at Stanford Computer Science Department, and co-founder and CEO of World Labs.It is her work on ImageNet a project which enabled major advances in computer vision for which she is recognised. She and her students created large-scale image recognition datasets upon which a lot of artificial intelligence technology is now built. It paved the way for computer vision – working out how computers could 'see'.She says the importance of that data set \"open the floodgate of data-driven AI\".She thinks the next AI milestone will come when it is able to interact with the world around it.This ability was is \"innately important and native to animals and humans\", and if this could be unlocked in AI, it could \"superpower\" humans in many ways, \"including creativity, robotic learning, design and architecture\".This will be the first time all seven laureates have come together in person. The three \"godfathers\" have publicly stated opposing views on how dangerous AI could be. Dr Hinton has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the potential for AI to pose an \"extinction-level threat\".  But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta has written that apocalyptic warnings are overblown.Prof Li says she takes a more \"pragmatic approach\" and says the disagreement amongst scientists is \"healthy\".\"We're used to even disagreement, and I think that's healthy. A topic as profound and impactful as AI requires a lot of healthy debate and public discourse.\"I think in the case of AI, both extreme rhetorics concern me…I have always advocated for a much more science based, pragmatic method in communicating and educating the public.\"So, yes, I would like to see our communication of AI to be much more moderated and grounded in facts and science instead of the extreme rhetorics\".The Queen Elizabeth prize is awarded annually to engineers responsible for groundbreaking innovations which globally benefit humanity. Previous recipients include Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.Lord Vallance, chair of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said the winners \"represent the very best of engineering,\" adding that their work \"demonstrates how engineering can both sustain our planet and transform the way we live and learn.\"Additional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "body": "49 minutes agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe report said that a 22-year-old who falls out of work for health reasons could lose out on £1m over the course of their lifetime.The number of sick and disabled people out of work is putting the UK is at risk of an \"economic inactivity crisis\" that threatens the country's prosperity, according to a new report.There were 800,000 more people out of work now than in 2019 due to health conditions, costing employers £85bn a year, according to the review by former John Lewis boss Sir Charlie Mayfield.The problem could worsen without intervention, but Sir Charlie, who will lead a taskforce aimed at helping people return to work, said this was \"not inevitable\".The move has been broadly welcomed, but some business groups said Labour's Employment Rights Bill included some disincentives to hiring people with existing illnesses.One in five working age people were out of work, and not seeking work, according to the report, which was commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions by produced independently. Without intervention, another 600,000 people could leave work due to health reasons by the end of the decade.Sir Charlie said sickness cost employers £85bn a year through issues including lost productivity and sick pay, but it also cost the broader economy.\"For employers, sickness and staff turnover bring disruption, cost and lost experience,\" he said. \"For the country, it means weaker growth, higher welfare spending and greater pressure on the NHS\".Speaking to the BBC, he said that \"on the whole, work and health are mutually reinforcing\". \"So keeping people in work, keeping them active, actually helps them to stay healthier.\"The state spends £212bn per year on illness-related inactivity, or nearly 70% of income tax, through lost output, increased welfare payments and additional burdens on the NHS.People could be encouraged to stay in work if health is viewed as \"a shared responsibility between employers, employees and health services\", he said.'I want to find a job'Loz Sandom has mental and physical health conditions which has made it difficult to find a job, and the last time they worked was a year ago. \"I am willing to do the work, and I want to. I want to find a job,\" said the 28-year-old, who has a degree in illustration and has previously worked as a digital marketing executive.  They said that part of the challenge was employers did not realised they had \"a duty to provide reasonable adjustments.\"\"It's such a shame because they're missing out on so many fantastic disabled people that can do fabulous jobs.\"And I'm not blaming employers entirely. They need support as well,\" Loz added. \"There are things that can be put in place to help employers, help save people.\"Responding to the report, the government announced a major partnership with over 60 companies, many of them large employers, to \"tackle the rising tide of ill-health that is pushing people out of work\".The companies include Tesco, Google UK, Nando's and John Lewis.Over the next three years, they will \"develop and refine workplace health approaches\" which aim to \"reduce sickness absence, improve return-to-work rates, and increase disability employment rate\".The government is aiming to develop these changes into a voluntary certified standard by 2029.Speaking to the BBC, Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the report was a \"win-win for employees and employers because its' aimed at keeping people with sickness issues or developing disability issues in work\". \"That's in the interests of employers because these are good experienced staff and it's in the interests of employees too because most people want to stay in work if they possibly can.\"\rThe Resolution Foundation think tank's chief executive Ruth Curtice said: \"The review has accurately identified a culture of fear, a dearth of support and structural barriers to work as key challenges to overcome in turning the tide for Britain's economic inactivity problem – which is currently trending in the wrong direction.\"The CIPD, which represents HR professionals, welcomed the government's vision for a preventative approach to illness in the workplace.But its chief executive Peter Cheese said: \"The report's success will depend on the extent to which these recommendations are understood by business in driving positive outcomes and backed by policy makers at a national and regional level.\"The report comes as the government tries to move ahead with its Employment Rights Bill – which some businesses say will stifle growth.The proposed new law includes a right to guaranteed hours and cracks down on zero-hour contracts without the offer of work.As well as that bill, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is aiming to guarantee paid work to young people who have been out of a job for 18 months.Those who do not to take up the offer could face being stripped of their benefits.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoEmma Simpson,Business correspondent and Esyllt Carr,Business reporterThe oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has said she can now \"look to the future\" after receiving her long-awaited settlement from one of the government's compensation schemes.\"I can settle up my affairs. I can turn the heating up full blast, and that will be wonderful,\" 92-year-old Betty Brown told the BBC.Mrs Brown was forced out of her Post Office in Country Durham in 2003 after she and her late husband spent more than £50,000 of their savings to cover shortfalls that did not exist.Her settlement comes after it was confirmed that campaigner Sir Alan Bates had agreed to a multi-million-pound compensation figure from the Post Office.\"At last, after 26 years, they've recognised justice,\" she said, adding: \"pity they took so long.\"Her Post Office had been one of the most successful in the region but eventually she had to sell it at a loss.Talking about what happened, she previously said it \"absolutely destroyed my whole life\".The Horizon IT system was responsible for more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongfully prosecuted because of it providing incorrect information. Thousands more, like Betty, were forced to make up for the alleged losses at their branches across the UK.The scandal has been described as one of the widest miscarriages of justice in the UK.Mrs Brown was one of the original 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action led by Sir Alan Bates against the Post Office.She said it was \"fantastic\" that Sir Alan had received his final settlement too, describing him as her \"hero\".\"I think at long, long last, the government are starting to listen. Not only are they starting to listen, they're beginning to act,\" Mrs Brown said.Both Betty and Sir Alan were part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, and those claimants were offered the option of taking a fixed sum of £75,000 or pursuing their own settlement.In Dec 2024, Betty was originally offered just under a third of what she'd claimed for in compensation. That was gradually upped to 70% earlier this year, which she rejected. Her case was then escalated to an independent panel.There were two main sticking points. Firstly, the Post Office knocked 10% off the income she'd been making when she was running her branch, which had a big impact on the calculation for her future loss of earnings. And then it downgraded her claim for psychological damages from severe to moderately severe, even though her medical report had concluded it was severe.Betty took up the opportunity to address the panel, an experience she said felt like reliving the past.\"The emotions, the fear, the terror was all coming back,\" she said.The panel found in her favour.By then, Betty had already dropped a couple of incidental claims for business costs, because she didn't have any paperwork and the lack of evidence was being challenged by the governmentShe has now ended up with about 95% of what she originally claimed for – and Betty is happy with that.The latest government figures up until the end of September, which don't include Betty's payout, show that of 492 eligible claimants, 385 have had their claims fully settled – with more than 100 people still waiting for their final payment.Across all the government compensation schemes, £1.2bn has now been paid out to more than 9,100 victims.\"This is a redress scheme,\" Betty stressed. \"They've only given us back what they took from us. We haven't had a penny in compensation.\"Over the last two years, that's the message Betty has been putting across as she's become one of the most formidable campaigners for justice for former sub-postmasters.She has appeared on BBC Breakfast, Newsnight and taken government ministers to task.Betty celebrated with tea and cake at her local church coffee morning. She got a round of applause and some hugs as she broke the news of her final payout.Mrs Brown also made it clear that she was not finished.\"I don't want to put my feet up,\" she said. \"I just want the other sub-postmasters to have what I have been given. That's all I want – justice for every one of them.\"",

    "body": "16 minutes agoSima KotechaSenior UK correspondent Getty ImagesHuman error could have led to criminal cases involving alleged grooming gangs being dropped, the early stages of a massive review has found.Operation Beaconport - a National Crime Agency project tasked with unearthing failings to tackle grooming gangs - is set to look at thousands of cases where police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service decided to take no further action against suspects.Police say that there appear to be cases where lines of inquiry were not pursued properly, victim accounts were not taken, and suspects were not interviewed as they should have been.Investigations that were wrongly closed with no further action taken have already been discovered.\"Initial reviews have identified that in some cases where there has been a decision to take no further action, there were available lines of inquiry that could have been pursued\", said the National Crime Agency's deputy director Nigel Leary.\"We've seen in those cases what appears to be potentially human error. \"We've seen in some cases that those investigations haven't followed what we would characterise as proper investigative practice, actually that would have contributed to the no further action decision,\" Mr Leary added. The issue of grooming gangs has made headlines in recent months - with a national inquiry into the issue in England and Wales thrown into turmoil by disagreements before it had even got under way.Operation Beaconport is a national policing operation led by the NCA and was set up earlier this year in a bid to eliminate inconsistencies in how cases are handled by police forces. It is reviewing cases between January 2010 and March 2025.It is not clear how much the operation will cost or how long it will take.Getty ImagesSo far, 1,273 cases relating to allegations of group-based child sexual abuse and exploitation identified by 23 police forces have been referred to the investigation team. Of these, 236 relate to allegations of rape, which Operation Beaconport is reviewing as a priority.The NCA expects the operation to involve thousands of officers from across policing, with Mr Leary claiming it will be \"the most comprehensive investigation of its type in UK history\".In response to the review's early findings, the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"The grooming gangs scandal was one of the darkest moments in this country's history.\"This government initiated this national policing operation to track down the evil child rapists that perpetrated these crimes, and put them behind bars where they belong.\"As part of the review, the ethnicity of suspects and victims will be recorded. Officers admit to finding gaps in the existing data that they are trying to fill. They will also aim to flag dangerous suspects, and any that are at risk of fleeing the country.The NCA says better data sharing between multi-agency teams and more coordinated efforts to track and disrupt offenders will also be developed to help them tackle these crimes more effectively.It's not clear how much the operation will cost or how long it will take.The investigation into grooming gangs and other non-familial sexual abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, cost £89m over 11 years.Last month, the Metropolitan Police announced it was reviewing 9,000 cases of child sexual exploitation.It is likely that some of these cases will be checked by Operation Beaconport, which is looking at cases involving two or more suspects. It will also focus on allegations where there have been multiple victims, the suspects are still alive, and the case has not already been independently reviewed.The review will run alongside the national public inquiry, announced by the government earlier this year.Richard Fewkes from the National Police Chiefs' Council said that some victims will just want to feel listened too. \"Justice means different things for different victims and survivors, and no one victim and survivor is the same.\"For some, justice is just being believed, perhaps for the first time, by someone in authority, being listened to,\" he said. Last month, a watchdog said that while police forces had made significant progress in tracking grooming gangs and child exploitation, \"significant challenges\" remained. Inconsistent definitions, data accuracy issues and poor national co-ordination risk undermining efforts to protect vulnerable children, His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services said in a progress report.It found only 37% of child exploitation cases were accurately flagged on police systems, with opportunities to protect children still being missed.A Home Office spokeswoman said the inspectorate's report showed \"important progress\" had been made but acknowledged there was \"more to do\".Shadow home secretary Chris Philip said the Home Office's failure to adopt a definition for group-based child sexual exploitation was keeping \"the system blind to patterns of abuse\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoMarc WaddingtonBBC North West Investigations BBCDr Faisal Maassarani, seen here in a BBC health programme in 2018, spent £3.5m buying an asylum seeker hotelMore than 100 people were threatened with eviction from their homes to make way for asylum seekers after companies linked to a prominent GP started running migrant hotels.Firms connected to Dr Faisal Maassarani became landlords of Serco hotels in 2022 when asylum applications were almost at a 20-year high.But soon after a hotel in Seel Street in Liverpool owned by one of the firms was found to be unsuitable, people in one of their Liverpool housing complexes were told they had to move out over \"urgent\" fire safety issues, unaware that 116 asylum seekers had seemingly been lined up to replace them almost immediately.Maassarani, whose involvement with one of the firms was hidden behind a complex structure of companies and trusts registered in the Isle of Man, said he had no part in the day-to-day running of the buildings and did not authorise any communication with tenants.Maassarani operates several GP surgeries in Knowsley and Sefton and in 2009 set up the social isolation charity Care Merseyside.Between 2021 and 2022, a company he had founded, Schloss Roxburghe Holdings, acquired about £5m of freeholds on buildings that were originally owned by property developer Elliot Lawless before his companies went into administration.In August 2022, when some of Maassarani's business associates bought the Waverley Hotel in Whitehaven in Cumbria, Serco moved asylum seekers into it within a week.In November, one of Maassarani's companies then spent £3.5m buying the King's Gap hotel in Hoylake, which had been running as asylum seeker accommodation since 2020.Protests have been held over the Hoylake King's Gap hotel being used as asylum accommodationAt the same time, asylum seekers were moved into the Seel Street hotel as the firms' relationships with Serco and the Home Office expanded.And the BBC's investigations suggest it was the use of that hotel that directly led to dozens of people almost losing their homes in an alleged illegal eviction attempt.A tenant of Parliament Place in Liverpool told the BBC he came home from work in March 2023 to find a letter from Schloss Roxburghe Holdings (SRH).Andrew Lewis said he was left in \"disbelief\" at what the letter said.Andrew Lewis was told he had to move out of his flat, unaware of plans to move asylum seekers in The letter told tenants they needed to move out because the building required urgent fire safety works.Lewis, 47, said: \"People were afraid, panicking… and didn't want to be evicted.\"The IT worker added: \"They put it vague enough to make us assume we could come back in again. It wasn't until someone emailed the management company and said what happens after this four-week period that they said they were going to terminate our leases.\"And that's when we thought, we're not standing for this.\"The tenants did not know about plans to move asylum seekers into their homes, nor that the plan had been under discussion for up to three months.Those the BBC has spoken to also said they did not know that the buy-to-let landlords who owned the flats they lived in had been directly approached by an \"agent\" of SRH promoting the asylum deal to them.Plans were being made to move asylum seekers into Parliament PlaceIn February 2023, an email was sent to some of the private landlords of flats in the building telling them a deal with \"the United Kingdom Home Office\" would give them a guaranteed £435 a month per flat, potentially for up to seven years.The email said the Home Office had \"undertaken a full survey of the building\" in December 2022, and had then issued a \"heads of terms\" for a contract to use it from March 1.The BBC understands the unsigned and undated \"heads of terms\" was actually a draft proposal, and that no agreement had been made.But at the time, the Home Office and Serco were facing pressure from Liverpool City Council about the use of the SRH-owned Seel Street hotel as asylum accommodation because its location in the middle of the city centre's nightlife district made it unsuitable.The Seel Street Hotel - now known as the Ropewalks Hotel - housed asylum seekers briefly in 2022 The timing suggests it was likely it was these asylum seekers that were destined to move into Parliament Place.Liverpool City Council said it had visited the building \"informally\" in February 2023 \"to check room sizes for intended occupancy\" and whether the fire alarm system was suitable.It is understood that not all of the building's private landlords were told about the plan, and that when some were, they objected to it.The tenants were then contacted directly by letter by SRH and told they had to move out for fire safety works to take place.Liverpool City Council said it had never suggested anyone needed to move out of the building.Lewis, whose own landlord was not aware of the move, said he \"100% believed\" that the fire safety claims were a ruse to clear the building.SRH shelved the asylum seeker plan, and was reported in the Liverpool Echo at the time to have withdrawn from the plan when it became clear the \"upheaval to tenants was too great\".The tenants did not have to leave, and, to their knowledge, the fire safety works never took place.Family tiesMaassarani set up SRH in 2018 in the Isle of Man. Its directors were all professionals from other Isle of Man or British Virgin Islands-based firms. And because the shares in the company are owned by a foundation, there is no publicly available information linking Maassarani to it.The GP said the revelation of his involvement in the company was not in the public interest, that he derived no financial income from it, and that while he had been told about plans to move asylum seekers into Parliament Place, he was not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.Dr Maassarani, seen here taking part in a BBC health documentary in 2018, says he makes no financial benefit from Schloss Roxburghe Holdings The trust which owns SRH was founded to pay for education and training for his family, and Maassarani has a personal business history with people believed to have been involved in both running SRH and managing his interests in asylum seeker accommodation.The agent who wrote to Parliament Place landlords promoting the asylum seeker deal signed off the correspondence as 'Mike Murphy'. The BBC understands this to be Michael Murphy, at the time a partner at major Liverpool law firm and Everton stadium sponsor Hill Dickinson.The BBC have asked Murphy about his alleged involvement, and he said he could not respond because of client confidentiality.Tenants were not told their buy-to-let landlords had been told about an alleged deal with the Home Office The BBC has found that as well as having acted as a solicitor for both Maassarani and Lawless, Murphy had personal business links to both men in relation to property deals worth nearly £2m.He is also the son-in-law of one of the directors of the firm that managed the Waverley asylum seeker hotel in Cumbria, 76-year-old former building firm boss David Lloyd.Lloyd is now the sole director of SRH, which in recent months has faced fresh illegal evictions allegations in relation to another of its Liverpool buildings, Queensland Place.Schloss Roxburghe Holdings has also faced allegations of illegal eviction attempts at Queensland Place in LiverpoolIn November, leaseholders there secured an injunction against the firm to stop it changing the locks on some tenants' rooms as part of a row over ground rent payments, with the company warned its assets could be seized and its director jailed if it was breached.Maassarani and Lloyd are both currently directors of a firm called Optimus Hotel Management, which has recently taken a loan out against the £3.5m Wirral King's Gap asylum seeker hotel. Solicitor Murphy acted as a witness to the application.'Not good enough'The Wirral hotel remains asylum seeker accommodation, but the Cumbria hotel was closed in December 2023, owing more than £170,000 to unpaid staff and His Majesty's Revenue and Customs.It had been operated through a company that did not have its own bank account, and its liquidation fees were paid by another firm of which Maassarani is a director.GoogleThe Waverley Hotel in Whitehaven was turned into asylum accommodation soon after it was bought in summer 2022Murphy – who resigned from Hill Dickinson last April - declined to respond to any of the BBC's questions, citing \"client confidentiality\". Hill Dickinson said it could not comment on \"the matters of any individual organisation or the private interests of existing or former partners\".Lloyd has not responded to the BBC's enquiries.In a statement to the BBC, a spokesman for Dr Maassarani said he was \"a local GP with over 20 years of NHS service to thousands of patients and their families across the Merseyside area\" and \"holds senior leadership positions within the NHS\".The statement added: \"He is not in any way involved in the running or management of Schloss Roxburghe Holdings, neither does he benefit financially from it.\"As such he had no knowledge of, and was not involved in or responsible for, any communications with tenants at Parliament Place or Queensland Place.\"It added he \"is neither a party, defendant or respondent\" in the injunction proceedings relating to Queensland Place.  Parliament TVKim Johnson raised the attempted eviction of Parliament Place tenants in the House of CommonsLiverpool Riverside's Labour MP Kim Johnson said the incident at Parliament Place raised questions about how asylum accommodation deals were done, and rejected Maassarani's suggestion there was no public interest in knowledge of his link to SRH.She added: \"It's not good enough. I think there needs to be more investigation and scrutiny of how contracts are awarded and the whole procurement process. More due diligence is definitely required.\"The Home Office – which the BBC understands has to approve all accommodation looking to be used by Serco - has declined to comment on its providers' commercial relationships.North West Investigations",

    "body": "2 hours agoMaia DaviesMetropolitan PoliceMatvei Rumiantsev, 22, was convicted on Wednesday at Snaresbrook Crown CourtA Russian man has been found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after Donald Trump's son told UK police he had seen a woman being beaten up on a video call.Barron Trump, 19, contacted officers when he was in the US to say his friend had been attacked by Matvei Rumiantsev in London in January 2025, a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.Prosecutors said Rumiantsev, 22, had been jealous of the woman's friendship with Trump. Rumiantsev, who lived in Canary Wharf, east London, was also convicted of perverting the course of justice. He was found not guilty of one count of rape and intentional strangulation, and another of rape and assault alleged to have occurred in November 2024.The trial had heard that Trump called the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on 18 January last year and contacted UK police shortly afterwards.\"I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up,\" he said, according to a transcript of the call released by the Crown Prosecution Service.Asked by the operator how he knew the woman, Trump said: \"I don't think these details matter, she's getting beat up but OK fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters.\"The operator responded: \"Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?\"A few months later, in May 2025, Trump told police in an email that what he saw had been \"very brief indeed but indeed prevalent\".The 19-year-old said his video call to the woman had been picked up by \"a shirtless man with darkish hair\".This view lasted \"maybe one second\" before the camera flipped to \"the victim getting hit while crying\", he told police, adding: \"This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds.\"Jurors heard that Rumiantsev and the woman had been drinking together on the evening of 17 January and into the next morning.The prosecution said he assaulted the woman on 18 January 2025, including hitting her in the face. Getty ImagesBarron Trump is the US president's fifth and youngest childJudge Mr Justice Bennathan KC had cautioned the jury not to rely on Trump's account as the main basis for a conviction, noting he had not given evidence under oath or been cross-examined.Prosecutor Serena Gates said Rumiantsev had been jealous of the woman's friendship with Trump, perhaps because of his \"public profile\".Asked during cross-examination whether he was jealous of men the victim might speak to, Rumiantsev said: \"What I was really unhappy about was that she was frankly leading him [Trump] on.\"Mr Justice Bennathan KC told Rumiantsev the trial was about whether he \"attacked her or not\".Rumiantsev responded: \"I am being portrayed as a jealous person who can lose his temper due to jealousy. I want to just make clear that her actions towards him was wrong and it was not fair.\"He added: \"I was jealous to some extent.\"The conviction for perverting the court of justice relates to a letter Rumiantsev wrote to the woman from prison after the 18 January attack, asking her to withdraw her allegations.",

    "body": "24 minutes agoGetty ImagesRoss Davidson, 37, who used Ross Wild as his stage name, was known for singing with the 80s band Spandau Ballet in 2018A former singer for Spandau Ballet has been found guilty of rape and attempted rape.Ross Davidson, who used Ross Wild as his stage name, was known for singing with the 80s band Spandau Ballet in 2018 as well as starring in the Queen-themed West End musical We Will Rock You.The 37-year-old from Finchley, north London, had pleaded not guilty to the rape of a woman in London in March 2015. He also denied the attempted rape and sexual assault of another woman in Thailand in December 2019.Jurors at Wood Green Crown Court found him guilty of all charges after more than 11 hours of deliberation.Following the convictions, Det Con Kamila Kedadrova, from the Metropolitan Police, described the Aberdeen-born singer as \"a prolific offender who carried out cowardly and opportunistic assaults against his victims\".'Helpless and scared'During the trial, prosecutor Richard Hearnden said Davidson had been thought of as \"a bit of a sex symbol\" but the two women found he had \"a much darker side that they did not notice, at least at first\".Davidson had met both women on the dating app Tinder and claimed that all sexual activity he engaged in was consensual.The rape victim told the jury she woke to find Davidson assaulting her while she slept in his bed at his London home. She said she felt \"helpless\" and \"scared to react\".She also said that Davidson had told her he was interested in the idea of sex with \"a person in a helpless state, someone not moving\".Davidson described himself as \"sex positive\", explaining that for him the term meant having \"open dialogue\" and being \"open minded about people's predilections\".'Asleep, still and unresponsive'Davidson had earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of voyeurism in December 2019 against the woman in Thailand after he secretly filmed a video of her as she slept.Detectives later traced her after discovering a video on Davidson's phone which the prosecution said showed her being touched while \"asleep, still and unresponsive\" and \"at least half naked\" in the hotel room.She told the court she had no idea the footage existed until that point.Davidson admitted the voyeurism charge, but had denied sexual assault and attempted rape.He said he created the video for \"selfish reasons, for sexual gratification\". He told the jury he wished he \"had never done it\".The court heard Davidson had been found guilty of rape, two counts of sexual assault and voyeurism at a previous trial.He is due to be sentenced for his later convictions at a later date.More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandKathryn ArmstrongHandout via ReutersThe fleet is headed by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (file image)Donald Trump has warned Iran that \"time is running out\" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the steady build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.The US president said a \"massive Armada\" was \"moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose\" towards Iran, referring to a large US naval force.In response, Iran's mission to the UN said Tehran \"stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests\", but if pushed, it wrote in all capitals, it would defend itself and \"respond like never before\".Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Trump's latest warning to Iran's leaders follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on demonstrations in the country earlier this month.\"Help is on the way,\" he told protesters, before later changing his tune - saying he had been told on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,220 people, including 5,858 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. HRANA says it is also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.However, Trump's warning on Wednesday appeared to focus more on Iran's nuclear programme. \"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS,\" he wrote on Truth Social. Trump added that this force was \"ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary\".Earlier on Wednesday, before Trump's comments, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said: \"Conducting diplomacy through military threat cannot be effective or useful.\" \"If they [the US] want negotiations to take shape, they must certainly set aside threats, excessive demands and raising illogical issues,\" he said in televised remarks, translated by the AFP news agency.Using open-source tools, BBC Verify has been able to track some of the US deployments to the area. A US defence official confirmed that a naval \"armada\" led by the USS Abraham Lincoln had also arrived in the Middle East.The last time the US took action against Iranian nuclear sites was June last year, when it targeted three uranium enrichment facilities in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.American officials then said the operation - codename \"Midnight Hammer\" - had significantly set back the prospect of Tehran building a nuclear weapon.However, Hassan Abedini, the deputy political director of Iran's state broadcaster, claimed that Iran \"didn't suffer a major blow because the materials had already been taken out\" from the facilities.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterReutersSir Keir is greeted by Chinese government officials as he lands in BeijingPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in China for a three-day visit - the first by a British prime minister in eight years.Sir Keir is seeking to strengthen trading and cultural ties between the two nations after years of acrimony.But he has faced criticism from opponents at home over the risk posed by China to the UK's national security and Xi Jinping's human rights record.The PM - who will meet President Xi on Thursday - said the trip will bring benefits to the UK and it was important to maintain a \"strategic and consistent relationship\" with the world's second largest economy.As he arrived at the airport in Beijing, Sir Keir was greeted by a delegation of Chinese government officials and presented with a bouquet of flowers. Union flags were seen flying in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.Addressing the 60 British business leaders accompanying him on the trip, the PM said: \"On this delegation, you're making history. You're part of the change that we're bringing about.\"We are resolute about being outward-looking, about taking opportunities, about building relationships...and always being absolutely focused on our national interest.\"For a UK prime minister, the politics of engaging with China is tricky.In addition to China's human rights record, there are concerns about the scale of its espionage activities in the UK, with the head of MI5 recently warning that Chinese state operatives presented a daily national security threat.Sir Keir declined to be drawn on what he would seek to raise with Chinese leaders.\"In the past, on all the trips I've done, I've always raised issues that need to be raised, but I don't want to get ahead of myself on the specifics until I've had the opportunity,\" he told reporters travelling with him.He added: \"Part of the reason for engaging with China is so that issues where we disagree can be discussed, and the issues where we agree can be progressed, and so that's the approach.\"ReutersThe union flag flies alongside the national flag of China in Tiananmen SquareSir Keir will be hoping his visit - the first by a UK prime minister since Theresa May in 2018 - will mend relations with China, while keeping US President Donald Trump on side.He has insisted the UK will not be forced to \"choose between\" China and the US, amid rising trade tensions between the two superpowers in recent years.The UK would maintain \"close ties\" with the US on business, security and defence, he said, but added that \"sticking your head in the sand and ignoring China... wouldn't be sensible\".Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she would not visit China \"at this time\" if she was prime minister. \"We should be talking more to those countries who are aligned with our interests, not the country that is doing everything it can to undermine our economy,\" she told reporters.\"I think that that is what the prime minister should be talking about and he needs to show strength, not approving a super-embassy which many people think is going to become a spy hub.\"She had earlier said she was \"worried about what he's [Starmer] going to be doing when he gets to China\".\"He's probably going to give away the Isle of Wight before he comes back. Let's have an actual foreign policy, one that is rooted in realism and focusing on Britain's national interest,\" she added.Sir Keir also faced criticism from the Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons, where deputy prime minister David Lammy stood in for him at his weekly question time session.Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Whilst the Chinese regime still holds British citizen Jimmy Lai captive in prison, and whilst the Chinese regime continues to hunt down pro-democracy protesters on the streets of Britain with bounties on their heads, the British prime minister has gone cap in hand to China to ask for a trade deal on the promise of a super-embassy from which the Chinese regime will continue to spy on us.\"",

    "body": "Harry Styles to break Wembley Stadium record with 12 shows3 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesStyles has won six Brit Awards as a solo artist, including album of the year for his last release, Harry's HouseHarry Styles has added two more dates to his residency at Wembley Stadium, setting him up for a record-breaking 12-night run this summer.When the concerts take place, he will overtake Coldplay and Taylor Swift as the artist with the most performances in a single year at the London venue.Coldplay set the overall record with 10 shows last summer, while Swift's eight-night stint on the Eras tour was the highest number by a solo act.Across the 12 dates, Styles will play to approximately more than a million fans. However, his Wembley concerts come at the expense of shows at any other UK venues, and there has been disquiet among fans over the cost of tickets.Regular tickets for the UK dates of his Together Together tour range between £44.10 and £466.25.\"It's so tone deaf,\" replied another fan. \"It really shows that he has lost touch with the real world.\"Styles' prices reflect the rising cost of major tours, which have increased sharply since the Covid-19 pandemic.Last year, the average price of a ticket for one of the world's top 100 artists was $132.62 (£96.18), according to live music analysts Pollstar - down slightly from a historic high of $135.92 (£98.63) a year earlier.The last time Styles played at Wembley, in 2023, prices ranged from £50.65 to £326.20 before fees, meaning top-tier tickets now cost £140 more.Getty ImagesStyles' last tour made more than $500m (£371m) at the box office and he has sold more than 30m records, as part of One Direction and as a solo artistStyles' tour also marks a growing trend for celebrities to play multiple dates in a handful of cities, which can add to travel and accommodation costs for fans.The singer's world tour will visit just seven cities - Amsterdam, London, São Paulo, Mexico City, New York, Melbourne and Sydney - but he will play extended residencies in each. In New York, he has booked a 30-night stay at Madison Square Garden.By contrast, his previous tour visited more than 50 cities around the world.Despite the financial and logistical problems fans will face, demand for tickets has been huge.During pre-sales earlier this week, many reported being stuck in queues that numbered into the tens of thousands.Styles, who had originally booked six nights at Wembley, responded by doubling the length of his residency.The full list of Wembley dates is: Friday, 12 JuneSaturday, 13 JuneWednesday, 17 JuneFriday, 19 JuneSaturday, 20 JuneTuesday, 23 JuneFriday, 26 JuneSaturday, 27 JuneMonday, 29 JuneWednesday, 1 JulyFriday, 3 JulySaturday, 4 JulyA spokesperson for the venue said: \"We are incredibly proud to welcome Harry Styles back to Wembley Stadium for what will be a truly historic run of shows.\"The 12 nights will be among the most special in our stadium's long history.\"",

    "body": "Novak Djokovic is planning to double his thanks tonight.Partly in gratitude for what has happened so far at the Australian Open. Partly in hope for what lies ahead as he chases a record 25th Grand Slam singles title.Djokovic could not hide his relief when Italian fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti, who led their quarter-final by two sets to love, had to quit with injury.It was more fortune for the 10-time Melbourne champion, having already received a fourth-round walkover when Czech opponent Jakub Mensik withdrew with an abdominal issue.Feeling fresh is a positive for the 38-year-old Serb going into Friday's semi-final against Jannik Sinner.But equally, being undercooked against the 24-year-old Italian, who is bidding for a third straight title, is a worry.Djokovic has played just two sets since his third-round win on 24 January - and he lost both of those.\"I have no idea at this stage of my career what serves me [well] and what doesn't,\" fourth seed Djokovic said.Djokovic says he largely feels fine physically, with a blister on his foot his biggest concern.It is a marked difference to some of his previous Australian Open campaigns.Last year, he quit in the semi-finals because of a hamstring tear sustained in a super-human effort to beat Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round.In 2023, he won the title despite playing with a three centimetre tear in his hamstring. Two years earlier, he also triumphed despite tearing an abdominal muscle in the third round.Djokovic cannot afford any physical issues if he is going to beat Sinner and then potentially 22-year-old Alcaraz in Sunday's final.\"You always have some minor issues with your body, at least for me every single day,\" Djokovic said.\"But major issues, no. Thankfully, that's still not posing a challenge for me and obstacle in order for me to be able to play and move around the way I want to.\"Djokovic feels being injury-free is a stroke of luck as he attempts to become the oldest Grand Slam men's champion in the Open era.Considering his meticulous pursuit of almost every record there is in the sport, it feels wrong to put anything Djokovic down to fortune.But avoiding a default in the third round, followed by a walkover and then a retirement, is an enviable pattern.Against Musetti, Djokovic also recovered from falling victim to his own exemplary sportsmanship.As he served to stay in the second set, Djokovic conceded a point by admitting to umpire James Keothavong he touched a ball on its way out. The Italian would go on to claim the game.\"I'm going to double my prayers tonight,\" Djokovic said.There is no doubt Djokovic needs to be sharper both technically and mentally if he is to end Sinner and Alcaraz's recent dominance at the majors.Musetti was superb against Djokovic, but there was no escaping the fact the Serb was poor by his lofty standards.\"I think I've underperformed for the level that I showed throughout this tournament,\" Djokovic added.\"I have to play better - no doubt about it.\"I know that if I'm feeling well and the body is holding on and I'm playing well, then I always have a chance.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has apologised for a party statement which made reference to Suella Braverman's mental health following her defection to Reform UK.An initial statement, which the party later said was sent in error, said \"the Conservatives did all we could to look after Suella's mental health, but she was clearly very unhappy\".Badenoch told the BBC the comment was \"completely wrong and not the kind of culture we should have in our party\".However, in a speech she branded defectors \"drama queens\", saying people who did not agree with the direction she was taking the party \"need to get out the way\".The Tories had faced a backlash over the statement from mental health charities and politicians on all sides.Braverman said the reference to her mental health was \"a bit pathetic\" and \"more signs of a bitter and desperate party that seems to be in free-fall\".Asked if she had apologised for the statement, Badenoch told the BBC: \"Yes, that has come out from me. That should never have gone out. It has been retracted. And I've also spoken to the person who sent it. \"It was completely wrong and not the kind of culture we should have in our party.\"She was the third sitting Tory MP to join Reform UK in less than two weeks, following Robert Jenrick and Andrew Rosindell, taking the party's tally of MPs to eight.It comes after former Conservative chancellor Nadhim Zahawi also joined the party earlier this month. Addressing the defections of Braverman, Jenrick and Zahawi in her speech, Badenoch said: \"To those who are defecting, who don't actually disagree with our policies, I will say I'm sorry you didn't win the leadership contest. \"I'm sorry you didn't get a job in the shadow cabinet. I'm sorry you didn't get into the Lords, but you are not offering a plan to fix this country. This is a tantrum dressed up as politics.\"During Deputy Prime Minister's Questions, David Lammy joked that Tory MPs were \"lining up\" to join Reform \"while they squabble about the damage that they did to our country\".In her speech, Badenoch also took aim at former politicans who \"are in denial\" and \"don't want to admit that immigration is too high\".\"Some people say that we need to split the difference and find the centre ground,\" she said. \"It's not about the centre ground, it's about the common ground and it is about common sense.\"She added that \"most people in our country want to control immigration\" and the Tories were \"a mainstream party\".The initiative - named Prosper UK - aims to win back centrist voters who feel \"politically homeless\".Asked how damaging the new movement could be to the Conservative Party, Badenoch said: \"Anybody who is trying to push an agenda that is not the platform I stood on is not being helpful.\"She added: \"If they've got new ideas which are on the right, not left-wing ideas, and we will welcome them. But right now we need to move away from any sort of factionalism or groupings.\"The Conservative leader said her party was \"not a party of the left and we should not be accommodating people who want to paint that picture\".Asked if this referred to Davidson and Sir Andy, Badenoch denied this, telling the BBC: \"Ruth Davidson and Andy Street have been very supportive, but they are supporting the agenda which I'm delivering.\"However, she added that there were other people who had joined their movement who had previously defected to the Liberal Democrats and \"anyone who wants a different agenda needs to understand that that's not coming\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoClaire ThomsonandJames Cheyne,BBC ScotlandTracy ScottEthan Brown was awarded the wrong grade for a courseThe mother of a student who took his own life after wrongly being told he could not graduate says he was \"failed\" by Glasgow University after a report highlighted serious concerns.An investigation by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) found that the university's processes posed a \"systemic risk to academic standards\".Its review was carried out after the death of Ethan Brown, who should have been awarded a 2:1 degree but was incorrectly told he had not passed his course.His mother, Tracy Scott, said the findings confirmed the family's suspicions about failures at the institution. Glasgow University apologised and said it fully accepted the report's recommendations.Ethan was due to graduate from the University of Glasgow with an Honours degree in geography in December 2024.Tracy Scott said her \"kind and caring\" son enjoyed studying and was proud to be a Glasgow University student.\"He was looking forward to graduating and wanted to be like his aunt who also has a degree from the university,\" she said.'We don't want other families going through what we did. We are not going away.'But with three months to go, he was told he would not be eligible to graduate because he had not been awarded a grade for one course.The 23-year-old took his own life on the day he should have received his degree.An internal investigation was launched after Scott sought answers from the university.It concluded he had been awarded the wrong grade for a course due to an error by the university and should have graduated with a 2:1 Honours degree. The error was not spotted by any University of Glasgow staff, or by two internal exam boards and one external exam board.Scott said the report from the QAA was a \"very emotional read\" which confirmed the family's suspicions about the \"failures\" at the university.\"We're in shock but happy to know what we thought is true,\" she said.Scott said Ethan asked for help but had not been offered any support.\"They failed my son,\" she said.PA MediaEthan's mother Tracy (second right) collected his degree posthumously at a ceremony in DecemberScott said the university must make changes and wants a fatal accident inquiry to be carried out into Ethan's death to \"safeguard present and future students\".\"We can't help Ethan now but we can protect other students,\" Scott said.\"Ethan was a huge loss to our family and we don't want other families to go through what we went through.\"At the time of Ethan's death, the university said it was confident that the error with his marks was an isolated one and \"no other students have been affected\". But the QAA report reveals that two other students in the geography school were given the wrong outcomes, and that five other potential cases were being investigated. Final degree classifications at Glasgow University are currently calculated by aggregating individual course marks.The School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, where Ethan had been studying, was the only one of the 23 different schools which the university itself had identified as \"high risk\".Tracy ScottEthan had been proud to study at Glasgow UniversityThe QAA carried out its investigation after concerns were raised by the Scottish Funding Council.The review did not cover the individual circumstances of Ethan's death but focused on broader issues.It found that Glasgow University's assessment regulations posed a \"systemic risk to academic standards\".The QAA report described the university's code of assessment as \"convoluted\" and said there was a risk of inconsistent interpretation and decision-making at exam boards throughout the institution.It said the extent to which past, present and future awards at the university were affected by this systemic risk was not known.It also highlighted a lack of communication about the options for students who are at risk of not graduating.The report makes 21 recommendations, including mandatory training for staff and a review of how exam boards log final degree awards across the university.It also recommends the university's next regular external peer review takes place one year sooner than planned.Glasgow University apologised to Ethan's familyQAA chief executive Vicki Stott said the findings were \"of serious concern\".She said her organisation would work to ensure that the university implemented the recommendations \"in a timely manner\" to protect academic standards.The Scottish Funding Council, which asked the QAA to carry out the independent review, said a national review of assessment procedures at all universities would now be carried out.Jacqui Brasted, from the SFC, said the report's findings were \"deeply concerning\" and needed to be implemented \"as a matter of urgency\".A spokesperson for the University of Glasgow offered a \"sincere apology\" to Ethan's family and said it fully accepted the QAA recommendations and the risks identified in its report.\"We are profoundly sorry that Ethan tragically took his own life and understand the deep distress it has caused his family,\" it said.\"Since February 2025, we have worked to address the issues highlighted in the internal investigation and will implement the recommendations of the QAA review through a comprehensive plan that builds on current change projects.\"",

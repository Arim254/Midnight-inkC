    "body": "12 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterThe last 12 months have delivered a huge number of viral moments - Taylor Swift getting engaged, a raccoon getting drunk, and the 6-7 trend driving teachers everywhere to early retirement.But those weren't the only moments that kept us entertained throughout the year. Here are 15 of the cultural highlights (and lowlights) that defined 2025.1. Beyoncé's Grammy reactionCBS\"Wait, what? Me? I've won? I've won a Grammy? I've won this Grammy? Are you sure?\"Beyoncé didn't actually say any of these words as she won country album of the year in February, but her facial expression and body language conveyed her understandable shock.There had been some well-documented snobbery towards Cowboy Carter within the country community, but it had a huge night, also winning Beyoncé album of the year for the first time.We'll skip over the fact that she should've won much sooner for Lemonade or Renaissance and just be grateful that Beyoncé got her trophy and the internet got a meme for the ages.2. Sydney Sweeney's denim dramaGetty Images\"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\" So said the strap line for an American Eagle advert in July that featured the Euphoria actress dressed head to toe in denim.Depending on your viewpoint, this was either a fun piece of wordplay in a harmless clothing advert, or a dog whistle for white supremacy and eugenics-era rhetoric.The publicity generated by the fallout duly prompted the company's sales to skyrocket. Sadly for Sweeney, it didn't result in a similar surge for her next film at the box office.The actress herself kept quiet throughout the controversy, but later clarified she \"does not support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign\", adding: \"I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand.\" 3. Lily Allen's revenge Getty Images/Nieves GonzálezIt was an eventful year in music - Oasis got through their reunion shows seemingly without incident, the launch of a new Elvis experience was a blue suede shambles, and Coldplay's tour left two fans in Massachusetts wishing they'd stayed home.Meanwhile, there was an epidemic of plummeting pop stars. A giant car Beyoncé was floating in at her concerts tilted too far, almost tipping her into the audience, while a giant mid-air butterfly Katy Perry was sitting on plunged several feet.But it was Lily Allen's West End Girl that became the most talked about album of the year, thanks to its detailed description of the events that led to her divorce from Stranger Things actor David Harbour.Sample lyric, about setting the terms of an open relationship: \"We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don't be shameless / There had to be payment / It had to be with strangers.\"4. Adolescence: A one-shot wonderNetflix/GettyNetflix's series about a schoolboy accused of stabbing a female classmate was one of the biggest TV hits of the year, dominating conversation for weeks. \"Did you know it was all shot in one take?\" said everybody you know. Gosh, was it really? You're the first person to mention that.\"Can you believe this was Owen Cooper's first screen acting role?\" Well, yes actually.   At 15 years old I wasn't expecting a jam-packed IMDb profile.A few months later, the teenager became the youngest male winner of an Emmy Award, and gave an inspirational acceptance speech.\"I was nothing three years ago, I'm here now,\" said Cooper, who was 12 three years ago. \"If you listen, focus and step out of your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life.\"5. Dubai chocolate floods the shelvesGetty ImagesThere have been plenty of food and drink crazes over the years - matcha, bubble tea, cronuts, and the Starbucks olive oil coffee that we're still disappointed didn't really catch on. This year, the pistachio finally got its moment in the spotlight, after a woman with a very specific pregnancy craving turned it into a phenomenon.The decadent chocolate bar and its creamy pistachio filling subsequently went viral on TikTok thanks to its photogenic look and velvety taste, leading to a string of imitators (charging £11 per bar) and a global surge in pistachio demand.6. The endlessly parodied Jet2 advertGetty ImagesDespite being released in 2015, Jess Glynne's Hold My Hand was named TikTok song of the year after a viral trendOne of the most enjoyable trends of the summer, before it inevitably became overdone, was the much-parodied Jet2 advert.You know the one, where the inescapable Jess Glynne song Hold My Hand plays over footage of a family enjoying their holiday, in an ad campaign that has been running since around 1874. Social media users began sending it up by using the music and slogan over scenes of travel chaos instead, such as tourists in hotels binge-drinking, getting sunburn and physically fighting over sun loungers.Other TikTokkers took to the streets to test members of the public on the ad's famous strap line. The trend led to Hold My Hand being named TikTok's song of the year, despite being released in 2015.7. EsDeeKid's video with Timothée ChalametChalamet/EsDeeKid/XAs Banksy will tell you, nothing gets the public (and press) more interested in your work than keeping your identity a secret. There was much speculation, therefore, over EsDeeKid - a Liverpool rapper who shot to fame this year but keeps his face hidden under a balaclava, bandana or mask.Some fans suggested the rapper's eyes - the only visible part of his face - bore a striking resemblance to those of Hollywood A-lister Timothée Chalamet, who played along with the mystique when asked about it in interviews.On his next visit to London, Chalamet broke off from the red carpets and chat show sofas to meet the drill star, and the pair collaborated in a music video filmed outside a Finsbury Park off-licence.8. Labubu mania prompts consumer chaosGetty ImagesIf 2025 had a face, it was undoubtedly made of vinyl, with pointy ears, big eyes and a grin with precisely nine teeth.Created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung and adapted from picture book series The Monsters, the slightly scary-looking Labubu could be seen hanging from everybody's bag this year, with Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Lisa from Blackpink joining in.It's lucky that British people love a queue, as the plush toys prompted long lines around the world. The character's loveable but demonic appearance is said to be matched by its kind-hearted but chaotic personality (same, tbh).9. David Tennant's bonkers Bafta songCamila Cabello was fully on board with David Tennant's Proclaimers tributeHost David Tennant opened this year's Baftas with a barnstorming rendition of I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers - which involved some participation from the A-list crowd.Tennant name-checked Selena Gomez and Hugh Grant as he walked through the audience, but frankly those guys got off lightly compared with what came next.The actor picked on Camila Cabello, Anna Kendrick, Colman Domingo, James McAvoy and Celia Imrie for the call-and-response \"Da da-da!\" bits after the chorus.The facial expressions throughout were priceless. Some were enthusiastically on board, others seemed utterly confused and Jeff Goldblum looked as if he was having the best night of his life. 10. Rachel Zegler's film flop (and theatre triumph)Disney/PA MediaRachel Zegler in Snow White (left) and singing from the London Palladium balcony in EvitaA live action remake of Snow White ran into several controversies ahead of its release in March.Actress Rachel Zegler ruffled a few feathers by criticising the classic original, there were reports of tension between her and co-star Gal Gadot over the conflict in Gaza, and Disney got itself into a right old tangle over what to do about the seven dwarfs. The film bombed. But Zegler took Pitbull's advice and turned a negative into a positive, appearing in a successful West End production of Evita a few months later. A clever stunt which saw her leave the London Palladium stage to perform Don't Cry For Me Argentina from its balcony attracted giant crowds outside. An estimated 130,000 people watched Zegler from the street over the show's run.11. Streaming hits (and misses)Disney/Amazon/HBOL-R: Kim Kardashian in All's Fair, Joe Wilkinson in Last One Laughing, and Aimee Lou Wood in The White LotusAmazon found themselves with a surprise hit on their hands thanks to the first series of Last One Laughing, a reality show about 10 comedians in a house who aren't allowed to laugh at each other.The most viral moment came when Joe Wilkinson was giving a mock-serious speech about the RNLI, only to be pelted with a giant ball of pink paint, for no apparent reason. Glorious.Meanwhile, the third season of wealth satire The White Lotus became one of the most talked about series of the year, and prompted a row over a Saturday Night Live parody that had mocked Aimee Lou Wood's teeth.Kim Kardashian's legal series All's Fair, however, was far less well received with some critics suggesting it \"may be the worst TV drama ever\". But Kardashian made light of the bad reviews by using them to promote the series, which was promptly recommissioned.12. Alan Carr turning into a cold-blooded killer The biggest TV show of the year however, was a triumphant first series of The Celebrity Traitors, and the many viral moments that came with it.Tom Daley's side-eye, Celie Imrie's noisy digestive system, Paloma Faith's early murder, Kate Garraway's theatrics, Joe Marler's \"big dog\" theory and Jonathan Ross's rousing exit speech all contributed to a memorable series.But Alan Carr was the breakout star. We almost feel bad about how much he struggled with being a traitor, but his sweating and discomfort were pure entertainment. Plus, he pulled off an astonishing last-minute win.It led to a career resurgence for Carr, which he was both delighted and miffed about. \"People are going 'Oh, that Alan, isn't he funny?'\" he told Graham Norton. \"I've been on telly for 25 years, I must have been awful!\"13. Adrien Brody's never-ending Oscars speechGetty ImagesBreaking an Oscars record is usually a good thing, but Adrien Brody achieved a dubious honour when he won best actor in February.Accepting the statue for his role in The Brutalist, Brody threw his chewing gum at his girlfriend before delivering an acceptance speech which lasted 5min 40sec - the longest in Academy history. The orchestra tried to play him off, but he waved them off and continued his self-indulgence undeterred. Rumour has it he's still on stage at the Dolby Theatre today.A few weeks later, when presenter Conan O'Brien was confirmed to return in 2026, he joked: \"The only reason I'm hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech.\"14. The celeb-packed Blue Origin space flightEPAKaty Perry and Gayle King were among six women who took an 11-minute flight to space as part of the Blue Origin voyage in April. They flew more than 100km above earth, giving them a few minutes of weightlessness to enjoy Perry's live rendition of What a Wonderful World. But some commentators said it was \"tone deaf\" for celebrities to be taking part in such a fleeting and expensive trip at a time of economic struggle.And there was one fellow singer who made clear she wouldn't be following Perry into orbit...15. Mariah: 'I think I've done enough''Wow': Mariah Carey discovers Katy Perry went into spaceWe'd been aware for a while that Mariah Carey likes to take life at an easy pace these days, as she demonstrated in a less-than-energetic performance at the VMAs in September. But in case there was any doubt, she clarified her feelings about space travel in an interview with BBC Radio 2. The iconic behaviour began when presenter Scott Mills asked her about Perry's trip, and it emerged that the news story hadn't even made it on to Carey's radar (\"Did she go to space?\")Mills followed up by asking whether she would ever flying into orbit herself. In a response that went viral and gave us our new motto for 2026, Carey said simply: \"I think I've done enough.\"",

    "body": "22 minutes agoTinshui YeungJapan motorway crash involving 56 cars leaves one person deadA pile-up involving at least 50 vehicles on a highway in central Japan has left two people dead and 26 injured, according to police.The incident was caused by a crash between two trucks, sparking a chain reaction that set at least 10 vehicles on fire, local police said.A 77-year-old woman from Tokyo was killed, and another body was discovered in the driver's seat of a burnt-out truck. Five people were seriously injured and 21 suffered minor injuries, police said.There was a heavy snow warning in place at the time of the crash. Police believe icy surfaces likely caused the trucks to skid on the roads.The crash happened on the Kan-etsu Expressway in Minakami, Gunma prefecture, about 160km (100 miles) north-west of Tokyo, at about 19:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on 26 December.It took about seven and a half hours to put out the fire, police said. Following the incident, a section of the highway was closed, with a long line of vehicles, many charred beyond recognition, stuck in the outbound lane. Work is under way to tow them away.A man in his 60s, whose vehicle was involved in the accident, told local media outlet NHK he heard a loud explosion from the far end of the pile-up and saw fire during the crash. The blaze then spread to other vehicles, he said.He said he was evacuated to a nearby toll gate with about 50 other people and spent the night in the hallway there.Nexco, which operates the road, said checks were needed to see if the surface was damaged by the fire.The company is warning travellers not to use the highway.",

    "body": "The Treasury is set to insure the Bayeux Tapestry against damage for an estimated £800m while it is on loan to the British Museum next year.The 70m-long embroidery depicting the Battle of Hastings in 1066 will travel from France to London as part of a deal between the two nation's governments.The artefact's transit and its time in storage and on display will be covered under the Government Indemnity Scheme (GIS). Indemnity insurance covers situations like loss or damage.A Treasury spokesperson said that, without the long-standing scheme, \"public museums and galleries would face a substantial commercial insurance premium, which would be significantly less cost effective\".There are concerns about the move, as some French art experts have suggested the nearly 1,000-year-old work was in far too a delicate state to be transported - something French officials have denied.It is understood the Treasury has received an initial valuation for covering the Bayeux Tapestry that has been provisionally approved. The loan will not be formally confirmed until it receives the final valuation.That final valuation is estimated to be around £800m, according to the Financial Times, citing unnamed officials. The Treasury did not dispute this figure when approached by the BBC.The Bayeux Tapestry will be displayed in the Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery of the British Museum from next September until July 2027 while its current home, the Bayeux Museum, undergoes renovations. Comprising 58 scenes, 626 characters and 202 horses, the huge masterpiece charts a contested time in Anglo-French relations when William The Conqueror took the English throne from Harold Godwinson, becoming the first Norman king of England.The government's indemnity scheme allows art and cultural objects to be shown publicly in the UK which \"might not have been otherwise because the cost of insurance would have been too high\".  The scheme - first set up in 1980 - has facilitated numerous high-value loans,  including Vincent van Gogh's 1888 work The Bedroom to the National Gallery. The scheme is estimated to save museums and galleries around £81m a year when compared to the cost of taking out commercial insurance.In exchange for the Bayeux Tapestry, the British Museum will loan items to France, including the 7th Century Anglo-Saxon artefacts discovered at the Sutton Hoo burial site in Suffolk and the 12th Century Lewis chess pieces.",

His mother, Laila Soueif, almost died twice while on hunger strike to push for his release.The most prominent of Egypt's many political prisoners, he was pardoned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi in September but was then not allowed to leave the country.Now, removed from the travel ban list, he has flown to the UK to be reunited with his 14-year old son, who lives in Brighton.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote on X that he was delighted, saying Alaa Abdel Fattah's case had been a top priority for the government.His sister, Mona, said that hundreds of people around the world had helped bring this moment about and that the family could now finally begin to heal.Speaking to the BBC from Cairo in October after his release, he had said: \"I'm learning how to get back into life.\"He added: \"I'm doing much better than I would have expected. Much better than most people would have expected.\"His release in September followed a long campaign by his family - backed by celebrities such as actors Judi Dench and Olivia Colman - and lobbying by the British government.",

    "body": "Four hikers who went missing on Christmas Day have been found dead after being buried by an avalanche in the snow-covered Vardousia Mountains in Greece.The bodies of three men and a woman were found on Friday evening after a large-scale search in the mountainous region of Fokida, according to Greek state broadcaster ERT.Fire service teams located the bodies partially covered by snow on a steep and inaccessible slope near the summit of Korakas peak, at an altitude of about 2,000m (6,561ft). Rescue officials said the group was swept away by an avalanche.Authorities said the hikers had begun their ascent in favourable weather, but conditions quickly worsened due to the altitude and the area's terrain.Vasilis Vathrakogiannis, a spokesperson for the Hellenic Fire Service, told the BBC the alarm was raised by a friend of the three men after they failed to return at the expected time.\"Weather conditions were extremely difficult, with low temperatures and poor visibility,\" he said, adding this made it hard for both drones and a helicopter to detect anything.He said a fire service ground team later found the bodies of the three men and a woman, who was confirmed to be a friend of one of them and had not been expected to take part in the climb.The Vardousia Mountains are considered one of Greece's most challenging mountaineering areas, particularly in winter, when conditions can be unforgiving even for experienced climbers.Haris Asariotakis, head of the Hellenic Rescue Team mission at the scene, said preparations were under way to recover the bodies.Authorities said rescue teams began approaching the site early on Saturday, with a helicopter requested to help transport the bodies if weather conditions allow, due to the distance from the nearest road.Additional reporting by Kostas Koukoumakas",

    "body": "4 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandTabby WilsonThailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, the defence ministers of both countries have said in a joint statement.The two sides have agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now and allow civilians living in border areas to return home, halting almost three weeks of intense clashes in which dozens of people have been killed and nearly one million displaced.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Once it has been in place for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand since July will be released, the statement said.The breakthrough came after days of talks between the two countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US.The agreement prioritises getting the displaced back to their homes, and also includes an agreement to remove landmines.Thailand's Defence Minister Natthaphon Narkphanit described the ceasefire as a test for the \"other party's sincerity\".\"Should the ceasefire fail to materialise or be violated, Thailand retains its legitimate right to self-defence under international law,\" he told reporters.Thailand had been reluctant to accept the ceasefire, saying the last one was not properly implemented. They also resented what they saw as Cambodia's efforts to internationalise the conflict.Unlike the last ceasefire in July, US President Donald Trump was conspicuously absent from this one, although the US State Department was involved.That ceasefire agreement collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Si Sa Ket province, in which two Thai soldiers were injured.Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate.Clashes have continued throughout December. On Friday, Thailand carried out more air strikes inside Cambodia.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry said the strikes were \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses.How well the ceasefire holds this time depends to a large extent on political will. Nationalist sentiment has been inflamed in both countries.Cambodia, in particular, has lost many soldiers and a lot of its military equipment. It has been driven back from positions it held on the border, and suffered extensive damage from the Thai air strikes, grievances which could make a lasting peace harder to achieve.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May, and two months later, in July, there were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.Following intervention by Malaysia and President Trump, a fragile ceasefire was negotiated between the two countries, and signed in late October.Trump dubbed the agreement the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\". It mandated both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.However, the agreement was suspended by Thailand in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines, with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announcing that the security threat had \"not actually decreased\".",

Both teams have influential players who have recently been discussing the importance of their Christian beliefs.And it's not just in football where we've seen contrasting headlines about professional athletes displaying their faith.Earlier this year, at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, GB sprinter Jeremiah Azu was warned not to wear a \"100% Jesus\" headband.But can your beliefs impact your performance - and how you are treated - in the sport you play? ReutersCrystal Palace's Marc Guehi celebrates scoring against Arsenal at Emirates StadiumSport governing bodies often have rules against displaying religious and political slogans during competition.Jeremiah wasn't formally punished for wearing his \"100% Jesus\" headband in a 400m semi-final, but World Athletics bosses said they spoke to his team about the accessory.The 24-year-old says he now backs the rules separating religion from the track, but he's glad he did it.He tells BBC Newsbeat he believes his \"strength\" comes from his faith, and he wore the headband to show that.His father is a pastor, so Jeremiah says religion has always been a part of his life.\"We read the Bible at home, we prayed at home,\" he recalls. He says his religion helps his performance in athletics. \"As a Christian you have to be disciplined,\" he says, a trait he feels transfers over to track and field.\"There's days where it's difficult to push, but I know I have to from the discipline I've got from my faith,\" he explains. Semi-pro footballers Zainab El-Mouden (left) and Jaiden Chang-Brown are both devoted to their religions  Though Jeremiah says he's never felt \"muted\" when talking about his faith, up-and-coming athletes tell Newsbeat it's not always that simple. Semi-pro footballer Zainab El-Mouden, who plays for Chesham United FC Women,  says there are challenges as a female Muslim player who wears a hijab. The garment is worn over the head as a display of modesty, but it's not always been welcomed on the football pitch.It was banned by governing body Fifa until 2014, when players were permitted to wear it for religious reasons.And just two years ago, Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina, 27, made history by becoming the first player to wear a hijab at a World Cup.Zainab, 22, says her faith means everything to her, from the way she conducts herself to the way she dresses. She says it's been a real journey to become comfortable wearing a hijab while playing football. \"Initially I hated it, I hated the way it looked on me,\" she says.\"My hijab was my biggest insecurity and then it became my biggest strength.\"Whether you want to or not, you're going see me and you're gonna watch me more than anyone else.\"Zainab feels there is still a difference in how male Muslim players are treated compared with female players. \"With a female Muslim player, they're visibly different so that's where I think the rift kind of comes in,\" she says.After growing up with no one that \"looked like\" her in football to inspire her, Zainab says she wants to be that role model for others.\"All the girls that are growing up now need that representation to play,\" she says.Does faith impact your performance in sport ?There are studies on how a positive mindset and confidence can influence your performance.Religion isn't always part of it - many athletes have rituals they \"must\" follow before a big game or race to centre themselves.  Some report that their faith forms part of preparations for a big event.A Seoul University study published in 2000, based on interviews with 180 sports people across 41 sports, identified prayer as one of seven main \"coping strategies\" those surveyed used to combat anxiety before a big event.It suggested this could have a positive effect on their performance.Semi-professional footballer Jaiden Chang-Brown, of Lingfield FC, tells Newsbeat his faith has helped him to manage his emotions in a slightly different way.\"I feel like sometimes my passion could get the better of me in the past,\" he says.\"Sometimes I would lash out at teammates.\"It's really helped just to give me peace when I'm on the pitch.\"Jaiden says his faith has helped him to improve his mindset and \"tap into that psychological side of football\" when he plays.The 21-year-old describes himself as a \"born-again Christian\" and says his religion is the most important thing in his life.\"It's bigger than football, it's bigger than everything,\" he says.\"People think it's not cool to be bold in your faith, but it is.\"You can laugh and have your giggles, but it's what I believe in.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this ",

    "body": "'I was homeless but ice skating changed my life'4 days agoTom MacDougallYorkshireProvidedCharlie, who is supported by the charity Roundabout, said ice skating had helped him to express himselfWhen Charlie was 21 years old, he attempted to take his own life after becoming homeless for the third time. The 23-year-old has since represented Great Britain in international ice skating, saying the sport has \"changed his life\".Charlie, originally from Brighton, moved in with his grandmother when he was 13 after feeling pressure to come out as gay, which created a rift with his family.After his grandmother died when he was 17, he became homeless for the first time and would sleep on friends' sofas.He eventually got a private tenancy, but was unable to keep up with the cost of the rent, which led to him becoming homeless again.\"I really struggled with the instability of sofa-surfing, especially after having my own place and living independently,\" he said.\"It felt like a step backwards and it was much harder than I anticipated going back to a lifestyle I thought I'd left behind -  it felt like it was never going to end.\"In 2023, he moved to Sheffield with his boyfriend, but became homeless for the third time after the relationship broke down.During this period, he attempted to take his own life.He was referred to the South Yorkshire youth homelessness charity Roundabout, which assigned him a flat - in which he still lives - and gave him access to a counselling service.\"I've thrived as a person up in Sheffield, down south I'm just a shell and don't feel like a person or appreciated, but up here I have so much more to live for and I'm treated with respect,\" he said.ProvidedCharlie said his dream was to take part in the OlympicsHe said he felt \"lonely\" after moving into the flat and decided to try ice skating to \"make some friends\".\"I very quickly got addicted to it and wanted to do competitions,\" he said.Charlie represented Great Britain at the Celje Ice Cup in Slovenia last month.He won gold medals in the artistic performance and free skating categories, and hopes to one day make it to the Olympics.\"It isn't just about skating though - it's taught me discipline and respect for myself,\" he said.\"It's helped me understand my feelings and how to portray them, it's so hard to open up about how I feel, but I can express who I am through my skating.\"He now practises for 20 hours every week alongside working and studying at Doncaster College.\"I train mainly at Ice Sheffield and it's crazy to think that I have come this far in two years,\" he said.\"I wasn't expecting a medal at all and even when I heard the scores I had to check online to make sure I really had won - I didn't think I'd do so well.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.More stories like this",

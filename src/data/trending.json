    "body": "Second MP quits new left-wing Your Party group3 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterGetty ImagesA second MP has announced he is leaving Your Party, a new left-wing group set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former Labour MP Zarah Sultana.In a statement on social media, Iqbal Mohamed did not say why he was leaving but made reference to \"false allegations and smears made against me\".The Dewsbury and Batley MP said British politics needed \"a genuine, inclusive force for positive change\" and expressed the hope that Your Party could fulfil that role.Your Party has been approached for a comment.Mohamed's departure comes a week after Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain said he would be \"stepping away\" from Your Party, citing a \"toxic\" culture towards \"Muslim men\".Sultana announced in July that she was leaving Labour to set up a new party with Corbyn, saying it was time to challenge the \"broken\" Westminster system. However since then the group has been mired in factional in-fighting including a row over the handling of £800,000 of donations. Mohamed made reference to the internal tensions, saying in a statement: \"The many false allegations and smears made against me and others, and reported as fact without evidence, have been surprising and disappointing.\"However, I am confident that my colleagues and I have acted professionally, patiently, and in good faith throughout.\"He thanked those who had supported Your Party and wished them \"success in their future endeavours\".He said he would continue working with colleagues in the Independent Alliance, a grouping in Parliament made up of Corbyn and four other independent pro-Gaza MPs who were elected for the first time in the 2024 general election. Your Party, which is yet to form an official parliamentary group, is due to have its first conference on 29 November in Liverpool, where delegates will pick an official name and leadership model. Sultana is hosting what is being billed as \"Zarah's eve of conference Your Party rally\" before the event kicks off.The group had hoped to gain support from those on the left unhappy with the Labour government. However, it has lost ground in recent months to the Green Party, which has surged in the polls and gained tens of thousands of new members following the election of left-wing activist Zack Polanski as it leader.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKatie Razzall,Culture and Media Editor and George Bowden,Culture reporterA member of the BBC's board has resigned over what he says are \"governance issues\" at the top of the corporation.Shumeet Banerji also said in a letter that he was \"not consulted\" about the events leading up to the departures of the director general, Tim Davie, and BBC News chief executive, Deborah Turness.Banerji confirmed his resignation on Friday, the BBC said in a statement.BBC News has approached Banerji for comment.The BBC's two top executives resigned earlier in November as a result of the fallout over a Panorama episode that edited together parts of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump.Since then, concerns have been raised in some quarters about how the BBC board operates. The board is responsible for oversight and strategy of the corporation.In blaming governance issues, Banerji appears to have made a direct criticism of chairman Samir Shah and other members of the board.Banerji's resignation comes at a difficult time for the BBC, with Shah and board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson due to give evidence to the Culture Media and Sport Committee of MPs on Monday afternoon.Questions have already been raised in Parliament about political appointees on the BBC board (there are five including Shah and Gibb).They will likely be asked about claims, first made in a leaked document, that the BBC has \"systemic issues\" relating to coverage around, for example, the Israel-Gaza conflict and coverage of sex and gender. That was rejected by Turness and Davie.Written by Michael Prescott, who was previously an independent external advisor to the BBC's Editorial Standards Committee, the document was published by the Telegraph newspaper and also flagged the Panorama edit.The corporation has since acknowledged the edit gave \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" on the day of the riot at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021.In his speech on 6 January 2021, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, Trump said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme, Trump: A Second Chance?, the edited clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Trump has threatened to sue over the programme, saying it defamed him. While the BBC has apologised, it has refused the president's demand for financial compensation.In his role on the board, Banerji was \"responsible for upholding and protecting the independence of the BBC by acting in the public interest and exercising independent judgement\", according to the corporation's website.Banerji, a non-executive board member since 2022, is the founder of an advisory and investment firm that specialises in technology companies. He previously led Booz & Company, a management consultancy firm.The 12-member board of the BBC is responsible for ensuring it delivers on its public service mission and it sets the strategic direction of the corporation, which is largely funded by licence-fee payers.Non-executive members hold the BBC's executive management to account. The board is chaired by Shah, a former documentary maker.A BBC spokesperson said: \"Shumeet Banerji today notified the BBC Board of his resignation. Mr Banerji's term on the Board as a non-executive director was due to end at the end of December and we thank him for his service.\"The search for a replacement is already well under way and we will update further in due course.\"",

    "body": "While cleaning out their late mother's California attic last Christmas, three brothers made a life-changing discovery under a pile of faded newspapers: one of the first Superman comics ever made. An original copy of the June 1939 first edition on the Man of Steel's adventures, it was in a remarkably pristine condition.Now it has become the highest-priced comic book ever sold, fetching $9.12m (£7m) at auction.  Texas-based Heritage Auctions, which hosted Thursday's sale, called it the \"pinnacle of comic collecting\".The brothers found six comic books, including Superman #1, in the attic underneath a stack of newspapers inside a cardboard box and surrounded by cobwebs in 2024, Heritage said in a press release. They waited a few months before contacting the auction house, but once they did, Heritage Auctions vice-president Lon Allen visited them in San Francisco within days, according to the auction house. The brothers, who have chosen to withhold their names, are \"in their 50s and 60s, and their mom had always told them she had an expensive comics collection but never showed them\", Mr Allen said in Heritage's press release. \"It's a twist on the old 'Mom threw away my comics' story.\"Their mother had held on to the comic books since she and her brother bought them between the Great Depression and the beginning of World War Two, Heritage said.Mr Allen added that the cool northern California climate was perfect for preserving old paper. \"If it had been in an attic here in Texas, it would have been ruined,\" he said.That helped CGC, a large third-party comics grading service, give this copy of Superman #1 a 9.0 rating on a 10-point scale, topping the previous record of 8.5. And at its sale price of over $9m, including buyer's premium, Superman #1 easily beat the previous highest-priced comic book ever sold by $3m. Action Comics No. 1, the 1938 work that first introduced Superman, sold for $6m last year.The youngest brother said in Heritage's press release that the box had remained forgotten in the back of attic. \"As the years unfolded, life brought about a series of losses and changes,\" he said. \"The demands of everyday survival took centre stage, and the box of comics, once set aside with care and intention, was forgotten. Until last Christmas.\"He added: \"This isn't simply a story about old paper and ink. This was never just about a collectible. \"This is a testament to memory, family and the unexpected ways the past finds its way back to us.\"",

Residents have been warned to remain indoors while armed officers try to track down the animal.A male teacher \"got the whole brunt of it\" and some children were hit with bear spray as the adults tried to fend off the animal, Veronica Schooner, a parent, told the Canadian Press.Ms Schooner said her 10-year-old son was part of the school group, though he was not attacked. \"He said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\" she said, adding that \"he even felt its fur\".British Columbia Emergency Health Services said two people were critically injured, two more were seriously hurt, and seven others were treated at the scene, reports the Canadian Press.The group were from Acwsalcta School, which is run by the indigenous Nuxalk Nation, in the town located 700km (435 miles) north-west of Vancouver. \"Officers are armed\" the Nation wrote on Facebook. \"Remain indoors and off the highway.\" \"It's hard to know what to say during this very difficult time.

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterThe Labour MP behind the bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales says she is worried some members of the House of Lords are trying to \"frustrate\" its passage into law.Kim Leadbeater warned the legislation was approaching a \"crunch point\" after the number of changes proposed in the Lords rose above 1,000.The bill, which was passed by MPs in an historic vote in June, must be approved by both Houses of Parliament before becoming law.But peers are making very slow progress in scrutinising it, meaning that unless they speed up it will almost certainly need to be allocated more debating sessions to avoid running out of time.The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill passed its first stage in the Lords in September, but will only become law if MPs and peers can agree the final wording before the current session of Parliament ends in the spring.Peers have so far discussed fewer than 30 of the amendments during two of the four days reserved for committee stage, when the bill is scrutinised line-by-line.The passage of the bill has been complicated by the fact it was put forward by Leadbeater, a backbench MP, rather than the government, a category of draft law that is vulnerable to running out of debating time.On Friday, they spent the entire four hours allocated for the day discussing a group of 21 amendments on safeguards designed to prevent people being coerced or encouraged into an assisted death.Speaking after Friday's debate, Leadbeater told the BBC she respected those with concerns, adding that most peers had been \"engaging in good faith\" and \"I know the Lords want to do a good job\".But she added that some of the debate in the Lords had been \"repetitive\", whilst some of the issues raised by peers had already been \"discussed at length\" by MPs.Adding that \"in practice, the protection is there\", she said: \"I do worry that some of the processes and procedures that can be used are being used to frustrate the bill, and that is deeply disappointing and upsetting.\"A similar bill to legalise assisted dying did not make it through the Lords in 2014 - although unlike Leadbeater's draft law, it had not already been approved by MPs.Leadbeater said she was \"concerned\" about the Lords potentially trying to block a bill after the Commons had already \"voted to change the law\".Adding that \"now is the time\" to update the law, she said: \"the Lords have to respect that, and we have to respect democracy\".Legalisation of assisted dying did not feature in the manifestos of any of the major parties prior to last year's general election, and parties have agreed to treat it as a matter of conscience, meaning they will not tell their MPs how to vote.Critics and opponents of the bill have insisted the legislation requires significant redrafting to ensure any system properly protects vulnerable people.During the earlier debate, before Leadbeater's intervention, former DUP leader Baron Dodds of Duncairn said the bill needed further changes to ensure \"all the necessary safeguards\" were in place.He added that the Lords would not need to spend so much time on the bill \"had some of these issues been dealt with in a different way\" by MPs.Former High Court judge Elizabeth Butler-Sloss expressed a similar sentiment, telling peers: \"There are many of us who do not like the bill, but there is a real probability that the bill will pass, and if it passes, we want it better than it is at the moment. Consequently, we are not wasting time.\"Ministers have ruled out using government debating time to enable further discussion of the amendments in the Lords, but have hinted they are prepared to explore other routes to make more time available.According to the Hansard Society, a think tank, such options include additional sittings on Fridays, a time traditionally reserved to debate bills put forward by backbench MPs.Other alternatives include using time that would normally be reserved for other subjects, or sitting for longer hours between Monday and Thursday, it added.

At least 10 students were injured in a stampede as they tried to leave Dhaka University on Friday.\"We have never experienced an earthquake this powerful in the last five years,\" said the country's environmental adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan.At least three people were killed when a railing and debris fell from a five-storey building in Dhaka's Armanitola area, deputy police commissioner Mallik Ahsan Uddin Sami said.Nitai Chandra De Sarkar, director of the department's monitoring division, said 461 people have been reported injured across the country, including 252 in the Gazipur district, north of Dhaka.Sarker told the BBC: \"Our main task at the moment is to assess casualties and damage. We are not yet seeing the challenge of rescue from the rubble or debris management at that level.\"Bengali Sadman Sakib told Reuters news agency: \"I have never felt such tremor in my 30 years of life. We were at the office when the furniture started shaking.\"We rushed down the stairs on the street and saw other people on the road already.\"A student called Abdullah, who was sleeping at the time of the earthquake, told Reuters the \"whole building was shaking\".Abdul Goni/Anadolu via Getty ImagesTremors were felt in eastern Indian states bordering Bangladesh, but there were no reports of major damage.The earthquake caused Ireland's second cricket test match in Bangladesh to stop temporarily.Coaches and players not involved gathered at the boundary, while those in the stands took shelter. The game was stopped for three minutes but play soon resumed.Ireland's head coach Heinrich Malan said: \"I've been involved in a couple of earthquakes from my time living in New Zealand.\"It's never a nice feeling and you're trying to understand what is happening in the moment around you, but also the bigger impacts about where the earthquake struck.\"Everything stood still for a couple of minutes and we got back to business, but we're thinking of everyone and hoping there wasn't too much damage done.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterSir Keir Starmer has said it will take time to turn the country around, telling voters to judge him at the next general election.The prime minister told the BBC his government had made \"good steps\", particularly on the cost-of-living, but \"we need to do more\".It comes after a dismal few weeks for the PM, who has faced growing criticism and speculation he could face a leadership challenge.The government is also facing a difficult Budget next week, when the chancellor is widely expected to increase taxes.In an interview with the BBC's Chris Mason in Johannesburg, South Africa, where the PM is attending the G20 summit of world leaders, Sir Keir was challenged over why some opinion polls suggest he is the most unpopular prime minister since modern polling began.\"We won an election last year on the manifesto that said we would change the country after 14 years of failure,\" he said.\"I always said that would take time because you can't turn around 14 years of failure in just 12 months or 16 months. \"I'm very conscious that we have to deliver on three things above all else. The first is making sure people feel better off, and that's bearing down on the cost-of-living, making sure the public services are better, in particular the NHS, which is why we put record investment in the NHS, and making sure people feel more safe and secure. \"And I have no doubt that I will rightly be judged against that at the next election.\"Sir Keir has insisted he will lead Labour into the next general election, which is not due until 2029, although he could choose to call one earlier.Last week, allies of the prime minister told journalists that he would fight any attempts by Labour MPs to remove him, with Health Secretary Wes Streeting among those named as plotting a leadership challenge.However, the attempt to strengthen Sir Keir's position appeared to backfire as it brought talk of threats to his leadership into the open and sparked further criticism of the PM.Streeting denied he was planning to challenge Sir Keir and hit out at a \"toxic\" culture within No 10, although he said he did not think the PM was behind the briefings.Sir Keir has insisted the attacks against Streeting had not come from Downing Street.Meanwhile, the PM has faced claims from the the Conservatives his government's Budget is already unravelling, after the chancellor backed away from raising income tax rates - a move which would break an election pledge. Asked if he was frustrated the achievements of his government were being \"drowned out\", Sir Keir told the BBC: \"Every minute that is spent talking about anything other than cost-of-living is a wasted minute in my book.\"The next major test for Sir Keir will come in May, when Labour are braced for najor losses in Sccottish, Welsh and English local elections.However, with the prospect of a tricky Budget next week, there has been speculation a leadership challenge could come sooner.Anyone mounting a leadership bid would need the backing of at least 80 Labour MPs.Only a small number of Labour MPs have publicly called for Sir Keir to be replaced but many more have raised concerns about his leadership privately.On Friday, Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome, who is on the left of the party, joined Labour backbencher Clive Lewis in calling for a new leader.\"Even if Keir Starmer had a radical change of direction, I don't think people would believe him. And I don't think people around him would allow that to happen,\" she said in an interview with former Labour candidate Ali Milani.\"So I think there has to be a change in leadership, a change in personnel, of the people in Number 10, and a completely different direction for the party.\"Earlier this week Rachael Maskell, who was recently readmitted to Labour's parliamentary party after a four-month suspension for leading a rebellion over proposed welfare cuts, suggested the PM should consider his position if next week's Budget does not deliver.\"Ultimately, the prime minister needs to look in the mirror and say 'Do I have the skills at this particular time in our history to lead the Labour Party?',\" the Labour MP for York Central told LBC.Challenged over her comments and whether he was the right man to lead the country, Sir Keir said he had proven his doubters wrong in the past by changing the Labour Party and winning a landslide election victory last year.\"Now people will say to me, 'It's not possible to change the country for the better.' I say it is,\" he told the BBC.\"I'm optimistic about the future of our country and I know that we can turn it around after 14 years of failure under the Conservatives.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoMegan Bonar and Rebecca Curran,BBC ScotlandPA MediaScotland beat Denmark in a thrilling 4-2 victory to get to the World CupUefa has apologised after videos of Scotland fans celebrating the team qualifying for the World Cup were removed from social media.The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) received emails from the European football governing body stating it had shared footage showing TV coverage of the Scotland v Denmark game on X without permission.Posts shared by the SFSA showed fans across the country celebrating Tuesday 's match, where Scotland secured a World Cup spot for the first time since 1998.Uefa said many videos were \"wrongly picked up by content protection agencies\" and taken down due to copyright infringement. The SFSA's account was also blocked.SFSA co-founder Paul Goodwin had questioned the fairness of the claim.He said: \"It is hard to believe that Uefa are so out of touch that they demanded that X take down images of joyous fans in bars in Glasgow, Stirling and Dundee where some of our members were celebrating a glorious evening for the nation.\"It really smacks of folk who have no idea about football, making decisions.\"Uefa orders Scotland fans to remove celebration videos from XTuesday's match was free-to-air on BBC Scotland and BBC Two. Rights differ elsewhere.One of the videos removed showed a packed pub in Inverurie erupt when Kenny McLean scored with a spectacular shot from the halfway line to seal Scotland's 4-2 victory.Mr Goodwin added: \"Yes, the game was on in the background but these clips were of fans watching the game that were legally being watched on the BBC and were an average of 40 seconds long. \"So its hardly us streaming a game to a worldwide audience.\"The group received emails from lawyers on behalf of Uefa after posts had been flagged for breaching Uefa rules on match footage.Mr Goodwin said he was \"shocked\" when the videos were deleted and the group's account was blocked.\"Our message to Uefa is maybe best summed up in the chant often directed to match officials, 'you don't know what you are doing',\" he added.'Fantastic achievement'Following the criticism, Uefa backtracked on the removals and issued an apology.It said steps were being taken to withdraw the copyright notices so that the videos can be reinstated by the social media platforms.A spokesperson said: \"Uefa has a robust and extensive content protection programme in place to combat the unauthorised distribution of its content.\"In this instance, it appears that the relevant content was wrongly picked up by our content protection agencies. \"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and thank you for your understanding. \"Congratulations on your qualification for the World Cup, a fantastic achievement that we know means so much to Scottish fans everywhere.\"Scotland qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 with a memorable 4-2 win over Denmark at Hampden.Goals from Scott McTominay, Lawrence Shankland, Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean secured Scotland's place at the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico.As well as fan reactions, video edits of the goals, particularly McTominay's bicycle kick, have been widely shared on social media sites, including X as well as Instagram and TikTok.Scottish Labour culture spokesman, Neil Bibby, said the removals had been \"heavy-handed\".He said: \"Scotland's victory on Tuesday night was a historic moment for the country.\"But it was also a spectacular advert for the beautiful game across the globe.\"Uefa frequently removes YouTube videos due to strict copyright enforcement.The governing body for European football owns the broadcast rights to its matches and generally restricts the uploading of match footage by unofficial channels and fans.According to Uefa rules, the governing body \"is the exclusive owner of all intellectual property rights of the competition, including any current or future rights in all types of audio and visual material of the competition\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondentgettyThe \"swarm\" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered.They used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust. They used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them.One of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.What happened in Santorini?The seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor.The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"Does this mean the Santorini unrest is over?For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\".",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Kyiv risks losing US support over a White House plan on how to end the war with Russia.Addressing the nation on Friday, Zelensky said Ukraine \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\", adding that \"today is one of the most difficult moments in our history\".The widely leaked US peace plan includes proposals that Kyiv had previously ruled out: ceding eastern areas it now controls, significantly cutting its army size, and pledging not to join Nato.These provisions are seen as heavily slanted towards Russia, whose President Vladimir Putin said the plan could be a \"basis\" for peace settlement.At Friday's meeting with his security cabinet, Putin said Moscow had received the plan, which had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.In his 10-minute address in front of the presidential office in Kyiv, Zelensky warned that Ukraine would face \"a lot of pressure... to weaken us, to make divide us\", adding that \"the enemy is not sleeping\".Urging Ukrainians to stay united, he stressed that the country's \"national interest must be taken into account\". \"We're not making loud statements,\" he went on, \"we'll be calmly working with America and all the partners... offering alternatives\" to the proposed peace plan.Zelensky also said he had been reassured of continuous support during a phone call with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.After the talks, Starmer stressed that \"the principle that Ukraine must determine its future under its sovereignty is a fundamental principle\".Separately, Zelensky said he had spoken \"for almost an hour\" with US Vice-President JD Vance and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, adding that Ukraine \"always respected\" President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war.In Washington, Trump warned that Ukraine would lose more territory to Russia \"in a short amount of time\".He said it was \"appropriate\" to give Ukraine until 27 November - Thanksgiving in the US - to agree to the peace deal, but added deadlines could be extended if things were \"going well\".Washington has been pressing Kyiv to quickly accept the plan, and sent senior Pentagon officials to the Ukrainian capital earlier this week.On Thursday, President Putin sounded determined to continue the war despite reported heavy Russian combat casualties.\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader, wearing a military uniform, told his army commanders. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation [full-scale war].\"The 28-point US peace plan emerged as Russia claims small territorial gains in south-eastern Ukraine, while Zelensky faces a domestic crisis implicating top officials in a $100m (£76m) corruption scandal.The White House has pushed back on claims that Ukraine was frozen out of the drafting of the proposal, following meetings between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.An unnamed US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the plan was drawn up \"immediately\" following discussions with Ukraine's top security official Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of it.Umerov is said to have made several modifications before he presented it to Zelensky.The leaked draft proposes Ukrainian troops' withdrawal from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.The US plan also limits Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.The draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.Ukrainians both under and free of Russian occupation struck a defiant tone in reaction to news of the US proposal.In Kyiv, the widow of a Ukrainian soldier told the BBC: \"This is not a peace plan, it is a plan to continue the war.\"Another person speaking from one of the occupied territories in Ukraine told the BBC: \"I'm trying to keep my sanity here in the conditions of constant propaganda that Ukraine has forgotten us. I hope they will not sign this.\"Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory and its troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line, despite reported heavy losses.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSteve RosenbergRussia editorEPAIt was quite a contrast.On Thursday, a US Pentagon delegation was in Kyiv. They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan to end the war in Ukraine.The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".Which brings us back to the peace plan.On Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.Addressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.President Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.The 28-point proposal, which has been widely leaked and reported on, appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev. He took part in three days of discussions in Miami with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.According to drafts of the peace proposal, Ukraine would cede to Russia parts of the Donbass still under Kyiv's control; the Ukrainian armed forces would be reduced in size and Ukraine would vow not to join Nato.\"The Russian military's effective work should convince Zelensky and his regime that it's better to strike a deal and do it now,\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously told journalists on a Kremlin conference call.A peace proposal does not automatically mean peace. What if there's no agreement?Pro-Kremlin commentators insist that, deal or no deal, Russia will prevail.\"Everyone thought that the idea of a peace deal had sunk in a swamp,\" wrote Russian news outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"But suddenly, a rocket has shot out of this bog with a new, or rather an 'old new' peace plan, with something of the Alaska summit about it. It shot out like a jack in the box.\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.Many. But not everyone.Some elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5. That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.For now, though, Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

    "body": "'A lot of fighting': Fossil fuel row breaks out at UN climate summit30 minutes agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science correspondent, in Belém, BrazilGetty ImagesMembers of the Ipereg Ayu movement, representing the indigenous Munduruku group, demoonstrated outside this year's summitA row over fossil fuels has broken out at the COP30 UN climate talks in Belém, Brazil, as the meeting is meant to be nearing its end.At the heart of the row is a disagreement over how strong a deal should be on working to reduce the world's use of fossil fuels, whose emissions are by far the largest contributor to climate change.The dispute pits groups of countries against each other, but all 194 parties must agree in order to pass a deal at the two-week summit.Representatives and observers from inside a guarded negotiating room say the talks have become very difficult.One negotiator inside the room told the BBC that there \"is a lot of fighting\".Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and some countries including the UK want the summit to commit nations to stronger, faster action to reduce their use of fossil fuels.It would advance a deal made two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, that committed countries to \"transition away from fossil fuels\".A first draft of an agreement in Brazil offered three options including timeframes, but the latest version has no mention of fossil fuels.French Environment Minister Monique Barbut said the deal was being blocked by \"oil-producing countries - Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, but joined by many emerging countries.\" She added: \"As it stands now, we have nothing left.\"The BBC has approached Saudi Arabia for comment.Speaking to journalists outside the negotiating room, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said the UK was determined to keep \"alive\" at the talks a plan to take further action on fossil fuels.\"It's hard, it's sweaty, it's frustrating. There's a big divergence of views,\" he said.Tom Ingham/BBCCountry representatives are inside a negotiating room with journalists and observers waiting for news outside\"We are determined that one way or another, this innovative idea, with the support of more than 80 countries to have a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels, is kept alive at this COP,\" he said.Mr Miliband added: \"I think that in 10-20 years time people will say, \"You were the generation that saw the climate crisis around you. Did you take action? Did you rise to the challenge. It's that sense of what will people think of us in the future that keeps me going.\"Some developing countries have not backed the deal on fossil fuels because they want richer nations to first deliver on promises to give climate finance to help them cope with or adapt to the effects of climate change. \"We need adaptation financing because we are already doing a lot to reduce emissions,\" Aisha Moriana, head of Pakistan's delegation, told BBC News.\"Who will pay the cheque? We are looking forward to receiving that money,\" she said.When asked if Pakistan would support the fossil fuel deal if it received new promises about finance, Ms Moriana replied: \"That is something which cannot happen in a few hours, and it requires a lot of financing.\"In the hallways, groups of campaigners are chanting \"fossil fuels out\" and hanging banners saying \"Stop Amazon oil\" and \"1.5C under threat: time to act\".\"A good outcome could mean giving us a future and a present that it is worth fighting for,\" International Youth Climate Movement campaigner Shurabe Mercado, from Mexico told BBC News. \"Our generation is most at risk and we are most at stake.\"The meeting is a fraught and delicate diplomatic process as countries jostle to protect their national interests, while also attempting to address the issue of climate change.Some observers question the value of the complex, legalistic talks which almost always over-run. But others point to the significant advances in measures to tackle climate change, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, and protection of nature in recent years linked to COP agreements. Other issues discussed at the COP include the gap in climate finance promised by richer nations to developing nations that are most impacted by climate change.The new draft deal called for global efforts to triple financing available to countries by 2030. But it did not say if this should come from richer nations or from other sources, like the private sector.This could anger poorer countries who want stronger support from richer nations and heavily criticised a deal at last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, which they considered paltry.gettyBrazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, wants the summit to commit countries to stronger, faster action to reduce their use of fossil fuelsDeforestation has also been been a fraught issue, which takes place on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon.The new draft deal weakened previous language around tackling deforestation. \"The wildlife and indigenous people who call the forest their home deserve better than this,\"  said Kelly Dent, Director of External Engagement for World Animal Protection.The two-week meeting has been interrupted by two evacuations. Last week a group of protesters broke into the COP venue in Belém carrying signs reading \"Our forests are not for sale\".On Thursday a fire broke out, burning a hole through the sheeting covering the venue and causing 13 smoke inhalation injuries. The summit was evacuated and closed for at least six hours.The summit has been praised for including the largest number yet of delegates from indigenous groups.",

    "body": "15 minutes agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesA customer tries on sneakers at On NYC flagship store in New YorkAthletic shoe company On is facing a lawsuit from customers who claim that its popular sneakers make a \"noisy and embarrassing squeak\".The \"CloudTec\" sneakers typically cost around $200 (£150) and have holes in the sole designed to make users feel like they are \"running on clouds\". Instead, the lawsuit says, they cause issues in daily life - especially for nurses who wear them all day.\"No reasonable consumer would purchase Defendant's shoes - or pay as much for them as they did - knowing each step creates an audible and noticeable squeak,\" the customers allege.The company, which did not immediately respond to a BBC enquiry, has declined to comment on the allegations.The class action lawsuit was filed on October 9 in US District Court in Oregon.The customers say that multiple On sneaker styles are unwearable without \"significant DIY modifications\". They accused the company of \"deceptive marketing\".The plaintiffs, who claim they were unable to return the shoes after complaining about the noise, are seeking refunds and other damages.The Switzerland-based sneaker company could have \"fixed the design, and/or offered to fix the shoes or [given] consumers their money back but did none of those things\", the complaint alleges, citing the Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner models, among others.One customer claimed in the complaint that she was \"no longer able to use her shoes as intended due to the embarrassment and annoyance\".The plaintiffs in their complaint reference social media posts, on TikTok and Reddit, from other frustrated customers who have suggested at-home remedies for the noise - including applying coconut oil to the soles of the shoes.On, which is backed by the tennis player Roger Federer, reported better-than-expected earnings in August. Its quarterly revenue was boosted by direct-to-consumer sales. Earlier this year, the company said sales of its Cloudmonster and Cloudsurfer sneaker models contributed \"significantly\" to its growth.",

    "body": "A conservation group linked to Prince Harry and Chad's government have agreed to sign a new partnership - less than two weeks after the central African country severed ties with the organisation.Chad had terminated its agreement with African Parks on 6 October, accusing it of failing to curb poaching.The two parties released a joint statement on Friday saying they have \"initiated, in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation, a series of discussions relating to the delegated management of protected areas\".African Parks, which counts Prince Harry as a board member and former president, manages around 20 national parks and protected areas across 12 countries.The new agreement will see African Parks once again manage Zakouma National Park and Ennedi Natural and Cultural Reserve in Chad, which it had managed for 15 years.African Parks would continue to finance and co-manage these protected areas, as well as pursuing the implementation of future projects until new agreements are signed.\"This milestone comes at the close of a challenging period that required significant dialogue to reach mutual understanding and commitment on the way forward,\" a statement from the conservation group read.Peter Fearnhead, CEO of African Parks, said the reinstatement \"provides a stable foundation to continue safeguarding some of Chad's most extraordinary natural and cultural landscapes, together with the communities who depend on them\".Chad's government had accused the organisation of failing to curb poaching, an arrogant and disrespectful attitude, and not co-operating fully with authorities.The environment ministry had blamed the resurgence of poaching in its natural parks on a lack of investment by the charity.Founded in 2000, the organisation aims to protect Africa's national parks and advance conservation in the continent and around the world.Earlier this year, the charity admitted that employees in a park it managed in the Republic of Congo had abused members of the local community, but refused to publish an independent report into the abuses.",

Storm Reid, who played Zendaya's on-screen sister, confirmed last year that she is not returning for series three. Actor Angus Cloud, who played drug dealer Fezco, died aged 25 after season two, which ended on a major cliff-hanger involving his character.  Details of the new characters and their plot lines have not yet been announced.Who is joining Euphoria for season three?Getty ImagesL-R: Trisha Paytas, Danielle Deadwyler and Natasha Lyonne are among the actors joining for season threeThe 18 newly announced cast members include Danielle Deadwyler, who has been nominated for several major awards for her performance in films such as Till and The Piano Lesson.Natasha Lyonne, who has starred in Orange is the New Black, American Pie and His Three Daughters will also join for season three.American Hustle and Apocalypse Now star Colleen Camp, Hostel star and creator Eli Roth, and singer and YouTuber Trisha Paytas have also joined the cast.Other actors to join include The Wire's Kwame Patterson, Ozark's Madison Thompson, True Blood's Sam Trammell, The Unit's Rebecca Pidgeon, and NFL star-turned-actor Matthew Willig.Cailyn Rice, of Yellowstone spin-off 1923 and Bella Podaras, known for Ashley Garcia: Genius in Love will also star, alongside Gideon Adlon, who appeared in Netflix's The Society and Jessica Blair Herman of American Crime Story.The new cast is rounded out by Bill Bodner, Jack Topalian, known for General Hospital, Hemky Madera, who has appeared in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Netflix series Kaleidoscope, and Homer Gere, son of actor Richard Gere.Who else will appear in the series?Sharon Stone and Rosalía are among the other cast members who were previously confirmed to be joining the show this year.

Little me would be going crazy right now.\"It showed me I'm on the right track.\"Speaking to DAZN, two-weight undisputed champion Taylor described Tiah-Mai as \"a seasoned pro\" after watching her defeat France's Lydie Bialic in September.\"I can't believe she's just turned 19. This is scary,\" said Taylor at the time.\"I don't think we've seen a talent like this in a long time.\"Being hyped up as \"the future\" by one of her heroes fuelled Tiah-Mai's desire to make Taylor's prediction come true.Tiah-Mai Ayton, from Bristol, has fought two bouts as a professional As a child, the Bristol-born boxer's dad encouraged her and her sister to turn sibling squabbles into training in the ring.While fighting remained a hobby for her sister, it became Tiah-Mai's career.Her potential to turn professional was clear to those who watched her excel as a five-time national champion at youth level.As she racked up titles as a teenager, Team GB had Tiah-Mai on its radar as a future Olympian.\"I knew from a young age that I was going to be a professional boxer,\" she says.\"I didn't think about anything else.\"If I didn't have it, I would be so lost.\"'Better under pressure'Tiah-Mai dreams of following Taylor to the top and hopes doing so sparks the next generation of female fighters.\"I want to inspire them,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"Women's boxing is getting big but it could get better.\"Hopefully by the time I've finished my career, it'll be easier for women to be treated the same as men in the sport.\"Her similiarities with Katie Taylor go beyond having big reputations.They share a promoter after Tiah-Mai signed with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing.While she aims to be part of a main event in future, the teenager's on the undercard before Kieron Conway's title defence against George Liddard on Friday.She says she fights \"better under pressure\" and is eyeing her first knockout despite admitting she knows little about her opponent.\"No-one has ever stopped her,\" says Tiah-Mai.\"I think if I do stop her, it's going to be a big statement from me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "4 hours agoEsme StallardClimate and science reporter, BBC NewsA landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks.More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.But President Trump had called the plan a \"green scam\" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they had voted in favour.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a \"huge win\" for Trump.But reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a \"plea\" for this not to be repeated.In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year.The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised.The motion passed by just a handful of votes. Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was \"unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change\".\"We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,\" he said.The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards. Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : \"We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.\"\"Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,\" he added.The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain.The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers.Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings. Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position. The deal was first agreed in April after ten years of negotiations and was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.The agreement had meant that from 2028 ship owners would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea. Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive.\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment, told the BBC during the last IMO negotiations.This means without intervention the International Maritime Organisation previously estimated that by 2050 emissions could grow by between 10% and 150%.The meeting this week in London between nations had been to make the final approval and finalise the next steps. But since April the US has been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan which they are concerned could raise prices for goods for its consumers.Posting on Truth Social on Thursday night President Trump wrote: \"The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers.\"With talks now delayed the carefully planned timeline to get the regulations in place for 2028 does not appear feasible. \"A delay in action may require changes to the text of agreement that undermine the planned timeline, and could revert years of work to date,\" said Blánaid Sheeran, an observer to the talks and policy officer at environmental NGO Opportunity Green.

    "body": "8 minutes agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent in WarsawOmar Marques/Getty ImagesVolodymyr Zhuravlyov was released after the judge delivered his verdictA Polish judge has refused to extradite a Ukrainian citizen – suspected by Germany of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 – arguing that if Ukraine was responsible for the attack, then it was a \"just\" act.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was brought to Warsaw District Court in handcuffs, was detained in Poland last month on a European arrest warrant.Judge Dariusz Lubowski ordered his release, after a ruling that was met with a ripple of surprise from the crowd in court and a smile from the man in the dock.Mr Zhuravlyov, along with others, is suspected of planting explosives deep beneath the Baltic Sea on the pipelines leading from Russia to Germany.Blame for the blasts, which crippled a long-controversial energy supply line from Russia to Germany, initially focused on Moscow until signs of Ukrainian involvement began to emerge. Officials in Kyiv have repeatedly denied any role.Extradition cases within the EU are usually quick and straightforward, but the Nord Stream case is proving to be very different.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose government is a key ally of war-torn Ukraine, immediately posted on X that the ruling was right. \"Case closed,\" he wrote.Diver held in Poland over Russian pipeline blasts in Baltic SeaUkrainian held in Italy over Nord Stream gas pipelines blast mysteryInside the giant district courthouse in Warsaw, Judge Lubowski announced his decision to the suspect, his family and legal team – and a large cluster of TV cameras.In a long and passionate speech, he said he was considering only the request to send Mr Zhuravlyov to Germany, not the substance of the case itself. But he was clear that the context of the war in Ukraine was critical.The judge described Russia's invasion as \"a bloody and genocidal attack\" and argued, quoting Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas, saying that Ukraine had the legal right to defend itself.\"If Ukraine and its special forces… organised an armed mission to destroy enemy pipelines – which the court does not prejudge – then these actions were not unlawful. \"On the contrary, they were justified, rational and just,\" he told the court.BBC/Sarah RainsfordMr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, said it was important to hear the judge understood UkrainiansHe said the attack had \"deprived the enemy of billions of euros paid by Germany for the gas… and weakened Russia's military potential\".What could be seen as terrorism or sabotage in peace time, the judge said, was different in a time of war.Germany had in fact halted use of the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 had not yet entered service.Poland has always been a vocal critic of that project for making Berlin too dependent on Moscow. The route deprived Poland of transit fees for the gas. Ukraine and the US were also longstanding opponents of the pipelines.Judge Lubowski insisted, though, that his ruling was a legal one, and not emotional or political. He also questioned whether Germany had jurisdiction even to bring its case, as the explosions were in international waters on pipelines with majority Russian state ownership.Announcing that Mr Zhuravlyov would be released from custody, he said the Ukrainian would also get compensation from the Polish state.\"I am happy… it was a really very hard three weeks,\" Mr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, told the BBC in court after the judge's verdict.\"For me, as a Ukrainian, it was very important to hear that he understands us.\"She said the family planned to stay in Poland, where they have lived since February 2022.Earlier, she described her husband's arrest at their home just outside Warsaw and said he denied any involvement in the sabotage.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov is a deep-sea diver, his wife has confirmed, but she called it a hobby and said he had no military role. He has a business in Poland installing air conditioners. Mrs Zhuravlyova could not tell the BBC exactly where her husband was when three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were blown up, because she said no-one had asked her to check.He is not the only suspect on Germany's list: another Ukrainian man was detained in Italy in August when he was on holiday. Serhiy Kuznetsov was also accused of \"unconstitutional sabotage\" and has denied any connection to the blasts. He is currently in a high security prison in northern Italy.A court in Bologna did rule he should be extradited to Berlin but earlier this week that verdict was annulled by the top appeals court in Rome and the case has been returned to Bologna to begin all over again.Asked about the decision, Germany's foreign minister said he respected the ruling and it was not the job of government to interfere with the courts.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporter andDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentShutterstockChina has warned the UK of \"consequences\" amid an escalating row over its delayed application to build a mega-embassy in London.It comes after the government confirmed it had pushed back a decision on the controversial site for a second time, to 10 December. On Friday, Beijing's foreign affairs ministry said the delay went \"entirely against the UK's commitments and previous remarks about improving China-UK relations\".Downing Street said it did not \"recognise any claims of commitments or assurances\". Beijing's application for the embassy was initially rejected by Tower Hamlets Council in 2022 over safety and security concerns.However, it was taken over by the UK government housing department last year, after China resubmitted an application one month after Labour came to power.Asked about the latest delay on Friday, Beijing's ministry of foreign affairs accused the UK of \"constantly complicating and politicizing the matter\".Spokesman Lin Jian said the UK had \"repeatedly put off the approval of the project citing various excuses and linked the project with other issues\".\"That goes entirely against the UK's commitments and previous remarks about improving China-UK relations,\" he added.\"We once again call on the UK to fulfil its obligation and honour its commitments at once, otherwise the consequences arising therefrom shall be borne by the UK side\".Downing Street hit back at Mr Jian's comments, saying: \"We do not recognise any claims of assurances, and I can't explain the statement they've set out.\"The PM's official spokesman added: \"Protecting the UK's national security is our first duty.\"In terms of the planning process, as set out yesterday, this is a decision that is independent of the rest of government.\"He added it would not be \"appropriate for me to comment further\" on a decision being made by the housing department. China bought the site of the proposed new embassy, at Royal Mint Court near the Tower of London, for £255m in 2018. At 20,000 square metres, the proposed complex would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead.The proposed complex would include offices, a large basement area, housing for 200 staff, and a new tunnel to connect the Embassy House to a separate building on the embassy grounds.The pending decision on whether to approve the new embassy has attracted close scrutiny because of concerns about the security implications of the plan, including the location, size and design of the building.There are concerns held by some opponents that the site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into nearby fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.Blanked out plansThe government's first delay was requested by then housing secretary Angela Rayner, after she asked China to explain why some rooms within its planning documents had been blanked out for \"security reasons\".Planning consultants working for the Chinese embassy had replied that China \"does not consider that, as a matter of principle, it is necessary or appropriate to provide full internal layout plans\".Rayner had written back to groups involved in the consultation, including China, the Met police and a local residents' association, to give them more time to respond to the plans and putting the deadline back to 21 October.Steve Reed, who took over the housing role following Rayner's resignation last month, then requested a further delay to 10 December.In the latest correspondence, the housing department said it was unable to set a new deadline for fresh comments until it receives pending responses from the Foreign Office and Home Office.The two departments wrote jointly to Rayner in August to say they were still in discussions with China over consolidating the country's existing diplomatic premises in the capital into the new complex.The departments requested that Rayner should not make a final decision until a \"firm plan is agreed\". Sir Keir Starmer said last year that Chinese President Xi Jinping had raised the embassy issue during their first leaders' phone call in August.Speaking in November, the prime minister told China's leader \"you raised the Chinese embassy building when we spoke on the telephone, and we have since taken action by calling in that application\".\"Now we have to follow the legal process and timeline,\" Sir Keir added.The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have urged the government to throw out China's application.

They held a funeral and were given ashes.But two years later they discovered the ashes were not his - and police later found their son's body, still at the funeral home.On Wednesday, former undertaker Robert Bush appeared at Hull Crown Court after an investigation into human remains found at his premises. He pleaded guilty to 35 counts of fraud by false representation, one of which related to Mrs Beverley. He faces a trial on other charges in October 2026.\"I am trying to forgive him,\" said Mrs Beverley, \"but I am finding it hard, there must be some reason why he did this.\"She described Sunny's original funeral service in June 2022 as \"beautiful\". It was held in an on-site chapel at Legacy's headquarters.Following the ceremony, her family were presented with an urn of ashes. They were informed by police in March 2024 they were the remains of an unidentified stranger.Jasmine and her husband Ben Conlin returned those ashes to police. She said she had polished the urn daily and \"whoever was in there, was loved like they were my own baby.\"Mr Bush also admitted deceiving three other women into thinking ashes he gave them were those of their unborn babies.PA MediaRobert Bush denied 30 counts of preventing lawful and decent burials and one charge of stealing money from charity collection boxesHumberside Police began investigating Legacy Independent Funeral Directors in March 2024 after they received a \"call of concern for the deceased\". They announced at the time 35 bodies and the ashes of at least 163 people were recovered from the firm's headquarters.Sunny was the only stillborn baby found at the premises. Mrs Beverley received the call that Sunny had been found whilst she was pregnant with her fifth child. She said it \"ruined\" the final months of her pregnancy and plunged her into a depression. At times she said she had suicidal thoughts.Mrs Beverley said it had highlighted to her how pregnancy loss was still a taboo subject and reliving Sunny's birth had added \"further distress\".If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the can be found at the BBC's Action Line website.BBC/Joe WeirJasmine and her husband keep Sunny's sleeping bag with other keepsakes in a memory boxThe family held a second funeral before Sunny was buried alongside his great-grandparents, Mrs Beverley said she was \"happy that he is finally home\".Reflecting on Mr Bush's guilty plea in relation to her family, she said she felt \"mixed emotions\" because other families were \"playing a waiting game\" for next year's trial.Mr Bush denied 30 counts of preventing lawful and decent burials and one charge of stealing money from charity collection boxes, during Wednesday's hearing at Hull Crown Court.He was bailed until his next court appearance and will be sentenced after the conclusion of his trial.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorGAVRIIL GRIGOROV/POOL/AFPPutin flew to Alaska in his specially modified Il-96 plane in AugustThe summit has not been set in stone, but if Russia's Vladimir Putin does go to Budapest to meet US President Trump in the next two weeks, he would need to clear a few hurdles first.When Putin travelled to Alaska for his Anchorage summit in August, the US granted special permission for the presidential plane - a modified Ilyushin Il-96 airliner dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\" that has four engines and is bristling with defence systems.Russian planes are banned from US air space, and from EU air space too. So if Putin does fly to Budapest he would need special dispensation if he decided to fly over an EU member state.It is perfectly possible, but landlocked Hungary is not the easiest destination to get to for a Russian president who rarely sets foot abroad and has not travelled to the EU for years.\"For now, of course, it's not clear,\" says Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"What we do have is the willingness of the presidents to hold such a meeting.\"Days after Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU froze the assets of both its leader and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.A blanket ban was also imposed on all Russian aircraft flying through the airspace of all 27 EU countries. Hungary and many of its neighbours are Nato member states too.Putin has also been accused by the International Criminal Court of war crimes of unlawfully deporting and transferring of Ukrainian children to Russia.So there are complications, although Hungary believes they can all be sorted out. Hungary is in the process of pulling out of the ICC anyway.Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orban, probably his closest ally in the EU, have already discussed the planned summit over the phone, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has told reporters \"we will of course ensure that he can enter Hungary, hold successful talks here, and then return home\".Getty ImagesHungary's Viktor Orban is one of Putin's closest allies in the EUThe EU is unlikely to create obstacles either.Its executive commission has said any meeting that moves forward \"a just and lasting peace for Ukraine\" is welcome and it supports President Trump's efforts towards that.One of the main drivers for its latest proposed sanctions on Russia - the 19th package so far - is to bring the Russians to the negotiating table, it says. And it points out there's no travel ban on Putin, only an asset freeze.The biggest sticking point is how Russia's leader will fly from Moscow to Budapest. Clearly he will not be buying an Air Serbia ticket to Belgrade and catching the train to Hungary, which may be the most direct route to take.He will want his Il-96 plane to guarantee his safety, but that will probably mean using the air space of an EU and Nato member state and obtaining permission to break the EU's ban on Russian planes.European Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said on Friday that \"in terms of the direction of travel, member states can give derogations but it must be given by member states individually\".Nato has also referred the issue to respective national authorities, and as Trump is involved they may acquiesce.Even with dispensation, a look at the map shows Putin may have to take a circuitous route. Ukraine is out of the question, and probably Poland too because of Warsaw's icy relations with Moscow.Perhaps the most direct route goes via the eastern coast of the Black Sea and Turkey, through Bulgaria and either Serbia or Romania into Hungary.Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, knows Putin well and Air Serbia has direct flights to Moscow over EU airspace. Serbia is a candidate to join the EU but is not a member.It is the EU countries, Bulgaria or perhaps Romania, that would need to give consent, and they would have to escort Putin's plane through their airspace.Romania has what is set to become the biggest Nato base in Europe, and Bulgaria is also building a Nato base as part of efforts to shore up the defensive alliance's eastern flank.The BBC has approached the foreign ministries of both countries for comment.If Putin wants to play it even more safely, he could fly via Turkey, around the south coast of Greece and then up through Montenegrin airspace before going over Serbia. But it is a far longer route.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPutin's Ilyushin plane has been dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\"Budapest is not then the easiest of venues, even if it works very well for Viktor Orban, who has long had good relations with both Putin and Donald Trump.\"It's a leader that we like,\" said Trump on Friday, \"he likes him, I like him.\"A high-profile international summit will do Orban no harm at all, as he is trailing in the polls before elections next spring.Within hours of Budapest being named as a venue, Orban was on the phone to Putin and declared on his Facebook page: \"Preparations are in full swing!\"Orban has little time for the EU's backing of Ukraine and he was quick to make clear Brussels would have nothing to do with the talks.\"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he told Hungarian radio on Friday.European leaders will have other ideas when they see him at next week's summit in Brussels next week.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterGetty ImagesEuropean stock markets recovered some ground after a warning of fraud from two US banks triggered a sell-off in banking shares around the world.Two US regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, said on Thursday that they had been hit by either bad or fraudulent loans, sparking fears of problems in the wider sector.Some of the UK's biggest banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, saw their share prices fall more than 5% on Friday morning, before recovering slightly before the end of the day's trading. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares had dropped about 1.5% at one point before coming back slightly to close 0.9% lower.The US S&P 500 benchmark was marginally up after Donald Trump appeared to indicate that high tariffs on China may not be \"sustainable\". On Thursday, Zions Bank said it would write off a $50m loss on two loans, while Western Alliance disclosed it had started a lawsuit alleging fraud.\"Pockets of the US banking sector including regional banks have given the market cause for concern,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\"Investors have started to question why there have been a plethora of issues in a short space of time and whether this points to poor risk management and loose lending standards.\"\"Investors have been spooked,\" he added, saying that while there was no evidence of any issues with UK-listed banks, \"investors often have a knee-jerk reaction when problems appear anywhere in the sector\".Bank shares in Europe were also hit, with Germany's Deutsche Bank ending the day 6% lower, and France's Societe Generale closing down 5%.The main stock market in Germany closed down 1.8%, while the Cac 40 in Paris finished the day down just 0.2%.Asian markets fell earlier on Friday. Japan's Nikkei index closed down 1.4% and in Hong Kong the Hang Seng Index was 2.5% lower.But shares of some of the US banks hit hardest on Thursday clawed back some ground.In early afternoon trade on Friday, shares in Zions Bank were up about 4%, following its 13% fall on Thursday. Shares in Western Alliance Bancorp, which had dropped almost 11%, were also up nearly 2%.In an interview on the Fox Business Network, the director of the White House National Economic Council described the issues as \"messes\" left by the Biden administration, while maintaining that US banks were well positioned to handle the stress.\"Right now, the banking sector has ample reserves,\" Kevin Hassett said. \"We're very optimistic that we can stay way, way, way ahead of the curve on this.\"Investors have been nervous following the failure of two high-profile US firms, car loan company Tricolor and car parts maker First Brands. These failures have raised questions about the quality of deals in what is known as the private credit market - where companies arrange loans from non-bank lenders.This week Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US's largest bank JPMorgan Chase, warned that these two failures could be a sign of more to come. \"My antenna goes up when things like that happen,\" he told analysts. \"I probably shouldn't say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\" There have also been warnings that the surge in artificial intelligence investment has produced a bubble in the US stock market - including from Mr Dimon - leading to fears that shares are overvalued.The market turbulence on Friday saw the price of gold reach a fresh record high of $4,380 per ounce, as investors looked for safe havens for their money. Another closely watched measure of market nerves, the VIX volatility index sometimes called the \"Fear Index\", hit its highest level since April. ",

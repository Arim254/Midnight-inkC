    "body": "Manchester City prevailed in a nine-goal feast at Fulham thanks to the sort of attacking display that would normally have title rivals quaking in their boots.Unfortunately for Pep Guardiola's side, City's defensive display will have had those same rivals sighing with relief.City led 5-1 early in the second half after a 100th Premier League goal for Erling Haaland, a Phil Foden double, one from Tijjani Reijnders, and Sander Berge's own goal. They were seemingly cruising towards victory by a handsome margin.But Fulham, led by substitute Samuel Chukwueze, hit back with three unanswered goals and even had one effort cleared off the line in stoppage time as they came close to completing one of the great comebacks.City were on the ropes and just about absorbing shots as they clung on for the 5-4 win and all three points.\"I was close to scoring and then they went and made it 5-3, so that's football, that's the beauty of football,\" said Haaland.\"That's why we love the game.\"The powerful Norwegian's feat of reaching 100 goals in 111 Premier League games is the fastest the century has been achieved in the competition, and he weighed in with two assists too.But City went from being a side who looked as though they could keep scoring, to being a group almost begging the final whistle to come.Guardiola joked afterwards: \"I'm so old, and the players don't respect me! They don't have to treat their manager in that way.\"It only happens in this league.\"By holding on, the win put City two points behind leaders Arsenal, although that gap will increase to five again if Mikel Arteta's side beat Brentford on Wednesday.Manchester City's win at Fulham will have been a great watch for the neutral, with the statistics highlighting just what a thriller - and unusual result - it was:It was Fulham's first top-flight game featuring nine or more goals since a 7-2 loss at West Ham in February 1968, and their first at home since a 6-3 loss to Aston Villa in September 1965.This was the 41st time from 356 Premier League games under Pep Guardiola that Manchester City had scored at least five goals.It is the first time City have won a league match in which they conceded as many as four goals since December 1957 - a 5-4 victory against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.This was the sixth Premier League game involving Manchester City to see at least nine goals scored, with only Manchester United (seven) being involved in more.While it was a game that certainly delivered in the entertainment stakes, Manchester City's followers will have seen there need to be improvements at the back if Guardiola's side are to truly challenge leaders Arsenal.City's attacking strength is not in question - their first four shots on target resulted in goals in this game, while both Haaland and Foden are in the sort of form this season that will make almost any team in the Premier League struggle to stop them.But while their play going forward has certainly been worthy of title winners, their defence is lagging way behind.Arsenal have conceded just seven goals in 13 games in the Premier League, but City have let in more than double that with 16 in just 14 games.It is rare for City in a title-winning campaign to have conceded as many as that at this stage of the season, happening once - in 2023-24 - in Guardiola's six Premier League title-winning seasons.\"You can't expect to win the Premier League when you defend like that,\" former Premier League striker Clinton Morrison said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\"There's a problem with Manchester City defensively. I've said it all season that we know they can score goals, no bother with them the way they're going forward, but defensively they have to be better.\"They need to be better defensively because you'd never see Arsenal be 5-1 up and end like that, so they have to sort that out.\"Manchester City have conceded 10 goals in their latest four games in all competitions, but in the four games prior to that they conceded just three.That will give Guardiola hope that the recent defensive frailties can be rectified, and the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich head coach even thinks the recent problem at the back could help his side by focusing minds.\"Of course I was concerned [Fulham could come back], but this will help us in future games,\" Guardiola said.\"Every game is a new team for some players. You have to make a process to start to correct.\"There were some really positive things in what we have done - to come here, to score five goals, and the way we played in that first half.\"In the end, it was a question of character, resilience and defence. They did what they had to do.\"",

    "body": "Racism, rape and death threats: One weekend of abuse in footballImage source, BBC SportImage caption, Managers are being targeted by abuse more often than players in the Premier League and Women's Super LeagueByNatalie Pirks, Mel Sharman, Sarah Dawkins and Daniel AustinBBC Sport Warning: This article contains screenshots of and references to offensive language.More than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend, a BBC investigation has found.The analysis - conducted with data science company Signify - focused on posts made during 10 Premier League and six WSL matches on the weekend of 8 and 9 November, and also found messages including racist slurs, homophobia and threats of violence.Managers were targeted more than players, with 82% of abusive posts made on X, formerly known as Twitter.Premier League bosses Ruben Amorim, Arne Slot and Eddie Howe were the most common targets of abuse in the men's top flight, while Chelsea and their manager Sonia Bompastor faced 50% of all abuse in the WSL.A total of 61% of all abusive messages were sent from accounts in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and the data suggests the overall number is on the rise.Media caption, 'It's not acceptable' - Bompastor on online abuse'People have sense of impunity online'\"Abuse is never a good thing, whether it's about me or other managers,\" Liverpool head coach Slot said.\"We expect to be criticised. That is completely normal. I do not have social media so I don't see it, but I'm not stupid, I know it's there.\"Signify operates an artificial intelligence system called Threat Matrix, which scans posts made on social media for abuse. During the weekend of matches selected for the study, it analysed more than 500,000 posts on X, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, and identified 22,389 potentially abusive messages.But those flags can sometimes include examples which aren't abusive. For example, references to Newcastle defender Dan Burn can be flagged as a threat because of his surname.Therefore, a two-stage analysis by humans is conducted, which found that 2,015 of the posts met the threshold for verified extreme abuse - such as threats to life or hate speech - and broke the rules of the platforms they were posted on.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, BBC SportSlide 1 of 7, A screenshot of a death threat sent to Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim, Thirty-nine posts - including monkey emojis on black players' accounts and rape threats - were deemed serious enough to warrant further investigation, which in some cases involves reporting to football clubs for potential identification of fans, and possible referral to law enforcement.One post was reported to police, who decided it did not meet their threshold for further action.Only one of the posts flagged to Meta, which owns and operates Facebook and Instagram, was removed. The others remain under investigation.Some of the 37 posts that were flagged to X were removed, while the others had their reach suppressed but were left online.\"If this happened on the street, this would have criminal consequences, potential financially damaging consequences,\" said Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango.\"So why is it that online people have got this sense of impunity? We need to put an end to this.\"Some in the game are resigned to the inevitability of abuse.\"It comes with the territory now,\" Newcastle manager Howe said.\"My advice is always to try and shelter yourself from it and become psychologically strong enough to not need to read it. But, invariably, people will show it to you even if you don't want to see it.\"Meta has implemented systems for helping block and filter abuse, while X has introduced a tool which displays the country or continent in which an account is based.The BBC contacted both X and Meta with questions about abuse on their platforms. Neither provided a comment.'Really horrible, violent content'In an office in central London, Signify's small team quietly sifts through thousands of posts.With every contentious moment during a game, the number of abusive messages rises.Up pop posts containing monkey emoijs and racist slurs, threats of rape to the family members of managers, and even death threats, sparked purely by actions on a football pitch.Every message the AI system deems abusive is checked twice by humans, who only count the messages which break social media platforms' own guidelines as verified abuse.The most significant surge in abusive posts occurred during Tottenham's dramatic 2-2 draw with Manchester United on 8 November, a match that featured two stoppage-time goals, after which both clubs' managers and several players faced concentrated abuse.In messages seen by the BBC, death threats were sent about Amorim, including one saying 'Kill Amorim - someone get that dirty Portuguese'.The Online Safety Act, which came into force in October 2023, puts a statutory duty of care on social media platforms.That means they are legally obliged to proactively identify and remove illegal content such as threats, harassment or hate speech. Ofcom is now the independent regulator responsible for making sure platforms comply.But the social platforms argue that the right to free speech makes them reluctant to censor or remove content. Signify insists that the problem of serious abuse and threats sent online is worsening.\"We've seen around a 25% year-on-year increase in the levels of abuse we're detecting,\" said its chief executive Jonathan Hirshler.\"We understand the platforms' position on free speech but some of the stuff we're talking about is so egregious.\"Really nasty death threats and really horrible, violent content. If the people who are the free speech absolutists out there read some of those messages, they wouldn't question why some of these are being reported and why action needs to be taken.\"Media caption, '25% year-on-year increase' - Can football clubs stop online abuse?Threats and homophobia in WSLControversy during Chelsea's 1-1 draw at Arsenal on 8 November sparked the vast majority of the 97 verified abusive messages posted about WSL matches.More than half targeted Chelsea boss Bompastor, including a threat of violence and a homophobic slur.\"People think they can say anything they want from behind a screen,\" Bompastor said. \"It's scary - I want to raise my voice against that.\"I have a family, including kids. They don't want to see those comments online. They are so young, and people need to realise the effect it can have on them too.\"Threats are a big problem, because the security in the women's game isn't the same as the men's game.\"Abuse can cause real mental problems for players. It can go really far.\"Ex-Chelsea and current England defender Jess Carter was the subject of prominent racist abuse online during Euro 2025, and Bompastor believes the platforms themselves bear plenty of blame.\"The social media companies are not doing their job, not taking the responsibility or accountability,\" Bompastor said.\"If we have to wait for them to act, I think we will be in this situation for too long.\"I'm hoping now that all clubs in the women's and men's games are proactive and protect people as much as possible.\"How are clubs combatting abuse?As frustration with social media companies grows, more clubs are taking matters into their own hands. Arsenal have worked with Signify for the past three years and have seen a 90% drop in the number of affiliated fans sending abuse to their own players, coach and owners. Signify attributes this to the fact that Arsenal have been actively taking action, including implementing education programmes and banning fans from the Emirates who have been identified as senders of abuse.Chelsea women are now also working with the same company.Tottenham, meanwhile, are conducting investigations into season-ticket holders alleged to have posted abusive content.Premier League director of content protection Tim Cooper said: \"We're constantly monitoring around matches where the abuse can happen and looking for trigger instances such as a goal being scored, missed penalties, or even things like yellow and red cards.\"The platforms can do more by changing their algorithms. That would be a step in the right direction.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "Where F1 title may be won and lost in three-way fightImage source, ReutersImage caption, Lando Norris (centre) leads the drivers' championship by 12 points from Red Bull's Max Verstappen (right) and 16 from McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri ByF1 CorrespondentThe Formula 1 drivers' championship will be decided in a three-way showdown that takes place this weekend on Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina circuit.Lando Norris leads Red Bull's Max Verstappen by 12 points and McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri by 16 as they head to a track that has hosted a number of dramatic climaxes in the past.This weekend has all the ingredients to be another.Norris, with his significant points advantage, goes into the weekend as an on-paper favourite.But Verstappen has won five of the eight races before Abu Dhabi and is in a far simpler position than two drivers operating out of the same McLaren garage.Who has the best car?Image source, EPAImage caption, McLaren's drivers have combined for a total score of 800 points in the constructors' championship, allowing them to seal that title with six races of the season to spareThe McLaren has been the fastest car on average over the season. It has a significant advantage on average qualifying pace - 0.274 seconds over the season, and 0.203secs over the past eight races.But wins are split evenly between all three drivers this year - Norris, Verstappen and Piastri all have seven each. The other two grand prix victories have been taken by Mercedes' George Russell.McLaren have dominated the constructors' championship, which they clinched at the Singapore Grand Prix on the first weekend in October, with six races remaining.But that is reflection of having two competitive drivers in a consistently race-winning car. No other team has had the luxury of those two factors together.Verstappen, by contrast, has scored more than 92% of all his team's points this year - team-mate Yuki Tsunoda has been nowhere near him and of no help whatsoever in the Dutchman's title campaign, and has been dropped by Red Bull for next season as a result.Competitiveness has ebbed and flowed through the season, and each car has specific strengths.Verstappen won the Qatar Grand Prix last weekend only because of McLaren's strategy error. Otherwise, that track's long-duration medium- and high-speed corners were perfect McLaren territory.Abu Dhabi also has some long corners - especially the hairpin on to the first long straight and the long Turn Nine at the end of the second main straight.But the McLaren is not at its best in the sort of short-duration, 90-degree corners that comprise the final sector around the marina and hotel, or when braking into chicanes.And the Red Bull has the best straight-line speed.So, in terms of track characteristics, the fight looks finely balanced.McLaren have taken pole position at the past four races. Over the season, Norris and Verstappen are tied on seven poles each, with Piastri scoring six.Who has the best history on this track?Verstappen has won four times in Abu Dhabi, taking every race victory from 2020-23.But his win in 2021 was extremely controversial - that was the title showdown with Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes, where Verstappen won only after the then-race director made up the rules during a late safety-car period.It's also not a fair comparison between the three drivers.For a start, this is only Piastri's third season in F1. Norris has been in F1 since 2019 and Verstappen since 2015.But Norris did not have an even vaguely competitive car until 2023, whereas Verstappen has been winning races on and off since 2016.And Norris was dominant on his way to victory in Abu Dhabi last year.FormCompetitiveness has fluctuated through the season, between both drivers and teams.In the first half of the season, the Red Bull was competitive with the McLaren only on circuits with a predominance of high-speed corners, such as Japan, Saudi Arabia and Imola.Piastri was the stronger McLaren driver on balance over the first 14 races of the season, while Norris struggled with certain elements of the car's behaviour.But Norris has come on strong since the summer break, overhauling what had been a 34-point lead for Piastri at the end of August.Red Bull had a slump in form through the summer, by the end of which Verstappen was 104 points off the championship lead.But tweaks to their car for the Italian Grand Prix at the beginning of September transformed their season, and Verstappen went on a run of three wins and a second place in four races through September and October.In the past two races, Verstappen was the stronger in Las Vegas and McLaren in Qatar. But Abu Dhabi is a very different track from both of those.Abu Dhabi Grand Prix5-7 DecemberLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sports Extra 2; live text updates on BBC Sport website and appTeam dynamicMcLaren's task is the more complicated. They have two drivers in contention and have pledged to allow them both to compete fairly until one is no longer in contention for the championship.But the team's clear stated goal is for one of their drivers to win the title - and they don't mind which. So don't rule out team tactics of one kind or another at McLaren.For example, if Verstappen is winning and Piastri in the top three with Norris fourth, that would make the Dutchman champion. But if Piastri dropped back to let Norris into the top three, Norris would win the title.In those circumstances, it would be expected for McLaren to ask Piastri to aid Norris - but only at such a point when it's clear the Australian's hopes were over.At Red Bull, Verstappen is on his own. Except, that is, if a McLaren finds itself somehow behind one of the other three Red Bull-owned cars - Tsunoda and the two Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson.If that's the case, expect them to make themselves as hard as possible to pass - as Sergio Perez did to Hamilton in 2021, ultimately playing a decisive role in how the race played out.MentalityImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Can he make it five titles? If he does, Max Verstappen will equal Michael Schumacher's record for consecutive drivers' championships, set between 2000-04The pressure is certainly greater on Norris than anyone else.All year, McLaren have looked like the team who will deliver the drivers' title, and he is the man leading the championship.At the same time, this is his first chance to win the title, and McLaren's first drivers' title chance since Hamilton won in 2008.Yes, Hamilton was in mathematical contention in 2010, but 24 points behind with only 25 available, so not really in the picture.In addition, McLaren have been fundamentally restructured since then, and while team principal Andrea Stella has been involved in title fights previously - working with Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso - most of the team have not.Their relative rawness has shown at times this year, especially in Qatar, when they were the only team not to take the opportunity to pit under a safety car, and lost the win as a result.There will likely have been some soul-searching and in-depth analysis in the past days as a consequence. Some anxiety and nervousness would be understandable.Red Bull and Verstappen, meanwhile, are fully versed in this situation. They have won the past four drivers' titles and are a ruthless, finely honed winning machine.And as a team and driver who have done it before, and in addition did not expect to be in this situation, the pressure is off.Verstappen has repeatedly said \"it won't change my life\" whether he wins or not.After Qatar, he said: \"It shows everything is possible. We have nothing to lose so I just go there and try to maximise the car and hope we can be a little bit more competitive than here but we'll see.\"",

    "body": "29 minutes agoSimon Jack,Business editorandEmer Moreau,Business reporter Getty ImagesThe government has lined up administrators in case Thames Water collapses.Thames Water is running out of time to secure a rescue deal as its debt swelled to nearly £20bn.The UK's largest water and waste company posted a rise in profit after increasing customer bills, and said talks with the government and regulators are ongoing. The company has sufficient cash to last until early next year.If a plan is not agreed by then, Thames Water is likely to collapse into government-supervised administration.Administrators have already been selected to step in if required. A consortium of its main creditors, named London & Valley Water, has submitted plans to pump investment into the utility and write off debts in return for more lenient performance targets.The proposed plan would see the lenders write off a quarter of the money they are owed, with a smaller group of junior lenders loans written off completely. The BBC understands the lender group is hopeful their plan will get agreement in principle before the end of the year but has many critics over the proposed leniency on fines for pollution and spillage.The lender group insists that allowing Thames to fall into administration will leave it in limbo, where its many problems will deteriorate.Regardless of what happens to Thames or who owns the company, its water services will continue as normal.Customer complaints have nearly doubled since last year, the majority of which concern bill hikes.Chris Weston, Thames Water's chief executive, said in the company's half-year results that \"bill increases have been significant this year, and I recognise the difficulties this creates for many\".\"A market-led solution clearly remains the best option for our customers, the environment, taxpayers and the economy,\" he said.

    "body": "1 hour agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPrada announced on Tuesday that it has acquired Versace, bringing two major Italian luxury fashion houses under one roof.The $1.38bn (£1.04bn) deal is well below the roughly $2bn that Versace's former parent company, Capri Holdings, paid for the brand in 2018.The acquisition expands Prada's portfolio of designer brands - including Miu Miu - as it seeks to compete with rivals including French conglomerate LVMH, which owns Dior and Fendi in addition to Louis Vuitton.Storied designer Donatella Versace stepped down as the brand's creative chief in March after 27 years at the fashion company, known for its glamorous styles and the iconic Medusa head logo. She took over the company in 1997, after the murder of her brother Gianni. She was replaced by Dario Vitale, formerly a design director of Miu Miu, Prada's youth-focused luxury brand.The company is being sold at a roughly $700m loss after Versace's sales slowed, along with the sale of Capri Holdings' other brands, which include Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.During Capri Holdings' ownership, Versace shifted from its recognisable ornate designs to embrace a more minimalist trend – while hiking prices.Prada said in a one-line statement on Tuesday that it has successfully completed the acquisition of Versace, having received all required regulatory clearances.Proceeds from the sale will help cut debt for Capri Holdings, Versace's former parent company, the firm said. Capri chief executive John D Idol said: \"We plan to use the proceeds to repay the majority of our debt, which will substantially strengthen our balance sheet.\"Andrea Guerra, the chief executive of Prada, said earlier this year that Versace has \"huge potential\".\"The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience,\" he said.

The ingested loot - a Fabergé egg locket valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600) - has not yet been recovered, police told local media outlets.Police were called to Partridge Jewellers in central Auckland last Friday afternoon and the 32-year-old man was arrested in store minutes later.  He has undergone a medical assessment and remains in custody, police say. The allegedly stolen Fabergé egg is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18K gold miniature octopus.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to reports, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "The search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will resume on 30 December, over a decade after the aircraft with 239 people on board vanished, Malaysian authorities have said.This fresh search, which will run for 55 days, had begun in March but was suspended shortly after because of poor weather conditions.\"The latest development underscores the [Malaysia's] commitment to providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,\" the transport ministry said Wednesday, according to local media.Flight MH370, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and sparked the largest search in aviation history.Exploration firm Ocean Infinity is leading the current search under a \"no find, no fee\" arrangement. It will receive $70m (£56m) if the wreckage is found, Transport Minister Loke Siew Fook earlier said.Previous attempts include a multinational search involving 60 ships and 50 aircraft from 26 countries, which ended in 2017, and a 2018 effort by Ocean Infinity ended after three months.Flight MH370 lost contact with air traffic control less than an hour after take-off on 8 March 2014, and radar showed it had deviated from its original flight path.It remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries, which continues to haunt the families of those on board. Over the years, many had called for a new search, noting their struggle to find closure.The incident has also given rise to a host of conspiracy theories, including speculation that the pilot had deliberately brought the plane down or that it had been hijacked.An investigation in 2018 found that the plane's controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course, but drew no conclusions behind it.Investigators said at the time that \"the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoJosh MartinandOsmond ChiaAirbus has confirmed an unspecified number of its aircraft will undergo inspections after a \"supplier quality issue\" with metal panels used on some A320 planes was identified.The problem, which the firm said impacts a \"limited number\" of planes, comes days after thousands of the same model were grounded for an urgent software update.On Tuesday, the European manufacturer said it was taking a \"conservative approach\" by checking all planes that could be affected, even though not all are expected to need repairs.Reuters and AFP news agencies reported that around 600 A320s, a model widely used by major airlines, could be impacted. Airbus did not confirm the number in its response to the BBC.\"The source of the issue has been identified, contained and all newly produced panels conform to all requirements,\" Airbus's spokesperson told the BBC.A statement continued: \"Only inspections will determine where an aircraft may have panels with quality issues and the appropriate action to be taken.\"The number of jets that needed inspections for quality problem include 168 planes that are already in service, Reuters reported on Wednesday.The panel issue is not being treated as an immediate safety matter, unlike the emergency recall of thousands of A320s over a software problem during the weekend, according to Reuters' sources.It is not known how long repairs could take.The BBC has contacted major airlines that use the A320, including British Airways, American Airlines and Lufthansa Airlines for comment.Korean Air told BBC in a statement that it is awaiting more information from Airbus to determine if any of its aircraft are affected.Delta said that its teams have completed the required work and that there has been no effect on operations.\"This applies to a small portion of our Airbus A320 family fleet. Specifically, less than 50 A321neo aircraft,\" the airline said in a statement. Earlier this week, thousands of Airbus planes were grounded for a software update after it was discovered that intense solar radiation could interfere with onboard flight control computers.That issue was discovered after a plane travelling between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude as a result of the vulnerability, injuring 15.More than 6,000 Airbus aircraft needed emergency computer updates in one of the largest ever aviation industry recalls.It resulted in global disruption and flight cancellations over the final weekend of November, a busy time of the year for travel - particularly in the US, where it coincided with Thanksgiving. Airbus shares have fallen by more than 6.5% in the past five days.",

    "body": "The mother of Sarah Everard says she is still tormented by the horror of her daughter's final moments before she was killed.The 33-year-old was abducted, raped and murdered by serving Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens in March 2021.Her mother, Susan Everard, spoke of her \"sadness, rage, panic, guilt and numbness\" in a foreword to an inquiry which has issued a raft of recommendations to protect women from violent attacks.She said: \"I am not yet at the point where happy memories of Sarah come to the fore. When I think of her. I can't get past the horror of her last hours\".The Angiolini Inquiry was launched after Ms Everard's death to investigate how Couzens was able to carry out his crimes, and look at wider issues within policing and women's safety.Sarah's mother spoke powerfully of her grief in a statement to the latest stage of the inquiry: \"All the happy, ordinary things of life have been stolen from Sarah and from us – there will be no wedding, no grandchildren, no family celebrations with everyone there.\"Sarah will always be missing, and I will always long for her\".Couzens tricked Ms Everard into thinking he could arrest her for breaking lockdown rules, as she walked home from a friend's house in south London.Couzens, who is now serving a whole life term in jail, had been a police officer for almost 20 years and had indecently exposed himself on two occasions in the months leading up to the attack.A second report from part two of the inquiry  will be published next year, looking at whether there is a risk of issues from the first phase happening again, such as failures in police vetting, police culture and poor police investigation into reports of sexual offences.A third phase of the inquiry will consider the crimes of David Carrick - who also served in the Met's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command and was handed 36 life sentences in 2023 after being unmasked as a serial rapist.\"I read that you shouldn't let a tragedy define you, but I feel that Sarah's death is such a big part of me that I'm surprised there is no outer sign of it, no obvious mark of grief.I have been changed by it, but there is nothing to see. Outwardly we live our normal lives, but there is an inner sadness. People who do know are unfailingly kind and have helped more than they will ever know.We are not the only ones to lose a child, of course, and we form a sad bond with other bereaved parents. After four years, the shock of Sarah's death has diminished but we are left with an overwhelming sense of loss and of what might have been.All the happy, ordinary things of life have been stolen from Sarah and from us – there will be no wedding, no grandchildren, no family celebrations with everyone there. Sarah will always be missing and I will always long for her. I go through a turmoil of emotions – sadness, rage, panic, guilt and numbness.They used to come all in one day but as time goes by they are more widely spaced and, to some extent, time blunts the edges. I am not yet at the point where happy memories of Sarah come to the fore.When I think of her, I can't get past the horror of her last hours. I am still tormented by the thought of what she endured. We find we still appreciate the lovely things of life, but, without Sarah, there is no unbridled joy.And grief is unpredictable – it sits there quietly only to rear up suddenly and pierce our hearts.They say that the last stage of grief is acceptance. I am not sure what that means. I am accustomed to Sarah no longer being with us, but I rage against it.\"",

    "body": "Cyclone catastrophe in Sri Lanka awakens volunteer spirit8 hours agoIshara Danasekara,News Editor, BBC News SinhalaandKoh EweWatch: Sri Lankan communities under water after catastrophic floodingSri Lankan actor and musician GK Reginold rides a motorised fishing boat through Colombo's suburbs, hoping to bring food and water to those in desperate need.Some of the families, Mr Reginold says, have not received aid for days, isolated by the South Asian island nation's worst weather disaster in recent years.Cyclone Ditwah lashed the country last week, bringing catastrophic floods and landslides that killed more than 460 people, left hundreds missing and damaged some 30,000 homes.But the deluge has also inspired volunteerism among its people, as they face what their president has described as the \"most challenging natural disaster\" in its history.\"The main reason why I wanted to do this, is to at least help them to have one meal,\" Mr Reginold tells the BBC. \"And I was so happy that I was able to do that.\"BBC SinhalaVolunteers have been taking fishing boats out to rescue flood victims and deliver aidMore than one million people have been affected by the disaster and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency.Sri Lanka's military has deployed helicopters for rescue operations, while humanitarian aid is flowing in from foreign governments and non-governmental organisations.But it will be a long journey to recovery for Sri Lanka, which has seen its fair share of turmoil in recent years.Activists volunteer in community kitchenIn Colombo's Wijerama neighbourhood, activists who protested against former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 are now helping run a community kitchen that churns out food aid.The protests from three years ago were fuelled by a spiralling economic crisis that caused shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentThe Princess of Wales has sent a Christmas message about the importance of acts of kindness in times that can seem \"fragmented or uncertain\", in a letter to guests attending her carol concert in Westminster Abbey on Friday.\"The time, care and compassion you give, often quietly and unspoken, and without any expectation or recognition, make an extraordinary difference to the lives of others,\" writes Catherine.Alongside members of the Royal Family, the 1,600 guests will include volunteers and people who have helped local communities.Traditional Christmas carols will be sung in the specially decorated Abbey, with readings and music from performers including Hannah Waddingham and Kate Winslet.\"At its heart, Christmas speaks of love taking form in the simplest, most human ways,\" write Catherine in her letter to guests.\"Not in sentimental or grand gestures, but gentle ones. A moment of listening, a word of comfort, a friendly conversation, a helping hand, presence.\"Last month she gave her first public speech in two years, as she gradually recovers after her cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.While guests are waiting to get inside Westminster Abbey, they will hear music from young people supported by the the Future Talent charity, co-founded by the late Duchess of Kent, who died this autumn.The duchess, who taught music in a state primary school, wanted to provide wider access to music lessons to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.Among the guests will be Anna and Jonathan Cordiner, whose daughter died of a brain tumour, and who set up a charity, Kayleigh's Wee Stars, to support families where a child has a terminal illness.Also attending will be Saphia Turner, aged nine, the winner of the BBC's Make a Difference Young Hero Award, who sells artwork and carries out sponsored challenges to raise money for food banks.\"As the year draws to a close, I hope this season brings you moments of peace and clarity, and that you too, feel surrounded by the same love and care that you offer so freely,\" writes Catherine.Earlier on Tuesday, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee published information about royal leases, including Prince William and Catherine's new home, Forest Lodge in Windsor.It showed they had a 20-year lease with the Crown Estate, with the couple paying a market rent, determined by independent valuers.The public spending watchdog is to hold an inquiry into the Crown Estate and royal property next year, in the wake of questions over Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrangements in Royal Lodge.",

    "body": "2 hours ago\"No justice\" exclaims the Daily Mirror after a report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster was published, which it says leaves \"police shame\". Not one officer of 12 that could have faced gross misconduct charges over the stadium crush that killed 97 will do so as they have all retired, it writes. The Mirror is also among several papers to feature a photo of television presenter Holly Willoughby on its front page after she pleaded guilty to \"driving without care\" and was fined £1,653.The i Paper echoes the Mirror with a headline reading \"Still no justice\", after 36 years of investigations. It features photographs of all 97 victims of the disaster in a grid,  saying lives were lost after \"failures\" on the day - citing the latest inquiry's findings.The Guardian quotes families of those that died in the Hillsborourgh disaster as saying that it is \"a bitter injustice\" that no officers will face proceedings. Also on the front page, the Guardian reports Vladimir Putin made \"hard-edged remarks\" before meeting US officials for talks over the Ukraine war by saying that \"Russia does not intend to fight Europe, but if Europe starts, we are ready right now\". The paper also highlights criticism from MPs that the handling of the China spy case was \"shambolic\".A photo of Sarah Everard, who was abducted, raped and murdered by police officer Wayne Couzens in 2021, is splashed across the front page of the Daily Express. Her mother has spoken at an inquiry into her death as a new report warns \"more lives are at risk\" from violent sexual attacks on women and girls. There is \"no better time to act\", the Express adds, quoting the report.A warning from economists of \"low growth and higher bills\" leads the Times. The paper also features a photo of Sarah Everard as her mother says she continues to suffer \"sadness, rage and guilt\" more than four years after her murder.Sarah Everard's mother is \"still tormented by the horrors\" of her daughter's final hours, writes the Independent. The chair of the inquiry into her death is quoted by the paper as saying it is \"shocking\" that her police vetting recommendations are yet to be fully implemented after nearly two years.Metro headlines on Justice Secretary David Lammy's decision to end jury trials for thousands with a headline reading \"the jury's out\". MPs \"from all sides\" have \"railed\" against the call according to Metro, which Lammy made to cut a backlog of 80,000 cases.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has told party donors that he expects a \"deal or merger\" with the Conservatives before the next election, according to the Financial Times. This \"suggests he believes he cannot sweep to power alone\", it writes. In Russia, US special envoy Steve Witkoff has been in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The discussions, at a large white table, are shown on the FT's front.The Daily Telegraph continues to focus on questions over whether the chancellor may have misled the public over the state of the UK's finances before the Budget. It reports senior figures at the Office for Budget Responsibility said Treasury permanent secretary James Bowler - the department's top civil servant - approved the publication of a letter showing the chancellor knew \"the financial hole was smaller than previously thought\".Royal rents are \"under fire\" as \"cut-price\", writes the Daily Mail. Following the scandal of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's peppercorn rent of Royal Lodge, now MPs will \"scrutinise deals enjoyed by Sophie, Edward and Princess Alexandra\", it reports.The Daily Star focuses on the Holly Willoughby court case. The paper reports the TV presenter collided with man on a scooter near her home in London, who was knocked to the ground and sustained a fracture to his neck.For the Sun, it is the \"great game robbery\" as it says tickets at the World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico next year will be \"the most expensive ever seen\". Fifa has \"grabbed\" a share of the resale market and tickets are already going for £1,000, it reports. Photos of all 97 victims of the Hillsborough disaster feature on the front page of the i paper, after the publication of what the Times calls a \"damning\" report on the police's actions during the stadium crush. The Daily Mirror says it confirms what families \"have feared all along\": that nobody will face justice. The paper claims that officers, criticised for their failures, have been allowed to simply \"walk away\". One woman whose son was killed in the tragedy is quoted in the Guardian as saying: \"How lucky they are to grow old\".A Reform UK donor tells the Financial Times that Nigel Farage has said he expects the party to either make a deal or merge with the Conservatives before the next election. The unnamed donor says the move would be aimed at \"easing Reform's route to victory\". But Farage tells the paper that he would never do a deal with a party he does not trust, adding that a deal with the Tories \"as they are\" would cost his party votes.According to the Daily Telegraph, the top civil servant at the Treasury has been dragged into the row over whether the chancellor misled the public about the state of the UK's finances. It reports that James Bowler \"approved the publication of a letter that showed Rachel Reeves knew the financial hole was smaller than previously thought\". An MP on the Treasury Select Committee tells the paper he was \"probably uncomfortable with the way the political team were leaking stuff\". But Treasury insiders deny any split, and insist Reeves approved the letter's release.The Daily Mail says that following what it calls Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's \"rent scandal\", Pandora's box has been opened, with a new investigation into homes owned by the Crown Estate. The paper says the probe will scrutinise the deal on the Prince and Princess of Wales's new family home in Windsor Great Park.And the Sun says that England fans are being \"clobbered\" with \"the most expensive World Cup tickets ever seen\". The paper says Fifa has \"grabbed a share of the resale market\", taking a 15% cut from both the buyer and the seller. According to the report, tickets are already going for £1,000, with some listed for nearly £33,000.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "1 day agoEmma SimpsonBusiness correspondentBBCRain drifts across the car park of Crawley's sprawling Asda, but the gloom does little to slow the steady stream of shoppers this midweek afternoon. Parents hurry past with school bags and groceries; car boots slam shut as people load up their weekly shops.For Carol Stimpson, who grew up in the area, the Asda is only a ten‑minute walk from her home, and she pops in most days. \"It's my corner shop,\" she says.Joanne Dench, another local, is also shopping in Crawley, and says she visits the town's Asda for its variety. \"They've got a good range of stuff — clothes, all sorts of things... And they have lots of international food, which is lovely because I like trying new things.\"But despite the bustle in this West Sussex Asda, the chain has been losing ground to rivals at an alarming rate.Joanne Dench, shopping in the centre of Crawley, says she enjoys Asda's rangeThe UK's third biggest supermarket had a dreadful Christmas. Two sets of industry data show Asda suffered a big slump in sales while all its main rivals reported an increase.Asda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to Worldpanel — and that's off the back of a terrible Christmas the year before.\"A mess\" is how William Woods, a food retail analyst from Bernstein Research, describes Asda's situation.The industry data suggests that despite Asda embarking on a turnaround and cutting prices, shoppers are still turning away. Asda's hope is that with time the plan will work out, but the question others are asking is whether this 60-year-old retailer is really able to turn things around?A controversial dealFor decades, Asda had the reputation as Britain's cheapest grocer, a slightly cheeky northern-based business loved by families for its \"everyday low prices.\"A generation grew up with its \"That's Asda Price\" TV commercial, first featured in an advert for the supermarket in 1977, showing shoppers tapping their back pockets signalling they'd saved money at the tills.The business was sold to the US retail giant Walmart in 1999, in what was then the largest foreign takeover in the UK retail sector.But from about 2010, Asda struggled to fend off the growing threat from Aldi and Lidl as Walmart's global priorities focused on its businesses in the US and elsewhere.In 2021 it sold the chain. In the four years leading up to the transaction, Asda paid just over £4bn to Walmart through a series of dividend payments.Asda was bought by two billionaire brothers from Blackburn and the private equity firm TDR Capital for £6.8bn.Mohsin and Zuber Issa made their fortune by building a petrol forecourt empire, EG Group. They were hailed as self-made entrepreneurs who would inject fresh thinking.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAsda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to WorldpanelBut the sale was financed by adding billions of pounds worth of debt onto Asda's business — one of the UK's biggest debt-funded takeovers in recent history.It was a controversial deal inked at the end of a Covid boom in groceries, when people were spending much more time at home and less money eating out. But the market soon changed. The war in Ukraine triggered a huge rise in inflation and a new era of rising interest rates, pushing up the cost of Asda's borrowings.Asda's market shareFollowing the takeover, Asda's CEO left, and Mohsin Issa took over the reins.\"His instincts were good, but it needed an experienced figure to guide the business through the very choppy waters,\" says one former Asda executive.The problems grew, compounded by high management turnover and shifting priorities.Store standards fell after cuts in staff hours and shoppers complained about empty shelves, slow restocking, and poor online availability.Lynette from Swindon first started shopping at Asda more than 20 years ago, but says it began to go \"downhill\" really quickly — \"you could see it in the supermarket, half the tills were closed, shelves were empty.\"Once a loyal Asda shopper, she has within the last few years begun using the discounters, Aldi and Lidl for her main shopping.EG GroupFollowing the takeover, Mohsin Issa took over the reinsBehind-the-scenes, Asda was also working through a huge tech overhaul as it moved away from the systems it used under Walmart.This included installing close to 16,500 new checkouts and launching a new groceries app and website — costing hundreds of millions of pounds.By autumn 2024, Mohsin Issa had stood down from his role. TDR also took majority ownership of the business, putting them in the driving seat.Asda's market share stood at 14.3% just before the takeover, according to Worldpanel, at the end of December 2025, it had fallen to 11.4%.Comparing this to the value of the grocery market overall, you end up with a business that is £4.5bn smaller in terms of annual revenue, at today's prices, than it would have been if Asda had maintained this share, according to Worldpanel sales analysis.Grocers have high fixed costs and slim profit margins. If you can grow the amount of stuff you sell, your profits can increase quickly, but the reverse can happen if your volumes decline (you sell fewer products in total) — leading to \"a negative spiral which is really, really difficult to get out of,\" says Bernstein's William Woods.The revival of AsdaAsda is now in the midst of a turnaround plan.But, judging by the industry data, there's been little sign of traction. The question is, does it simply need more time, or will it be unable to win customers back?The company has brought in the man who helped rescue Asda from the brink of collapse some thirty years earlier, to revive its fortunes.Allan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024, then aged 71. His big plan? The revival of Asda Rollback, the price campaign which he deployed, successfully, in the '90s.Getty ImagesAllan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024\"Rollbacks\" are temporary price reductions. This time round, after the Rollback ends, the products are then moved to a new \"Asda Price\" which are \"guaranteed\" to be lower than the original pre-Rollback price.Leighton said his aim was to make Asda 5-10% cheaper than other traditional supermarkets by the end of 2026, and he was prepared to take a big hit on profits, in the short term, to achieve it.One year on from its launch, Asda's pricing has improved. Data provided to the BBC by retail research firm Assosia shows that Asda's prices on more than 30 branded items were mostly cheaper than Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons based on promotional deals over the festive quarter.The retailer has also regularly come top of a closely watched weekly price survey run by The Grocer magazine. It doesn't include Aldi and Lidl.\"At times in the last year, Asda has certainly been 5% cheaper than all its established rivals,\" says Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of The Grocer.The trouble is, the price cuts don't appear to have made any difference.\"For shoppers, it's not just about price,\" says Leyland. Customer service, in-store experience and range is also important as well as perception about \"value\" and brand appeal.That sentiment is echoed by Madeline in Crawley. She says she avoids doing her weekly shop at the town's Asda.\"A lot of the shelves are quite empty, and there are always trolleys in the aisles when they're filling up shelves. Sometimes you can't get to where you want to be — it puts you off.\"One key supplier I spoke to said Asda needed to strike a better balance by investing more in stores and availability, and getting a grip on \"the basic fundamentals of retailing\".Asda has put more staff in stores and insists it is making progress.But once you've lost shoppers, it's very hard to win them back, especially when many of your rivals are firing on all cylinders, helped by price matching and loyalty schemes, in an intensely competitive market.William Woods believes Asda should have stuck to its year-long Aldi and Lidl price match campaign, which ended in January 2025. He says price matching has been a \"great psychological mechanism\" for Tesco and Sainsbury's to change customer perception and fight the discounters.Their respective loyalty price schemes, Clubcard and Nectar, also create a \"wow\" factor at the till, Woods says.Asda points out that rebuilding the business is a three to five year journey.\"We are in the early stages of our transformation,\" a spokesperson said. \"This is anchored in offering an unmatched value proposition, making sure products are always available and ensuring customers have the best possible experience when visiting our stores or shopping online.\"This approach is beginning to be reflected in stronger volumes over recent periods.\"One person familiar with the situation said there had been signs of a recovery last summer, but that coincided with the final stage of Asda's separation from Walmart's systems. This caused disruption, leading to empty shelves in the all important run up to Christmas trading, a \"nightmare\" putting the turnaround six months behind schedule, they said.\"It's annoying, disappointing, but we had to get out of the Walmart system.\"Does Asda have the firepower?In December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales data.Many in the industry are wondering if it has the necessary firepower to regain all the lost ground. Even if it can fix the basics, will Asda's high levels of debt prevent a full recovery?It sold off a raft of stores and a distribution centre – and then rented them back – to help reduce its borrowings. At the end of December 2024, its net debt stood at £3.8bn, whilst the annual financing costs, including debt interest payments, increased 38% to £611m.\"It's an amazing brand….  but sadly, I believe the business is totally broken,\" the former Asda executive believes.\"Whoever the owner is, I just don't think the business can stomach, or the balance sheet can't stomach, the level of investment that is required. The lack of investment goes back 10-15 years,\" they claimed.Getty ImagesIn December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales dataAn Asda spokesperson said its \"strong balance sheet and underlying free cash flow generation\" means it can comfortably cover current and future debt obligations.Like Asda, Morrisons has also been struggling under new private equity owners and has been selling assets to reduce its debt pile. It has lost all important market share and the number four spot to Aldi but its performance has recently stabilised.According to the major supplier, both businesses are in a race to get out of the debt burden, which is holding them back.\"I would love for them [Asda] to get back to where they were. Whether it's feasible is another question...\" the supplier says.Ged Futter spent fifteen years working as a buyer for Asda. He now runs a business training suppliers on how to negotiate with supermarkets and fears his former employer is in \"real trouble\".\"I was with a client today who said Asda was asking for this investment for promotions. The client said I'm walking away. What they asked for is too much. I'm backing another horse.\"2026: Make or breakThis year there's also been a further fall in the price of Asda's traded debt — a sign that investors are getting more nervous about the viability of the turnaround.The person familiar with the workings of Asda says they believe it has a compelling offer with its in store pharmacies and opticians, as well as the George clothing brand and a general merchandise business that is healthy.The view among many observers I've spoken to is that some form of consolidation in the sector seems, at some point,  inevitable — whether that means supermarkets breaking up, being sold, or merging.Allan Leighton has compared his task to climbing Mount Everest. Certainly, winning back customers will be no mean feat.Swindon local Lynette says: \"I don't think I will ever go back to shopping at Asda again, I might pick up the odd thing there, but they've lost me as a loyal customer.\"Asda badly needs some momentum, and 2026 feels make or break for the turnaround.Top image credit: Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,in Doha, Qatar,andJack BurgessEPAIran is due to hold live fire naval drills in the Strait of HormuzIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any attack on his country would spark a regional conflict, as the US continues to build up its forces nearby.\"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.Donald Trump earlier said Iran was in \"serious discussions\" and he hoped they would lead to something \"acceptable\", while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN he was \"confident that we can achieve a deal\" on Tehran's nuclear programme.Araghchi said: \"Unfortunately, we have lost our trust [in] the US as a negotiating partner,\" but added the exchange of messages through friendly countries in the region was facilitating \"fruitful\" talks with Washington.Iran's top security official Ali Larijani had previously said a framework for negotiations was progressing.As part of its build up of forces, the US has sent its aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region and late last week US Central Command said it was operating in the Arabian Sea.\"[Trump] regularly says that he brought ships... The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things,\" added Khamenei.Iran had been expected to begin a two-day live-fire naval exercise on Sunday in the Strait of Hormuz - one of the world's most important shipping lanes and a key route for energy supplies. However on Sunday Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) navy had no plans for such an exercise.Around a fifth of the world's traded oil passes through the waterway, which is about 33km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point between Iran and Oman. Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait if it were attacked. The US has warned Iran against any \"unsafe and unprofessional behaviour\" near its forces in the area.Araghchi responded by saying: \"The US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.\"On Saturday, two explosions in Iran heightened anxiety in the country. Local authorities said a blast that killed one and hurt 14 at a building in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas was caused by a gas leak. Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.In the south-western city of Ahvaz, at least four people were killed in another explosion, with local authorities again blaming a gas leak, according to Iran's Tehran Times.On Thursday, Trump said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid US military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.In his remarks on Sunday, Khamenei accused protesters of attacking police, the IRGC and other facilities including banks and mosques.\"The coup was suppressed,\" Tasnim quoted him as saying.",

It means the whole side of the moon that is facing us is illuminated by the sun's light.Full Moons were historically named as a way of keeping track of the change of seasons and often influenced the timing of activities like hunting, harvesting and planting, where the bright moonlight could come in handy. Each full Moon in a year has a name - a practice that dates back to ancient traditions centuries before the Gregorian calendar existed.February's full Moon is known as the Snow Moon, after the heavy snowfall often associated with this time of year in the northern hemisphere, but is also sometimes called the Storm Moon or Hungry Moon.Image source, BBC Weather Watcher/ AstroMalImage caption, January's Wolf Moon captured by BBC Weather Watcher 'AstroMal' over Crystal Palace, London Will I be able to see the full Moon?Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / YorkshireTedImage caption, A bright orange supermoon shines over Yorkshire Weather fronts moving north-eastwards across the UK have provided rain for many places on Sunday.Some of this will linger on Sunday night - crucially with a lot of cloud, which could spoil the plans of some moongazers.The cloudiest conditions are likely to be in east Wales, central, eastern and northern parts of England, and eastern and northern Scotland.Western Scotland, Northern Ireland, west Wales and the south-west of England have the best chance of seeing some clear spells at times.Don't forget you can check the latest hour-by-hour forecast for your area on the BBC Weather website and app.If you manage to spot the Moon and want to take a picture make sure you turn off the flash on your phone, activate night mode and use ambient light.If you miss the full moon overnight it will continue to appear nearly full in the few days after the peak.The lunar monthImage source, Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesImage caption, The Snow Moon in February 2023 was the smallest one of the year making it a Micromoon - the opposite of a supermoon This year there will be an extra full Moon on 31 May, known as a Blue Moon. This is the name given to the second full Moon in a calendar month. May's Blue Moon will also be one of three Micromoons this year. Micromoons appear to look smaller in the sky and are the opposite of a supermoon.We usually get 12 full Moons a year, but as this doesn't quite match up with the lunar cycle we get an additional one roughly every two and half years. As it only happens every few years it is where the expression 'once in a blue moon' comes from.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloVisionhaus/Getty ImagesCrown Princess Mette-Marit said she regretted having any contact with Epstein at allNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has said he agrees with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's admission of \"poor judgement\" after it emerged she had extensive contacts with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The princess features hundreds of times between 2011-14, in the latest files released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein.This latest embarrassment for the royal family comes on the eve of her son's seven-week trial in Oslo on 38 charges including rape and assault.Princess Mette-Marit married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon as a commoner when her son Marius Borg Høiby was four, and is in line to become queen when her husband accedes to the throne.As the content of her email exchanges began to emerge, the princess released a statement on Saturday saying: \"I showed poor judgement and regret having any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.\" She went on to express her \"deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the abuses committed by Jeffrey Epstein\".Although the prime minister did not go further than agreeing with the princess's admission of poor judgement, his implicit criticism of her is considered unusual.  Støre said he also believed that ex-Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland had exercised \"poor judgement\", after it emerged that he had planned a family holiday on Epstein's private island, although he then cancelled it.The latest cache of Epstein files reveals that Princess Mette-Marit spent four days at Epstein's house in Palm Beach, Miami in January 2013; and in one email from the HRH Crown Princess account, Epstein is asked whether a mother should suggest naked women carrying a surfboard for her son's wallpaper.US Department of JusticeThe warm nature of the correspondence has appalled commentators in Norway, and one message implied she was aware of his initial jail term in 2008.Norway's royal family has been buffeted by a succession of scandals in recent times, including the marriage of the crown prince's sister, Princess Märtha Louise to a self-styled American shaman.Now as Norwegians prepare for the trial of Marius Borg Høiby, questions are being asked about his mother's failure to realise the toxic nature of maintaining contact with Epstein, and the role of her advisers.Mette-Marit is suffering from pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant. Her 29-year-old son, who is not part of the royal family, denies the most serious charges against him. One charge of rape involves intercourse while a woman was asleep. Three others allege sexual assault while women were incapacitated, which also counts as rape in Norway.If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in jail.No member of the royal family will attend the trial, which starts at Oslo district court on Tuesday. However, in an emotional statement to reporters last week, Crown Prince Haakon said \"our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by this case...we understand that this is a difficult time for many of you, and we sympathise\".Although his stepson was not a member of the royal family he said: \"We care about him, and he is an important member of our family.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoHenri AstierWikipedia CommonsJavier Tarazona was arrested in July 2021 - photo Juanjoseco123, Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 4.0Prominent Venezuelan rights activist Javier Tarazona has been freed, in the latest prisoner release announced by the government amid US pressure for reforms.Tarazona, the head of human rights NGO Fundaredes, was arrested in 2021 and detained in the notorious El Helicoide prison in the capital Caracas. His release was announced on Sunday by Fundaredes.Foro Penal, another Venezuelan rights group, said it had verified the liberation of more than 300 political prisoners since 8 January.On Friday acting President, Delcy Rodríguez said the government would introduce an amnesty law that is expected to benefit hundreds of political prisoners. Under the bill, El Helicoide is also due to be closed.In its statement on Sunday, Fundaredes said Tarazona had been jailed \"for defending human rights, denouncing abuses, and speaking out\".It added that his release did not \"erase the injustice he suffered\", but represented \"a necessary step in a process marked by criminalisation, persecution, and a lack of due process\".Tarazona had alleged that government officials had links with guerrillas in Colombia, with which Venezuela has a 2,000km (1,200-mile) border. The government accused him of treason, terrorism and incitement to hatred.Maduro's dramatic capture by US special forces on 3 January has encouraged families of opposition and human rights figures arrested under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez to step up their campaign for releases.Venezuela has long denied holding political prisoners, but families and rights advocates have demanded charges against detainees be dropped. Opposition politicians, journalists, and activists have faced charges including terrorism and treason, which their families describe as arbitrary.The amnesty bill announced by Rodríguez is expected to be approved by the National Assembly in the coming days. Its aim, the acting president said, is to \"heal the wounds of political confrontation, violence, and extremism\".Foro Penal has said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group added.",

    "body": "12 hours agoGeorge WrightAFP via Getty ImagesIsrael says it will ban Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) from working in Gaza after the medical charity refused to hand over a list of its staff in the territory.The Israeli government had ordered 37 organisations to submit documents about their local and international workers in Gaza, claiming some in MSF had links to armed groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The charity has vehemently denied this.MSF announced on Friday that it would not share a list of its Palestinian and international staff with Israeli authorities as it had not secured \"assurances to ensure the safety of our staff\".In response, Israel said it was \"moving to terminate the activities\" of MSF in Gaza.The Israeli Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism said the decision followed \"MSF's failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region\".On 30 December, Israel announced that it was going to revoke the licences of 37 international non-governmental organisations working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, saying they had failed to meet new registration requirements.At the time the diaspora ministry said the measure was needed to prevent \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\".The groups - which include MSF, ActionAid and the Norwegian Refugee Council - were told their operations must end within 60 days.The move was condemned by 10 countries, including the UK, France and Canada, who said the rules would have a severe impact on access to essential services.MSF said in a statement on Friday that it had informed Israeli authorities that, as an \"exceptional measure\", it would share a list of names of its Palestinian and international staff, \"subject to clear parameters, with our staff safety at its core\". \"However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident in recent days that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required,\" it said.\"These included that any staff information would be used only for its stated administrative purpose and would not put colleagues at risk.\"On Sunday, it said the move was a \"pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance\" to Gaza.\"Israeli authorities are forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need,\" it said. Sam Rose, director of Gaza affairs for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, told the BBC that this will have \"major negative consequences on the ability of international organisations to provide healthcare inside Gaza\".He said MSF had its own reasons for not handing over staff lists \"given the large numbers of staff of medical organisations and international organisations that have been killed over the past two years\". A total of 1,700 healthcare staff have been killed in the war, including 15 MSF staff, the medical charity says.MSF says it currently provides at least 20% of hospital beds in Gaza and operates around 20 health centres. Last year, it carried out more than 800,000 medical consultations and more than 10,000 infant deliveries, while providing drinking water.The latest war in Gaza began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.",

Most closures were lifted shortly after 14:00, with only access to the hospital's west wing remaining blocked off.The hospital asked anyone requiring medical attention to use other services in the community, including urgent treatment centres at the Royal South Hants Hospital in Southampton or at Lymington New Forest Hospital.The fire rescue's group manager Larry Mackrell said the impact of the fire was \"significant\"Speaking earlier, Hampshire & Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service group manager Larry Mackrell crews were carrying out smoke clearance at the building.\"We'll have an attendance here for the foreseeable future but now we're looking to scale down our operations,\" he said.\"At this stage we don't have any information as to what caused the fire or really what was involved.\"He said the fire appeared to have \"stayed within the room of ignition\" but there had been \"products of combustion smoke\" travel throughout the floor, so the impact had been \"significant\".Related Links",

Selected others: -12 T Finau (US), S Power (Ire); -8 A Scott (Aus); -6 K Bradley (US); -4 B Koepka (US)Full leaderboardEngland's Justin Rose clinched an utterly dominant win at the Farmers Insurance Open in a new tournament record score.Rose, the 2019 winner, led by six shots before Sunday's fourth round on Torrey Pines' South Course and was rarely troubled over his final 18 holes.He signed for a two-under-par 70 to finish seven clear of the field on 23 under and claim his 13th PGA Tour title.The 45-year-old, whose last win came at August's FedEx St Jude Championship, picked up birdies at the sixth, eighth and ninth, with a bogey at the 12th his only blip.The previous best winning score in the tournament's history was 22 under - by Tiger Woods in 1999 and George Burns in 1987.Rose also becomes the oldest player to secure a wire-to-wire finish on tour - leading in all four rounds - since Rocco Mediate in October 2010 aged 47.\"This has been a huge win and to start the season with a win is amazing,\" said Rose.\"I knew 23 under was a record. I've grown the lead each day so I wanted to finish seven ahead rather than six. \"I had my own little mini goals down the stretch which kept me focused, which was key and I managed my game well.\"I'm still loving it and working hard and do believe there is some good stuff ahead of me.\"American Pierceson Coody had the best round of the day - a seven-under-par 65 - which gave him a share of second place alongside South Korea's Si Woo Kim and Japan's Ryo Hisatsune who both shot 69s.American Jake Knapp and Germany's Stephan Jaeger finished a further shot back. Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka, in his first tournament back on the PGA Tour since leaving LIV Golf, finished in a tie for 56th after a final round of 70.",

    "body": "12 hours agoWatch: 'I've never taken a drug in my life or even drunk alcohol,' says PolanskiThere needs to be a \"system change\" on drugs policy, Green Party leader Zack Polanksi has said as he reiterated his backing for the legalisation of drugs.Speaking on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, he called for a \"public health approach\" that would ensure that someone who had a \"problematic relationship with drugs\" could get help from a medical professional.Earlier in the week, Sir Keir Starmer accused Polanski of being \"high on drugs, soft on Putin\", a comment Polanski said was \"disgraceful\" and \"a cheap joke\".A No 10 source said the prime minister had been making \"an important point about the recklessness and irresponsibility of the Green Party\". Polanski said he had personally never taken drugs or drunk alcohol, adding that it \"wasn't for me\".  Asked why he had never drunk alcohol, he said: \"I grew up in school where a lot of my friends were drinking and in fact taking drugs and it felt like  somebody needed to be sober.\"I've always liked dancing without taking drink or drugs.\"If anyone wants to do it and they're doing it safely fine, I'm glad people are having a good time.\"But we know lots of people aren't doing it safely so let's make sure they get the support they need.\"Asked whether he believed legalisation could send a message to young people that using drugs would be okay, Polanski replied: \"I think the danger is happening right now which is where we're pushing it into street corners and a black market.\"He pointed to the organisation Anyone's Child, set up by families of those who had died due to drug use.\"They're saying very clearly with one voice we need a national conversation about how the war on drugs is not working,\" said Polanski.\"In fact it's making drugs more dangerous and actually what we need is a grown-up conversation based on evidence, taking a public health approach that looks at prevention, intervention and makes sure that afterwards people can get the support they need.\"Last year, The Thistle in Glasgow became the first place in the UK where people could inject heroin or cocaine while under medical supervision without being prosecuted.The UK government has said it would not change the existing drug laws to allow for the creation of more legal drug consumption rooms but would welcome any evidence that came out of The Thistle's three-year pilot.It added the government was \"focused on delivering a balanced approach with strengthened law enforcement to tackle supply coupled with investment in treatment, the development of a skilled workforce, sustainable recovery services and peer networks that will support people in recovery with employment, housing and education\".He describes himself as an \"eco-populist\" and has sought to position his party firmly on the left of politics.Asked if there was a risk he could alienate some of his party's traditional \"tree-hugging middle class\" voters, Polanski insisted his was \"the party of the 99% versus the 1%\". He said there was \"always a risk in politics\" but added that since he became leader 130,000 new members had joined his party. At the next general election, the Green Party could face the option of going into coalition with one of the other parties. He has previously said the prime minister is \"not a man I would be willing to work with\". Asked on Sunday if he would potentially be prepared to work with other politicians on the left such as Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, he said it would depend on \"what kind of policy platform they were putting forward\". He added his \"biggest focus\" was trying to win more seats for the Green Party.\"If I was working with another politician, I would have some obvious demands - a wealth tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires, proper action on the climate crisis and indeed proportional representation so people's votes actually counted,\" he said.

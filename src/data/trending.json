    "body": "Hamas ruled Gaza with an iron rod - will it really give up control?19 hours agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem andRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondentBBCHow does a group that has governed the Gaza Strip for almost 20 years, ruling two million Palestinians with an iron rod and fighting Israel in repeated wars, suddenly lay down its arms and relinquish control?Judging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.Its masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.Other victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.Some of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.This is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.AFP via Getty ImagesThe ceasefire came into effect on Friday 10 October​ - Hamas and Israel have both blamed each other for blatant violations of itFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.On his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.Three days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"So, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas? And ultimately, after two years of war that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?'A complete loss of law and order'For many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry - this ugly endgame is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.Of the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control. And indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians gathered to celebrate following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement \"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"Dr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.'As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs,' argues aid worker Hanya Aljamal \"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others. \"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"Other Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them. AFP via Getty ImagesMany Palestinians and Israelis doubt Hamas is willing to step back from a political roleHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip. The wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer: 'If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head'\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas. \"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"'Still the dominant player in Gaza'Mr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.The disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated into a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"'Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza' says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military IntelligenceHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza. The Trump ceasefire plan, to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".But even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.Rise of Hamas and its iron gripTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.From its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.Initially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"But when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.A violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election, in sole control of the Gaza Strip.Eighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.Despite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"With Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"Getty ImagesIsrael has gone to enormous lengths to eliminate Hamas's key political and military figuresThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.Mr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.Netanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.Hamas was always preparing for warAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.Tunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.In 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar, one of those behind the Hamas attacks of October 2023Over time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.Regional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.Hamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling in places like Lebanon and Iraq.Iran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.In 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expandedSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.A local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).Precise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.Tunnels: a project shrouded in secrecyPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening. Local residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.What began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.It emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAt least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since since October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministryAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.Eli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity. \"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"By the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).EPAEli Sharabi, who was held hostage, was moved from a safe house into a tunnel. 'They tied us with ropes,' he has saidHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.Eventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"Getty ImagesIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024In the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.And the job is far from done.\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"A leadership in tattersRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.Israel has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures. From its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.Israel assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024. Three months later, Haniyeh's successor, the elusive Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the ruins of a house in Rafah.ReutersIsmail Haniyeh (left) was assassinated in Tehran in July 2024, followed three months later by his successor Yahya Sinwar (centre). Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri (right) was killed in Beirut blastDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.But Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.Ezzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.EPA/ ShutterstockMany of the group's key political and military figures have been killed. (L-R) Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Sheikh Ahmed YassinOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.All are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.Hamas is 'tired of war'Despite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war. Without mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople sit among the rubble and wreckage of war in Gaza. The former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, claims Hamas is also tired of war\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says. \"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"Hamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life. \"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"Dr Milshtein is doubtful.\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael may have to deal with Hamas for some time to comeDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.But Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says. \"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"For now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.But Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.Additional reporting: BBC MonitoringTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Met Office yellow weather warnings have been issued for wind and rain impacts on Thursday in the United Kingdom.This severe weather come as a deepening area of low pressure heads across southern England that has the potential to be a named storm.Impacts for the UK do not look severe enough for the Met Office to name this weather system.However, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), Météo France or the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium may decide to name it.Heavy rain will spread in across southern England late on Wednesday, spreading north-east and likely to persist right through until late Thursday.The Met Office yellow warning for rain covers much of southern and eastern England from midnight on Wednesday night into Thursday, and through until 21:00 BST.Rainfall totals by early Thursday morning could be  widely 20-30mm (around 1in), and for some places 30-50mm (up to 2in). There is a small chance a few places could exceed this, most likely over Devon and Cornwall and more generally in eastern England.Localised flooding and some transport disruption is possible.The wind will also strengthen with an additional yellow warning from the Met Office covering west Wales and south-west England from 04:00 until 18:00 BST.A separate wind warning has also been issued for eastern England from 09:00 Thursday until 23:59 BST.Very strong north-westerly winds gusting to 45-55mph (70-90km/h) in both areas are possible, while locally 65mph (105km/h) on the east coast is also possible.While there is still some uncertainty on the intensity of this weather system, the Met Office warns that there is potential for gusts up to 75mph (120km/h) for a small period of time later on Thursday morning and into the afternoon. These wind speeds have the potential to topple trees or their branches, cause travel disruption and even bring power cuts.While the impacts for the UK are not thought severe enough for this low pressure system to be named by the Met Office, we could still end up talking about a named storm.With much stronger winds expected in northern France or Belgium on Thursday, impacts there could be much more severe.In this instance, Météo France or the Royal Meteorological Institute in Belgium could name it Storm Benjamin.Benjamin is second on the list of names in the south-western Europe meteorological group consisting of Portugal, Spain, Luxembourg, France and Belgium.However, if the Netherlands meteorological agency decides that impacts there will be more severe, it may wish to name it first.And because the Netherlands is in partnership with the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in the western meteorological group, it would come from our list of named storms.The next storm on our list is Storm Bram.It might therefore seem like quite a complicated situation with uncertainties remaining firstly on whether the low pressure system will be intense enough to be given a name, and secondly, what name it would be given.However, all weather agencies discuss the forecast and a decision will be made that will become consistent for all.For now, stay tuned to the forecast and get all the latest updates from us here at BBC Weather.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJennifer McKiernanpolitical reporter andRuth Green and Sima Kotechasenior UK correspondentGetty Images/BBCFiona Goddard (left) and Ellie Reynolds resigned from the inquiry panel on Monday. The third survivor - Elizabeth - remains anonymousA third abuse survivor has resigned from their role in the government's inquiry into grooming gangs.\"Elizabeth\" - not her real name - joined Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds, who quit the inquiry's victims and survivors liaison panel on Monday in protest.In her resignation letter, Elizabeth said the process felt like \"a cover-up\" and had \"created a toxic environment for survivors\".Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has denied claims of a cover-up and insisted her government was \"committed to exposing the failures\" to tackle \"these appalling crimes\".Elizabeth, who is from Rotherham, said she felt the process had been \"scripted and predetermined\", \"rather than emerging from honest, open dialogue with survivors\".\"This sense of control and stage-management has left many of us questioning whether our voices truly matter, or whether we are being used to legitimise decisions that have already been made,\" she added.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in June there would be a national inquiry into grooming gangs covering England and Wales, with a panel of survivors set up to oversee the process.However, a chairperson for the inquiry has yet to be appointed.The BBC has been told former senior social worker Annie Hudson, who had been named as a potential chair has withdrawn following recent media coverage over her candidacy.One of the other names being considered to lead the inquiry is former deputy chief constable Jim Gamble.A meeting between Mr Gamble and survivors took place earlier, with both sides said to have listened to each others perspectives.Ms Goddard and Ms Reynolds had raised concerns about the suitability of the candidates shortlisted to chair the inquiry, arguing they should not have a background in policing or social work.Ms Goddard, who was abused by gangs while living in a Bradford children's home, said these services had \"contributed most to the cover-up of the national mass rape and trafficking of children\". Meanwhile, Ms Reynolds suggested having \"establishment insiders representing the very systems that failed us\" as potential chairs was a conflict of interest.The three women have accused officials are trying to water down the inquiry by widening the scope beyond grooming gangs into broader issues of child sexual abuse and exploitation.Elizabeth said she had seen \"selective narratives being promoted - ones that appear to serve particular agendas, especially around issues of race and the narrative of widening the scope\".Ms Reynolds, who was abused by a gang of Pakistani brothers in Barrow, said the \"final turning point\" in her decision to quit was a move to widen the inquiry \"in ways that downplay the racial and religious motivations behind our abuse\".Watch: Abuse survivor Ellie-Ann Reynolds says a judge should lead grooming gangs inquiryResponding to the resignations of Ms Goddard and Ms Reynolds in the House of Commons earlier, Safeguarding Minister Phillips said she regretted the departure of the two women but added: \"My door is always open to them.\"She also said \"not all victims are of the same opinion - they are not one homogeneous group of people, who all think the same thing, who all want the same exposure, who all want their identities known\".\"I will engage with all the victims, regardless of their opinions, and I will listen to those that have been put in the media, that are put in panels, I will always listen and I will speak to all of them.\"Phillips added that the inquiry panel of victims from which Ms Reynolds and Ms Goddard resigned was not managed by the government, but by a grooming gang charity.However, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the government's inquiry was \"descending into chaos\". He argued that ministers had been \"forced\" into holding the inquiry in June adding: \"Perhaps that is why, months later, the government has said nothing substantive publicly.\"The Conservatives have called for the inquiry to be chaired by a senior judge to guarantee impartiality and restore faith in the process.Phillips rejected that suggestion, arguing that Baroness Casey, who led a previous inquiry into the subject, had said she did not want a traditional judicial-led inquiry.The minister also stressed the difficulty of finding a chair who was not attached to an institution \"that didn't fail these girls over the years, including our courts who took the children away from grooming gang victims, who criminalised some of them\". \"There is no institution in our country that hasn't failed,\" she added. Speaking to the BBC's World At One, a campaigner against forced marriage and abuse also criticised the process. \"It feels to me now that [survivors have] been invited to the party, but not invited to the dance. If this is lip service, it's not real engagement,\" said Dame Jasvinder Sanghera,  who runs the Karma Nirvana charity. \"Closing doors and making decisions without them about this is absolutely the wrong thing to do.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoEthan GudgeOxfordOxford Union/YouTubeCharlie Kirk and George Abaraonye took part in a debate at the Oxford Union in MayThe president-elect of the Oxford Union has lost a no-confidence vote after he was criticised for comments appearing to celebrate the death of Charlie Kirk. The motion against George Abaraonye had met the required two-thirds threshold to oust the student from his position, the society has announced.It comes after Mr Abaraonye reportedly posted on social media to seemingly welcome the attack on the US conservative activist in September. Mr Abaraonye is disputing the no-confidence vote, telling the BBC people campaigning to oust him had \"unsupervised access\" to the email account collecting proxy ballots.Kirk, an influential right-wing activist and close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at a university in Utah.According to the Telegraph, Mr Abaraonye posted a message on Instagram which read \"Charlie Kirk got shot loool\" - an elongated version of the phrase 'lol' which means 'laughing out loud'.He is also said to have posted in a WhatsApp chat with fellow students appearing to welcome the incident.Last week, Mr Abaraonye said he had submitted the motion of no confidence in himself, with voting taking place over the weekend.A notice published by extraordinary returning officer Donovan Lock on Tuesday said 1,228 ballots were cast in favour of no confidence, while 501 were against.The notice stated the president-elect was deemed to have resigned in accordance with Oxford Union's rules.Oxford UnionThe Oxford Union shared the outcome of the no-confidence vote on Tuesday morningProceedings were informally suspended early on Monday after the returning officer was allegedly subjected to \"obstruction, intimidation, and unwarranted hostility by a number of representatives\", a notice said.In a statement, Mr Abaraonye claimed the count had been halted because electoral officials believed \"no legitimate and true result could be reached as a result of procedural failures\".\"We unequivocally deny that any representative appointed by George engaged in intimidating or disruptive behaviour,\" his statement stated.It said the \"extremely serious issues\" had been referred to the disciplinary committee on Monday afternoon and that Mr Abaraonye remained president-elect.\"George is proud and thankful to have the support of well in excess of a majority of students at Oxford, who voted to have a safe election and resist attempts to subvert democracy,\" his statement added.The society said if allegations or complaints are lodged the result shall be pending their determination.Opponents have said any failure to remove him would \"signal to the world that the Oxford Union has chosen ideology over integrity\".Getty ImagesCharlie Kirk was shot dead while speaking at a university in SeptemberOn Friday, Mikey McCoy, Kirk's former chief of staff, read out an open letter to the Oxford Union on The Charlie Kirk Show podcast.It accused the union of becoming a place where \"presidents of the union publicly celebrate the assassination of a political opponent\".The letter said that if Mr Abaraonye were to remain in post, Kirk's allies would \"personally contact every American political speaker who has ever graced the union's chamber and urge them never again to lend their name, time or reputation to that institution that has betrayed its founding ideals\".In a statement last month, the Oxford Union condemned Mr Abaraonye's remarks after Kirk's death and said the complaints filed against him had been forwarded for disciplinary proceedings.It later issued a second statement condemning the racial abuse and threats Mr Abaraonye had faced.The president-elect had been one of several students to debate with Kirk at the union in May.More on this story",

Brands stepped in to save the remaining 64 pizza restaurants and 1,276 jobs.Pizza Hut is well-known for its family-friendly dining and salad bar, but its UK business has been struggling and had previously gone into administration less than a year ago.Administrators FTI Consulting said DC London Pie had been hit by the combination of \"challenging trading conditions and increased costs\". Cashflow had come under pressure \"as a result of tax-related obligations\".\"The joint administrators will continue to work with employees who have unfortunately been made redundant, to ensure they get the support needed,\" joint administrator Matt Callaghan said in a statement on Tuesday.DC London Pie had bought Pizza Hut UK's restaurants from insolvency in January this year. The company also owns Pizza Hut franchises in Sweden and Denmark.Alongside the newly acquired 64 pizza restaurants, Yum!

    "body": "1 hour agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East Correspondent, JerusalemUnder Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, the \"yellow line\" - which Israel withdrew to earlier this month - is the first of three stages of Israeli military withdrawal. It leaves it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.One Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, referred to it as \"effectively the new border\" in Gaza.It's a remark that will please the far-right coalition partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The fortifications and demarcations Israel is now building along this boundary are meant to clearly divide the territory, but they may also help to blur the differing hopes and expectations of Mr Netanyahu's allies in Washington and at home.How long he can keep both sets of expectations in play depends largely on this next stage of negotiations.The boundary marked by the yellow line is temporary, but further withdrawal of Israeli forces rests on resolving the difficult issues pinned to the second stage of Donald Trump's deal – including the transfer of power in Gaza and the process for disarming Hamas.Washington is keen that nothing upset this next delicate stage of negotiations. US Vice-President JD Vance flew in on Tuesday to push Netanyahu to press on with peace talks. Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with the Israeli PM on Monday.Israeli newspapers have been reporting that Netanyahu is receiving a stern message from his American allies to \"show restraint\" and not to endanger the ceasefire.When Israel complained that Hamas had violated the terms of the ceasefire on Sunday, killing two soldiers, the response advocated by Mr Netanyahu's far-right National Security Minister was a one-word demand: \"War\".Instead, Israel carried out an intense, but brief, wave of air strikes, before reinstating the truce, and was careful to emphasise that its troops had been attacked inside the yellow line – keen to show Washington that Israel had not broken the rules.Netanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas is dismantled – its disarmament, and the full demilitarisation of Gaza, are among the conditions he has set.But Israeli commentators are lining up to say that the real decisions over Israel's military action in Gaza are now being made in Washington.The yellow line – and the daunting task facing negotiators in this second stage of the deal – are clues as to why Netanyahu's coalition partners have chosen to wait, rather than carry out a threat to bring down his government.The dream for many extremist settlers – and ministers – is that the next stage of this process will prove impossible to resolve and the yellow line will indeed become the de facto border, opening the way to new settlements on Gazan land. Some hardliners would like Israel to annex the whole of the Gaza Strip.The vast majority of Israelis want an end to the war and for the remaining bodies of the hostages, and Israel's serving soldiers, to come home.But Israel's prime minister is known as a politician who likes to keep his options as open as possible, for as long as possible, and this is a deal in stages, with caveats built in.Agreeing to this first stage meant withdrawing to positions that left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, and agreeing to a ceasefire in order to get hostages home.From here, it will become harder to align the goals of his US and domestic allies.Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that violations of the deal by Hamas – including its failure to disarm – would allow Israel to return to war.\"If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better,\" he told the Israeli public earlier this month. \"If not, it will be achieved the hard way.\"Donald Trump has said the same.  But Washington has so far shown a tolerance for delays and violations in implementing the deal on the ground, leaving Netanyahu with far less political room than perhaps he'd like.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterChildren paid a \"huge price\" to protect others during the Covid pandemic, Boris Johnson has told the inquiry looking at the impact on young people.The former prime minister repeated an apology made previously for things the government got wrong, but said he was proud of what teachers and schools did to cope with the \"unbelievably difficult\" circumstances.He pushed back on earlier suggestions that there had been no plans in place for closing schools in early 2020, saying he had assumed a \"great deal of thought and care\" was already going into those decisions by then.But he said he had also hoped schools could remain open, calling it a \"nightmare idea\" and \"personal horror\" to close them.Former education secretary Gavin Williamson gave his own evidence to the inquiry last week, in which he said the government had made an error in \"sticking to the plan\" of trying to keep schools open in March 2020.The inquiry was told a plan was only made on 17 March 2020 - the day before an announcement that schools were closing. Johnson told the inquiry on Tuesday that he accepted the criticism around the lack of planning, but added that making changes to schools would have required a \"much greater state of knowledge about Covid and what was likely to happen\".\"The speed at which the disease was progressing\" made it harder to plan around, he added, saying the key focus was on trying to avoid an \"appalling public health crisis\".The inquiry has also heard previously about several disagreements between Williamson and Johnson, including over the decision to close schools again in 2021.Last week, Williamson was confronted with an expletive-laden message he had sent to the then-prime minister in February 2021, in which he said he had taken \"abuse\" for the government's decision to shut schools one day after they reopened.On Tuesday, Johnson told the inquiry he had wanted to see \"mass testing\" in schools as a way of keeping them open.But that was \"never going to be a runner\" because of the new alpha variant which arrived at the same time and accelerated the spread of the disease, he said.One of the biggest issues of the pandemic for both Johnson and Williamson came in the exam results fiasco of August 2020.The Department for Education (DfE) had been forced to go back on its use of an algorithm to award results, which was designed to prevent inflated grades but which instead saw 40% of predicted results downgraded.The public outcry led to a U-turn which meant pupils were ultimately awarded the grades they had been predicted by their teachers, after GCSE and A-level exams were scrapped earlier in the year.Johnson was confronted with his own leaked messages at the inquiry on Tuesday, in which he had told advisers Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain at the time that the DfE needed \"better ministers\".\"We can't go on like this. I am thinking of going into Number 10 and firing people,\" he had said.Johnson said he had been in a \"thoroughly homicidal mood\" at the time.Referencing the exams fiasco, counsel to the inquiry Clair Dobbin KC suggested to Johnson that \"the whole thing was a disaster\".\"If you mean was Covid a disaster? Yes. Was the loss of education a disaster? Yes. Was the loss of exams a disaster? Yes. Was the disappointment, anger, frustration of a large number of kids - the additional frustration - a disaster? Yes it was,\" Johnson said.\"But it has to be seen in the context of us trying to deal with a much, much bigger disaster,\" he added, referencing the loss of learning and exams.\"On the whole\", he said the DfE had done a pretty \"heroic job\" of trying to cope with the pandemic.Later in Tuesday's evidence, Johnson said the lockdown and social distancing rules \"probably did go too far\", and that children could have been exempted from them.While \"hopefully this thing never happens again\", he said in any future pandemic the closure of schools \"really should be a measure of last resort\".This session of the Covid inquiry, looking at the impact of the pandemic on children and young people, is due to end later this week.You can listen to the latest episode of the Covid Inquiry Podcast on BBC Sounds",

    "body": "British grandmother on death row to return to UK1 hour agoDawn LimbuWest of EnglandAPGrandmother Lindsay Sandiford will be transferred to the UK after 12 years on death row in IndonesiaA British grandmother who has spent more than a decade on death row in Indonesia after being convicted of drug smuggling can return to the UK, the Indonesian government has said.Lindsay Sandiford, 69, was sentenced to death on the island of Bali in 2013 after nearly five kilos of cocaine with a street value of £1.6m were found in her suitcase when she arrived on a flight from Thailand in 2012.She admitted the offences but said she had agreed to carry the cocaine after a drug syndicate threatened to kill her son. An agreement between the Indonesian and British governments, announced on Tuesday, will allow her to return to the UK in about two weeks alongside British national Shahab Shahabadi.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting two British Nationals detained in Indonesia and are in close contact with the Indonesian authorities to discuss their return to the UK.\"ReutersSandiford was convicted of drug trafficking in 2013Sandiford, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, had faced the threat of execution by firing squad during her sentence in Indonesia.Shahabadi, 35, had been serving a life sentence after being convicted of drug smuggling and both British prisoners are said to have been suffering from health problems.The Indonesian minister for law and human rights, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, said he had signed a deal with British foreign secretary Yvette Cooper for the transfer of the pair.\"We agreed to grant the transfers of the prisoners to the UK. The agreement has been signed,\" Mr Yusril told reporters at a press conference in capital Jakarta earlier.They will be handed over after the technical details of the transfer are agreed, which the minister said could take \"around two weeks\" to organise.Speaking at the press conference, Mr Yusril said both prisoners are \"currently facing problems.\"\"The first one, Sandiford, is in poor health and has been examined by our doctors as well as by a doctor from the British consulate in Bali. She is seriously ill.\"The second, Shahab Shahabadi, although still young at 35 and serving a life sentence, is suffering from several serious health issues, particularly mental health disorders.\"Indonesia and the UK do not have a formal prisoner transfer arrangement; normally these require that repatriated prisoners serve out their terms in their home countries.Sandiford was arrested at a time when the Indonesian authorities were imposing tougher penalties on drug smugglers and in 2015 two Australian men were executed after being convicted of smuggling heroin.'Really tough punishment'Jennifer Fleetwood, a criminologist at the University of London, was part of Sandiford's appeal team in the initial case 12 years ago. She said it was good that the grandmother would be returning to the UK.She said: \"To undertake a prison sentence with the threat of execution, I can't fathom how difficult that would be.\"Having spent time doing research in prisons overseas, I know that it's really, really hard for people to serve a sentence abroad.\"They have huge distance from family for their significant language difficulties.\"But on top of that, often we see human rights abuses in prison, lack of access to health care.\"And as someone who is ageing with health needs, that's a really, really tough punishment to serve. 12 years is a long, long time.\"Additional reporting by Jonathan Head in Bangkok",

    "body": "3 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentShutterstockNew details have emerged about how Prince Andrew can afford his sprawling 30-room Windsor mansion in a lease agreement which has been revealed.The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a document seen by BBC News confirms. The deal meant that instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments up-front, including for renovations. In effect, those payments - which totalled around £8m - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease.Details about Prince Andrew's living arrangements have been scrutinised as controversy continues over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a scandal which has been reignited by new sexual abuse allegations contained in Virginia Giuffre's posthumously-published memoir. While Prince Andrew has always strenuously denied abusing Giuffre, fresh questions have been asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.Prince Andrew, who gave up titles including the Duke of York last week, signed the lease agreement on his home in 2003 with his landlord, the Crown Estate - an independent property company owned by the monarch.The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.Prince Andrew's rent is described as a \"peppercorn\", which means a small sum such as £1, which can be paid every year on a long lease, as part of a legal arrangement between a tenant and the landlord. Or in his case there was no payment at all.It's not about making a profit but is a symbolic payment, in this case from Prince Andrew to the Crown Estate.Crown Estate/PAThis ongoing arrangement poses a problem for the Royal Family: with Prince Andrew mired in scandal, it is a terrible look to have him living among them in Windsor in apparent splendour.The lease document also show Prince Andrew has to keep paying for the upkeep of Royal Lodge, ensuring the exterior stonework is in good condition every five years and painting the interior every seven years.He has to \"paint, paper, polish, decorate\" to keep the house in good condition and to keep the landscaped grounds and gardens in good order. Prince Andrew, as the tenant, also has to allow his landlords to inspect and make sure he is keeping to the terms of the lease.Other details revealed in the lease include clauses specifying that no helicopters are able to land there, and no gambling is allowed on the premises.Upfront paymentsInformation separately published by the National Audit Office shows Prince Andrew had to pay for £5 million worth of repairs, £2.5 million for the option of buying out future rent and a further £1 million premium to the Crown Estate.There might now be questions about where Andrew got the funds in 2003 to effectively pay more than £8 million for a lease for life.That up-front payment arrangement helps to explain how he can currently afford to live there, given he does not have to make a monthly payment. The deal was based on a notional rent of £260,000 per year, although with the recognition that it would have been hard to rent out the property commercially because of the security restrictions.And the NAO said the refurbishments went on to cost Andrew more than £7.5m, rather than the initial £5m anticipated by the deal.There were other precedents for this kind of arrangement with the Crown Estate. In 1998, Prince Edward took a 50-year lease for Bagshot Park, putting in about £580,000 to pay for renovations which later rose to about £1.4m.It was a smaller up-front payment than Prince Andrew paid, with Edward then having to pay rent of about £90,000 per year, which will have risen since in line with inflation.EPAIt's been no secret that Buckingham Palace has wanted to see him move out of such a grand setting, but it's also recognised that he has a cast-iron lease, independently held, on Royal Lodge.More than 20 years ago, when Prince Andrew was a less controversial figure, the deal on Royal Lodge was seen as financially better for the taxpayer than using the house as a \"grace and favour\" residence, where someone might live without any commercial payment.The property at the time, once occupied by the Queen Mother, had been rundown and in need of modernisation, and getting Prince Andrew to pay for the building work was seen as a way of avoiding any public expense.And because of security requirements about the house's location on the Windsor estate, the Crown Estate was keener to keep a cash-paying royal there, when it could have been difficult to put on the open market.An NAO report said the arrangement met the Crown Estate's obligation to provide \"value for money\" and that it had been \"money's worth\".The King last year ended any financial support for his brother - and it still remains unclear how Andrew pays for costs such as security and the requirement to pay for the upkeep.The arrangement by which he paid cash up-front rather than monthly rent, and his agreement to carry out substantial repairs, also explains why he will be reluctant to give up his place in Royal Lodge, which he shares with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson.Part of the deal was that if he left early in the lease he could reclaim some of the money that he had paid up-front, with that amount tapering down over time, until that guarantee ended entirely after 25 years. The longer he stayed there, the less he would get back if he gave up the lease.It's now more than 22 years since he signed the lease and so the amount he would get back has kept falling. At the current rate, it's about £186,000 for each remaining year until 2028.The lease is due to end in June 2078, beyond his expected lifetime, and the arrangement also includes the clause that his ex-wife and daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie could continue with it.On Tuesday, Number 10 said it was up to the NAO whether to re-examine Prince Andrew's lease arrangements for the building.Dame Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons treasury committee, said \"we need to have answers\" to ensure taxpayers' money was not being misspent.Asked about Prince Andrew's living arrangements, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"I haven't seen the details of this... but I do think people should pay their way and pay their fair share.\"Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick had earlier said: \"It's about time Prince Andrew took himself off to live in private and make his own way in life.\"While Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokeswoman Lisa Smart said Andrew \"should show some contrition by returning every penny of rent that he's not paid while disgracing his office\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoShaimaa KhalilJapan correspondentReutersSanae Takaichi has made it to the top in a male-dominated countryFor many young girls in Japan today, the image of Sanae Takaichi taking the helm of power as the country's first ever female leader is powerful and formative.It means a patriarchal society and a political system that has long been dominated by men is now led by a woman.But while the optics speak of a progressive moment, some women don't see her as an advocate for change.\"It was quite interesting to see how people outside Japan have reacted to the news.\" Ayda Ogura, 21, says.\"Everyone's like, 'wow, she's the first female prime minister in Japanese history and that would be a great opportunity for women empowerment and gender equality in Japan'.\"I think that's a very naive interpretation.\"Instead, Ms Ogura points to her \"political beliefs and what she stands for\", adding: \"She perpetuates the patriarchal system.\"Ayda Ogura, 21, warns this may not be the moment for gender equality in Japan some thinkA big fan of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has always wanted to be the \"Iron Lady\" of her country.And like Thatcher, Takaichi is a staunch conservative.Observers say her leadership is a tactical move from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to appeal to the more conservative base which had recently gravitated towards Japan's parties further to the right.Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and has long stood against legislation that would allow married couples to have separate surnames, preventing many women from keeping their maiden names.She's also against women being in line for succession in the imperial family.However, she did soften some of her messaging during her campaign - saying she favours giving tax incentives to companies that provide childcare facilities to their employees and spoke of possible tax breaks for families spending on childcare.But she has over the years backed the idea of a more traditional role for women in society and in the family.When it comes to women's issues, Takaichi is consistent with her country's less than impressive record on gender issues.Japanese women are among the best educated and highest qualified in the world and yet they struggle with the expectations of a conservative society that still pushes them in traditional roles.According to the 2025 gender gap index by the World Economic Forum, Japan ranked 118th among 148 countries, with female representation in the field of politics notably low.Leadership positions have traditionally been dominated by men and Japan has struggled to increase the number of female lawmakers and business leaders.The world's fourth largest economy ranks last among the G7 countries when it comes to the share of women in its national parliament.  Specifically, women make up about 15.7% of lawmakers in Japan, the lowest figure among the G7.It is even slow when it comes to women's reproductive health: only this week was it announced that the \"morning after\" pill - a form of emergency contraception available without prescription in more than 90 countries - had finally been approved for over the counter use in Japan.Even so, some see Takaichi's rise to power as a pivotal moment that could change how women view their prospects.\"There is great significance in Ms Takaichi becoming prime minister, with a broader impact on society,\" Naomi Koshi - who became the country's youngest female mayor in 2012 - told Japan's Kyodo news agency.Koshi argued Japan having a female prime minister will \"lower psychological barriers\" for women and girls, helping them feel it is normal to \"stand out\" as leaders in companies and society, even as gender-based stereotypes and expectations still remain.But Audrey Hill-Uekawa, 20, points out that, while it is remarkable Japan has its first female leader, one must remember it took her more than 30 years to get to that position.\"She's also not really going against the grain. She's saying the same thing as the men.\" Audrey Hill-Uekawa, 20, says the new prime minister's views don't differ much from the men who have gone beforeMs Hill-Uekawa adds that she shouldn't be put on a pedestal simply because she is a woman.\"We need to make sure we're talking about her policies. We need to be able to criticise her equally as everyone else.\"It is not just what Takaichi has said which has led people to label her as a defender of the patriarchy.It's also evident by who her champions inside the party have been.She's the protégé of the late former hawkish prime minister Shinzo Abe, and was backed in the leadership election by Taro Aso - a senior figure in the LDP at the head of one of the ruling party's most influential conservative blocs.His faction's support for Sanae Takaichi was pivotal in uniting the party's right wing behind her.\"I do feel that it is difficult for women to sort of relate to her success because it furthers this idea that we must be compliant with the status quo,\" 21-year-old Minori Konishi says.Ms Ogura agrees, saying that with her as a figurehead for women in politics, \"people are going to expect the same from us as well\".\"They're going to expect us to be compliant, not go against the ideals that they have, and it might make our job more difficult.\"Making history, however, was just the first of the challenges Takaichi will face - not least tackling a sluggish economy and inflation and winning back the trust of a frustrated and angry electorate, as well as hosting president Trump within days of taking power.It's safe to say that no-one expects gender equality issues to be high on her priority list.",

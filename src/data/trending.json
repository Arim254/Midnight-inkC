    "body": "1 day agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterThe last 12 months have delivered a huge number of viral moments - Taylor Swift getting engaged, a raccoon getting drunk, and the 6-7 trend driving teachers everywhere to early retirement.But those weren't the only moments that kept us entertained throughout the year. Here are 15 of the cultural highlights (and lowlights) that defined 2025.1. Beyoncé's Grammy reactionCBS\"Wait, what? Me? I've won? I've won a Grammy? I've won this Grammy? Are you sure?\"Beyoncé didn't actually say any of these words as she won country album of the year in February, but her facial expression and body language conveyed her understandable shock.There had been some well-documented snobbery towards Cowboy Carter within the country community, but it had a huge night, also winning Beyoncé album of the year for the first time.We'll skip over the fact that she should've won much sooner for Lemonade or Renaissance and just be grateful that Beyoncé got her trophy and the internet got a meme for the ages.2. Sydney Sweeney's denim dramaGetty Images\"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\" So said the strap line for an American Eagle advert in July that featured the Euphoria actress dressed head to toe in denim.Depending on your viewpoint, this was either a fun piece of wordplay in a harmless clothing advert, or a dog whistle for white supremacy and eugenics-era rhetoric.The publicity generated by the fallout duly prompted the company's sales to skyrocket. Sadly for Sweeney, it didn't result in a similar surge for her next film at the box office.The actress herself kept quiet throughout the controversy, but later clarified she \"does not support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign\", adding: \"I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand.\" 3. Lily Allen's revenge Getty Images/Nieves GonzálezIt was an eventful year in music - Oasis got through their reunion shows seemingly without incident, the launch of a new Elvis experience was a blue suede shambles, and Coldplay's tour left two fans in Massachusetts wishing they'd stayed home.Meanwhile, there was an epidemic of plummeting pop stars. A giant car Beyoncé was floating in at her concerts tilted too far, almost tipping her into the audience, while a giant mid-air butterfly Katy Perry was sitting on plunged several feet.But it was Lily Allen's West End Girl that became the most talked about album of the year, thanks to its detailed description of the events that led to her divorce from Stranger Things actor David Harbour.Sample lyric, about setting the terms of an open relationship: \"We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don't be shameless / There had to be payment / It had to be with strangers.\"4. Adolescence: A one-shot wonderNetflix/GettyNetflix's series about a schoolboy accused of stabbing a female classmate was one of the biggest TV hits of the year, dominating conversation for weeks. \"Did you know it was all shot in one take?\" said everybody you know. Gosh, was it really? You're the first person to mention that.\"Can you believe this was Owen Cooper's first screen acting role?\" Well, yes actually.   At 15 years old I wasn't expecting a jam-packed IMDb profile.A few months later, the teenager became the youngest male winner of an Emmy Award, and gave an inspirational acceptance speech.\"I was nothing three years ago, I'm here now,\" said Cooper, who was 12 three years ago. \"If you listen, focus and step out of your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life.\"5. Dubai chocolate floods the shelvesGetty ImagesThere have been plenty of food and drink crazes over the years - matcha, bubble tea, cronuts, and the Starbucks olive oil coffee that we're still disappointed didn't really catch on. This year, the pistachio finally got its moment in the spotlight, after a woman with a very specific pregnancy craving turned it into a phenomenon.The decadent chocolate bar and its creamy pistachio filling subsequently went viral on TikTok thanks to its photogenic look and velvety taste, leading to a string of imitators (charging £11 per bar) and a global surge in pistachio demand.6. The endlessly parodied Jet2 advertGetty ImagesDespite being released in 2015, Jess Glynne's Hold My Hand was named TikTok song of the year after a viral trendOne of the most enjoyable trends of the summer, before it inevitably became overdone, was the much-parodied Jet2 advert.You know the one, where the inescapable Jess Glynne song Hold My Hand plays over footage of a family enjoying their holiday, in an ad campaign that has been running since around 1874. Social media users began sending it up by using the music and slogan over scenes of travel chaos instead, such as tourists in hotels binge-drinking, getting sunburn and physically fighting over sun loungers.Other TikTokkers took to the streets to test members of the public on the ad's famous strap line. The trend led to Hold My Hand being named TikTok's song of the year, despite being released in 2015.7. EsDeeKid's video with Timothée ChalametChalamet/EsDeeKid/XAs Banksy will tell you, nothing gets the public (and press) more interested in your work than keeping your identity a secret. There was much speculation, therefore, over EsDeeKid - a Liverpool rapper who shot to fame this year but keeps his face hidden under a balaclava, bandana or mask.Some fans suggested the rapper's eyes - the only visible part of his face - bore a striking resemblance to those of Hollywood A-lister Timothée Chalamet, who played along with the mystique when asked about it in interviews.On his next visit to London, Chalamet broke off from the red carpets and chat show sofas to meet the drill star, and the pair collaborated in a music video filmed outside a Finsbury Park off-licence.8. Labubu mania prompts consumer chaosGetty ImagesIf 2025 had a face, it was undoubtedly made of vinyl, with pointy ears, big eyes and a grin with precisely nine teeth.Created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung and adapted from picture book series The Monsters, the slightly scary-looking Labubu could be seen hanging from everybody's bag this year, with Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Lisa from Blackpink joining in.It's lucky that British people love a queue, as the plush toys prompted long lines around the world. The character's loveable but demonic appearance is said to be matched by its kind-hearted but chaotic personality (same, tbh).9. David Tennant's bonkers Bafta songCamila Cabello was fully on board with David Tennant's Proclaimers tributeHost David Tennant opened this year's Baftas with a barnstorming rendition of I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers - which involved some participation from the A-list crowd.Tennant name-checked Selena Gomez and Hugh Grant as he walked through the audience, but frankly those guys got off lightly compared with what came next.The actor picked on Camila Cabello, Anna Kendrick, Colman Domingo, James McAvoy and Celia Imrie for the call-and-response \"Da da-da!\" bits after the chorus.The facial expressions throughout were priceless. Some were enthusiastically on board, others seemed utterly confused and Jeff Goldblum looked as if he was having the best night of his life. 10. Rachel Zegler's film flop (and theatre triumph)Disney/PA MediaRachel Zegler in Snow White (left) and singing from the London Palladium balcony in EvitaA live action remake of Snow White ran into several controversies ahead of its release in March.Actress Rachel Zegler ruffled a few feathers by criticising the classic original, there were reports of tension between her and co-star Gal Gadot over the conflict in Gaza, and Disney got itself into a right old tangle over what to do about the seven dwarfs. The film bombed. But Zegler took Pitbull's advice and turned a negative into a positive, appearing in a successful West End production of Evita a few months later. A clever stunt which saw her leave the London Palladium stage to perform Don't Cry For Me Argentina from its balcony attracted giant crowds outside. An estimated 130,000 people watched Zegler from the street over the show's run.11. Streaming hits (and misses)Disney/Amazon/HBOL-R: Kim Kardashian in All's Fair, Joe Wilkinson in Last One Laughing, and Aimee Lou Wood in The White LotusAmazon found themselves with a surprise hit on their hands thanks to the first series of Last One Laughing, a reality show about 10 comedians in a house who aren't allowed to laugh at each other.The most viral moment came when Joe Wilkinson was giving a mock-serious speech about the RNLI, only to be pelted with a giant ball of pink paint, for no apparent reason. Glorious.Meanwhile, the third season of wealth satire The White Lotus became one of the most talked about series of the year, and prompted a row over a Saturday Night Live parody that had mocked Aimee Lou Wood's teeth.Kim Kardashian's legal series All's Fair, however, was far less well received with some critics suggesting it \"may be the worst TV drama ever\". But Kardashian made light of the bad reviews by using them to promote the series, which was promptly recommissioned.12. Alan Carr turning into a cold-blooded killer The biggest TV show of the year however, was a triumphant first series of The Celebrity Traitors, and the many viral moments that came with it.Tom Daley's side-eye, Celie Imrie's noisy digestive system, Paloma Faith's early murder, Kate Garraway's theatrics, Joe Marler's \"big dog\" theory and Jonathan Ross's rousing exit speech all contributed to a memorable series.But Alan Carr was the breakout star. We almost feel bad about how much he struggled with being a traitor, but his sweating and discomfort were pure entertainment. Plus, he pulled off an astonishing last-minute win.It led to a career resurgence for Carr, which he was both delighted and miffed about. \"People are going 'Oh, that Alan, isn't he funny?'\" he told Graham Norton. \"I've been on telly for 25 years, I must have been awful!\"13. Adrien Brody's never-ending Oscars speechGetty ImagesBreaking an Oscars record is usually a good thing, but Adrien Brody achieved a dubious honour when he won best actor in February.Accepting the statue for his role in The Brutalist, Brody threw his chewing gum at his girlfriend before delivering an acceptance speech which lasted 5min 40sec - the longest in Academy history. The orchestra tried to play him off, but he waved them off and continued his self-indulgence undeterred. Rumour has it he's still on stage at the Dolby Theatre today.A few weeks later, when presenter Conan O'Brien was confirmed to return in 2026, he joked: \"The only reason I'm hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech.\"14. The celeb-packed Blue Origin space flightEPAKaty Perry and Gayle King were among six women who took an 11-minute flight to space as part of the Blue Origin voyage in April. They flew more than 100km above earth, giving them a few minutes of weightlessness to enjoy Perry's live rendition of What a Wonderful World. But some commentators said it was \"tone deaf\" for celebrities to be taking part in such a fleeting and expensive trip at a time of economic struggle.And there was one fellow singer who made clear she wouldn't be following Perry into orbit...15. Mariah: 'I think I've done enough''Wow': Mariah Carey discovers Katy Perry went into spaceWe'd been aware for a while that Mariah Carey likes to take life at an easy pace these days, as she demonstrated in a less-than-energetic performance at the VMAs in September. But in case there was any doubt, she clarified her feelings about space travel in an interview with BBC Radio 2. The iconic behaviour began when presenter Scott Mills asked her about Perry's trip, and it emerged that the news story hadn't even made it on to Carey's radar (\"Did she go to space?\")Mills followed up by asking whether she would ever flying into orbit herself. In a response that went viral and gave us our new motto for 2026, Carey said simply: \"I think I've done enough.\"",

    "body": "38 minutes agoThe Observer leads with the headline \"War and peace\" in Ukraine, filling their front page with a striking image of a woman carrying a Christmas tree and walking past the rubble of a bombed-out building. A sub-headline updates readers with the latest that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to meet with Donald Trump on Sunday in Florida discuss a new 20-point peace plan agreed by American and Ukrainian envoys.Closer to home, Sir Keir Starmer has welcomed the arrival of British-Egyptian writer and pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah in the UK, the Sunday Telegraph reports. The paper says the prime minister is \"delighted\" that Abdel Fattah has been reunited with his loved ones following his years in jail, including on charges of spreading fake news. But the paper points out that Conservative Robert Jenrick said it was an error of judgement to welcome the arrival of \"the awful extremist\".  Elsewhere, a photo of Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay's wedding is front and centre after the pair got hitched at Bath Abbey.\"Abbey ever after\" is the Sunday Times' take on the Peaty-Ramsay wedding. Alongside, the paper reports that the prime minister nominated a former adviser for peerage despite knowing he had once campaigned for a councillor who had been charged with child sex offences. Matthew Doyle, who was the Downing Street director of communications, left his role in March.Staying with the PM, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has warned Sir Keir is \"in trouble\" and could face a leadership challenge if Labour perform poorly in next year's May elections, according to the Sunday Express. Badenoch added that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has only kept her job because if she is ousted the prime minister will also \"have to go\", the paper says.In royal news, the Mail on Sunday says Prince William is facing backlash from neighbours over a \"ring of steel\" security zone around his family's new home in Windsor. The paper reports locals are feeling \"ambushed\" into accepting the security measures that include fencing with CCTV cameras and numerous no-entry. The paper says the measures have \"cut a gouge\" through Windsor Great Park.A poll conducted by the Sunday Mirror reveals some 64% of Britons are in favour of an Australian-style social media ban for under-16s. The paper quotes Labour MP Joani Reid, who is also chairwoman of the Children's Online Safety Group, who says \"the public is well ahead of the political debate\".In a \"touching tribute\" at Liverpool's Anfield stadium, the late footballer Diogo Jota's young sons joined their dad's teammates and family on the field as mascots before Saturday's match against Wolves. It was the first meeting between Jota's two former teams since his death. The headline \"They'll never walk alone\" is a reference to the club's famous anthem which is always played prior to kick-off.Finally, the Sun leads with the news that ice skating legends Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean will be given a damehood and knighthood in the King's New Year Honours, to be officially announced this week. The pair won gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics and continued to delight fans after they retired as judges, trainers and performers on ITV show Dancing on Ice.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Few things mark the winter season a much as frosty mornings, a sprinkling of snow and the robin, which comes into its own when the weather turns cold. It is one of the UK's most-loved garden birds and along with species like wrens can still be heard singing, external long after some other species go quiet. While other birds focus on looking for food and staying warm in the winter the wren and robin's determination to defend their territory means that they sing all year round warning to others to stay away. Blackbirds and thrushes can also be heard regardless of the chill in the air.Many birds fly south to warmer climates in the winter and some fly in to the UK looking for winter food, external. But those that remain spend their time competing for the scarce resources and trying to survive in the lower temperatures. The robin's song changes with the seasons. In the winter it is softer and less dynamic. But in the spring and summer its song is more lively and intense.This coincides with when it starts looking for a mate which is the reason why most other birds start singing again. The dawn chorus can be heard from late January, with more and more birds joining in, external as the weather gets warmer.The best time to hear it is around 30 minutes before and after sunrise, when birds are most active.Blackbirds and robins are usually the first to sing, external, followed by wrens, thrushes, and warblers as the light increases.You can find the sunrise and sunset times for where you live on the BBC Weather website or app.Still, dry mornings are the best to hear the chorus in all its glory. On a calm, still morning their song will travel further.  Even during a quiet, steady drizzle, most species will sing much as usual.However, Daniel Johnson, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said: \"Birds tend to avoid singing in bad weather conditions. This includes windy, rainy or cloudy conditions as during these times they're usually low down conserving energy.\"So if you notice the birds have fallen silent, it can indicate that bad weather is on the way. Conversely a study carried out by researchers in the USA showed that exposure to high temperatures can also reduce song production, external.For most species once they've mated and their fledglings have left they sing less and focus on surviving the cold months. Scientists believe that the sound of birds singing makes humans feel safe. The soaring melodies are a reassuring sign that all is well in the environment meaning the absence of birdsong can feel unsettling - even if we don't consciously realise why.",

    "body": "The Treasury is set to insure the Bayeux Tapestry against damage for an estimated £800m while it is on loan to the British Museum next year.The 70m-long embroidery depicting the Battle of Hastings in 1066 will travel from France to London as part of a deal between the two nations' governments.The artefact's transit and its time in storage and on display will be covered under the Government Indemnity Scheme (GIS). Indemnity insurance covers situations like loss or damage.A Treasury spokesperson said that, without the long-standing scheme, \"public museums and galleries would face a substantial commercial insurance premium, which would be significantly less cost effective\".There are concerns about the move, as some French art experts have suggested the nearly 1,000-year-old work was in far too a delicate state to be transported - something French officials have denied.It is understood the Treasury has received an initial valuation for covering the Bayeux Tapestry that has been provisionally approved. The loan will not be formally confirmed until it receives the final valuation.That final valuation is estimated to be around £800m, according to the Financial Times, citing unnamed officials. The Treasury did not dispute this figure when approached by the BBC.The Bayeux Tapestry will be displayed in the Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery of the British Museum from next September until July 2027 while its current home, the Bayeux Museum, undergoes renovations. Comprising 58 scenes, 626 characters and 202 horses, the huge masterpiece charts a contested time in Anglo-French relations when William The Conqueror took the English throne from Harold Godwinson, becoming the first Norman king of England.The government's indemnity scheme allows art and cultural objects to be shown publicly in the UK which \"might not have been otherwise because the cost of insurance would have been too high\".  The scheme - first set up in 1980 - has facilitated numerous high-value loans,  including Vincent van Gogh's 1888 work The Bedroom to the National Gallery. The scheme is estimated to save museums and galleries around £81m a year when compared to the cost of taking out commercial insurance.In exchange for the Bayeux Tapestry, the British Museum will loan items to France, including the 7th Century Anglo-Saxon artefacts discovered at the Sutton Hoo burial site in Suffolk and the 12th Century Lewis chess pieces.",

The mistake was only realised after the funeral service and cremation.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde blamed human error and said that the staff involved had been suspended.First reported by the Scottish Sun, the family who thought they were cremating their loved one are said to be inconsolable.The mistake also denied another family the chance to have their relative's remains for a funeral. Dr Scott Davidson, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde medical director, said: \"I would like to offer my sincere apologies to both families affected.\"We have very rigorous processes for the identification and labelling of bodies from arrival in our mortuaries until their release into the care of an undertaker.\"It is of deep regret that these processes have not been adhered to on this occasion, and that as a result two families have been caused significant additional distress at an already very difficult time.\"We launched an immediate investigation into this incident and will ensure that learning is applied.\"'Deeply concerned'The £840m QEUH campus, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children, was hailed as a world leading facility when it opened in 2015.However, it has been dogged by infection outbreaks and concerns around the water and ventilation systems.Such issues are being investigated as part of the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry.The Scottish government said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the cremation incident.A spokesperson said: \"We wish to express our sincere condolences to the families involved with this terrible incident. \"We have been clear with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that they must fully investigate the circumstances. \"We will also carefully consider the findings of the senior inspector of burial, cremation and funeral directors into the circumstances.\"",

    "body": "Italian police have arrested nine people accused of raising around €7m (£6m) for Hamas over more than two years.The money was ostensibly collected as humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, a police statement said, but was instead sent to the militant group via a \"complex fundraising system\".Alongside the arrests, police say they have seized more than €8m (£7m) in assets as part of the investigation. Police say the suspects are \"specifically accused of carrying out financing operations believed to have contributed to terrorist activities\".The arrests were made as part of a joint initiative between Italy's counter-terror police and financial police.The investigation began after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack in southern Israel. Police say they analysed \"a series of reports of suspicious financial transactions\" involving some of the suspects in the lead up to the attack.Investigators uncovered a \"complex\" system of fundraising, which was headquartered in Genoa with branches in Milan, the statement adds.\"The suspects collected donations intended for the civilian population of Gaza, however, it emerged that over 71% of these funds were diverted to Hamas's coffers to finance its military wing and support the families of suicide bombers or those detained for terrorism,\" the police statement says.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the most well-known of the arrested suspects was Mohammad Hannoun, the president of the Palestinian Association in Italy.Mr Hannoun has previously described allegations he is a financier of Hamas as a \"lie\". Piantedosi thanked police for their work in a post on X, but also noted that \"the presumption of innocence... must always be recognised at this stage\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandAlex KleidermanThe UK is to impose visa restrictions against people arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo after its government failed to agree to measures allowing the return of illegal migrants and foreign national offenders. Ministers say the DRC has not made changes required under the toughening up of the UK's asylum rules announced in November.Fast-track visa processes will no longer apply to people from the country, while the Home Office said VIPs and politicians would no longer get preferential treatment when coming to the UK.Meanwhile, the Home Office said Angola and Namibia had agreed to step up efforts to take back their citizens, having been threatened with sanctions alongside the DRC.A government source said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood would not hesitate to ban visas for other countries refusing to take citizens back.The Home Office said Angola and Namibia agreeing to improve their processes marked the \"first delivery success from last month's asylum reforms\".The government had warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo if their governments did not rapidly improve co-operation on removals.A Home Office source said the agreements could see thousands of people removed and deported.Under the government's changes to the UK's asylum system, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped \"safe and legal routes\" into the UK will be created.Announcing the changes last month, Mahmood had warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with the returns policies, including an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto.It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".It said there had been some engagement by the DRC but \"unless co-operation rapidly improves\" further measures could be imposed, including the possibility of a complete visa ban on people from the country coming to the UK.Home Secretary Mahmood said: \"We expect countries to play by the rules. If one of their citizens has no right to be here, they must take them back.\"I thank Angola and Namibia and welcome their co-operation. Now is the time for the Democratic Republic of Congo to do the right thing. Take your citizens back or lose the privilege of entering our country.\"",

    "body": "The head of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC has demanded $1m (£740,000) in damages from a musician who cancelled a concert after President Donald Trump's name was added to the venue.Chuck Redd called off his Christmas Eve performance, which he has hosted annually since 2006, citing a vote by the board to rename the site the Trump Kennedy Center.In his letter, Richard Grenell, said the cancellation was a \"political stunt\" and \"has cost us considerably\". Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired several of the board members, and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board. Grenell, the Trump Kennedy Center president, wrote in his letter to Redd that his no-show \"is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution\".He added: \"Your dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support, combined with your last-minute cancellation has cost us considerably. \"This is your official notice that we will seek $1 million in damages from you for this political stunt.\"Last week, the White House announced the centre's board had voted unanimously to rename the cultural institution as The Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.A day later, crews could be seen etching the president's name on the building's façade. Its website and some social media accounts were also renamed.The White House said the renaming effort was in recognition of Trump's actions to renovate the building, but the move was criticised by Democrats, several artists and members of the Kennedy family. \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player, told the Associated Press news agency earlier this week.Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, recently filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name from the centre.She argued in her lawsuit that because the centre was named in a 1964 law, changing its name should require \"an act of Congress\".The lawsuit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change, but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. She is one of several lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. Work on a national performing arts centre began in the 1950s and after Kennedy, the 35th president, was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to turn it into a living memorial to him.",

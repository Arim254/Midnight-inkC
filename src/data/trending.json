    "body": "1 day agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Where does Old Trafford thriller rank among best Premier League games?Media caption, Kroupi levels for Bournemouth in eight-goal thriller against Man UtdWhen it comes to the greatest Premier League game ever, where do you even start?Manchester United and Bournemouth served up an eight-goal thriller on Monday, which former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher described as the \"best game\" so far this season in the English top flight.  Speaking on Sky Sports, Carragher said: \"That's what makes the Premier League the greatest product in the world. \"For the majority of that Manchester United were absolutely fantastic. Bournemouth were not at the races at all in the first half but they were fantastic in the second half. What a game. Brilliant.\"I think we have just seen the best game of the Premier League season so far.\" The Red Devils famously played out a 5-5 draw at West Brom in Sir Alex Ferguson's final match in charge of the club in 2013. And United's 4-4 draw against the Cherries was the 17th time the scoreline has occurred in the Premier League era. But where does Monday's match rank among some of the other remarkable contests we have seen down the years?Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle (3 April 1996)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This result played a major factor in the outcome of the title race eventually won by Manchester UnitedHaving blown a 10-point lead at the top of the table, Newcastle's title hopes suffered a major blow as they lost a classic in stoppage time at Anfield despite having led twice. \"Collymore closing in...\"Man City 3-2 QPR (13 May 2012)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sergio Aguero's late winner delivered the most dramatic end to a Premier League title raceIn an extraordinary conclusion to the 2011-12 campaign, Manchester City scored twice in stoppage time to beat Queens Park Rangers on the final day and win their first title in 44 years.Sergio Aguero's famous late winner ensured City pipped rivals Manchester United, who had already won that day, to the trophy on goal difference.Liverpool 4-4 Arsenal (21 April 2009)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Andrey Arshavin enjoyed his finest night in an Arsenal shirt at AnfieldOn another remarkable evening at Anfield, Arsenal's Andrey Arshavin produced a stunning individual display - netting all four goals for the Gunners to deliver a serious blow to Liverpool's title ambitions.Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal (5 February 2011)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cheick Tiote scored a sensational late equaliser for NewcastleArsenal were 4-0 up at and cruising at half-time as they looked to chase down league leaders Manchester United. However, Abou Diaby was then sent off for the Gunners as Newcastle produced a stunning comeback to earn an improbable draw - with Cheick Tiote's thumping 87th-minute strike clinching the point.Newcastle 5-0 Man Utd (20 October 1996)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Philippe Albert (right) scored a superb chip to round off Newcastle's 5-0 win With Manchester United having beaten Newcastle to the title the previous season, this felt like payback for Kevin Keegan and his players, who had also suffered a 4-0 reverse to Sir Alex Ferguson's side at Wembley in the Charity Shield just weeks earlier.Tottenham 3-5 Man Utd (29 September 2001)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, David Beckham scored Manchester United's fifth goalManchester United staged a magnificent comeback from 3-0 down at the break to overwhelm Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Dean Richards, Les Ferdinand and Christian Ziege all scored for the hosts but a transformed United hit back through Andy Cole, Laurent Blanc, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastian Veron and David Beckham.Man Utd 4-3 Man City (21 September 2009)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Michael Owen provided the decisive moment for the hosts late onMichael Owen's winner deep into stoppage time gave Manchester United a dramatic victory in a classic derby at Old Trafford.The moment prompted Ferguson to set off on an impromptu wild dance along the touchline, while City boss Mark Hughes - whose side had come from behind three times - questioned why the game had gone on for six added minutes rather than the four allocated.Leeds 4-3 Liverpool (4 November 2000)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mark Viduka scored all four goals for LeedsLiverpool had gone 2-0 up early on with goals from Sami Hyypia and Christian Ziege, but Mark Viduka scored either side of half-time to drag Leeds level.Vladimir Smicer restored Liverpool's advantage, before two goals in three minutes from former Celtic forward Viduka secured an incredible win for the hosts.Crystal Palace 3-3 Liverpool (5 May 2014)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Crystal Palace's late show had huge implications in the title raceTitle-chasing Liverpool had just lost to Chelsea at Anfield, but looked set to power themselves back into the race when they took a commanding 3-0 lead at Selhurst Park.But they squandered that advantage in a chaotic final 11 minutes, leaving Luis Suarez in tears at the final whistle. Man City went on to win the league by two points. Arsenal 3-2 Man Utd (9 November 1997)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This was another Arsenal v Manchester United match packed with incidentA tight pitch, a packed Highbury and another compelling contest between two of English football's heavyweights. The Gunners went two goals up courtesy of Nicolas Anelka and Patrick Vieira only for the champions to draw level thanks to two Teddy Sheringham efforts. But in a season when Arsene Wenger's side were to wrestle the title away from Manchester, David Platt scored the winner. Everton 3-2 Wimbledon (7 May 1994)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Everton have not been relegated from the top flight since 1950-51Everton are one of only six sides that have never been relegated from the Premier League, but they were on the brink at 2-0 down to Wimbledon in the first 20 minutes of the final day of the 1993-94 season.However, a Graham Stuart double helped the Toffees preserve their stay in the top division, with his winner coming in the 81st minute, which kick-started jubilant scenes at Goodison Park.Arsenal 2-4 Man Utd (1 February 2005)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, There were fireworks in the Highbury tunnel before play even got under wayMost people will remember this game because of the fiery exchange between captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane in the tunnel before the game, but the 90 minutes itself were just as thrilling.Vieira opened the scoring for Arsenal before they were pegged back by an Ashley Cole own goal. Another Gunners legend, Dennis Bergkamp, helped the hosts retake the lead before two goals from a young Cristiano Ronaldo and a delightful John O'Shea chip stunned Arsene Wenger's side.Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham (2 May 2016)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chelsea supporters enjoyed dashing the title hopes of their London rivals TottenhamA match that meant most for a side that wasn't involved - the day that Leicester City were crowned champions will go down in footballing history.Two first-half goals from Harry Kane and Heung-min Son gave Tottenham hope of chasing the Foxes down at the business end of the season. But Gary Cahill and Eden Hazard scored to get Jamie Vardy and his Leicester team-mates' party started as tempers flared in the second half of a match dubbed the 'Battle of the Bridge'.Man Utd v Bournemouth (15 December 2025)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eli Junior Kroupi's goal rounded off a thrilling evening at Old TraffordManchester United and Bournemouth played out the latest Premier League classic at Old Trafford. The hosts led three times and thought they had won the game when they scored twice in 129 seconds to turn a 3-2 deficit into a 4-3 advantage. But Eli Junior Kroupi's strike in the 84th minute pegged Ruben Amorim's side back once again as both sides had to settle for a share of the spoils.",

    "body": "More UK families will \"know what sacrifice for our nation means\" as the nation seeks to deter a potential confrontation with Russia, the head of the military has said.Sir Richard Knighton said the country's security \"cannot be outsourced to the armed forces\" and \"requires a whole-of-society response\", including harnessing UK universities and manufacturing.While the chief of the defence staff suggested there was only a remote chance of Russia directly attacking the UK, he told an event at the Royal United Services Institute that so-called hybrid attacks showed the threat was worsening.He referenced a Russian spy ship that was recently suspected of mapping undersea cables near UK waters.\"Every day the UK is subject to an onslaught of cyber-attacks from Russia and we know that Russian agents are seeking to conduct sabotage and have killed on our shores,\" he added.At the same time, Russia's military had become a \"hard power [which] is growing quickly\".While Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine had been a strategic failure, he said, \"we should be under no illusions that Russia has a massive, increasingly technically sophisticated, and now highly combat-experienced military\".Sir Richard said the UK needed to make itself a \"harder target\" for hybrid threats and to avoid war.Building the nation's resilience went beyond strengthening the military and \"more people being ready to fight for their country\", and included harnessing the UK's universities, energy and manufacturing industries, and the NHS.It also meant building industrial capacity \"to meet the demands in the UK and of our allies to re-stock and re-arm\".\"Building this industrial capacity also means we need more people who leave schools and universities to join that industry.\"He added that \"we need defence and political leaders to explain the importance of the industry to the nation, and we need schools and parents to encourage children and young adults to take up careers in the industry\".Addressing a skills gap highlighted in a recent report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, Sir Richard also talked about the need to work with industry and young people, announcing £50m for new defence technical excellence colleges.In recent weeks, both France and Germany have outlined plans for voluntary national service.Last year, the then-Conservative government set out its own compulsory proposals, which Labour dismissed as a gimmick.Sir Richard, who became chief of the defence staff in September, said he found himself in a position none of his predecessors had: \"looking at the prospect of the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War\".The government announced earlier this year that UK defence and security spending would rise to 5% of GDP by 2035 at the latest.\"Sons and daughters, colleagues, veterans will all have a role to play - to build, to serve, and if necessary, to fight,\" Sir Richard said. \"And more families will know what sacrifice for our nation means.\"That is why it's so important we do explain the changing threat and the need to stay ahead of it.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentThe new MI6 chief has said \"we are now operating in a space between peace and war\" as she laid out the \"interlocking web of security challenges\" that the service is working to tackle.Blaise Metreweli's first public speech since taking the role focused on the multi-faceted threat posed by Russia, which she said was \"testing us in the grey zone with tactics that are just below the threshold of war\".She also highlighted the \"the menace of an aggressive, expansionist and revisionist Russia\" while referring to the war in Ukraine, insisting the UK would maintain pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine's behalf.Ms Metreweli is the first woman to head Britain's overseas spy agency.She took over as head of the Secret Intelligence Service from Sir Richard Moore on 1 October.Ms Metreweli used her speech on Monday to point to instances of drones appearing over airports and airbases, and cyber-attacks on infrastructure as being among examples of Russia's so-called hybrid warfare and grey-zone tactics. \"It's important to understand their attempts to bully, fearmonger and manipulate, because it affects us all,\" she said.Referencing the recent sanctioning of Russian entities accused of conducting information warfare, Ms Metreweli noted: \"The export of chaos is a feature not a bug in this Russian approach to international engagement.\"Western sanctions have certainly damaged Russia's economy, driving its exports eastwards towards China and India. But they have singularly failed to change Putin's determination to wage war on Ukraine until it gives in to his demands for territory and, ultimately, loyalty to Moscow.Meanwhile, Ms Metriweli described \"the defining challenge of the 21st century\" as \"not simply who wields the most powerful technologies, but who guides them with the greatest wisdom\".\"Power itself is becoming more diffuse, more unpredictable as control over these technologies is shifting from states to corporations, and sometimes to individuals,\" she said.Responding to the threat Russia poses would involve infusing technology and an understanding of technology into everything MI6 does, she said, while making clear that a special area of interest is learning new technologies.Having joined MI6 in 1999, she has arrived at the top job via Q Branch. Named after the fictional MI6 division in Ian Fleming's spy books, this is the real life, in-house, top secret part of the Secret Intelligence Service that designs the sorts of gadgets and gizmos that enable agents to communicate with their handlers, without being detected and caught.Ms Metriweli called on all her intelligence officers to master technology, \"not just in our labs, but in the field, in our tradecraft... \"We will become as comfortable with lines of [computer] code as we are with human sources, as fluent in Python as we are in multiple languages.\"Python, a programming language, may surprise some as an example to pick, since it has been around for more than three decades. But her point will not be lost on the men and women who have chosen to work in the shadowy world of espionage.In an age where data is key, where spies can no longer rely on false identities when biometric scanning can unmask them in seconds at borders and checkpoints, MI6 needs to prove that it can still be relevant.",

    "body": "9 hours agoChristina McSorleyPolitical producer The government is considering a draft definition of anti-Muslim hatred which does not include the term \"Islamophobia\".The BBC has seen the form of words from the Islamophobia/Anti-Muslim hatred working group, which the government has taken to stakeholders for consultation.Free speech campaigners have expressed concerns that protections for \"Islamophobia\" would mean it would not be possible to criticise the religion itself.Members of the working group argue the definition protects individuals while avoiding overreach.A working group was established in February to provide the government with a working definition of anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia.They submitted their proposal to the government in October.The definition will be non-statutory, meaning it is not set in law or legally binding,  but will provide a form of words public bodies can adopt.It provides guidance to the government and other bodies on what constitutes unacceptable treatment of Muslims, aiming to help them better understand and quantify prejudice and hate crimes against this group.The draft definition is: \"Anti-Muslim hostility is engaging in or encouraging criminal acts, including acts of violence, vandalism of property, and harassment and intimidation whether physical, verbal, written or electronically communicated, which is directed at Muslims or those perceived to be Muslims because of their religion, ethnicity or appearance.\"It is also the prejudicial stereotyping and racialisation of Muslims, as part of a collective group with set characteristics, to stir up hatred against them, irrespective of their actual opinions, beliefs or actions as individuals.\"It is engaging in prohibited discrimination where the relevant conduct – including the creation or use of practices and biases within institutions - is intended to disadvantage Muslims in public and economic life.\"The working group met last week to consider changes from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.The BBC understands one area of debate is around the use of the word \"racialisation\" in the definition.Baroness Gohir, who sits on the working group, said their submission achieves \"the right balance\" by \"safeguarding individuals while avoiding overreach\".\"The definition also recognises that Muslims are frequently targeted not only for their beliefs but also because of their appearance, race, ethnicity, or other characteristics,\" she said.\"Including the element of racialisation validates these lived experiences.\"The Free Speech Union is concerned that any definition of anti-Muslim hatred could infringe on free speech and possibly introduce a blasphemy law through the back door.Conservative peer Lord Toby Young, the campaign group's director, said: \"The definition is unnecessary because it's already a criminal offence to stir up religious hatred and unlawful for employers or service providers to discriminate against people on the basis of their religion or belief. \"Granting Muslims additional protections not extended to people of other faiths will have the effect of increasing anti-Muslim hostility, not reducing it.\"Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who chairs the working group, is adamant the form of words does not remove the right to free speech.Mr Grieve said: \"The review done by the working group is within a framework that makes it clear that no definition of anti-Muslim hatred should have an adverse impact on freedom of expression under law including the right to criticise Islam and its practices. \"The working group has been mindful of this at all times in the advice it is giving to government.\"A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said they do not comment on leaks.\"With all hate crime on the rise and anti-Muslim hate incidents at a record high, we are tackling hatred and extremism wherever it may occur,\" the spokesperson said.\"We will always defend freedom of speech, this remains at the front of our minds as we carefully consider the recommendations.\"There was a 19% increase in religious hate crimes targeted at Muslims last year, with a spike after the Southport murders and riots that followed last summer, according to Home Office figures. Labour had promised to introduce a new definition of Islamophobia, after the last Conservative government rejected a cross-party proposal in 2019.The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims had defined Islamophobia as \"rooted in racism\" and \"a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness\".Critics had argued this definition was too vague and could inhibit freedom of speech.The new draft definition being considered by the government differs from this previous proposal, which was adopted by the Labour Party in 2019 when it was in opposition.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThis week's five-day doctor strike in England will go ahead despite a new offer from the government.The British Medical Association said 83% of its members had voted to continue with the walkout in an online poll over the weekend, with a turnout of 65%. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"gutted\" by the result, describing it as \"irresponsible\" given the rising pressure from flu.The union agreed to the snap poll last week after the government came forward with a fresh deal which included increasing speciality training posts and covering out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.The strike by resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, is due to start at 07:00 on Wednesday.Sir Keir, who was appearing in front of MPs on the Liaison Committee, said: \"It's irresponsible at any time, particularly at the moment.\"It comes on the back of a very substantial pay increase in the last year or so.\"There's a deal that we've put on the table that could have been taken forward, and so I think it's irresponsible action by the BMA, and not for the first time.\"The offer did not include any promises on pay – Health Secretary Wes Streeting has maintained he will not negotiate on that after resident doctors pay has been increased by nearly 30% in the past three years.The BMA argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Streeting said the pay demands were \"fantasy\".And he added: \"The BMA has chosen Christmas strikes to inflict damage on the NHS at the moment of maximum danger. These strikes are self-indulgent, irresponsible and dangerous.\"He said he hoped resident doctors would still go to work, saying there was a different magnitude of risk striking at this moment.Flu pressuresData shows the number of patients in hospital with flu had risen by more than 50% in a week, topping 2,600 in the first week of December, with officials warning there is still no sign of it peaking yet.Flu came early this winter, and it looks to be a particularly nasty season.The strain that is circulating is H3N2, which tends to cause more severe illness, and it has mutated somewhat with fears people may have less immunity.This will be the 14th strike in the long-running dispute which began in March 2023.Resident doctors, which represent nearly half the medical workforce, will walk out of both emergency and non-urgent care. Senior doctors will be drafted in to provide cover.BMA resident doctor leader Dr Jack Fletcher said the \"resounding response\" should leave the health secretary in no doubt about how badly he has just fumbled his opportunity to end industrial action. \"Tens of thousands of front-line doctors have come together to say 'no' to what is clearly too little, too late,\" he added.He said any solution had to address pay.But he added the union was \"committed to ensuring patient safety\" and would be in close contact with NHS England throughout the strike to address concerns as they arise.Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said: \"It's bitterly disappointing that the BMA has rejected this offer and chosen to continue with hugely disruptive strikes. \"These strikes come at the worst possible time, with rapidly rising flu levels putting huge strain on hospitals.\"If BMA members had instead voted not to continue with this week's strike, that would have then triggered a new survey on the actual deal that the government had put forward last week.Only if they voted in favour of that deal would the dispute have ended.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMadeline HalpertandRegan Morris,Los AngelesGetty ImagesThe couple were found dead in their home with multiple stab wounds, according to the BBC's US partner CBS NewsA son of film director Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner has been arrested and booked on suspicion of murder after the couple were found dead in their Los Angeles home. The Los Angeles Police Department said on Monday that Nick Reiner, 32, had been arrested and that he was in custody with no bail. The deceased couple's 28-year-old daughter, Romy, found her parents in their home with multiple stab wounds on Sunday, sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News.Rob Reiner is known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including When Harry Met Sally, This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.Emergency services were called to provide medical aid at the Reiners' Brentwood, California, home at around 15:38 local time (23:38 GMT) on Sunday. The Los Angeles Fire Department said two people - later identified as Rob Reiner, 78, and his wife Michele, 68 - were pronounced dead at the scene.Police said Nick Reiner was arrested several hours later, at about 21:15 local time on Sunday. Investigators have not publicly outlined a motive and said the investigation remains ongoing.Watch: \"Lucky\" to have parents that \"care about me\", says Nick Reiner in 2015 interviewNick Reiner has spoken publicly about his struggles with addiction and homelessness. His experiences formed the basis of the semi-autobiographical film Being Charlie, which he made with his father in 2015.The family's home is in Brentwood, a wealthy celebrity enclave full of large mansions, boutique shops and restaurants. On Monday morning, a security guard stood outside the home as media gathered outside the front gate.Rob Reiner, the son of comedy great Carl Reiner, began his career in the 1960s and rose to fame playing Meathead in the TV sitcom All in The Family.He cemented his success with the cult mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap in 1984, which he directed and starred in. Reiner was married to Laverne & Shirley actress Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981 and is the adoptive father to Marshall's daughter, actress Tracy Reiner.He married Michele Reiner in 1989, who he said he met during the making of the romantic comedy-drama film When Harry Met Sally. The couple have three children together.Getty ImagesRob Reiner and his family, including son Nick (fourth from left) attend a movie premiere Michele Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.Rob Reiner was also known for his outspoken political activism and support for Democratic candidates. In a post calling their deaths \"very sad\", President Donald Trump criticised Reiner, saying that they \"reportedly\" died \"due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction\" with \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\".\"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump,\" the president wrote.It is not clear what reports the president was referring to, and while the investigation is being treated as a homicide, police have yet to comment on any possible motive. The president and his allies often used the term Trump Derangement Syndrome in reference to those who are critical of him. Reiner was a vocal critic of Trump's. Several Republicans criticised Trump over the post, including former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said the deaths were a \"family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\". \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder,\" she said. \"These go to 11\" - watch Rob Reiner in the amplifier scene from This is Spinal Tap, one of the films he directedTrump's post was also met with anger by some of the Reiners' friends.In a post on X, Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California and longtime friend of the Reiners, said the couple were \"devoted parents\". \"They deeply loved all their children and they never gave up trying to care for them,\" she said. Sir Elton John, who made an appearance in this year's Spinal Tap sequel, said: \"I am in disbelief at today's news of Rob and Michele.\"They were two of the most beautiful people I'd ever met and they deserved better.\"Fellow actor John Cusack, who appeared in Reiner's 1985 film The Sure Thing, called him \"a great man\", while Elijah Wood, who starred in 1994's North, said he was \"horrified\" by the couple's deaths.",

He was shot multiple times and has since undergone surgery for his wounds.His father told BBC Arabic: \"Ahmed was driven by his sentiment, conscience and humanity.\"The fruit shop owner and father of two has been hailed as a hero for intervening in the shooting, which killed 15 people and left dozens injured at an event to celebrate Hanukkah on Sunday.Mr Ahmed was meeting a friend for coffee in the area when the attack unfolded, his father said.His son did not hesitate to intervene and \"rushed forward, stopped the gunman, and snatched his weapon\".The family said they felt immense pride in Mr Ahmed, who was now in a stable condition and awaiting further treatment for wounds to his shoulder and hand.Speaking from Syria, where Mr Ahmed was born and raised, his uncle remarked: \"He made us proud - our village, Syria, all Muslims and the entire world.\"Chris Minns/FacebookChris Minns met Mr Ahmed after the attack and said it had been an \"honour\" to thank himNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns shared a picture of himself and Mr Ahmed late on Monday and described him as a \"real-life hero\".\"His incredible bravery no doubt saved countless lives when he disarmed a terrorist at enormous personal risk,\" he wrote on Facebook.He said it had been an honour to spend time with Mr Ahmed and \"to pass on the thanks of people across NSW\".\"There is no doubt that more lives would have been lost if not for Ahmed's selfless courage.\"Meanwhile, a US billionaire donated A$99,999 (US$ 65,000; £49,000) to Mr Ahmed, calling him a \"brave hero\".William Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, made the top donation to a GoFundMe for Mr Ahmed, which had raised more than $1m by late Monday.Mr Ahmed managed to wrest the gun from the attacker in the struggle The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention was shared widely online.It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of sight.Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker and tackling him.He manages to wrest the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker begins to retreat back to the bridge.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.The same attacker is later seen on the bridge picking up another weapon and firing again.Another gunman also continues firing from the bridge. It is unclear who or what they are aiming at.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday: \"We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.\"These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.\"Speaking at a White House Christmas reception, US President Donald Trump also praised Mr Ahmed, saying he had \"great respect\" for him. \"It's been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,\" he said.

    "body": "12 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, SantiagoReutersSupporters of José Antonio Kast celebrated his victoryChile is perceived by many of its neighbours in the Latin American region as a safer, more stable haven. But inside the country, that perception has unravelled as voters worried about security, immigration and crime chose José Antonio Kast to be their next president.Kast is a hardline conservative who has praised General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former right-wing dictator whose US-backed coup ushered in 17 years of military rule marked by torture, disappearances and censorship.To his critics, Kast's family history, including his German-born father's membership in the Nazi Party and his brother's time as a minister under Pinochet, is unsettling. However, some of Kast's supporters openly defend Pinochet's rule, arguing that Chile was more peaceful then.In a nod to Chile's past and to accusations levelled at other right-wing leaders in the region after they imposed military crackdowns on organised crime, the 59-year-old pledged in his first speech as president-elect that his promise to lead an \"emergency government\" would not mean \"authoritarianism\". Sunday's election makes Chile the latest country in Latin America to decisively swing from the left to the right, following Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama. Peru, Colombia and Brazil face pivotal elections next year.Kast's victory places Chile within a growing bloc of conservative governments likely to align with US President Donald Trump, particularly on migration and security.In some cases, like that of Argentina, inflation and economic crisis drove the shift. In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting. In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela. The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.\"Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,\" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign. He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.\"What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,\" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced \"the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security\".Jeremías Alonso supported José Antonio Kast in the electionKast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity. Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an \"iron fist\" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult. Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited. Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.Gabriel, who is from Venezuela, felt hurt by comments diners made about migrantsFor irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.Gabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country's \"very, very bad economic situation\".He has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request. His salary is currently being paid into a friend's bank account. \"I'm basically a ghost here,\" he says.While he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.\"Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He's validating it,\" he said.He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.\"It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.\"He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants. With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business. Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries. Carlos Alberto Cossio says migrant workers are key to his businessHe says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that \"the migrant workforce is very important\".He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.\"Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,\" he adds. Expelling unregistered workers \"will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,\" he warns.Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.\"Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,\" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.But for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.",

    "body": "21 minutes agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos deal\"Do not give away Diego Garcia,\" US President Donald Trump has said as he criticised the UK's plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the U.K.\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. This comes despite Washington on Tuesday giving its official backing to London's plan to cede sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius. The BBC has approached the Foreign Office for comment. Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used by the UK and US armed forces.Under the plan, the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years.Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealPosting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia... in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.In a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJake Horton,Ghoncheh HabibiazadandSarah JalaliBBCCrowds of mourners appear to have been fired on by a security official at a cemetery in Iran.The incident happened in Abdanan, in west Iran, on Tuesday as people gathered to commemorate those killed during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters last month.Iranians usually hold commemoration ceremonies on the 40th day after someone dies. The events have been held in several cities across the country to mourn the thousands killed during the deadliest nights of protests on 8 and 9 January.Verified video also shows people shouting anti-government chants at events in Tehran, Mashhad and Abdanan on Tuesday as crowds gathered at cemeteries and in the streets for commemorations.State-organised ceremonies were broadcast on TV and attended by senior government and military officials where people were led by organisers to chant \"death to America\".BBC Verify and BBC Persian have verified footage of people chanting \"death to Khamenei\", referencing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An armoured vehicle is then seen driving past the crowd of mourners as an apparent security official opens fire. People are heard screaming and seen fleeing the area as two gunshots ring out.The person who appears to be in uniform is seen pointing the gun away from the camera when the first shot is fired, before pointing the gun towards the crowd when a second shot can be heard. A puff of smoke near the gun is visible after each shot.Another verified video from the cemetery shows smoke in the distance as people run away from the scene and several gunshots can be heard.State-run IRIB News claimed that the event was peaceful and reports of people injured or killed were not true.XA billboard in the background of one the videos shows a picture of Alireza Seydi, a teenager from Abdanan who was understood to have been killed during the protests in Tehran last month and appears to be one of those commemorated during the ceremony.Weeks of anti-government protests started in late December which began over the economy but rapidly escalated. It peaked on 8 and 9 January after Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, called for nationwide protests to take place. Thousands of people were killed in one of the deadliest government crackdowns in recent years. BBC Verify previously reported that it had spread to more than 68 towns and cities across the country.Khamenei last month acknowledged that thousands had been killed during the protests and blamed the US for the deaths.Additional reporting by Daniele Palumbo and Shayan Sardarizadeh",

    "body": "4 hours agoRobert GreenallGetty ImagesSpanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.He was detained while staying at a Madrid hotel, where he was accused of racking up charges of more than €20,000 during several stays.Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system, and was the first of its kind to be detected.Their investigation began after suspicious activity was reported by a travel booking site. It took just four days to complete - the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyber attack, getting the system to authorise his transaction after entering only one cent as the charged amount.Police said that the transaction had at first appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount - €0.01 - to the hotel company.Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His latest stay there was for four nights, normally costing €4,000. They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.The police statement appears to suggest that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were given.ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.",

    "body": "Just nowNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesA shortage in medical cement is likely to lead to delays in some patients getting joint surgery, NHS bosses say.It comes after Heraeus Medical, the main supplier of bone cement to the health service, has had to temporarily halt production at its main site for two months.The German firm supplies about three-quarters of the bone cement needed in the NHS. The product is used in more than 1,000 operations a week, mostly in knee replacements, but also in some hip and shoulder replacements.Hospitals are being told to prioritise emergency patients ahead of those on the waiting list.These are likely to be older patients who have suffered falls and those with broken hips.Currently there are 850,000 patients on the waiting list in England requiring planned treatment to their joints – the largest of any speciality.Guidance from NHS England calls on hospitals to focus on providing care to those in the most pain or with the most complex conditions.Hospitals have about two weeks supply of bone cement in stock.NHS England and counterparts in the rest of the UK are seeking to increase supplies from four other manufacturers that supply the NHS.Patients are being told to assume their appointments and treatments will go-ahead,  unless they are told otherwise.'Crushing blow'Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Arthritis UK, said: \"This is a crushing blow for those individuals who have finally made it to the front of the orthopaedic surgery queue after a long time waiting.\"We urge hospitals to communicate quickly with those affected to avoid additional worry and uncertainty.\"Aside from the personal toll on people with arthritis, the stakes are high for government who have an uphill challenge to bring down waiting lists to meet ambitious targets.\"In a letter to its customers, Heraeus Medical said it had experienced a critical machine failure at its main site when it was in the process of upgrading its production processes.A spokesman for the firm added: \"The wellbeing of our patients and the satisfaction of our customers are top priorities. We deeply regret that there are currently delivery delays affecting our medical bone cements.\"An NHS England spokesman said the problem was affecting supply globally.\"The NHS is issuing immediate guidance to hospitals to ensure trauma and urgent care can safely continue and to support prioritisation of waiting lists based on patients' needs over the coming weeks.\"Fergal Monsell, of the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA), which represents joint surgeons, said his organisation was working with NHS bosses to limit the impact on patients.He said it was likely hospitals would start using surgeons and theatres more to carry out operations that do not require bone cement.\"The BOA will update surgeons with developments so they can treat their patients as the situation develops,\" he added.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAdam EleyBBC NewsGetty ImagesA Supreme Court ruling is likely to lead to significantly higher damages being awarded to children injured by medical negligence.Until now, children have only been entitled to compensation for lost earnings – pay missed out on by not being able to work – for the years they are expected to live.But the court, ruling on the case of a child who sustained a brain injury at birth, found that compensation should take into account the full working life she would have had if she had not been harmed at birth.The decision could have large cost implications for the NHS. Its clinical negligence liabilities currently stand at £60bn, with two-thirds relating to maternity injuries.The child at the centre of this case, born in 2015 at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, is not being named.During labour, monitoring indicated that her heartbeat was abnormal, but this was not acted on.She was born with signs of oxygen deprivation, required resuscitation and later scans confirmed a severe hypoxic brain injury.The Trust admitted failures in her care. The girl has severe cerebral palsy, is unable to walk or talk, has severe visual impairment and epilepsy, and requires continuous 24-hour care.In 2023, the High Court awarded a lump sum of £6,866,615 and an additional payment of £394,940 per year, linked to inflation. This was to cover the cost of her care needs and for loss of earnings up to the age of 29, her life expectancy.Wednesday's Supreme Court verdict, by a majority, has ruled that compensation should take into account her entire loss of earnings and pension for a full working life.It said that the Trust and the family's lawyers were agreed that had the girl not been injured, she would have enjoyed a normal life expectancy, obtained GCSEs, worked until aged 68 and received a pension.The additional damages will now be decided on at a later date - lawyers for the family claim it amounts to more than £800,000.Family 'elated'The girl's mother said in a statement that she felt \"elated that my little girl has changed the law and that this will help lots of other children who have been injured through no fault of their own\". The ruling brings the law in cases involving children into line with adolescents and adults that have suffered life-shortening injuries, who were already able to claim for 'lost years'.The court found there was \"no basis in law\" for injured children to have their claims treated differently.Around 250 cases of brain injuries in childbirth are reported to the NHS in England annually.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative MP and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the NHS must do more to resolve cases through mediation.\"Very often... what people who have been wronged by the NHS want is a simple explanation and an apology, and their cases considered properly by the complaints procedure,\" he said.When cases instead end up in court, he added, they can take years, be stressful for families and lead to significant legal fees for the NHS - money which would be better spent providing care.The NHS must also \"seriously learn lessons,\" Sir Geoffrey said, to reduce instances of clinical negligence happening in the first place, which cause \"devastation\" for a child and their family.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJoe Pike,Political correspondentandBrian Wheeler,Political reporterGetty ImagesMinisters are considering slowing down plans to pay adults of all ages the same minimum wage.Labour committed in their election manifesto to remove \"discretionary age bands\" and increase the wages of 18 to 20-year-olds so they are paid the same as those over 21.But government sources have confirmed ministers are interested in delaying that rise, though are unlikely to reverse the commitment entirely.Some business leaders say minimum wage increases are making it too expensive for them to hire young people - but unions say it is unfair that the young can be paid less for doing the same job as older people.The government has already made a start on ending the gap between minimum pay for younger and older workers.The hourly for rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will rise by 85p to £10.85 in April, with under-18s and apprentices getting 45p more to £8 an hour. That comes on top of 16.3% rise for 18 to 20-year-olds in 2024.The minimum wage for those aged 21 and over has been rising at a slower rate and is due to go up by 50p to £12.71 an hour in April.That leaves a gap of £1.86 an hour between younger and older workers, which the government has committed to closing before the next election in 2029.The Times newspaper first reported that ministers were weighing up whether to drop the pledge.Chancellor Rachel Reeves did not deny that the process could now be delayed when asked about it on a visit to a supermarket in south London.She said: \"We already have incentives to hire young people with the apprenticeship rate of the minimum wage, but also for no national insurance contributions for the youngest workers.\"But we do recognise there are challenges and that is why we're extending the number of further education college places, extending the number of apprenticeship places to help young people get the skills and the experience that they need to move into work.\"At an event in south Wales, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"We've made commitments to young people in our manifesto, and we will keep to those commitments, including the commitment that we would make sure that the living wage would go up this April, which I can absolutely confirm to you will happen.\"On Tuesday, it was confirmed unemployment had risen to a near five-year high, with the jobless rate among young people at its worst level for more than a decade.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment rose to 5.2% in the three months to December, up from 5.1% in the three months to November.Luke Johnson, the former chairman of Pizza Express and a director of Gail's bakery and Brompton Bicycles, said: \"The government is making it more expensive and more risky to employ people and so I think entrepreneurs and managers will not create the jobs.\"He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The mood amongst employers and those who invest in this country is the darkest I have ever seen.\"He argued that it was fair to pay a lower rate to young workers because \"if someone is less experienced and less well trained than someone who has been doing the job for a while they are not necessarily going to be as productive\".Johnson said the timing of the planned increases in the minimum wage was a \"tragedy\" for young people because there was set to be a \"substantial rise in unemployment\" in the coming years due to Artificial Intelligence and other factors.Tina McKenzie, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"Sharply rising employment costs, alongside other increasing costs of doing business, are already chilling hiring intentions. \"Even steeper increases after the coming April hike would have priced many more young people out of jobs.\"But Unison, which represents NHS and other public service workers, said competitive wages were needed to \"keep and attract the staff\".The union's head of policy, Sampson Low, said: \"There's no reason for younger workers to be paid less for the same work.\"Young, low-paid workers are likely to spend the extra cash where they live, helping their local economies.\"Andy Prendergast, national secretary of the GMB Union, which represents workers across public utilities, said: \"Employers tell us that every single improvement in workers' rights is going to cause a problem and time and time again they have been proved wrong.\"",

    "body": "'I don't pay attention': Cynthia Erivo ignores online criticism as Dracula gets mixed reviews10 hours agoYasmin RufoNoël Coward Theatre, LondonDaniel BoudAfter years defying gravity, Wicked star Cynthia Erivo has traded the shimmering world of Oz for something darker and far more demanding. On the stage at London's Noël Coward Theatre, Erivo stands alone, carrying an entire gothic epic on her shoulders in a new adaptation of Dracula. There are no flying monkeys or emerald cities here. Instead, the actress alone carries a two-hour theatrical marathon, playing 23 characters with 20,000 words of dialogue in a constant dance with live technology that blurs the boundary between film and stage.During early preview performances, the show attracted attention for more than its ambition, as some audience members complained online that Erivo appeared to still be learning sections of the script and at moments relied on an autocue. But speaking after the show's opening night on Tuesday, the 39-year-old told the BBC she blocks out those comments. \"I'm not paying attention to any of them as no-one knows the experience except me,\" she said. \"It's not for me.\" \"I have a job to do and I want to do it as well as I can and I want to do it with all my heart. I don't let the comments take the energy that I should be spending on the stage.\" Daniel BoudErivo accepts that she was \"still learning my lines and figuring it out\" during the preview shows, adding that \"bit by bit it's become something that's a part of me, and everyone's learning process is different\". The production is stripped back and minimal. Erivo conjures the Victorian world  through voice and movement and her Dracula, delivered in a Nigerian accent and crowned with bright red hair, is only one of dozens of transformations. She slips between characters through rapid costume changes as several cameras film her live, projecting close-ups of her face onto a screen where the audience watches much of the action unfold.'I choose the challenges'Bram Stoker's 1897 novel about a Transylvanian vampire whose move to England unleashes terror, obsession and desire is one of the most frequently adapted works of fiction in history, with hundreds of stage and screen versions reinventing the vampire for new generations.Erivo said she hopes Stoker would like this adaptation and explained why she chose to take on the role. \"It challenges me and makes me learn in a different way so I am forced to grow as an artist,\" she said.\"If things were easy it would be boring so I choose the challenges.\" A stage performer at heart, Erivo made her West End debut in 2011 and has since become one of the few artists nominated for an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award, winning all but the Oscar.Daniel BoudAsked what it actually takes to prepare for a performance of that scale night after night, Erivo described a routine built on discipline and repetition.\"You have some good people who can help and it takes time and patience,\" she said. \"You find your way in and the through-line, and it becomes easier to learn.\" She added that before every show she meditates, has an extensive vocal warm-up and \"runs sections of the show\". Erivo is not the only Wicked star performing in the West End. Her former co-stars Ariana Grande and Jonathan Bailey are set to reunite for a London revival of Stephen Sondheim's Sunday in the Park with George at the Barbican in 2027.Erivo tells BBC News she would not rule out sharing a stage with them in future. \"Maybe it's something I'd consider,\" she said. \"I'd never say no.\" Middling reviewsDracula has divided critics so far. \"From defying gravity to defying mortality – Cynthia Erivo gives an extraordinary, shape shifting performance,\" wrote the Standard's Nick Curtis in a four-star review.\"Her performance triumphantly walks a knife edge between virtuosity and absurdity.But many critics were far less positive. In a two-star review, Sam Marlowe of the Stage said that the show had \"sounded like such a toothsome prospect\", but that the result is \"bloodless\". \"What could possibly go wrong? Sadly, the answer is: almost everything,\" she said. \"I wouldn't go so far as to say it sucks, but it certainly doesn't bite.\"Getty Images\"The story is narrated by Erivo, with only snippets in dialogue,\" she explained, \"which gives the sense of an audiobook accompanied by screen illustrations.\"\"Over a very long and testing two hours and five minutes – unrelieved by the mercy of an interval – [Erivo] gives an astonishing performance,\" he said.\"I didn't come here to watch a film about Dracula, I came here to watch a live show,\" he said. \"The production disassociates you with much of the feeling and heft of live performance.\"Olivia Garrett of the Radio Times agreed the show is \"let down by overproduction\" in a three-star review, adding: \"Like Dracula himself, this production sits stranded in the middle, not dead, not alive, but somewhere in between.\"\"The British actress proves any doubters wrong,\" he said in his four-star review. \"This isn't a flawless night but it's a tour de force even so.\"Additional reporting by Steven McIntosh.",

Oh my God.\"Sides, who has been dancing for 60 years and teaches ballroom dancing classes, said she had signed up for TV extra work with an agency, and responded to a call-out for senior dancers on behalf of an \"unknown artist\". After being shortlisted, Sides received a call confirming she had been specifically chosen by the artist out of hundreds of applications.But she had no idea record-breaking Swift was behind the request.Sides said the whole experience was \"hush-hush\" and all she had been told was that the job involved recreating a dance competition.It was only ten minutes before filming began that she found out the video was for a track from Swift's latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.Sides, a Swiftie herself, said she was in shock when the singer walked in.\"I still feel excited now [remembering it],\" she said.Sides said Swift, who sang in and directed the video, put everyone at ease during filming and thanked dancers for their time. \"She knew exactly what she wanted. She'd say, 'try this, try that,' and she was really nice about it,\" said the dance teacher.\"Some can be a bit abrupt but she wasn't. She was lovely and so talented.\"In the video, Sides can be seen wearing a royal blue ballroom dancing outfit she has owned since becoming a professional dancer in 1988.She said Swift complimented her outfit and said: \"I love your dress. It really fits the set.\"TAS Rights ManagementGraham Norton's chat show played a role in the video's castingWhen Sides saw the video, which was filmed in November but released earlier this month, she said she was gobsmacked.\"You just can't believe it's you,\" she said.It was difficult to keep the experience a secret too, she added: \"It was hard, I only told a few people in my dance class and my family.\"Opalite features Domhnall Gleeson, Lewis Capaldi, Greta Lee and a cameo voiceover from Cillian Murphy, all of whom appeared on the Graham Norton show with Swift in October.It tells the story of a lonely woman who uses a magical spray to improve her life and finds romance with a fellow loner.Matt Crossick / PA MediaThe video's cast all featured on Graham Norton's chat show last OctoberDespite dancing her whole life and with decades of acting experience, Sides said the shoot with Swift was the most important of her career. She said she hoped her experience would inspire others to try dancing.\"Maybe people will think, 'Well, if Taylor chose her, why don't we?',\" she said.\"You're never too old. It was an experience I will never, ever forget.\"In addition to running Dens Dance Studio since the 1990s, Sides also hosts inclusive workshops for those with disabilities.\"If I'm not teaching, I'm dancing myself,\" she said. \"That's my happy place, my passion.\"More top stories",

    "body": "5 hours agoNathan Briant,South of EnglandandDuncan Kennedy,CorrespondentBBCBarry O'Sullivan was found guilty of causing death by careless driving at Reading Crown Court on Wednesday A van driver who crashed into a broken-down car in a smart motorway's outside lane has been found guilty of causing death by careless driving.Barry O'Sullivan was driving on the M4 in Berkshire when he hit the stationary Nissan Micra, which burst into flames with Pulvinder Dhillon inside it, on 7 March 2022.O'Sullivan, 45, of Wixams, Bedfordshire, said there was nothing to warn him of the car on the motorway, with signs and alerts defective for days before the crash. Prosecutors at Reading Crown Court said any competent driver should still have avoided the Micra, owned by Dhillon's daughter, Rajpal Dene, on the motorway westbound between junctions 11 and 12.But the defence argued that an accident was always likely to happen and that O'Sullivan was failed by the smart motorway system.Family handoutPulvinder Dhillon was \"loved and respected by all she knew\", her family saidO'Sullivan was found to have been driving his Ford Transit Connect van at about 77mph in the moments before the crash at about 08:30 GMT.Footage taken in the moments before the impact showed multiple motorists driving around the marooned car.Prosecutor Ian Hope said O'Sullivan \"essentially ploughed straight into the back of the stationary Nissan, with there being no apparent avoiding action to the naked eye.\"O'Sullivan, who had a clean driving licence and showed no trace of alcohol or drugs, suffered serious injuries himself and was in hospital for four months following the incident.Speaking outside Reading Crown Court following the verdict, O'Sullivan said: \"I would like to say how sorry I am to the family.\"When asked if he could potentially appeal, he added: \"I need to seek legal advice before I make any decisions.\"Alerts from radars to detect stopped vehicles had not been working on the M4 between junctions 8/9 to 12 for five days before the crash, the court heard.Smart motorways use technology to regulate traffic flow and ease congestion.They also use the hard shoulder as an extra lane of traffic to increase capacity, but critics claim that has led to road deaths.Instead of a continuous hard shoulder, there are refuges every mile.The £814m project to install a 32-mile stretch of smart motorway, between junction 3 at Hayes and junction 12 at Theale in Berkshire, was completed in December 2022. In April 2023, the Conservative government cancelled plans for all new smart motorways following safety and cost concerns. A National Highways spokesperson said: \"Any death on our roads is one too many and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Pulvinder Dhillon following this tragic incident.\"While nothing can ever compensate for their loss, the person responsible has been found guilty of driving carelessly.\"O'Sullivan is due to be sentenced on 24 April.

    "body": "53 minutes agoLaura GozziReutersRussian, American and Ukrainian representatives met in Geneva on Tuesday and WednesdayTalks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending Moscow's war in Ukraine have concluded without a breakthrough. The trilateral meetings, held in Geneva, went on late on Tuesday but only lasted two hours on Wednesday. Although US envoy Steve Witkoff had expressed optimism over the talks, both the chief Russian negotiator and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky indicated they had been \"difficult\".After the main talks concluded, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky returned to the venue and held a closed-door meeting with the Ukrainian side for about an hour and a half. No details from that meeting have emerged.Some progress was made on \"military issues\", including the location of the front line and ceasefire monitoring, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source.White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said later on Wednesday that \"there was meaningful progress\" made on both sides, and an agreement to \"continue to work towards a peace deal together\".But an agreement on the issue of territory - without which no ceasefire can be envisaged - remains elusive, with Moscow and Kyiv's positions still far apart.Russia has not budged in its demand for full control of the eastern Donbas region - made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - which is a non-starter for Ukraine.While conceding talks were challenging, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky added that they had been \"businesslike\" and said another meeting would take place \"soon\".Zelensky also described the negotiations as \"not easy\" due to the difference in the two sides' positions. Rustem Umerov cut a less downbeat tone, saying the discussions had been \"substantive and intensive\" and that while there had been progress, no details could be disclosed \"at this stage\".\"This is complex work that requires alignment among all parties and sufficient time,\" Umerov said.Shortly before the end of the talks was announced, Zelensky accused Russia of \"trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage\".The Russian and Ukrainian delegations last met in US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi earlier in February, which led to the first prisoner exchange in several months. On Wednesday, Zelensky indicated that another swap might be forthcoming. US President Donald Trump, who spearheaded diplomatic efforts to end the war, has been signalling impatience with the deadlock between the two sides. On Monday, he said Ukraine had \"better come to the table, fast\" - a sentiment Zelensky has since rejected, saying it was \"not fair\" that his country should be the one asked to compromise.Four years on from the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, substantial distance still exists between Moscow's demands and what Kyiv might consider a \"just peace\".Kyiv has long rejected Russia's demand for the eastern Donbas, which would mean relinquishing Ukrainian sovereign territory, including several heavily fortified cities and a long defensive line in the region of Donetsk. Many Ukrainians believe giving that territory up would leave the country vulnerable to another Russian invasion. Zelensky himself has drawn parallels with the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler annex the Czech territory of Sudetenland.On Tuesday, Zelensky told US media outlet Axios that any plan to hand over the Donbas would be rejected by Ukrainians if it were put to a referendum. The Ukrainian president is also working to ensure that robust security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again are provided by Kyiv's western allies.Another sticking point in the talks is the status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Ukraine wants Moscow to return it and Zelensky has previously said Kyiv could share control of the plant with the Americans - an arrangement Moscow is unlikely to agree to.Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy were present in Geneva and held talks with the Ukrainians on the sidelines of the trilateral meeting. European representatives have struggled to be included in the US-led negotiations, but Zelensky said European participation was \"indespensable\" for any final agreement.Next Tuesday will mark the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war, which has resulted in tens of thousands of military and civilian casualties and displaced millions across Ukraine, continues to shape the lives of Ukrainians, with daily deadly aerial attacks across the country.Four people were killed and 30 injured in Russian artillery and air strikes overnight on Tuesday. Power infrastructure too continues to be targeted across the country, leaving millions without light or heating in one of Ukraine's coldest winters in years.",

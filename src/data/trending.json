    "body": "Ferrari's Charles Leclerc ended the test with the single fastest lap time in an emphatic way - 0.811 seconds quicker than the next best time, set by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.Headline times in testing are usually not the place to look to gauge the competitive order, but this did reflect the picture in one important way - Mercedes and Ferrari look like they are going into the new season in the best shape.Andrea Stella, team principal of world champions McLaren, said on Friday evening: \"This test has confirmed that Ferrari and Mercedes look like the teams to beat. McLaren and Red Bull [are] probably very similar, Ferrari and Mercedes a step ahead.\"This picture, an impression reflected by many other senior figures up and down the pit lane, comes less from the headline lap times - even if they did show the teams in the order Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Red Bull - than the so-called race-simulation runs.Because the teams fill up their cars with fuel and run a grand prix distance, these have far fewer variables to muddy the picture than single laps.On Friday evening, Leclerc did the best race simulation of the week, slightly quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen and McLaren's Oscar Piastri the day before, when they set more or less exactly the same time.Mercedes did not do any race simulations in the second week, only in the first, when track conditions were up to a second slower.Antonelli set comfortably the fastest race simulation of the first week - a lot faster than Piastri, who was running at the same time.And his team-mate George Russell - the bookies' pre-season championship favourite - was also impressively quick when running in the hotter, slower conditions earlier in the day.This is not an exact science, but the cumulation of data is what led to the conclusion reached by Stella and many others.A complication was that McLaren were not running the latest specification of Mercedes power-unit, which Mercedes were proving out, so can expect an uplift when they switch in Australia to the latest spec.Another is Red Bull's new engine is said by Russell to have the best deployment of energy, which is such an important facet this season.Mercedes' biggest concern is reliability. This hit Antonelli much more than Russell, but it's probably fair to say that Mercedes suffered more problems than their major rivals, although Red Bull's new recruit Isack Hadjar did lose a fair bit of his running to issues of one kind or another.There is no question as to the prize for biggest disappointment so far this year. Aston Martin, starting their new works partnership with Honda, are runaway winners of that.With design legend Adrian Newey at the helm, Honda - world champions with Red Bull as recently as 2024 - and the money of their billionaire owner Lawrence Stroll and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), all the ingredients for success seem to be there.But the new car, delayed by the fact Newey did not arrive until March last year, is uncompetitive and difficult, and the engine is lacking power and unreliable. Aston Martin completed the fewest laps of testing, and look like they may even be in worse shape than new team Cadillac, who expected to be last this year.Both the internal combustion engine and hybrid elements of the new Honda power-unit are said to be well behind the best.Several sources told BBC Sport this week that Newey said at Wednesday's meeting of the F1 Commission - a rule-making body comprising all the teams as well as F1 and the FIA - that the Honda power-unit could not even recover energy at the lower limit of 250kw, let alone the higher one of 350kw, which comes into force under certain circumstances in the highly complex rules.Reliability was so bad that by the start of the final day of the test, Honda had only one battery left, and took the decision to limit running to only short runs. A statement said that was to allow them to study data in between track outings, but in the end Lance Stroll did only six laps all day.The problems with the engine make it difficult to make any judgement on the car. There is no question it was slow in the corners - but the Honda is running so badly that it's hard for the team to work out where the car is, and therefore how to improve it.This is exacerbated by the fact Aston's first in-house gearbox - they have bought them in previously - is not communicating with the engine properly, and keeps behaving oddly, making life even more difficult for the drivers.For Fernando Alonso, this all must come with an agonising sense of deja vu. He spent three painful years at McLaren when Honda were underprepared when they re-entered F1 in 2015.And now he faces another one, at the age of 44, and with his contract running out at the end of the year.Publicly, Alonso is staying optimistic as he said: \"Short and medium term, I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\"How long it takes, though, is another matter. And one thing Alonso does not have much of is time.While all the teams are reluctant to say exactly where they think they stand in the competitive order, all are clear that there appears to be three groups of teams - the top four, the midfield, and then Aston Martin and Cadillac at the back.Among the midfield runners, who are in the region of at least a second a lap slower than the big four, the team poised to make the biggest step seem to be Alpine.They finished last season last, by the biggest margin ever, partly because they devoted extremely limited resource to last year's car, so they could focus on this year.Alpine have switched to a Mercedes power-unit, following parent company Renault's decision to end its F1 engine programme. And with the combination of this and a much-improved car appear to have jumped up to the top of the midfield fight.There is some debate as to whether they or Haas are in the best shape, but either way this is huge progress for the French team.Racing Bulls are also in this mix at the top of the midfield.Among the midfield teams, Williams seem to be the biggest losers. Their 2026 car has been a disappointment so far, overweight by a significant margin - said to be anywhere between 25 and 40 kilos - and lacking downforce.Williams finished fifth last year, and this season was supposed to be the next step in their ambition of a return to the top of F1.Team principal James Vowles has been saying for two years how much of an opportunity the new rules are to move forward, and was vocal last season as to how early they had switched to the 2026 design and compromised 2025 for exactly this reason.So this is a major blow.Audi, which has taken over Sauber for the start of its brand new works programme with its own in-house engine, were expected to have difficulties.But they appear to be in decent shape and have been quietly impressive in the midfield context, and could well be ahead of Williams, even if a long way from their ultimate ambitions.The leading drivers have all at various points expressed their dissatisfaction with the new rules, especially the amount of energy management required with the new hybrid power-units.These feature a near 50-50 split between internal combustion engine and electrical components.With the amount of hybrid power increased three-fold, a component of the engine that helped recovery energy removed, and the batteries more or less the same size as last year, the cars are energy starved.This has led to some unusual aspects being added to driving.These include not going flat out in the run up to the start of a qualifying lap, taking corners in higher gears than is optimum for lap time to keep the turbo spinning, lifting and coasting in qualifying, and even not going flat out at the end of a qualifying lap because it is more time-effective to use the energy elsewhere.At some circuits, there will be a lot more energy recovery required than others by the various means available. These include recovering while at full throttle, known as \"super-clip\", and lifting and coasting, as well as the standard method, during braking.Albert Park is one of these energy-poor circuits.For a purist, and drivers who want to be on the limit at all times, this is not ideal.But F1 as a sport has known this was coming ever since the power-unit regulations were created in 2022. And, for now, the drivers are going to have get used to a new normal.Behind the scenes, meanwhile, there are ongoing discussions as to how to allow the drivers to drive in a more conventional way, but it remains to be seen how these will resolve.However, having seen the cars on track, and watched them on television, it is highly unlikely the average viewer will notice any difference. They still look like F1 cars, and in some ways are more appealing than last year's.They are smaller and have less downforce, so they slide more in corners, and look more agile. Many of the fast corners that were rendered bends in straights by last year's cars will become a driving challenge again, such as Abbey at Silverstone.Russell, while acknowledging the differences from previous cars, said: \"The guiding principles are still very much the same. You're pushing the car to the absolute limit. You're trying to brake as hard and late as possible, and carry as much speed through the corners. So far, I'm quite enjoying it.\"Off track, one of the main focuses of pre-season has been a row between the engine manufacturers over the rules governing the engines' compression ratio.It split the engine suppliers into two groups, Mercedes versus the rest - Ferrari, Honda and newcomers Red Bull and Audi.The row was dismissed earlier this week by Vowles - a Mercedes customer - as \"noise that will probably go away\", and by Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff as \"a storm in a teacup\". And it looks like both will end up being right.Why have Mercedes been targeted? Because their rivals believe they have found a way of exploiting the rule restricting the compression ratio - a measurement of the cylinder displacement between the two extremes of the piston stroke - to 16:1. The rules dictate it is measured at ambient temperature.Typically, the compression ratio reduces when engines heat up, and the belief was Mercedes had found a way using materials technology to limit this loss.Mercedes' rivals have been pushing for a rule that measures it at a higher temperature, in the hope of restricting their perceived advantage.This could also have allowed the others to set their ambient temperature compression ratio higher than 16:1 so that it was at the limit at a higher temperature, and so improve the performance of their engines relative to Mercedes.Governing body the FIA has proposed a compromise whereby the ratio is measured both at ambient temperature and 130C.As this does not achieve the aim Mercedes' opponents wanted, the signs are the other companies may even vote against the proposal that came out of their own campaign. Even if it passes, it seems it will make no difference.Wolff added: \"The way it works, you know, either we stay with the regulations like we are or the e-vote goes ahead with the proposal that came from the FIA. Both are OK for us.\"The new engines are also much harder to get off the line, which many expect will lead to unpredictability at starts.There were safety concerns about this at the start of the first test - especially the risk of a car slow away being rear-ended by another at high speed.But these were largely assuaged by a new start line procedure that was trialled at the test, which gives the drivers more time to get the turbos spinning at the optimum speed.On the face of it, the Ferrari-engined cars seemed to have an advantage - they rocketed past rivals on several occasions during these tests.But Williams driver Alex Albon said: \"I don't think what you're seeing is really what's going to happen. You've got drivers who are finishing long runs, going into a practice start, on a high-mileage tyre that's already gone. So you've seen this chaos of some people getting good starts, bad starts, but actually it's not as bad as that.\"And data seen by BBC Sport showed that, actually, of all the starts performed in testing, the Mercedes-engined teams as a bloc had the best starts on average - they were ranked in four of the top five places - followed by Ferrari-powered cars.Strangely, Racing Bulls were second and Red Bull last, despite having the same Red Bull Powertrains/Ford engine.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMany of Saturday's papers are leading with the latest on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office. \"Andrew is facing axe from line of succession\" is the Daily Mirror's lead story, reporting he could be \"stripped of his position as the eighth in line to the throne\". The UK government is drafting legislation to \"seal his exit from the Royal Family\", the paper writes, under the headline \"Throne Out\". The Sun splashes \"Andrew's out of line\" for its headline. It adds that King Charles III \"will not object to historic move\" against his brother Andrew, quoting anonymous royal sources. \"Sir Keir Starmer and Buckingham Palace indicated their support\" for removing Andrew from the line of succession is the lead story in the Times. It explains while the former prince \"ceased to be a working member of the royal family in 2019\", he remains eighth in line to the throne – an entitlement that can only be removed by an act of parliament.The Daily Telegraph also writes Andrew's removal from the line of succession would be \"historic\", saying the measure \"would be the most significant change to the line of succession since the abdication of Edward VIII\".\"82% say ditch Andrew from line to throne\" reads the Daily Express headline citing a poll that shows wide public support for \"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to be cut from the line of succession\".\"Met issues dramatic plea to ex-prince's protection officers\" is the Daily Mail's top story, as detectives investigating Andrew urge his bodyguards \"to 'consider carefully anything they say or heard' while working for him\".The Guardian also leads with Scotland Yard \"expanding its inquiry\" into Andrew \"by approaching all his former protection officers and reviewing records of flights at London's airports to see if they were used for human trafficking\".\"Royal Family fears new investigations and fallout\" reads the i Weekend headline, and it reports: \"Met Police are identifying and contacting Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's former and serving protection officers\".The Daily Star says Andrew's \"trip to the cop shop was pants\". It reports: \"There have been complaints of an undies shortage,\" under the headline: \"You're undie arrest.\"Meanwhile, the Financial Times Weekend says \"Trump pledges fresh tariffs\" after the US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the president had \"exceeded his authority\" in imposing tariffs on international trading partners. In response, Trump \"vowed to impose a 10 per cent 'global tariff' by alternative means\". Related Internet Links",

It's coming.\"The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.\"Yesterday we were able to fully tank the SLS rocket within the planned time line […] we also succesfully demonstrated the launch countdown,\" she said.Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.The first day of their journey will be spent in orbit around the Earth, then if all systems are working well, the astronauts will head towards the Moon.The voyage takes about four days, and the crew will travel around the far side of the Moon, which is the side we never see from Earth.They'll be at a distance of 6,500-9,500km (4,000 to 6,000 miles) above the lunar surface, and will have several hours dedicated to studying and taking images of the Moon.After the fly by, the astronauts will begin their four-day journey home. They will end the mission with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean.NASAApollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt visited the Moon in 1972The mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the lunar surface. The last time humans visited the Moon was in 1972 for the Apollo 17 mission.Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but this is a very ambitious timescale.Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander for Artemis III - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.Both nations are planning to land at the Moon's south pole - and are competing for the best spots to build their lunar bases.",

    "body": "Puberty blockers trial paused over concerns from medicines watchdog5 hours agoAmy WalkerandAlison Holt,Social affairs editorGetty ImagesA clinical trial assessing the risks and benefits of puberty-blocking drugs in children who question their gender has been paused after safety concerns were raised by the UK medicines watchdog.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is set to hold talks with King's College London, whose researchers are leading the trial, next week to address concerns, the government said.Details of the trial, which would involve more than 220 children aged between about 11 and 15, were announced in November after getting approval from the MHRA and Health Research Authority.An MHRA spokesperson said the \"safety and wellbeing\" of participants - yet to be recruited - was \"paramount\".Puberty blockers for people under-18 questioning their gender identity were banned in 2024. The drugs, also known as puberty suppressing hormones (PSH), are used to delay or prevent puberty happening.The clinical trial, called Pathways, was set to involve children who are distressed about their gender and currently accessing gender services. It would examine the impact of the drugs on their physical, social and emotional wellbeing. But the MHRA has suggested the minimum age limit of those taking part should be increased to 14, and that there should be more detailed monitoring of bone density and a more rigorous consent process for participants.In a letter published on the government website on Friday, the MHRA expressed concern over the current age limit for participants in the trial.\"Since potentially significant and, as yet, unquantified risk of long-term biological harms is present to participants and biological safety has not been definitively demonstrated in this proposed cohort, at the very least, there should be a graded/stepwise approach starting with those aged 14 as the lower limit of eligibility,\" it reads.In a separate statement on Friday evening, an MHRA spokesperson said it was \"part of the usual process that clinical trials are kept continuously under review and for us to have active scientific dialogue with the trial sponsors\".\"We have raised some concerns related to the wellbeing of participants and scientific dialogue will now follow with the trial sponsor,\" they added.The Department of Health & Social Care (DHSC) said participants would not be recruited until the issues raised had been resolved between the MHRA and the trial clinicians. \"We have always been clear about the red lines regarding this trial – ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the children and young people involved and always being led by the clinical evidence,\" a spokesperson said.They added that the trial would \"only be allowed to go ahead if the expert scientific and clinical evidence and advice conclude it is both safe and necessary\".A spokesperson for King's College London said the wellbeing and health of young people with gender incongruence and their families was its \"priority\".It added that \"rigour and ongoing scientific discussion\" was important for a clinical trial, \"particularly one as complex as Pathways\".Some doctors have questioned whether the trial is necessary.  Campaigners are also taking legal action against the MHRA, the government and others involved in the trial. They claim it is unethical and that children cannot give fully informed consent to a treatment which might affect their future fertility.A 2024 review by Dr Hilary Cass found gender medicine had been operating on \"shaky foundations\" when it came to evidence for treatment, with the ban for puberty blockers for under-18s introduced after the review raised concerns about their safety.",

    "body": "Multi-cancer blood test missed key goal in NHS trial34 minutes agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentGetty ImagesA blood test which looks for multiple types of cancer has failed to achieve its key objective in a major NHS trial, the company has announced.The Galleri blood test is being trialled on 142,000 NHS patients with the goal of finding cancers early and saving lives.However, the company behind the test, Grail, said there were still positive signs in the data that some of the most aggressive cancers could be prevented.But researchers said any benefits of the test \"remain speculative\" until it was proven to save lives and the NHS said it was looking at the results \"carefully\".The blood test searches for fragments of DNA – or genetic code – that have escaped from tumours and entered the bloodstream.The vision is to detect up to 50 types of cancer before the person has any symptoms.At the start of the clinical trial, NHS England described the test as \"the beginning of a revolution\".The trial was designed to see if screening people's blood would reduce the number of cancers being diagnosed at later stages when they may be harder to treat.Stage three cancers are when a tumour has started to spread locally, stage four is when they have spread to distant organs in the body too.The full data from the three-year NHS trial has not been published, but Grail has issued an update to investors.It said: \"While there was a trend towards reduction in combined stage three and four [cancers], the trial did not meet the primary endpoint.\"Grail, a US pharmaceutical company, halved in value after the announcement taking its share price back to levels seen at the end of the summer.However, a further analysis looking at stage four cancers alone showed they fell by around a fifth in the study, suggesting the most deadly cancers were being detected at an earlier stage.How much attention should be paid to this result, when it was not the main focus of the trial, has become a major debating point.Prof Charles Swanton, who is running the trials within the NHS, told the BBC he was \"genuinely very excited\" about the reduction in stage four cancers.\"I've been working in oncology for 20 years and the key, in my mind, is to reduce stage four because these are the cancers we cannot cure,\" he said.However, other experts say the focus has to be on the primary endpoint as that is what the trial was designed to test.Prof Richard Houlston, from the Institute of Cancer Research, said: \"Without mortality data and a transparent account of harms, including false positives, unnecessary procedures, and opportunity cost, claims of population benefit from multi-cancer early detection remain speculative,\" he said.The full data is due to be presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this year.An NHS spokesperson said: \"This evidence is an important step and the NHS will carefully study the full results from this major trial in the coming months to help determine how blood tests like this could be used in the future.\"",

    "body": "14 minutes agoRichard Wheeler,political reporterandNick Eardley,political correspondentGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor was pictured wearing Order of the Garter robes at his brother's coronation in 2023The government is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the \"right thing to do,\" regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.Currently Andrew, the King's brother, remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", last October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme, Pollard confirmed the government had \"absolutely\" been working with Buckingham Palace on the plans to stop the former prince from \"potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne\".He said this was \"something that I hope will enjoy cross party support, but its right that that is something that only happens when the police investigation concludes\".On Friday unmarked police cars and vans were seen coming and going at Royal Lodge, the 30-room Windsor property where Andrew lived for many years.At one point more than 20 vehicles could be seen parked at the property, although it is not known it all was connected to the investigation and searches.Thames Valley Police, the force which arrested him, is expected to continue searching Royal Lodge until Monday, the BBC understands.The government's proposal comes after some MPs, including the Liberal Democrats and SNP, signalled their support for such legislation.Some Labour parliamentarians who have been critical of the monarchy told the BBC they were less convinced the move was required - in part because it is so unlikely the former Duke of York would ever get near to the throne.In October, Downing Street said it had no plans to introduce a law to change the line of succession. After the latest revelations, historian David Olusoga told BBC Newsnight there is now \"a desperate desire within government and within the palace to draw a firewall… between this crisis and the wider monarchy\".Buckingham Palace has not publicly commented on the government's plans to remove Andrew from the line of succession.The move would require an act of Parliament, which would have to be approved by MPs and peers and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.It would also need to be supported by the 14 Commonwealth countries where Charles III is head of state, including Canada, Australia, Jamaica and New Zealand.The last time the line of succession was changed by an act of Parliament was in 2013, when the Succession to the Crown Act restored individuals who had previously been excluded because they had married a Catholic.The last time someone was removed from the line of succession by an act of Parliament was in 1936, when the former Edward VIII and his descendants were removed due to his abdication.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said police should be \"allowed to get on with their job, acting without fear or favour\".He added: \"But clearly this is an issue that Parliament is going to have to consider when the time is right, naturally the monarchy will want to make sure he can never become King.\"The SNP would support removing Andrew from the line of succession if legislation is required, according to the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn.Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central, has also backed the move.She said: \"I would support legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession and to remove from the counsellor of state.\"Counsellors of state can stand in for a monarch who is ill or overseas although, in practice, only working royals are expected to be called upon to fulfil those duties. Mountbatten-Windsor stepped back from public duties in 2019 following a backlash after an interview with BBC Newsnight about his relationship with Epstein.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said \"all of us in public life need to give space\" to the police investigation to be carried out.

    "body": "6 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporterandCachella SmithGetty ImagesIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said a proposal for an agreement with the US will be ready in daysUS President Donald Trump has said he is considering a limited military strike on Iran in order to pressure its leaders to agree a deal to curb the nuclear programme.The president made the remark in response to a question from a journalist hours after officials had suggested the possibility of a strike.On Thursday, Trump said the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached or the US would take military action. The US has been increasing its military presence in the region in recent weeks.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.  US and Iranian officials have met over the issue in Switzerland and said progress has been made in the talks.Speaking on Friday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was preparing \"a draft of a possible agreement\" and would hand it over to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the next few days.The talks in Geneva were held as American forces continued ramping up their presence in the vicinity of Iran.The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is also being deployed, joining an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces.\"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read.Trump takes questions from journalists several times a week - often in lengthy sessions in the Oval Office or on Air Force One - but his comments do not necessarily always translate into concrete actions, and often contradict each other.He is fond of reminding reporters that he prefers to keep his intentions to himself and a small circle of insiders to avoid potential adversaries knowing his next moves.\"I'm not going to talk to you about that,\" he snapped at a reporter on Thursday when asked about potential military action. \"We're going to make a deal or get a deal one way or the other.\"Even if an operation is carried out, Trump has so far yet to specify what the precise military objective would be, with US officials having reportedly presented him with a wide range of options for what could be a weeks-long campaign.In the past, Trump has also used deadlines to achieve an element of surprise.At the time of Operation Midnight Hammer in July last year - which saw US forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities - White House officials were still publicly discussing the possibility of successful talks.The day before US missiles and bombs struck the facility, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read a statement from Trump in which he said that because \"negotiations may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks\".Any strikes in the near future would come at a challenging time domestically for the Trump administration, with polls showing that a growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration and the economy.Unlike the one-day strike in Iran last year and the quick operation to capture Nicolás Maduro in January, a protracted, multi-week conflict with Iran threatens alienating parts of Trump's Maga base which were drawn to his campaign promise of an end to messy foreign entanglements.",

    "body": "2 hours agoOttilie MitchellRon Galella Collection via Getty ImagesAnna Murdoch-Mann, writer and ex-wife of media baron Rupert Murdoch, has died aged 81, his media outlets have announced.Married to the mogul for 31 years, she was described by the New York Post as an \"active partner\" in building News Corp.She was mother to three of Murdoch's children, Elisabeth, James, and Lachlan Murdoch - who is now chairman of Fox and News Corp - and stepmother to his daughter, Prudence.Murdoch-Mann was an active philanthropist and died on 17 February \"surrounded by family\" at her home in Palm Beach, Florida.Born Anna Torv in Glasgow and raised as a Catholic, she moved to Australia aged nine. After her parents' divorce, she is said to have brought up her own siblings.Murdoch-Mann became a reporter for the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Daily Mirror, where she met Rupert Murdoch and served on the board of his company.\"He never made a major business decision without her input\" The Australian, another title in his media stable, writes.She penned several novels during their marriage, including the 1988 Family Business about a multi-generational media dynasty.

It concluded with Murdoch's eldest son Lachlan set to control the news group as of late last year.His mother also remarried, first to financier William Mann who died in 2017.

    "body": "7 hours agoLana LamCootamundraBBC goes inside the beach volleyball contest hours from the nearest coastLike many wild and wacky ideas, it all started down at the pub.\"I was literally looking out the window at that intersection and thought, 'What if we put in a beach volleyball court and play a competition?'\"On a tar road. In the middle of a town 400km from the nearest beach,\" Simon Sutherland, 51, says.He wanted to bring the party vibe of Bali's Kuta – a popular island holiday spot for many Australians – to his hometown of Cootamundra.And so that night he went home and drew up plans for Australia's own \"Coota Beach\" and its now famous annual volleyball tournament.Twenty-five years on, it's grown from a single day of play into a three-day festival – a cultural and sporting highlight in the town's calendar, delighting locals, attracting thousands of tourists and bringing in an estimated $2m in revenue.\"In a way, I think it's bigger than Christmas,\" 86-year-old grandmother Pat Roberts, who tells the BBC she has made cheering on her children and grandchildren a summer tradition.\"I've loved it every year, I've never missed one.\"From one court to tenIt's Saturday afternoon and the tournament resembles a beach bash in full swing, costumed bodies heaving under the blazing sun.\"Mine!\" calls out one singlet-clad player to her teammates, making it to a volleyball just in time. Loud pop and rock music blares down the entire block, punctuated by the odd cheer and whoop from spectators.Over on one court, a team of minions – complete with yellow-painted faces, oversized googles and beach-styled overalls – are jumping excitedly much like their animated namesake.Many teams play in fancy dress like this team of minions from the animated film.Elsewhere, teams like Holy Blockamole and Itsy Bitsy Spiker are dropping shots like it's hot, diving to make saves and drinking like it's the last days of summer.There's plenty of laughs as teams of six serve, spike and block during the 20-minute matches, with rules that are a mix of indoor and beach volleyball.Suncream's being slathered on, high-fives are flowing as freely as the cold drinks. In between matches, hard-working staff are hosing down the courts to cool the sand.It's a stark contrast to the first Coota Beach event in 2001 – when 16 teams played a couple dozen matches on a single court in one day. This year's event had almost 200 teams playing over three days. Demand was so high, 40 teams were turned away.Sutherland remembers the early years clearly.\"We used to get up at 1am and start setting up on the Saturday morning, ready to go for games at 8am,\" he recalls, shaking his head in mild disbelief as he glances over the ten courts at this year's event.Kaktus ScotWhat started as a one-day event is now a three-day tournamentThese days, transforming the asphalt landscape into a sandy oasis takes about a week, with almost 900 tonnes of sand – that's about six blue whales or 70 double-decker buses – trucked in.James Graham, owner of the quarry where the sand is sourced from, says the town's order is the strangest request he's ever had: \"Who am I to tell people what to do with it?,\" he jokes.Council workers then flatten the huge mounds of sand to create an inland beach, ready for the first games on Friday.Hours after the finals wrap up on Sunday and all the eskies have been packed away, workers and volunteers try to scoop up every last grain of sand, which is either sold or donated to the community, turning up in local parks, sporting grounds or construction sites.Within two days, the road – buffed and cleaned - returns to its usual form, lined with parked cars and locals going about their daily errands.Costumes and camaraderieKaktus ScotTeams of six play 20-minute matches with crowds cheering from the sidelinesOrganiser Lee-Anne Hogan estimates the town's usual population of 7,000 swells by about 3,000 over the weekend. \"It's enormous - the town actually books out in every way\".While, in the early days, there were fears from some businesses that closing a street might mean fewer customers, those worries have disappeared.A No Vacancy sign out the front of his Southern Comfort Motor Inn, Dylan O'Neill says: \"It's clear that every hospitality business in town benefits significantly from the event.\"Among those who have flocked to Cootamundra for the weekend are British couple Guy Wilkinson and Lizzie Ellison, both 30, who moved to Sydney two years ago and have driven four hours to compete.It's a \"true rural experience,\" that feels \"uniquely Australian\", Ellison says.\"It's a super fun, friendly vibe,\" Wilkinson adds.Their team – all dressed in tasselled cowboy outfits – have nabbed the prize for best-dressed, tying with another team decked out in pink nighties and platinum blonde wigs.Kaktus ScotYee-haw! This group of cowboys and cowgirls came tied in the best dressed award...Kaktus Scot... with this team looking pretty in pink.\"We've had people come here from Manly in Sydney saying that these are better courts to play on than the ones at the beaches there,\" Sutherland brags, \"I don't think we can get a better wrap than that.\"Whether you're a long-time local or new to Coota, the weekend is an opportunity to cultivate a sense of community.Sia Lesa speaks to the BBC as she is about to step onto court eight for her third and final match of the day.She recently moved to town from her native Samoa as part of a visa scheme that has seen hundreds of Pacific Islanders relocate to Australia for jobs.\"I arrived in 2024, right on the day of the tournament,\" she says. \"I arrived in the early morning and I played in the afternoon, no kidding.\"Sia, who moved from Samoa a few years ago, enjoys the community spirit of the eventFor Lesa, the social aspect of the weekend is a rare chance to feel part of a community that often feels closed off to her.\"Coota is very small and [this is] something different for us, because normally we work at the abattoir and straight after we finish work, we go home and stay there.\"It's certainly a homely affair for James Dunk, who has played every year for about a decade and always enters a team made up of three sets of neighbours.Last year, his son joined the team as he had just turned 14 – the minimum age to participate. \"It's almost a rite of passage before they ditch you and go and have more fun with their friends,\" he jokes.Founder Simon Sutherland and his son Eamon, 14, who got to play for the first time this yearThat's exactly the case for Sutherland's son Eamon, 14, who finally had a chance to join in, after years of watching from the sidelines.\"It's so exciting to get to play,\" he smiles, his team's name – Spiked and Served – emblazoned on his singlet.As the sun sets and players dust off their sandy feet, Sutherland says he has big plans to expand the shoreline of Coota Beach.\"I want it to be as big as the Elvis Festival in Parkes,\" he says, referring to the week-long celebrations in another regional Australian town that draws tens of thousands of fans every January to celebrate the King of Rock.\"The more people we can bring into the Coota sphere, the better - people that would rarely go to a country town. Come and see what we've got to offer.\"",

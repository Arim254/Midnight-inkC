    "body": "6 hours agoLana LamSydneyEPAThe private number of Anthony Albanese was listed on the site The private phone numbers of several high-profile figures including Australia's Prime Minister and Donald Trump Jr have been published on a US website.Both of their personal contact details remain publicly listed on the site, which uses AI to scrape the internet for information and the BBC has chosen not to name.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's office is aware of the situation - which was first reported by independent Australian media outlet Ette Media - and local authorities are investigating.A spokesman for Australia's opposition leader Sussan Ley, whose private number was also published, said the matter was \"obviously concerning\" and they had requested the information be removed.The site claims to have contact details for hundreds of millions of professionals and is used by recruiters and sales representatives.The BBC has verified it includes a current private number for Albanese and a personal contact for Donald Trump Jr - though it is unclear if the latter still uses it.It is also unclear how the site obtained the information, but Australia has suffered a series of large data breaches in recent years.The BBC also called numbers listed for former US Presidents Barack Obama - to no avail - and Bill Clinton - which was picked up by an audibly confused man. A London landline purportedly for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer rang out. Users can search the database for a limited number of contacts for free or sign up for a paid service.According to its website, the site collects public information - including, for example, filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission - but also uses AI to collate data from social media networks, others website crawlers and job portals.The site also has an opt-out form where people listed can request their personal information be removed from the database.

    "body": "People applying for a driving licence will be encouraged to donate blood as part of a campaign to boost numbers of donors.Officials estimate the message - a link to register as a blood donor in emails following driving licence applications - will be seen by millions of people each year.By encouraging driving licence applicants, the NHS hopes to make a direct appeal to young people, as more than half of regular blood donors are over the age of 45.Tim Moss, chief executive of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), said his organisation is \"in a unique position to help raise awareness\" as it handles millions of driving licence applications each year.People can donate blood from the age of 17 and register from the age of 16.The new scheme is jointly rolled out by the DVLA and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), the body that oversees England's blood donation system.\"At 17 you can both learn to drive and start giving blood,\" said Altaf Kazi, assistant partnerships director for NHSBT.\"So this new partnership with the DVLA is a fantastic opportunity for the NHS to reach more younger people who have a lifetime of donating ahead of them,\" Kazi added.The two bodies hope to repeat an earlier success where the driving licence application has included an option to join the organ donor register since 1994. Around 70% of people signed up to the register did so through this prompt, according to NHSBT.Hospitals across England need 5,000 blood donations every day to treat patients with a wide variety of conditions, including traumatic injury, childbirth, blood disorders and cancer treatments, it added.Earlier this year, the NHS warned that it continued to face a \"challenging\" blood shortage, as it called for 200,000 new donors to come forward in order to maintain a safe and reliable supply.Concern over blood stocks prompted the health service to issue an \"amber alert\" last year, meaning supplies were running low enough to have an impact on patient treatment.Supplies have remained low ever since, with officials warning there is a \"critical\" need for more donors who have O negative blood, which can be given to the majority of patients.",

    "body": "38 minutes agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesWage growth in the UK cooled slightly over the summer, as unemployment ticked up marginally.Average wage growth was 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% over the three months to July, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The national unemployment rate rose slightly from 4.7% to 4.8%.Analysts said the data indicated that the UK jobs market was stabilising after a year of volatility.Job vancancies fell by 9,000, or 1.3%, in the three months to September, and the ONS said this was the 39th consecutive period in which job openings had fallen compared to the previous three months.Liz McKeown, the ONS's director of economic statistics, said: \"After a long period of weak hiring activity, there are signs that the falls we have seen in both payroll numbers and vacancies are now levelling off.\"Ms McKeown said the ONS was seeing different patterns among age groups, adding \"the increase in unemployment was driven mostly by younger people.\"There was a quarterly drop in the number of people who were economically inactive because they were students or retired, but this was largely offset by a rise in economic inactivity for other reasons, including long-term illness and for other reasons.The ONS has said the unemployment rate should be treated with caution and it is taking additional steps to address concerns about the quality of the data.Private sector earnings growth was the lowest in four years but was still ahead of inflation.Annual growth in workers' average earnings was 6% for the public sector and 4.4% for the private sector.Ashley Webb, an economist with Capital Economics, said that stubbornly high wage growth may prevent the Bank of England from cutting interest rates before the end of the year.\"But we think it's only a matter of time before the loosening in the labour market leads to a more marked easing in wage growth, which would allow the Bank to cut rates,\" he said.Chris Hare, the senior UK economist at HSBC, said the data indicates \"a fairly steady labour market\".\"I think we're probably seeing fairly soft demand for labour in the economy,\" he said, adding that it should lead to \"a gradual easing in broader cost pressures in the labour market and an easing in wage growth\".The ONS said the public sector annual growth rate is affected by some public sector pay rises being paid earlier in 2025 than in 2024.After the public sector, the wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants sector showed the strongest regular annual growth rate.The number of people who were made redundant between June and August increased from the same period last year, to 3.8 per 1,000 employees in June to August 2025.The ONS also revised the previous figure for wage growth, bringing it up from 4.7% to 4.8%.This figure will likely be used to calculate the increase to the state pension for next year.Under the triple lock policy, the state pension is increased by the highest of wage growth, inflation or 2.5%.'Paltry' real wage growthInflation currently stands at 3.8%, meaning that real wage growth - how much better off workers are when accounting for rises in the cost of living - is 0.9%.Responding to the figures, the Liberal Democrats said that real wage growth is barely keeping up with inflation.Similarly, the Resolution Foundation said real wage growth was \"paltry\", and that real weekly wages have only increased by £1.50 since last September — \"barely enough to cover the cost of a Greggs sausage roll\".Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the think tank, said: \"The UK's longstanding weakness in the jobs market has finally caught up with pay packets.\"The deteriorating labour market, coupled with persistently high inflation, means that cost of living pressures are likely to build over the autumn.\"",

    "body": "Venezuela announced on Monday it would close its embassy in Oslo, days after opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.In a statement, the Venezuelan government did not comment on Machado's prize, saying that the closure was part of a restructuring of its foreign service.Norway's foreign ministry confirmed that Caracas had closed its embassy in Oslo without providing a reason.The Nobel Committee in Oslo awarded her the prize on Friday in recognition of what it called \"her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela\", while Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro referred to the 58-year-old laureate as a \"demonic witch\".The Norwegian foreign ministry called the decision \"regrettable\". \"Despite our differences on several issues, Norway wishes to keep the dialogue open with Venezuela and will continue to work in this direction,\" a ministry spokeswoman said.She added that the Nobel Prize \"is independent of the Norwegian government\".Machado has for years been campaigning against Maduro, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many nations as illegitimate.She has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year.María Corina Machado wins Nobel Peace PrizeIn honouring her achievement, Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes called Machado a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis.\"Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement. \"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she said.Caracas also closed its embassy in Australia while opening new outposts in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, which it called \"strategic partners in the fight\" against \"hegemonic pressures\".Venezuela's closure of embassies in two close US allies comes after weeks of heightened tension between Caracas and Washington.The US military has destroyed at least four boats that it said were carrying narcotics from Venezuela to the US, killing at least 21 people on board, in what the Trump administration calls a war on drugs. The strikes have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.The last time Norway suffered a diplomatic blow over the Nobel Peace Prize was with China in 2010, when it was awarded to political dissident Liu Xiaobo. Beijing suspended trade and other relations, and only normalised ties with Oslo six years later. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoJoe TidyCyber correspondent, BBC World ServicePeople should plan for potential cyber-attacks by going back to pen and paper, according to the latest advice.The government has written to chief executives across the country strongly recommending that they should have physical copies of their plans at the ready as a precaution.A recent spate of hacks has highlighted the chaos that can ensue when hackers take computer systems down. The warning comes as the National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) reported an increase in nationally significant attacks this year.Criminal hacks on Marks and Spencer, The Co-op and Jaguar Land Rover have led to empty shelves and production lines being halted this year as the companies struggled without their computer systems.Organisations need to \"have a plan for how they would continue to operate without their IT, (and rebuild that IT at pace), were an attack to get through,\" said Richard Horne, chief executive of the NCSC.Firms are being urged to look beyond cyber-security controls toward a strategy known as \"resilience engineering\", which focuses on building systems that can anticipate, absorb, recover, and adapt, in the event of an attack.Plans should be stored in paper form or offline, the agency suggests and include information about how teams will communicate without work email and other analogue work arounds.These types of cyber attack contingency plans are not new but it's notable that the UK's cyber authority is putting the advice prominently in its annual review. Although the total number of hacks that the NCSC dealt with in the first nine months of this year was, at 429, roughly the same as for a similar period last year, there was an increase in hacks with a bigger impact.The number of \"nationally significant\" incidents represented nearly half, or 204, of all incidents. Last year only 89 were in that category.A nationally significant incident covers cyber-attacks in the three highest categories in the NCSC and UK law enforcement categorisation model:Category 1: National cyber-emergency.Category 2: Highly significant incident.Category 3: Significant incident.Category 4: Substantial incident.Category 5: Moderate incident.Category 6: Localised incident.Amongst this year's incidents, 4% (18) were in the second highest category \"highly significant\".This marks a 50% increase in such incidents, an increase for the third consecutive year.The NCSC would not give details on which attacks, either public or undisclosed, fall into which category.But, as a benchmark, it is understood that the wave of attacks on UK retailers in the spring, which affected Marks and Spencer, The Co-op and Harrods, would be classed as a Significant incident.One of the most serious attacks last year, on a blood testing provider, caused major problems for London hospitals. It resulted in significant clinical disruption and directly contributed to at least one patient death. The NCSC would not say which category this incident would fall into.The vast majority of attacks are financially motivated with criminal gangs using ransomware or data extortion to blackmail a victim into sending Bitcoins in ransom.Whilst most cyber-crime gangs are headquartered in Russian or former Soviet countries, there has been a resurgence in teenage hacking gangs thought to be based in English-speaking countries. So far this year seven teenagers have been arrested in the UK as part of investigations into major cyber-attacks. As well as the advice over heightened preparations and collaboration, the government is asking organisations to make better use of the free tools and services offered by the NCSC, for example free cyber-insurance for small businesses that have completed the popular Cyber-Essentials programme.",

    "body": "Nato chief Mark Rutte joked about the condition of Russia's naval fleet on Monday as Moscow denied one of its submarines had to surface because of technical problems. Russia's Black Sea Fleet said the diesel-powered submarine Novorossiysk had surfaced off France to comply with navigation rules in the English Channel, through which it was shadowed by a UK warship and helicopter.Dutch authorities had said on Saturday the submarine was under tow in the North Sea.\"What a change from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel The Hunt for Red October. Today, it seems more like the hunt for the nearest mechanic,\" Rutte said in a speech in Slovenia, saying the \"broken\" vessel was \"limping\" home. Rutte said there was \"hardly any Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean left\". VChK-OGPU, a Telegram channel that publishes purported Russian security leaks, reported on 27 September that fuel was leaking into the hold of the Novorossiysk in the Strait of ­Gibraltar, raising the risk of an explosion.As it was returning from its deployment in the Mediterranean, the Royal Navy said it tracked the vessel over three days, from 7 to 9 October. Taking part in joint Nato efforts, the navy said HMS Iron Duke monitored the surfaced Russian Kilo-class submarine and its support tug as they passed through the Channel and into the North Sea.On Saturday, the Dutch defence ministry said the Dutch navy had then escorted the Novorossiysk and the accompanying towing vessel.The Russian Black Sea Fleet said on Monday that the submarine, part of a group of submarines that carry Kalibr cruise missiles, was conducting a \"scheduled inter-fleet transit\".\"Information disseminated by a number of media outlets about an alleged malfunction and, as a result, the emergency surfacing of the diesel-electric submarine Novorossiysk off the coast of France does not correspond to reality,\" the Russian Black Sea Fleet's press service said, as quoted by Interfax news agency.\"In accordance with international navigation regulations, submarines are to navigate the English Channel only while on the surface,\" it added.The incident comes two weeks after the Royal Navy tracked a Russian frigate and cargo vessel through the Channel. Al Carns, minister for the armed forces, said the navy's latest operation was \"a clear sign of how the UK stands strong with our NATO allies to push back against Russian aggression\". In June, a Russian warship disguised itself using a fake ID signal while travelling through the English Channel with two sanctioned oil tankers, a BBC Verify investigation found.It travelled alongside two vessels known to be part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a network of tankers whose ownership can be obscured and are used to transport sanctioned oil products.",

    "body": "18 hours agoAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spiesThe government is facing questions after a case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed, just weeks before the trial was due to go ahead.In September, prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the charges, sparking a political row over who was to blame.The background to the case is complicated - so here we try and walk you through how we got here and the political impact.What was the case about?Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry - who have both consistently maintained their innocence - were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Why did it collapse?Last week, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.In a rare intervention, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, who is the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales, said the CPS had tried to obtain further evidence from the government \"over many months\" but witness statements did not meet the threshold to prosecute.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.However, some legal experts have questioned whether the CPS would have needed this evidence to go ahead with the prosecution.What was the political fallout?Downing Street has insisted the decision to drop charges was made by the CPS, with no ministers or members of the government involved. The government has maintained that it is frustrated the trial collapsed.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also sought to shift the focus to the previous Conservative government, which was in power when the alleged offences took place.He argued the prosecution could only be based on the Tory government's position at that time, when he says China was not designated a \"threat to national security\".Current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected this claim, pointing out that a number of former senior security and legal officials have also questioned the government's argument.Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat.However, they claim there are hundreds of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence.The Tories have suggested that the PM's national security adviser Jonathan Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it needed to secure convictions.Ministers have insisted Powell had no involvement in the substance or evidence of the case.Why is this a problem for the government?Badenoch has accused the government of deliberately collapsing the trial because \"the prime minister wants to suck up to Beijing\" - something it has denied.Since last year's general election, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China to help achieve its aim of growing the economy.Then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Powell have all visited the country over the past year.The government has insisted its approach to China is rooted in the UK's national interests.However, Badenoch has claimed that following the collapse of the case it seems the PM has been \"too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoEvery paper on Tuesday focuses on the release of Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of a US-brokered plan to end the war in Gaza, which also saw Palestinian prisoners and detainees freed. A number of fronts feature full-page picture spreads - a photograph of hostage Alon Ohel smiling with his family leads the Daily Express, paired with the headline \"The long, painful nightmare is over\".\"Two years of torment over\" declares the Times, picturing hostages Alon Ohel, Evyatar David and Avinatan Or reuniting with their respective loved ones. The paper says US President Donald Trump hailed an \"end of an age of terror and death\" in his speech following the hostage release, and urged members of the Israeli parliament not to resume hostilities.Monday was a \"rare moment of joy among both Israelis and Palestinians\", according to the Guardian, which carries a photograph of people rejoicing in Tel Aviv and another photo of a released Palestinian hugging his son. The paper reports that large crowds also gathered in Khan Younis for the return of nearly 1,700 Palestinians who had been detained during the war, while the West Bank capital Ramallah received 88 detainees who were serving life sentences in Israel. \"We did not give up faith, we did not lose hope\" reads the headline of the i Paper, detailing the \"jubilation and relief\" for Israeli families after the release of the 20 remaining living hostages.The Financial Times leads on Trump's speech to the Israeli parliament, and reports that the president received multiple standing ovations as he \"set out a grand postwar vision\". The paper hones in on the second phase of the ceasefire, which it says diplomats believe will be \"far more complicated\", and notes that it has not been formally agreed to by Israel and Hamas.Trump also used his speech to touch on other peace deals he hopes to broker, and the Telegraph says he told the Knesset that he plans to \"focus on Russia first\". The paper reports that the Ukrainian prime minister and his top aide flew to Washington DC on Monday to begin \"high level talks to strengthen Ukraine's defense\", amid \"mounting\" speculation over the US president's decision to ship Tomohawk weapons to the nation. \"Home and now it's time for peace\" reads the headline of the Metro, alongside a photo of the moment twin Israeli hostages Ziv and Gali Berman reunited.The front page of the Star also focuses on the twins, featuring a full-page photograph of the brothers embracing with the headline \"Hug of love\".All 20 Israeli hostages have been pictured on the front page of the Sun, with the paper declaring they have been \"freed from hell\" after 737 days in captivity.\"Noa's hero is home\" says the Daily Mail, reporting on hostage Avinatan Or being reunited with his girlfriend and former hostage Noa Argamani, who was rescued in 2024. And the Mirror features a poignant image of Mr Or holding his hands up in a heart, calling it a \"message of love for the world\". Its headline is: \"Day we thought we'd never see.\" The hostage and prisoner exchange that has accompanied the ceasefire in the war in Gaza dominates Tuesday's front pages.\"Freed from hell\" is the way the Sun headlines its coverage of the release of hostages after 737 days of captivity - over a photo of 24-year-old Evyatar David - last publicly seen in a Hamas video in August, digging what was described as \"his own grave\".The Daily Mirror says it was a day we thought we'd never see - picturing Avinatan Or making a heart gesture with his hands. He also features on the front of the Daily Mail, reuniting with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who was rescued from captivity in June last year; the paper notes that he managed to hide the fact that he was an Israeli Special Forces soldier from his captors.The Times says two years of torment are over - the Daily Star talks of the \"hug of love\" as it shows the reunion of twins, Gali and Ziv Berman, who had been locked up separately.The Guardian says the truce has brought joy to both Israelis and Palestinians - picturing Israelis celebrating in Tel Aviv - and Palestinians hanging out of bus windows as they celebrate with the crowds below them.The Financial Times says Donald Trump is enjoying his moment in the sun, but warns that peace is not yet a done deal. Writing in the Daily Express, the former British Army commander Richard Kemp says hopes of a lasting peace in the Middle East will need longer than Trump's remaining time in the White House, so his most important task will be to ensure that he is succeeded by someone who shares his commitment to peace through strength.In the meantime, the Daily Telegraph suggests Trump is now looking for his next project, saying he now wants to end the Ukraine war. The former Foreign Secretary William Hague writes, in the Times, that peace could be possible there too, if Trump takes note of his own lesson in Gaza and again backs diplomacy with hard power. It might even lead to that Nobel peace prize at last, he concludes.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "3 hours agoNatalie Shermanbusiness reporterJanani Mohan/Yagappa PhotographyJanani Mohan is missing a sari she wore at her wedding in April, which was also worn by her motherGraduate student Nicole Lobo moved back to the US in late August after a year in the UK, shipping 10 boxes of possessions back home to Philadelphia that she expected to arrive within a few days. Six weeks later, she is still waiting for the shipment - and fears it is lost, destroyed by UPS as the company struggles to handle a flood of packages facing new customs and tariff rules. \"It's been horrific,\" says the 28-year-old, who was notified last month that her boxes would be disposed of, leaving her to make frantic phone calls and send emails to try to head off the outcome. It's an ordeal facing many UPS customers since the Trump administration in late August stopped allowing parcels worth less than $800 to enter the US without inspection, taxes or tariffs.The decision abruptly made an estimated 4 million packages each day subject to new, more onerous processing and documentation rules.As the influx leads to longer processing times and higher, sometimes unexpected, costs across the industry, some customers of UPS like Nicole, say they fear their packages have been lost in the backlog. \"It's beyond comprehension to me,\" says Janani Mohan, a 29-year-old engineer living in Michigan, who has also spent hours on hold and sent repeated emails since a tracking alert listed a box sent by her parents in India as set for disposal.The parcel held her wedding dress, which had also been worn by her mother, an heirloom sari from her grandmother and wedding photos, among other items. \"I literally cried to them on the phone,\" she says. \"Everything in there is very close to my heart.\"Oregon-based Mizuba Tea Co, which has used UPS for more than a decade to import matcha from Japan, has five shipments together worth more than $100,000 held up in processing.The firm has received conflicting alerts about their status, including some saying the items were set for disposal. \"My whole team is basically on scan watch,\" says Lauren Purvis, who runs the business with her family and is now starting to worry about running out of inventory if the limbo continues. \"It's just clear to us that the current importing systems were not prepared to handle the sheer amount of volume and paperwork.\"Mizuba TeaLauren Purvis says her whole team is on \"scan watch\"Importers typically have 10 days after goods enter the US to submit documentation about the goods, pay tariffs and other fees, allowing the package to go to its recipient. But the Trump administration's rapid changes to tariff rules have made it increasingly difficult to meet customs deadlines requirements, say shipping companies like FedEx and UPS, which offer customs services and often act as importers of record.For example, businesses are now responsible for paying tariffs on any steel or aluminium contained in a product , and in many cases vouching for its country of origin - information that many businesses, let alone their shipping companies, do not know. \"Because of changes to US import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance,\" a UPS spokeswoman said. While acknowledging longer shipping times, the company said it was still successfully clearing more than 90% of international packages within a day of arrival. The spokeswoman said its policy was to contact customers three times before moving to dispose of a package. But seven people interviewed by the BBC, including several businesses responsible for shipping the items, said they had received no word from UPS about issues before seeing the tracking alert that their package would be trashed.FedEx, another major player in the industry, said it does not typically destroy packages, unless directed to do so by the shipper. Nicole, the graduate student, says she has been asked to supply more information about her items, which she did promptly in early September.  She did not hear more until seeing the notice about disposal in late September. After the BBC enquired about her package, the tracking information was updated for the first time in weeks to say it was \"on the way\", raising her hopes. Likewise, Janani says the company reached out last week, after the BBC got in touch, for a few more documents and her package now appears to have cleared customs.Swedish Candy LandDaniel and Tobias Johansson, co-founders of Swedish Candy Land, say lost packages have cost their company $50,000But for businesses, the chaos has already had real costs. Swedish candy exporter Swedish Candy Land says more than 700 packages it sent via UPS to customers in the US in the first few weeks of September have been held up.Co-founder Tobias Johansson says the business switched to FedEx after becoming aware of the problem and its shipments were now arriving without incident, although the process took a few days longer than before . But the lost packages, some of which have been reported destroyed, have cost the firm roughly $50,000 in refunds, not including the expenses they incurred in shipping and brokerage fees. \"That was a big hit for us and we haven't gotten any answers yet for anything,\" says Mr Johansson.Experts say the ripple effects are being felt across the supply chain, even on businesses, like Mizuba, that were not bringing in shipments using the $800 exemption from tariffs, known as de minimis.  \"This can be felt pretty much across the board,\" says Bernie Hart, vice president of business development at Flexport, a logistics and customs business. In a call with financial analysts last month, FedEx executives said it had been a \"very stressful period\" for its customers, especially smaller players. \"That is a big headwind,\" chief executive Raj Subramanian said, warning that changes to the trade environment would likely lead to a $1bn hit this year, including $300m in additional expenses as the firm hires and faces other costs related to the new rules. But John Pickel, vice president of supply chain policy for the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents many shipping firms, fears the issues may get worse before they get better. Overall trade volumes last month were lower than is typical, in part because many businesses rushed goods into the US early to beat tariffs. \"There's always been this prevailing thought that companies will figure it out,\" he says. \"What we've seen is that is much harder than anyone anticipated.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoDaniel DaviesWales political correspondentPA MediaFormer first minister Mark Drakeford is the Welsh government's current finance secretaryPublic services have been threatened with big cuts if Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford cannot convince political opponents to support the budget he starts publishing on Tuesday.Worth more than £27bn, the Welsh government's spending plans for next year pays for services from hospitals to bin collections. The Senedd has to vote in favour to approve it, but the Labour government does not have enough members to win those votes without other parties.Welsh Conservatives leader Darren Millar said a budget agreement \"may be possible\" if the government considered policies such as scrapping Welsh stamp duty for primary residential properties. \"We want to see changes to the Welsh government's budget and that's why we're saying if they are prepared to have that conversation about scrapping stamp duty then we are prepared to sit down with them and explore whether a deal might be possible,\" he said.A looming by-election could make the political arithmetic even more difficult.This budget will be inherited by the winner of next year's Senedd election.Drakeford has said he does not want to tie the hands of the next Welsh government.He has promised a budget designed to minimise political wrangling, but negotiations with other parties are inevitable.First Minister Eluned Morgan says she expects the budget that finally gets through the Senedd in the spring to be very different from Tuesday's first outline draft.Minority government'Mass redundancies'On Tuesday, Drakeford will allot money for government departments for 2026-27.A detailed breakdown, with spreadsheets showing funding for public services, will follow on 3 November.Weeks of lobbying and scrutiny will follow - and in the meantime Chancellor Rachel Reeves will publish her budget. Most of the Welsh government's funding comes from her.A vote on the final budget is due on 27 January.If the budget does not pass by the start of the financial year in April the government is only allowed to spend 75% of last year's budget.That would require big cuts, with Morgan warning of \"mass redundancies\".The spending limit rises to 95% if a budget still has not been passed by the end of July.A government can table a budget vote during the financial year, so it could try again after 1 April.Labour's optionsThe Welsh Conservatives said Drakeford should publish a budget that \"delivers for the taxpayer\".The party last week said it would scrap land transaction tax - the Welsh version of stamp duty.Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has not closed the door on talking to the government, but says \"it's Labour's budget\".\"I don't think anybody wants to face a situation where there isn't a budget in place for next year,\" he said.Dodds's spokesperson said she recognised what was at stake for public services.\"That means Jane is ready to listen and work with other parties, something that neither the Conservatives nor Plaid Cymru were willing to do in the last budget,\" they said.Reform, which has one MS after the defection of Laura Ann Jones, said it would not support a budget that continues to fund the Nation of Sanctuary policy.Full list of candidatesThe full list of candidates for the Caerphilly by-election are:Liberal Democrats: Steve AichelerGwlad: Anthony CookGreens: Gareth HughesConservatives: Gareth PotterReform: Llyr PowellUKIP: Roger QuilliamLabour: Richard TunnicliffePlaid Cymru: Lindsay WhittleYou can find out more about the candidates here.BBC Wales is holding a live debate for the candidates of the Caerphilly by-election on 15 October.

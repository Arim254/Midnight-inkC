    "body": "Wolves finally have their man.Rob Edwards' appointment on a three-and-a-half-year contract follows the sacking of Vitor Pereira earlier in November.Edwards arrives at Molineux having left Championship side Middlesbrough, who he joined as head coach in June, but eyebrows have been raised at his choice to leave a side second in the second tier for one eight points adrift of safety, winless and rock bottom of the Premier League.Meanwhile, for Wolves, there is the question whether Edwards is the right man to help them pull off a great escape for a second successive season?The 42-year-old appeared to have set Middlesbrough on the right track after being appointed manager in the summer, but the pull of his former club proved just too strong to resist.It is understood Edwards views the Wolves job as his dream role, having made more than 100 appearances for the Molineux side between 2004 and 2008. He also grew up in nearby Telford and has family in the area.Is Edwards the right appointment? Have your say hereThe gamble for Edwards is that he will need to unite a fractured club where fans' frustrations with the ownership have bubbled over.Swapping a Premier League promotion challenge for a battle to stay in the top flight is brave enough at the best of times, let alone when the club in question appear to have big issues in the background.Anger towards owners Fosun and executive chairman Jeff Shi is widespread, even if the fans are unlikely to achieve their ultimate goal of pressuring Fosun to sell.Wolves are aware of the division and Edwards will be joined by Harry Watling, who takes on the role of assistant head coach and was part of his team at the Riverside Stadium.Sources have also told BBC Sport that Paul Trollope, Joleon Lescott and Conor Coady have been sounded out over potential roles in a new-look backroom staff. The potential additions of Lescott and Coady are rated as difficult to complete - particularly the latter who is still playing for Wrexham.One thing Edwards has to his advantage is his lack of recent involvement at Wolves, this in contrast to other reported candidates.The potential reappointment of former boss Gary O'Neil, sacked 11 months ago and still being paid by the club under the terms of his severance package, could have widened the divide still further.Supporters had turned against O'Neil by the end of his reign last December, while Shi said in the summer the club waited too long to sack him.O'Neil perhaps shrewdly ruled himself out of the running last week. He had concerns about what he would be inheriting, especially the structure off the pitch.That aspect has not put Edwards off.Former England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"I get his connection with Wolves but I think Middlesbrough gave him a big opportunity and this is a huge risk for him as I don't see them staying up. It is a big gamble.\"Where the gamble lies for Wolves is that Edwards' only full-time Premier League managerial experience saw his one season in the top flight with Luton in 2023-24 end in relegation.He guided the Hatters to the Premier League for the first time but was then unable to halt a slide into League One, leaving Kenilworth Road in January of this year.Two Premier League relegations would not look great on Edwards' record, but he is keen on the job and a return to his roots, and will back himself to lead the team away from danger.Edwards won the Premier League 2 title with Wolves Under-23s in 2019, describing the moment as the best in his career at that time.\"It was probably one of the best feelings in 20 years of professional football that I've had. It was amazing, I felt so proud of the boys,\" he said.Now Edwards is at the helm, another career highlight would come with his first game in official charge - Edwards had a two-game caretaker spell in 2016 - against Crystal Palace at Molineux on 22 November.Wolves' 3-0 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday left them winless in the league this season after 11 games.It is just the second time in their history Wolves have failed to win any of their opening 11 league matches - the other being 1983-84 when they were relegated from the top flight.No club has ever survived in the Premier League from this position, leaving Edwards a monumental task to rescue the club's season.January additions will be key - if they are still in touching distance - but Wolves need to revamp their transfer strategy.The sales of Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were the latest high-profile departures after previous exits of Ruben Neves, Pedro Neto, Diogo Jota and Max Kilman.Eventually, selling a team's best players and failing to replace them effectively will prove costly, even with profit and sustainability limitations.There is a desire to add more homegrown players over the next few transfer windows.The club recognise what is missing, with only Sam Johnstone, Matt Doherty, back-up goalkeeper Dan Bentley, young striker Tawanda Chirewa and defender Ki-Jana Hoever classed as homegrown players.Of that group, only Johnstone started the loss to Fulham which ended Pereira's reign.There have been transfer targets in mind.Middlesbrough's Hayden Hackney has been discussed previously at Wolves, and the England Under-21 international turned down a £20m move to Ipswich in the summer to stay at the Riverside.He has enjoyed working with Edwards at Middlesbrough, believing staying for his development and not making a move to another Championship club was better for his career.Even with the Edwards link, attracting players of that ilk - or indeed any player -would be a problem for Wolves in January if they are cut adrift and have little hope of survival.There surely will be additions, though, with an acceptance Wolves must spend again after needing to sign Marshall Munetsi and Emmanuel Agbadou last winter to aid their survival hopes.A flurry of signings followed in the summer as attacker Fer Lopez, winger Jhon Arias, left-back David Moller Wolfe, right-back Jackson Tchatchoua, striker Tolu Arokodare and defender Ladislav Krejci arrived. Krejci aside, they have taken too long to adapt to the Premier League and Pereira argued they were not top of his target list, some being fifth-choice picks.Pereira was unhappy at the speed Wolves moved in the summer as moves for Marc Pubill, Juanlu Sanchez and Christantus Uche - who eventually joined Crystal Palace - failed to get finalised.The upheaval at Wolves has also gone beyond the departure of Pereira.Domenico Teti, the head of professional football, left Molineux two days after the head coach, having joined in June following a shake-up which involved the departure of former sporting director Matt Hobbs.Wolves will be looking to replace Teti, although it may mean a more prominent role for Matt Jackson - the director of player recruitment and development - in the interim.Wolves feel this year has seen them start on a new cycle in terms of recruitment and more conservative spending power.But after appointing their fifth manager in four years it all feels very familiar.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterFoster's beer drinkers in the UK will soon find their lager's alcohol strength cut to 3.4%.Heineken UK, which brews Foster's, said cutting the alcohol strength from the current 3.7% would make the lager eligible for lower rates of alcohol duty.The brewer hinted at cheaper pints saying \"customers benefit from more competitive pricing\" because of the lower tax charge.The change is set to go into effect by February, marking the second time in three years that Foster's alcohol percentage, or ABV, has been diluted. Heineken UK said it was responding to changes in UK government policy, which have encouraged brewers to offer lower alcohol options.The government introduced a new system of alcohol duties based on strength in August 2023, which made less alcoholic beers and ciders relatively cheaper compared to more powerful alternatives.Since then, rival brews Carlsberg Pilsner, Sol, Coors Light and Grolsch have also been reformulated to an ABV below 3.4% to qualify for the lower rate of tax in the UK.It insisted punters would not notice the difference, after \"extensive\" consumer testing.\"Our master brewers have spent many months refining the recipe to ensure the taste remains unmistakably Foster's - crisp, balanced, and refreshing,\" the brewing giant saidHeineken said there had been a \"continued shift\" in beer-drinking trends, toward lower-ABV options \"as part of a balanced and health-conscious lifestyle\".Heineken last month said its global beer sales would fall next year as drinkers cut back because of pressure on their household budgets.In its third quarter results, the global brewer said the UK had bucked the  global trend of falling beer volume sales, which it blamed on squeezed consumer budgets.Alongside making beers such Birra Moretti, Sol, Strongbow cider and the eponymous Heineken, the company also operates close to 2,400 pubs in the UK under its Star Group subsidiary.",

She previously served as commissioner from 2012 to 2019.Calling her an \"extraordinary public servant\", Lammy said: \"Her leadership shaped the Victims' Code, strengthened victims' voices in the criminal justice system, and ensured that the Victims and Prisoners Act progressed with victims' interests at its heart.\"She championed the rights of victims and witnesses and held agencies to account.\" Her office said Baroness Newlove \"consistently led by example\", and that she \"reshaped the office into a trusted voice and genuine force for victims\".It added that she was driven by her own experience of the criminal justice system.In August 2007, her 47-year-old husband was killed when he confronted a gang of youths who had vandalised their car, in Warrington, Cheshire.At the time, the court heard that he was kicked \"like a football\" in front of his daughters during the attack. Three teenagers were convicted of his murder in January 2008, and Lady Newlove was made a life peer for her work on youth crime in 2010.\"She was determined that all victims should be treated with compassion, decency and respect - and she consistently led by example,\" her office said.Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Barker said her dedication to defend victims regardless of who was in government at the time, \"a very laudable thing to witness\".Conservative frontbencher Lord Kamall remembered her as a \"fierce campaigner\", while independent crossbencher Baroness O'Loan, hailed her as a \"very lovely person\".The former police ombudsman for Northern Ireland added that she was \"so brave and effective in all that she did\".He added: \"She will be sorely missed, not only by her family, to whom I'm sure we all send great sympathy, but also by so many of us in this House and in the world beyond\".",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 11 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterApple has faced a wave of online mockery following its announcement of a new carrying case for its iPhone range.The US tech giant was ridiculed after it revealed the iPhone Pocket on Tuesday would retail for £219.95, despite it being little more than a novel way to carry a mobile device.Many took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of everyday knitted footwear - with one X user calling it \"$230 for a cut up sock\". And the popular tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said it was a \"litmus test\" for fans who \"buy or defend anything Apple releases\".In a press release, Apple said the brightly-coloured accessory was part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake.The late fashion designer previously worked with the tech firm to create the black turtleneck jumpers famously worn by the company's co-founder Steve Jobs.Apple said the product had been inspired by \"a piece of cloth\", and its concept came from \"the idea of creating an additional pocket\".The bag's short strap design will be available in eight colours, and the long strap in three colours.The announcement drew criticism on social media, with many suggesting it showed Apple fans would \"pay for anything\".The bag's open top and sock-like structure also caught flak, with one X user saying: \"no zip, no structure and considering how many thefts of iPhones there are these days... no security?\"And some even posted tongue-in-cheek pictures of the actor Sasha Baron Cohen as the fictional character Borat, suggesting the product bore similarity to his bright green mankini.But others came to its defence, pointing out the price could be because of the collaboration with Issey Miyake, calling it \"a nod to the history of Apple\". Social media consultant and analyst Matt Navara told the BBC the price tag looked to be less about \"function\" but more about \"form, branding and exclusivity\".\"This kind of pricing is not new in the world of luxury fashion or designer collabs,\" he said.\"But for most consumers, it feels like Apple is testing the limits of brand loyalty.\"",

    "body": "Ukraine's energy and justice ministers have resigned in the wake of a major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko's removal on Wednesday. On Monday anti-corruption bodies accused several people of orchestrating a embezzlement scheme in the energy sector worth about $100m (£76m), including at the national nuclear operator Enerhoatom.Some of those implicated in the scandal are - or have been - close associates of Zelensky's.The allegation is that Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and other key ministers and officials received payments from contractors building fortifications against Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Among those alleged to be involved are former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95. He has since reportedly fled the country. Halushchenko said he would defend himself against the accusations, while Grynchuk said on social media: \"Within the scope of my professional activities there were no violations of the law.\"The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the investigation - which was 15 months in the making and involved 1,000 hours of audio recordings - uncovered the participation of several members of the Ukrainian government. According to Nabu, the people involved systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Prosecutors alleged that the scheme's proceeds were laundered through an office in Kyiv linked to the family of former Ukrainian lawmaker and current Russian senator Andriy Derkach.Nabu has been releasing new snippets of its investigation and wiretaps every day and on Tuesday it promised more would come.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants. It will also shine a spotlight on corruption in Ukraine, which continues to be endemic despite work by Nabu and Sap in the 10 years since they were created. In July, nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing the independence of Nabu and Sap. Ukrainians feared the nation could lose the coveted status of EU candidate country which it was granted on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption. Kyiv's European partners also expressed severe alarm at the decision, with ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressing the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.The backlash was the most severe to hit the Ukrainian government since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate the freedom of the two anti-corruption bodies.Yet for some that crisis brought into question Zelensky's dedication to anti-corruption reforms. The latest scandal threatens to lead to more awkward questions for the Ukrainian president. ",

They have presented the programme together since 2014.Speaking to reporters after the investiture, Daly said: \"This is probably the greatest honour of my career and it still feels quite surreal to be honest with you.\"I've been working in television for 25 years, and it's a job I absolutely love to do.\"It was a real privilege to be in a room of people who have made a difference in their communities, who have built incredible careers. It was a very inspiring environment.\"She attended the ceremony with her husband Vernon Kay and her two children.She added: \"His Majesty put me at ease - I was quite nervous.\"We talked about the show and I know the Queen enjoys it.\"She sent me a letter of congratulations when I received the MBE which meant the world.\"ReutersThe pair scooped a Bafta for the entertainment programme category at the 2024 TV awards.Daly and Winkleman announced in a post on Instagram last month that they would be leaving Strictly.The BBC said the duo's final appearance would be this year's Christmas special show on 25 December.Speaking about her forthcoming departure Daly said there's \"no show like it\".\"I will miss it but I'm quite looking forward to a lie-in on Saturday morning - and new ventures in the new year.\"Asked who will replace her, she said: \"I have no idea, it's not up to me.\"I'll be watching at home with Claudia - we'll be watching the launcher together!\"Daly first appeared on screens in 1999 when she hosted The Big Breakfast's Find Me A Model competition on Channel 4.She has presented Strictly since the first series 21 years ago alongside the late Sir Bruce Forsyth. Winkleman joined in 2014, having hosted sister show It Takes Two since 2004.Winkleman and Daly were prime-time Saturday night TV's first female presenting duo.The pair picked up the entertainment programme gong at the Bafta TV Awards in 2024.Daly also presented the annual charity appeal show BBC Children In Need, which she co-hosted with the late Sir Terry Wogan several times.PALady Anita May is best known for playing Angie Watts, the stalwart pub landlady in EastEndersAlso at the investiture was former EastEnders star Anita Dobson, best known for playing Queen Vic landlady Angie Watts on the BBC soap, who was made an OBE for services to charitable fundraising and philanthropy.Shadow housing secretary Sir James Cleverly also received his knighthood, which he was awarded in Rishi Sunak's resignation honours list and Det Supt Katherine Goodwin, the Met Police chief who led the manhunt for the murderer of Sarah Everard in 2021, received the King's Police Medal.Her investigation led to the conviction of Met police officer Wayne Couzens.

    "body": "4 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterAdele is to swap music for acting when she makes her film debut in the next movie by former fashion designer Tom Ford.The singer will appear alongside big names including Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Colin Firth, Paul Bettany and Adolescence's breakthrough star Owen Cooper in Cry to Heaven.It will be adapted from Anne Rice's 1982 novel, which is set in the 18th Century world of the \"castrati\" - male singing stars who were castrated to preserve their high voices.Ford will direct, produce and write the film, but details of the roles to be played by Adele and the other cast members have not yet been revealed.The book follows the story of two castrati who become successful opera singers  in Venice and whose lives are intertwined.The cast will also include Ciarán Hinds, George MacKay, Mark Strong, Hunter Schafer and Thandiwe Newton, according to US media including Deadline, which first reported the news. A spokesman for Ford has confirmed it to BBC News.Adele, one of Britain's most popular music stars, released her last album four years ago and has been largely out of the limelight since she ended a Las Vegas residency a year ago.She said she was planning to take \"a big break\" after last year's run of live shows, and wanted to \"do other creative things just for a little while\".Ford, meanwhile, has been one of the biggest names in fashion, but has also made two highly acclaimed and stylish films - A Single Man, starring Firth and Hoult, in 2009; and Nocturnal Animals, which earned him two Bafta nominations, in 2016.He sold his self-titled fashion house to Estee Lauder for $2.8bn (£2.4bn) in 2022, before saying he would \"say goodbye to fashion\" and \"spend the next 20 years of my life making films\".\"I loved making the two films that I made. That was the most fun I've ever had in my entire life,\" he told GQ.",

    "body": "A British couple jailed in Iran after being accused of espionage have gone on hunger strike in a \"cry out for help\", their son has told the BBC.Craig and Lindsay Foreman were on an around-the-world motorbike trip when they were arrested by Iranian authorities in January.Joe Bennett, Lindsay's son, described the charges against them as \"ludicrous\". He said his mother had told him \"not eating was the only power she's got\", in the seven-and-a-half minute phone call she was permitted on Tuesday. \"She said she felt lost and let down by the government here as well as the authorities in Iran,\" he added. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) has been approached for comment.The Foremans' family say they entered Iran with valid visas, a licensed guide and a pre-approved itinerary - as rules there stipulate.Lindsay Foreman had been asking people along the route what it means to live a good life.It appears this is what led to their detainment by the Iranian authorities. She has been accused of asking questions that could prompt regime change, Mr Bennett said. The couple have appeared in court several times but have not been officially tried - or convicted. Both are currently in the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran.Mr Bennett met UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper last month to discuss the case.The UK government advises against all travel to Iran because of a \"significant risk\" of arrest, and says having a British passport or connections to the UK \"can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you\".The FCDO previously said it \"continued to raise the case of Mr and Ms Foreman directly with the Iranian authorities\" and was providing them with consular assistance. Mr Bennett has only been able to speak to his mother three times since her arrest. The couple, both in their 50s,  were only allowed their first phone calls home in August, after several months of no direct contact.Mr Bennett told the BBC he wasn't sure if the hunger strike had help secure the phone call, or when it had started.\"She was crying and I had to try not to cry on the call because I wanted to stay strong for her and pass the strength on,\" he added.He said his mother was \"usually a very positive person\" and it was the first time he'd heard his mother upset.\"Positivity only lasts so long against reality,\" he said. \"It's just a cry out for help.\"The Foremans were initially held in the city of Kerman and spent 30 days in solitary confinement before being allowed to share a cell. They are now both in separate cells in Iran's Evin jail, where British-Iranian activist Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was imprisoned before her release in 2022. She also went on hunger strike, several times. The Foremans had apparently been promised they would be able to see each other last Sunday but the visit didn't take place.The last time they saw each was during a visit from the British embassy six weeks ago, Mr Bennett said. Another consular visit is due to take place on Sunday.He appealed to the UK to do more to secure their release and specifically state that the couple were not spying for the British government.\"They were having a lovely time visiting Iran,\" he said. \"They couldn't have commended the country more... they were saying it was a beautiful country.\"\"The charges against them are completely bonkers,\" he added.Mr Bennett said the phone call with his mother ended abruptly. He doesn't know when he will hear from her again. Her last words to him were: \"I love you loads and I miss you,\" he said.\"And I said the same to her - 'I love you so so much'. And that's when I started crying, I couldn't hold it together any more.\"Additional reporting by Ruth Comerford.",

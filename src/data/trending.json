    "body": "Norris keen to 'live a normal few days' and 'forget I drive in F1'Media caption, 'Winning made everything worth it' - Norris on F1 title and what's to come in the futureByF1 Correspondent in Abu DhabiLando Norris says he is looking forward to switching off and forgetting all about the year in which he achieved his lifetime's ambition of winning the Formula 1 World Championship.The McLaren driver spent Sunday night into Monday morning celebrating in Abu Dhabi, before digesting his triumph with BBC Sport in a hotel on Yas Island, a stone's throw from the F1 track.Norris is relaxed, good humoured and chatty as he reviews his journey.Next, he is heading to the McLaren factory, to analyse this year, and for work in the simulator, already thinking about next season.There are more celebrations to come this week, including picking up the official championship trophy at a prizegiving ceremony in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on Friday, before the McLaren Christmas party in London on Saturday.And then, breathe.\"Honestly,\" Norris says, \"try to forget this season, try to forget a little bit what we've been able to achieve together. Forget that I drive in Formula 1.\"I don't want to forget what we've achieved this season, but just try to live a normal few days of the year, and go play some golf and do some normal things and that's it.\"The realisation of what he has achieved is beginning to dawn on the 26-year-old Briton but he says he \"still finds it very surreal\".\"I was just by the pool earlier,\" he says. \"And when someone says, 'Congrats, world champ' or something, it's definitely got a very different ring to it (than) when it's just 'Congrats, Lando,' or whatever it may be.\"I don't know. It's such a sizeable achievement.\"Making parents proud 'the best thing you can ask for'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris is embraced by his mum Cisca and dad Adam just after the conclusion of the Abu Dhabi Grand PrixAt the celebrations, and waiting for him in the lobby of the hotel, were his father Adam and mother Cisca. The family are wealthy, thanks to Adam Norris' success as a pension trader, which made him a multi-millionaire.But becoming an elite sportsman still means starting learning your trade at a very young age, and a lot of personal sacrifices.\"Everything is different for everyone,\" he says, \"so the sacrifices you've made are just very different sacrifices to all the people in the world have made. So I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.\"But still as a family you want to spend time together. And that's something we've not really done a lot of since I started when I was like seven, eight years old.\"My dad was taking me everywhere. I spent a lot more time with my dad than I did with my mum. My mum was at home looking after my sisters.\"I see my mum 20 days a year maybe, something like that. Which is not a lot.\"But certainly winning and having the achievement we did yesterday made everything feel more worth it, all those times away.\"One thing that everyone wants to do, is make their parents proud. So the fact I got to do that yesterday, I hope make them even more proud, is the best thing you can ask for.\"Proving himself wrong and 'a brutal honesty'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris, then 15, celebrates winning the 2015 MSA Formula Championship (now known as the F4 British Championship) - 10 years before he reached the pinnacle of motorsportNorris says he's \"seen a lot of photos over the last 12 hours; a lot of little me\".One of them is of him doing donuts in a kart when he was still a small boy. What would he tell little Lando if he could talk to him now?\"Probably just to have a bit more belief in myself,\" he says, \"because it's something I never really had when I was younger. It's something I always lacked.\"In that video, I was so small. I was never the big kid or never the aggressive one, that kind of thing. I'm still the same, I think, now. I would just get my elbows out a little bit more. That's probably my only thing.\"This sort of vulnerability is Norris' trademark. It was evident after the race, too, when he said he was \"proud that I've proved myself wrong\".I ask what he meant, and he says it was a reference to his difficult first part of the season, when his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took the initiative, and the championship lead, and had won four races before Norris had taken his second.By the time of the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August, Piastri had a 34-point lead over Norris and seemed a certain bet for the title, only for Norris to rally and overhaul it all.\"When Oscar was doing a better job than me and I wasn't doing a great job, I was like, 'Well, you know, maybe they're just a bit better. Maybe they can just be more consistent, get more out of the car,'\" Norris says.\"I just never thought at times that it was possible. So for me to then do that for myself, to kind of go, 'You're wrong, you can do it,' is a pretty incredible feeling to have for yourself.\"I wouldn't say I'm a very selfish person, but I've also learned at times I almost have to be more selfish with some of these feelings and thoughts. I need that to almost make me a better and stronger driver.\"It's just nice to almost make myself have more confidence. But I often only do that when I prove it to myself. I've always had that thought of, 'Oh, the next step is such a big leap. Am I ever going to be able to perform at the level I need to perform at?' I have more doubts than positive thoughts at those times.\"But I've also changed a lot this season. I also feel through the year I've been able to be in a much better place, be a lot more confident in myself, change my whole approach and mentality.\"It's a trademark of all great F1 drivers that they look hard at themselves, analyse their weaknesses, and work out ways to improve, and keep doing it throughout their career.Norris is unusual, though, in that he speaks about that process so openly. Why?\"Great question,\" he says. \"I don't know, truthfully. I don't know why sometimes I tell you guys as much stuff as I do.\"Sometimes I get told I shouldn't and sometimes I probably do tell too much, or reveal too much, and people can see vulnerabilities in that and so forth.\"Maybe at times that's a mistake. But at the same time at least I'm being truthful to my own self. If I'm doing a bad job, I tell myself I'm doing a bad job and I certainly have people around me telling me the truth about things.\"What I hate the most is the opposite, is doing a bad job and someone going, 'That's all right, you'll be fine, things will just get better.' Because it's just not the case.\"I hate that kind of mentality and approach, and I've certainly not been brought up in that way. People around me have certainly not been like that.\"It's very much a brutal honesty which has made me the person I am today. But I'm also just I think quite an open, honest person, I will just say what I believe.\"How Monaco lap made him cry and 'flipped everything'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris set a new track record of 1:09.954 in taking pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix in MayNorris has achieved so much this year. Along with the world title, he has won the two races every driver dreams of winning - Monaco and his home grand prix at Silverstone.What else is there left to do? He smiles.\"I would have loved to make my life a bit easier and win it just earlier next time,\" he says. \"But I won ones that people have dreams of winning. They're some of the most incredible ones.\"The lap I did in Monaco in qualifying was the only other time probably in the last 10 years that I cried a little bit over something.\"It was the one other moment this season that I proved myself wrong, because I had that bad run of results.\"I just couldn't perform in qualifying. Qualifying has always been my strong suit, my best. It's been my strength since I was in karting. All my qualifying results are my thing and they weren't at the beginning of the season.\"I went to the hardest track to do a qualifying lap. It's not been my best track in the past.\"I turned off my (lap time cockpit display) delta for the first time that weekend so I couldn't see if I was on a better lap, worse lap, whatever it was.\"For me to then to go there and put in that lap at the end of qualifying was one of the best moments of my career, because it was the time I almost doubted myself the most ever, in the most important season that it turned out to be.\"But that one lap - one minute nine seconds - was all it needed for me to flip everything and turn that thought of 'I just don't know if I've got this' to 'I can definitely do this'. That was a pivotal moment for me up here (he points to his head).\"We end by discussing what he will take from this year into next. And he gives another revealing answer.\"I take a lot,\" he says, \"plenty of things that I know I could have done better, I should have done better.\"But I did what I had to in the end. It was crazy close. Two points is all it was to Max (Verstappen). That's pretty insane, especially when he was so far back.\"What do I take? I take that I can do it. I do have what it takes.\"I had my flaws. I had my mistakes. But I'm confident, and I have the confidence now that I can look at them, review them, analyse them, not make them again and do even better next season.\"",

    "body": "A three-year-old girl was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza on Sunday, according to local sources inside the Palestinian territory.Ahed Tareq al-Bayouk was reportedly playing near her family's tent in Mawasi, Rafah, southern Gaza, when she was shot.The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that it was \"not aware of a strike\" but would \"conduct an additional review\" as more information was provided.Since a ceasefire came into effect in October, at least 370 people have been killed in Gaza including 140 children, according to Amnesty International. Ahed al-Bayouk's death appears to have taken place on the Palestinian side of the so-called Yellow Line, behind which Israeli troops agreed to withdraw as part of the first phase of a US plan to end fighting in the region.Phase one also required the return of all 20 living and 28 dead hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.All have been returned except for the remains of an Israeli police officer, Ran Gvili, 24, who is believed to have been shot and killed while trying to repel the attack in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Since then, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.The World Health Organization says at least 16,500 wounded or seriously ill Palestinians are in urgent need of evacuation for lifesaving medical treatment outside Gaza.International media, including the BBC, are prevented by Israel from reporting independently from inside Gaza.On Saturday, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar, said the current situation was more of a \"pause\" than a ceasefire and his country was working with the US, Turkey and Egypt to push the plan towards phase two.This would involve the establishment of an interim governing authority in Gaza, the deployment of an international security force, the disarmament of Hamas, and Israel's eventual withdrawal from the territory.The plan is to be overseen by a Board of Peace chaired by US President Donald Trump.It also sets out how redevelopment and reform might create \"a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\".After talks in Jerusalem with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the eventual creation of a Palestinian state could be the best route to \"a new Middle East\".But standing alongside him, Netanyahu reiterated his opposition to the two-state solution.The \"purpose of a Palestinian state,\" he argued, \"is to destroy the one and only Jewish state\".\"We believe there is a path to advance a broader peace with the Arab states, and a path also to establish a workable peace with our Palestinian neighbours, but we're not going to create a state that will be committed to our destruction,\" he added.The Israeli and German leaders did agree that the second phase of the American plan should be advanced as soon as Mr Gvili's remains were returned.Netanyahu is expected to discuss the next phase of the plan when he meets Trump in the US on 29 December.",

    "body": "A magnitude 7.6 earthquake has hit north-eastern Japan, with reports thousands have been ordered to evacuate their homes.The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31 miles), about  80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen.Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said at least seven people had been injured and warned residents to stay alert for new tremors for another week.Addressing citizens affected by the earthquake, she said: \"Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking.\"Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency.The government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said.\"We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,\" he added.Some bullet train services have been suspended along the north-eastern coast.No irregularities were reported at the Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said.None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency.Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011.That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries, with a tremor occurring at least every five minutes.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDaniela Relph,Senior royal correspondentandNoor Nanji,Culture reporterThe Duke of Sussex's access to security when he visits the UK is under review, sources have told the BBC.In May, Prince Harry lost a legal case to have his police protection reinstated when visiting the UK.In a BBC interview after the ruling, he said it was not safe to bring his family back to the country of his birth because he could not guarantee their safety.It is understood a Home Office review will now look at whether he should automatically receive full police protection on visits to the UK even though he is no longer a working member of the royal family.Sources close to the prince say this level of security review is long overdue. According to The Sun newspaper, the process for reassessing the duke's threat level is already under way and a decision is expected next month.King Charles has only met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children once before. He last saw his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.Prince Harry's security was downgraded after he stepped back from frontline royal duties in 2020 and moved to the US with the Duchess of Sussex.In his legal challenge earlier this year, he contested the decision-making process used by a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office.Ravec had concluded that because Prince Harry was going to be an infrequent visitor to the UK, his security needs would be assessed on a case by case basis.But in doing so, the duke's legal team argued that Ravec did not properly re-assess the threats he faced when considering his situation in 2020.His lawyers had argued that he had been \"singled out\" for \"inferior treatment\", but the court ruling upheld that there had been nothing unlawful about how the decision had been reached.A senior judge ruled that Prince Harry's \"sense of grievance\" over how the decision to alter his security was reached did not amount to a basis for a successful appeal.That decision meant the duke's security remained outside the automatic, high level of protection which is provided for senior royals.Speaking to BBC News in California shortly afterwards, Prince Harry said he was \"devastated\" at losing his appeal.He also said any prospect of a return to the UK for him and his family was \"impossible\" in light of the Court of Appeal ruling, adding: \"I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\"At the time, Buckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\"A government spokesperson said: \"The UK Government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate.\"It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoDouglas FraserScotland business and economy editorGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his \"prince\" title in October The St Andrews golf course named after the former Prince Andrew is to be rebranded. The Duke's Course, which is three miles from the centre of the Fife university town, will become the Craigtoun Course, after a nearby country park. A heathland course unlike the links which dominate the home of golf, the Duke's was opened by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in 1995.He later became captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which is based in St Andrews.Getty ImagesAndrew is a keen golfer and attended the 2018 Open at Carnoustie as a spectatorAndrew has given up his honorary membership, as part of his retreat from public life in the wake of the scandal about his close friendship with the paedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The course and club are also to come under the management of the St Andrews Links Trust on a long-term lease. The club's logo is also being changed, to remove the royal association.An illustration featuring trees will replace a lion rampant holding a saltire flag.The trust already runs seven public courses around the Fife town, including the world famous Old Course, which hosts the Open Championship every five years. Until 5 January, the Duke's will continue to be run by golf resort operator Kohler, alongside its ownership of the Old Course Hotel.From then on it will be know as the Craigtoun Course.Private estateFollowing a growing public outcry about his links to Epstein, Andrew was stripped of titles such as the Duke of York and his status as prince, becoming Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.As part of that announcement in October, Andrew was also to leave Royal Lodge and to move into some other accommodation in Sandringham, the King's private estate in Norfolk.Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.A press release confirmed the course would take on a \"revitalised identity\" but it did not mention the former prince.Neil Coulson, chief executive of St Andrews Links Trust, said: \"The agreement for The Craigtoun Course will see the first new course added to the Home of Golf's portfolio in 18 years and presents an ideal opportunity to expand the golf experiences we offer.\"We are delighted to have reached agreement with the Old Course Hotel and look forward to taking over what it is already a significant asset for St Andrews and Scotland and building on its reputation.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterDepartment for TransportThe government has unveiled its branding for Great British Railways (GBR), marking a step forward in plans to nationalise the railways.In the past year, the government has taken three rail franchises back into public control, something Labour promised in its manifesto.The new livery and branding uses a red, white and blue colour scheme to mirror the Union Flag and will be used on GBR trains, at stations and on its website and app. While the Budget included plans to freeze rail fares next year, the government has previously said it cannot guarantee customers will see lower prices under renationalisation. The rollout of the design, which was created in-house, is expected to take place gradually, with passengers beginning to see the trains across the national network from next spring. Through December, the design will be displayed at stations, including London Bridge, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, Leeds City, and Manchester Piccadilly.The Railways Bill, which will allow for the creation of GBR, is currently making its way through the House of Commons. The government has said it is renationalising the railways so it is \"owned by the public, delivering for the public, not for private shareholders\".The rollout of GBR will also include an app, which will let customers check train times and book trains without booking fees. Disabled passengers will also be able to use the app to book assistance. Department for TransportA mock up of what the GBR app might look like Seven train operators are already in public hands, accounting for about a third of journeys, with the franchises being acquired as their contracts have expired. Franchises which have been nationalised in the past year include Greater Anglia, South Western Railway, and c2c, with more expected to follow in 2026. The GBR logo is the distinctive double-arrow logo currently used by National Rail, which looks after Britain's rail infrastructure, and was created in the 1960s as the logo of British Rail - the state-owned company which previously operated Britain's railways.  Department for TransportTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander said that the new design \"isn't just a paint job\", and that it represents \"a new railway, casting off the frustrations of the past and focused entirely on delivering a proper public service for passengers\".Jacqueline Starr, executive chair and chief executive of Rail Delivery Group - a collection of Britain's train operators - welcomed the government's commitment to improving services for customers. \"We will continue to work closely with industry partners to support a smooth transition to Great British Railways,\" she said.

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterActivewear brand Sweaty Betty has become involved in a new dispute over advertising slogans, which a period underwear company claims were copied.Kelly Newton said Sweaty Betty's use of two taglines that were very similar to her firm Nixi Body's \"seemed a little off\", and while she could not get them trademarked she felt Sweaty Betty was \"taking from\" other female founders.Sweaty Betty said the \"No ifs. Just butt.\" line had been used by many brands and influencers, but also said it was reviewing all its marketing campaigns.Ms Newton said she was speaking out after seeing personal trainer Georgina Cox reveal Sweaty Betty had offered her a settlement over a disputed slogan.Ms Newton, who co-founded Nixi Body in 2019, said the company has advertised its leak-proof period underwear with the lines \"Keeping you moving through menstruation, motherhood and menopause\" and \"No leaks. No ifs. Just butts.\" for years.But late last year a friend alerted her to a Sweaty Betty ad for its femtech range of leak-resistant and maternity leggings with the tagline \"Keeping you moving through menstruation, maternity and menopause\". At first, Ms Newton thought it could have been a coincidence, and said she was annoyed but did not feel there was anything she could do.That tagline has since been changed on the Sweaty Betty website to \"Menstruation. Maternity. Menopause. Together we're raising the bar for every woman, for any life stage.\"Then, earlier this year, she noticed Sweaty Betty was running a campaign with the line \"No ifs. Just butt.\"\"I thought 'oh hang on a second',\" Ms Newton told the BBC.Again, Ms Newton said she didn't reach out. She said she had tried to get the \"Keeping you moving through menstruation, motherhood and menopause\" line trademarked but was unable to do so, and said she knew that legally she had little recourse.\"Legally they were within their rights to use these words, but they're words that we've used for quite a few years.”It was personal trainer Ms Cox sharing her story about dealing with the brand that made her want to speak out, Ms Newton said.Last month Ms Cox revealed that Sweaty Betty had offered her £4,000 in exchange for confidentiality over the use of the phrase \"Wear The Damn Shorts\" that she claims was used without crediting her in its latest campaigns.She told the BBC she came up with the slogan alongside her sister in 2020 and it quickly went viral. In 2023, Sweaty Betty approached her to use it in a campaign and paid her £3,500 to do so. She was also paid for another campaign using it in 2024, but was not approached about it for this year.Ms Newton said she felt compelled to speak out about her experience after talking to Ms Cox, because she was not the only person affected.\"Your tagline can't be empowering all women when actually all you're doing is taking from them,\" she said, adding that she was not seeking compensation but rather for Sweaty Betty to be accountable.\"It just feels like for me all the slogans I'm seeing are coming from other female founders.\"I just want them to do the right thing and just morally acknowledging what they've done isn't great and to do better really.\"Sweaty Betty said it chose words \"to empower women through fitness\" to advertise its femtech range, something many brands try to do, which \"sometimes… means the language used by different brands aligns\".\"We have been using the phrase for over a year and Nixi has not been in touch with us about our use of it. The phrase is used by many brands in various forms and that is why no individual or brand can claim exclusive rights to it or trademark it,\" the company said in a statement.\"It is never our intent to take credit for the work or creativity of others, particularly from trailblazing women, and we have reached out to Nixi Body directly to convey this. We have also been undertaking a review of all our campaigns and marketing language to fully understand the origins of the phrases we use and will continue to do this. \"We note that such a review was conducted with respect to the 'Wear the Damn Shorts' phrase and its origins date back to at least as early as 2019, before either Ms Cox or Sweaty Betty first used the phrase. We continue to work towards a resolution with Ms Cox, as has always been our objective, however this dispute remains ongoing.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoKatya AdlerBBC Europe editorUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has met key European allies as he faces US pressure to reach a swift peace deal with Russia.In London, Zelensky held talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.The meeting came amid US efforts to get Moscow and Kyiv to sign up - quickly - to a plan to end the war in Ukraine.For Kyiv, the crucial, thorny issues are the question of ceding territory to Russia as part of any peace deal and obtaining strong security guarantees to ensure that Moscow respects an eventual agreement.Ahead of the meeting in London, Starmer insisted - as he often has in the past - that Ukraine needed \"hard-edged security guarantees\". He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv must determine its own future, not have conditions imposed on it.The big names Starmer hosted in London discussed hugely significant issues - not only for Ukraine's future, but for the security of the continent as a whole.There's concern that if Russia is \"rewarded\" by being given Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, it could feel emboldened to attack other European countries in the future.But will Monday's talks in London make any meaningful difference to peace negotiations?The visuals of Europe's arguably most influential nations standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street tell one story. But when it comes to Washington, European leaders are walking a tightrope.In its National Security Strategy published on Friday, the US pointed the finger of blame at Europeans over Ukraine, accusing them of having \"unrealistic expectations\" as to how the war might end.Although they have not publicly commented on the document, behind closed doors Europe's leaders fear Donald Trump is keen for a quick fix in Ukraine, so he can turn his attentions elsewhere. But a quick fix, they worry, will not mean a long-lasting peace - only a temporary pause in Russian aggression in Ukraine and possibly further afield in Europe.Recent incidents including unmanned drones causing chaos in civilian airports in Germany, Denmark, Belgium and elsewhere, an act of railway sabotage in Poland that could have cost lives and significant cyber-attacks across the continent have all been laid at Russia's door. They have brought the war in Ukraine closer to Europeans, however far they are from the front line. With that has come a sense that Russia would like to weaken their continent as a whole.But we do not hear those European concerns broadcast loudly in public.For the most part, leaders continue to praise Trump. On Monday, Starmer said the US president had progressed peace negotiations \"the furthest we've got in the four years\" in just a few weeks. He added that talks were complicated, but progress was being made.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that he was \"sceptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the US side\",  but added \"we have to talk about it\".The fact is, European leaders don't want to provoke the US president over differences on how to achieve peace.Donald Trump has flip-flopped dramatically in his attitudes towards Kyiv since he returned to the White House. He has a pretty tempestuous relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, whereas he has often praised Vladimir Putin.Washington has already stopped direct aid to Ukraine - although it still provides much-needed intelligence to its military and allows European countries to purchase US weapons which are then sent on to Kyiv.European nations are not in a position to support Ukraine militarily without the US.After decades of under-investment in their militaries, they are not in a position to take on the security and defence of their own continent alone, either.The US is the biggest and most powerful member of Nato. Europe looks to Washington for intelligence, command and control capabilities, for air force capabilities - such as air-to-air refuelling - and much more.Despite a pledge to Donald Trump at a Nato summit a few months ago to vastly increase defence spending (and Trump is far from the first US president to ask for that), Europe cannot practically become militarily independent overnight.European governments are currently facing considerable budgetary constraints.In the UK, talk of struggling and failing public services are common. In France - which has long been in the throes of a huge budgetary crisis - next year's draft budget only sets €120m (£105m) in civilian and military aid for Ukraine.It is because of these limitations that - in public - the concerns about Washington and a peace plan for Ukraine are so carefully expressed by Europe's leaders. They don't want to risk being left completely alone by the power they still describe as their greatest ally.But the differences in the European and US approaches to Moscow are glaring.While Europeans – particularly in countries bordering Russia - view Moscow as a destabilising threat, in its National Security Strategy the Trump administration talked up the importance of building \"strategic stability\" with Russia, and questioned Europe's longer-term reliability as an ally.Europe's leaders are trying to avoid further alienating the US president, while fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and future continental stability. It's a tortuous dance.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoMichael BuchananSocial affairs correspondentGetty ImagesThe review looks at the worst-performing maternity and neonatal servicesHungry mothers, dirty wards and poor care are blighting England's maternity services while staff receive death threats for working in some units, according to a new report.Baroness Amos, who is chairing a review into maternity care, said that what she has seen so far \"has been much worse\" than she'd anticipated.Some women had felt blamed for their baby's death, while others suffered from a lack of empathy, care or apology when things had gone wrong, with poor and black mothers often at the end of discriminatory services.Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who set up the review, said \"the systemic failures causing preventable tragedies cannot be ignored\".Streeting said the update from Baroness Amos \"demonstrates that too many families have been let down, with devastating consequences\".\"I know that NHS staff are dedicated professionals who want the best for mothers and babies, and that the vast majority of births are safe, but the systemic failures causing preventable tragedies cannot be ignored,\" he said.The National Maternity and Neonatal Investigation is meant to draw up a series of national recommendations to improve maternity and neonatal services after previous inquiries had exposed the problems but not led to enough sustained improvements.  The report from Baroness Amos - her reflections and initial impressions three months into the inquiry - highlight how ingrained poor care is.Speaking to the BBC, the former UN diplomat said that she recognised there was \"scepticism\" and \"criticism\" of her approach.  \"Time and time again, families feel that the system has failed them. I am very keen that that does not happen this time. And I think the fact that the Secretary of State has taken such a close interest is the thing that will make a big difference.\"Several inquiries over the past decade, including investigations into maternity services in Morecambe Bay, Shrewsbury & Telford and East Kent, have led to 748 recommendations for improvements being made, according to the Amos review. Yet still the harm continues – the biggest maternity inquiry in the history of the NHS, examining around 2,500 case in Nottingham, is due to report in June while another inquiry was recently announced into care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS trust.Following visits to seven NHS trusts as well as meeting over 170 families, Baroness Amos said she had consistently come across:a lack of cleanliness, women not receiving meals, or getting help to use the bathroom with catheters not being emptiedwomen not being listened to, including concerns about reduced fetal movementswomen of colour, working class women and those with mental health problems receiving discriminatory careNHS organisations \"marking their own homework\" when babies died or were harmed, with poor behaviours, including inappropriate language not being tackledThe review has also engaged with staff in maternity services. Some reported having rotten fruit thrown at them, while others said they faced death threats after negative publicity or were attacked on social media.  Adverse media attention could make delivering high quality care more difficult, they said, although it had also acted as catalyst for improvements.Baroness Amos's final report will be published in the Spring, but her inquiry is controversial. Some families believe that limitations on what it can do, and the short time is has to do it, will mean that meaningful action cannot follow.  The Maternity Safety Alliance, which wants to see a statutory public inquiry into maternity failings, said the initial reflections had \"prioritised\" staff feelings while minimising the \"avoidable harm taking place in NHS maternity services every day\".\"This is entirely the wrong process to fix the deep seated and long standing failings in maternity care and we do not understand why [Wes Streeting] is allowing this farce to continue.\"Streeting will chair a new National Maternity and Neonatal Taskforce in the New Year which will be responsible for implementing Baroness Amos's recommendations.  He promised that families who've suffered poor care \"will remain at the heart\" of what follows the review.James Titcombe, a long standing maternity safety campaigner since he lost his son Joshua in 2008, said that while the issues identified by Baroness Amos \"mirror long-standing problems we've known about for years,\" he was supportive of its work as representing \"the best opportunity in a generation to finally put maternity services on a safer path.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoDavid HendersonScotland news correspondentPA MediaSandie Peggie, pictured with her lawyer Margaret Gribbon, welcomed the judgement, which found partially in her favourIt is a case that has generated headlines and interest around the world because it has been seen as a battleground between opposing views on sex and gender.Now, after months of legal wrangling, nurse Sandie Peggie can claim a partial - and rather narrow - victory in her employment tribunal against NHS Fife.At the centre of the case was a changing room and who was allowed to use it.A transgender doctor Beth Upton - a biological male who identifies as a woman - was using that female changing room.When Ms Peggie complained, she was accused of bullying and harassment and suspended. She then launched her own legal action.The tribunal found health managers could and should have acted differently.In a 312-page judgement, the tribunal ruled the health board harassed the nurse in a number of ways.Although Ms Peggie did not succeed in the other legal claims she made against Dr Upton and against NHS Fife, she is likely to see this as a win.She took on her employers, hauled them through the courts, and proved their treatment of her was unfair.But the wider impact of this case remains to be seen.This was the most high-profile and controversial employment tribunal to issue a finding since the landmark Supreme Court ruling earlier this year found that sex is biological under equality law. What we appear to be seeing now is how individual tribunals and cases are reacting to that Supreme Court judgement. There is another high-profile case going on in Darlington where nurses there objected to a transgender woman using a female changing room. That judgement is expected early next year.Meanwhile, the UK government is considering guidance drawn up by the equalities watchdog the EHRC on how single sex spaces should operate. Initial guidance was withdrawn after a legal challenge.All this will surely mean big changes to how employers have to act.AlamyThe tribunal dismissed allegations made against Dr Beth Upton The first key part of this particular ruling suggests they will have to be even-handed in the way they deal with cases like this in future.We now know that, in this tribunal's finding, Ms Peggie was entitled to complain in a reasonable way when she found herself sharing a changing room with a transgender colleague.It was not necessarily instantly bigoted, or illegal, or a sacking offence, to speak out, as some senior colleagues at NHS Fife seemed to think.Instead, she was entitled to complain to her manager - and at that point action should have been taken to reflect her concerns.It said Ms Peggie's suspension was unfair and unjust. She was harassed by NHS Fife health board.The second key point, according to the tribunal, is the law says that it is neither legal nor illegal for a transgender woman to use female changing rooms. What matters is whether a colleague complains about having to share that space.This view is not binding and is likely to be contested in other cases.However, bosses across the UK will take heed of this ruling.They know they cannot immediately take sides - even if they want to.Instead, they will have to strike a balance to ensure everyone's rights are respected.Further legal battlesFor Ms Peggie, this is just the first of her legal battles.The nurse has significant backing and she is taking forward three more court cases against people she thinks have treated her badly.Ms Peggie is suing NHS Fife health board, its chief executive and its head of people and culture.She is trying to push the health board to confirm it will exclude transgender women from female single-sex changing rooms - which she claims is yet to happen.In a separate case, the nurse is suing three of the senior medical staff who gave evidence in her case, and the health board again.She is also suing her trade union, the Royal College of Nursing, claiming it failed to protect her and help her when she was suspended. That is something they deny.As these cases stack up, politicians argue and activists clash, it's clear there is a lot at stake. And it is also clear we have not heard the last of Sandie Peggie.",

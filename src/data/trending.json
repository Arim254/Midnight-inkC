    "body": "4 hours agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday, in his insistence that the US needs Greenland for national security reasons. Is he prepared to use force to seize it, journalists asked him? \"No comment,\" said the president, sending chills down the spine of Greenland's anxious inhabitants. Again.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato. President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums. Especially those reliant on exporting to the US, like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said, \"we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed\" after an emergency meeting with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "23 minutes agoYang TianHang Ross/BBC Weather WatchersNorthern Lights seen in bursts of green, pink and yellow in Lyndhurst, Hampshire.Skies across the UK have been illuminated in hues of green and pink by the Northern Lights.The natural phenomenon - known as the Aurora Borealis - is the result of solar eruptions sending particles towards the Earth and interacting with particles in the atmosphere.The Northern Lights are mostly visible near the Arctic Circle but at times of high solar activity can be seen in other areas.Photos sent in to the BBC show dazzling images of light experienced on Monday evening across Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales as well as in parts of south-west, southern, eastern and northern England. The Met Office said \"severe geomagnetic storms\" were observed, producing \"widespread auroras visible across the UK, with reports extending as far south as northern Italy\". The activity is expected to decline but may still be visible in parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland on Tuesday, it added. The Met Office said the aurora was the result of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) - when the Sun emits really large clouds of particles.Colours are then produced when those particles hit oxygen and nitrogen gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.Denise CaseyGreen skies above Prestatyn, North Walesdani_photography83/BBC Weather WatchersA pink haze frames an overturned ship in Pin Mill, Suffolk GDW/BBC Weather WatchersA scarlet, pink and green-toned sky in Dartington, DevonSkywatcher/BBC Weather WatchersBeams of green and pink light illuminate Haddington in East Lothian, Scotland",

    "body": "6 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesSir David and Lady Victoria Beckham have not publicly acknowledged the much-rumoured rift with their eldest son and his wife Nicola\"I do not want to reconcile with my family,\" Brooklyn Peltz Beckham has said in a statement in which he accuses his parents of \"attacking\" him and his wife in the press.The eldest child of Sir David Beckham and Lady Beckham accused them of \"trying endlessly to ruin\" his relationship with Nicola Peltz Beckham and placing \"lies\" in the media \"to preserve their own facade\".After months of speculation about a feud in the high-profile family, he said he had tried to keep the situation private but was left with \"no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth\".The BBC has reached out to Sir David's and Lady Beckham's representatives for comment. The pair have never acknowledged the rift.\"I have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,\" the 26-year-old wrote in a series of posts to his 16 million followers.\"Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.\"I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.\"He added: \"Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.\"Much of the statement focused on his relationship with his wife - an American actress and the daughter of billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz - whom he said had been \"consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one\".He accused his parents of trying to derail their wedding, claiming his fashion designer mother had \"cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress\".Reports emerged at the time that Nicola, now 31, had refused to wear one of Lady Beckham's designs. She later told the Times that her mother-in-law had realised her atelier could not finish it in time, denying speculation that there was a feud.He also accused Lady Beckham of \"hijacking\" their first dance - claiming that when he was called to the stage, \"my mum was waiting to dance with me\" instead of his wife and \"danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone\".He said they renewed their vows in 2025 to create new memories \"that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment\".Peltz Beckham also alleged that his parents had \"repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name\" weeks before the ceremony. It is not clear to which rights he is referring.He said he had refrained from agreeing to do so - which \"affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since\".Getty ImagesThe pair joined the rest of the family at the premier of their Netflix documentary, Beckham, in October 2023He also addressed another incident which had fuelled speculation about the rift: the couple's absence from Sir David's 50th birthday party in May.Peltz Beckham said he and his wife had travelled to London for Sir David's birthday but were \"rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him\".\"He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner,\" the influencer wrote.He said his father \"finally agreed\" to meet him but on the condition that his wife was not present, which he called a \"slap in the face\", adding that his family then refused to see him on a subsequent trip to Los Angeles.At the time, a source told the BBC that the 26-year-old had chosen not to go to the party as his younger brother Romeo was attending with a woman to whom he had previously been linked.The influencer's post alleged that his mother had \"repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable\".The eldest son criticised his family for valuing \"public promotion and endorsements above all else\".\"Brand Beckham comes first,\" he wrote, adding that \"family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media\".He said: \"I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared\".Peltz Beckham said he had been subject to \"endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders\".He added that his younger brothers had also been \"sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last summer\".Cruz Beckham, 20, said in December that their parents would \"never unfollow their son,\" in response to a Daily Mail story claiming they had done so.\"Not true. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son. Let's get the facts right,\" he wrote on Instagram.\"They woke up blocked as I did.\" Ex-England football captain Sir David and former Spice Girl Lady Beckham have two other sons and a daughter - Romeo, 23, Cruz, and Harper Seven, 14.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBrooklyn Peltz Beckham's statement addressing his strained relationship with his parents features prominently on Tuesday's front pages. \"Brooklyn goes nuclear\" says the Daily Mail as it quotes the eldest son of Sir David Beckham and Lady Victoria Beckham, accusing his parents of being \"controlling\" and putting their family brand first. The Sun carries the same headline as the Mail, providing more details from the six-page Instagram statement from Peltz Beckham saying he has no wish to reconcile with his family.\"Brooklyn blasts Posh and Becks\" is the Daily Star's take. Elsewhere, the paper pays tribute to legendary Italian fashion designer Valentino who has died aged 93.The i Paper reports that Nato insiders are warning that Donald Trump's ambition to annex Greenland is \"destroying trust\" and \"tearing apart longstanding agreements\". The headline suggests that UK and US relations is at its \"lowest ebb\" since the 1956 Suez crisis.Staying with Donald Trump, the Guardian reports the US president has linked his threats to seize control of Greenland to his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize. In a text message sent to Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre on Sunday, Trump said he no longer felt the need to think \"purely of peace\" after being snubbed for the award, the paper says. In the top picture spot is Prince Harry arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice in London for the trial against the Daily Mail for alleged unlawful information gathering.The Metro focuses on the response from Norway's prime minister, saying he has repeatedly tried to explain to Donald Trump that he was not purposely snubbed for the award. \"A prize idiot\" is the headline. The Times follows with reports that Trump has refused to rule out military action to seize Greenland despite intense opposition from European allies. The US leader is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday where the paper says he is likely to face some \"tense encounters\" with Nato allies.\"Trump maintains Greenland seizure threat\" echoes the Financial Times. It features responses from Nato allies, with Denmark bolstering its military troops and Germany saying \"we will not be blackmailed\".In news closer to home, the Daily Telegraph's lead story reports the government confirmation that it is consulting on plans for an Australian-style social media ban for teenagers under 16 in the UK. The paper says the final decision is expected to be made in the summer. The story also gets a mention on a number of other front pages.Finally, the Daily Express fills its front page with a photo of four nurses, who have  spoken to the paper after they complained about a transgender woman using their changing room at a hospital - leading to an employment tribunal ruling in their favour.

    "body": "7 hours agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsWatch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has promised to get to the bottom of why two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain killing at least 40 people, as rescuers continue to search the wreckage.After visiting the site of the crash, Sanchez also announced three days of national mourning for victims.More than 120 more people were injured as carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.The crash is the worst the country has seen in more than a decade.Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, according to Transport Minister Óscar Puente. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Sanchez visited the site of the crash with senior officials on Monday afternoon.\"This is a day of sorrow for all of Spain, for our entire country,\" he told reporters.\"We are going to get to the truth, we are going to find the answer, and when that answer about the origin and cause of this tragedy is known, as it could not be otherwise, with absolute transparency and absolute clarity, we will make it public.\"Puente said an investigation could take at least a month, describing the incident as \"extremely strange\".ReutersRescuers are still searching the wreckage at the crash siteEPAPedro Sánchez travelled to Spain to pay tribute to the people killedBut Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed source briefed on initial investigations as saying experts had found a faulty joint on the rails, which was causing a gap between rail sections to widen as trains travelled over it. They added that the joint was key to identifying the cause of the accident.Spain's El País newspaper said it was not clear whether the fault was a cause or a result of the crash.Four hundred passengers and staff were on board the two trains, the rail authorities said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 41, including children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care.Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\". Officials are working to identify the dead.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\".\"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"All high-speed services between Madrid and the southern cities of Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla and Huelva have been suspended until Friday.Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuate from crashKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\" and offered their \"most heartfelt condolences\". The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).",

    "body": "10 hours agoNaomi de SouzaBBC Newsbeat PA MediaThe Hull hair stylist was a popular faithful on the BBC reality showSpoiler warning: This article contains details of the ongoing series of The Traitors.BBC Traitors star Jessie Stride says helping to raise awareness for those with a stammer \"means more than any prize money\".The Hull hair stylist was a popular faithful on the BBC reality show, but became the sixth player to be murdered by the traitors last week – leaving fellow contestants and viewers gutted. But representing people with speech conditions was always her bigger goal, and has seen her break down more barriers than she could have imagined. The 28-year-old tells BBC Newsbeat she is \"on a high\" after being the first contestant to have a stammer.\"I've had lots of people with stammers reach out, which is just really nice,\" says Jessie.\"I'm just on a really big high. I love it. I'm so happy.\"Ahead of entering the game, Jessie said having a stammer has helped her be \"an authentic person\" because she cannot hide it.Stammering, also known as a stutter, is a difference in the way some people speak which can cause them to repeat sounds or words, according to the charity Stamma. \"I would just love to be able to push (awareness) out a bit more and to get people speaking about stammers and just to help educate those who don't understand it,\" Jessie explains.PA MediaJessie was the first Traitors contestant to have a stammerJessie won many viewers' hearts and contestants in the castle with her loyalty, good humour and bright red hair - but also her ability to observe the behaviour of others. \"I feel like having a stammer makes you a good listener and it kind of helps me to be able to just watch a little bit more,\" she says. \"And I would just watch how Stephen was and how he'd act and I just had an instinct that it could be him.\"By the second week of the series, Jessie successfully identified that fellow contestant Stephen was a traitor after analysing numerous scenarios. The hairdresser doesn't feel her game was impacted by her stammer as the other contestants would be patient and allow her to speak her mind. \"It helped that the whole cast would just wait and were all just really kind about it,\" she says. \"Yes, it would take me longer speech-wise because I would need more time to speak, but the whole cast let me have that, which did help a lot.\"PA MediaShe hopes to continue to break down barriers by working more with children or in TV Jessie says she has received messages from others with a stammer who have said the representation has helped them feel seen.\"I'm hoping that if people who have a stammer watch me that it does give them hope that, you know, we are able to do what we want and that it doesn't have to hold us back,\" she says. When the next Traitors episode lands on Wednesday, many viewers will likely miss Jessie's yellow and orange energy, but she has plans to continue to knock down any challenges coming her way.\"I would love to do more BSL, I would love to work with kids, I'd love to work in TV,\" she says.\"I have an open mind, but I do hope this isn't it and that I could do more here.\"And although she has not won the prize pot, Jessie says she will take away the \"great\" friendships and bonds she made in the Traitors castle.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "A surfer has been bitten by a shark, the fourth attack along Australia's New South Wales (NSW) coastline in under 48 hours.The 39-year-old man suffered minor cuts after a shark bit through his board near Crescent Head on Tuesday morning. He is currently in hospital in stable condition, say reports.It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police. The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a \"perform storm environment\" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279mi) north of Sydney.Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was \"very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries\", ABC reported. \"We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate,\" Pearce said. \"If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there.\"A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with \"life-changing\" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach.Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in several of the recent attacks.Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach in New South Wales.Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute.Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility.\"I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,\" Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters.",

    "body": "Australia's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of a national gun buyback programme and new checks on firearm licence applications, a month after the deadly shooting at Bondi Beach.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said had such legislation already been in place prior to the attack that targeted a Jewish festival, the gunmen would not have legally had access to firearms.The individuals who killed 15 people on 14 December had \"hate in their hearts and guns in their hands,\" Burke told parliament.The father in the father-son duo allegedly behind the Bondi attack legally owned six firearms, while his son had been on the radar of intelligence agencies.The bill was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 96 to 45. It will now make its way to the Senate for consideration, where it is expected to pass with the support of the Greens. Parliament is also debating hate speech reforms.The buyback scheme will target \"surplus and newly restricted firearms\", Burke said, reducing the country's 4m registered guns.Burke added that it \"comes as a shock to most Australians\" to know that the country has more firearms that it did before the 1996 Port Arthur attack, in which a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania. That shooting had prompted the then government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun controls.Other measures passed on Tuesday include stricter firearm import controls and provisions to improve information sharing between intelligence agencies on people trying to obtain gun licences. The lower house of parliament is also expected to pass reforms to hate speech on Tuesday aimed at tackling antisemitism.Its passage through the Senate had initially looked unclear after members of the conservative Liberal-National coalition opposition said its provisions could impinge on free speech among other things. However, late on Monday reports said Liberal leader Sussan Ley had reached an agreement with the government on a watered down version. It remained unclear whether the Nationals would support the legislation.Liberal MP Julian Leeser, who is Jewish, on Tuesday told parliament Bondi represented a \"moment of choice\" and that \"the choice the Liberal Party makes this morning, as we have always done, is to stand with the Jewish community and law-abiding Australians.\"The Greens have said they will not vote in favour of the reforms unless changes are made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest.",

    "body": "6 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe government will consult on whether social media should be banned for under-16s in the UK.It said \"immediate action\" would give Ofsted the power to check policies on phone use when it inspects schools, and it expected schools to be \"phone-free by default\" as a result of the announcement.A similar ban took effect in Australia in December 2025, the first of its kind in the world. Other countries are said to be considering such a law.It comes after more than 60 Labour MPs wrote to the prime minister about the issue, with the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey also calling on the government to act.\"Some argue that vulnerable children need access to social media to find their community,\" Brianna's mother Esther Ghey wrote in a letter seen by the BBC. \"As the parent of an extremely vulnerable and trans child, I strongly disagree. \"In Brianna's case, social media limited her ability to engage in real-world social interactions. She had real friends, but she chose to live online instead.\"According to The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology, the consultation will \"seek views from parents, young people and civil society\" to determine the effectiveness of a ban.It would also look at whether more robust age checks could be implemented by social media firms, which could be forced to remove or limit features \"which drive compulsive use of social media\".And Ofsted will give tougher guidance to schools to reduce phone use - including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.The government will respond to the consultation in the summer.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the laws in the Online Safety Act were \"never meant to be the end point\" and said she understood \"parents still have serious concerns\".\"We are determined to ensure technology enriches children's lives, not harms them - and to give every child the childhood they deserve,\" she said.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has already said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it was in power.She said the consultation was \"more dither and delay\" from Labour.\"The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,\" she said. Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said there was \"no time to waste in protecting our children from social media giants\" and \"this consultation risks kicking the can down the road yet again\".National Education Union (NEU) general secretary Daniel Kebede called the move a \"welcome shift\". \"Every day, parents and teachers see how social media shapes children's identities and attention long before they sit their GCSEs, pulling them into isolating, endless loops of content,\" he said.Getty ImagesThe Association of School and College Leaders also welcomed the consultation on social media, but said the government had been \"sluggish\" in responding to the online risks posed to children.The union's general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio said there was \"clearly a much wider problem of children and young people spending far too much time on screens and being exposed to inappropriate content\".And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, also welcomed the plans to consult on a potential social media ban.But he said the suggestion that Ofsted should \"police\" phones in schools was \"deeply unhelpful and misguided\".\"School leaders need support from government, not the threat of heavy-handed inspection,\" he added.'Not strong evidence'It comes as the government faces additional pressure from the House of Lords, which is expected to vote on a proposed ban on Wednesday.The amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill has backing from several prominent figures such as former children's TV presenter Baroness Benjamin and former education minister Lord Nash.There is also a separate amendment calling for the introduction of film-style age ratings which could limit the social media apps children can access.Professor Amy Orben, who leads the Digital Mental Health programme at the University of Cambridge's MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, told the BBC there was \"broad agreement\" more needed to be done to keep children safe online.However, she said there was still \"not strong evidence\" that age-based social media bans were effective.Dr Holly Bear from Oxford University, whose work focuses on developing, evaluating, and implementing mental health interventions for young people, agreed the evidence for the effects of a social media ban was \"still unfolding\".\"A balanced approach might be trying to reduce algorithm-driven exposure to harmful content, improving safeguards, supporting digital literacy and carefully evaluating any major policy interventions,\" she said.The NSPCC, Childnet, and suicide prevention charity the Molly Rose Foundation were among 42 individuals and bodies to argue a ban would be the \"wrong solution\" on Saturday.\"It would create a false sense of safety that would see children - but also the threats to them - migrate to other areas online,\" the organisations wrote.\"Though well-intentioned, blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children's safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoHelen Briggs,Environment correspondentandGwyndaf Hughes,Science videographerWatch: hedgehogs have been busy in our gardens at nightBritish gardens matter more than ever for hedgehogs, according to a study of the secret night life of the spiny mammals.Scientists gave householders wildlife cameras to spy on hedgehogs in more than 400 gardens in Chester in one of the largest studies of its kind.The animals turned up in more than half of gardens studied, with food a powerful attraction.As numbers fall, scientists say these night-time visits could hold vital clues to the nocturnal mammal's survival.A rescued hedgehog recovers in a field hospital in South WalesHedgehogs are listed as vulnerable to extinction in the UK, with populations falling, particularly in rural areas, due to habitat loss, intensive farming and death on roads.Lead researcher, Kelly Hitchcock, of Nottingham Trent University and Chester Zoo, said: \"The pattern that we've seen is that hedgehog populations in rural areas have declined – gardens seem like a really important habitat – so it's really important that people are aware of that.\"The researchers analysed thousands of images from 415 gardens, alongside each garden's specific characteristics, to examine how often hedgehogs were detected and which features most influenced them stopping by.Leaving food out was the biggest factor, but the experts say providing wildlife friendly features is essential too as hedgehogs struggle to find space to hibernate and breed.These include patches of wildflowers, native plants, leaf litter and log piles, and holes in fences so hedgehogs can roam over large areas.If you are providing wildlife food, be mindful of what that food is and whether it's suitable for hedgehogs, said Hitchcock. \"It's not that we want to say everybody feed hedgehogs because we don't know the long-term impacts,\" she added.Chester Zoo/Nottingham Trent UniversityNumbers of hedgehogs have fallen by up to 30% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas since 2000The study comes as increasing numbers of hedgehogs need help from rescue charities as they lose their natural habitats.Any hedgehog out in the day is a cause for concern – as are hedgehogs seen limping or injured, said Sarah Liney of the charity, Hedgehog Helpline, in South Wales.\"If we can release a healthy hedgehog back into the wild, to be the hedgehog it is supposed to be, and it can produce or help to produce more litters then at least that is going to help with the hedgehog population to continue for years to come within our country,\" she said.Chester Zoo/Nottingham Trent UniversityHedgehogs roam side by side with foxes in our gardensConservation biologist, Dr Rebecca Thomas, of Royal Holloway, University of London, who is not connected with the study, said gardens are increasingly becoming important habitats for hedgehogs as numbers fall in the countryside.\"The best thing people can do for hedgehogs in gardens is to create wild spaces for them - areas where they can over-winter, mate, live happily, and hopefully we can keep the populations going in these suburban environments,\" she said.And if you do choose to feed hedgehogs use appropriate food, such as cat biscuits, and practice good hygiene, she said.\"In the wild hedgehogs wouldn't come together too much... and obviously hedgehogs don't need anything else affecting their populations through the spread of disease.\" The research is published in the journal Urban Ecosystems.",

    "body": "13 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorListening to the prime minister's tone and language this morning, the gravity of this moment was abundantly apparent.Sir Keir Starmer isn't a man to shoot his mouth off in public. He tends to pick his words carefully and avoid exaggeration or hyperbole.That is exactly what he did today, but with a clear subtext: the events of the last 48 hours or so had crossed a rubicon. Downing Street's long running attempts to avoid, wherever possible, public disagreements with the White House had run their course.To be clear, it is not the first time there has been a disagreement. During President Trump's state visit to the UK last autumn, I asked the two leaders about another issue where they transparently disagreed – the UK's decision to recognise a Palestinian state.But President Trump's plan to impose tariffs – economic sanctions – on European allies not willing to acquiesce to his plan to take over Greenland is clearly a different category of disagreement: one the prime minister sought to ground in what he saw as the inviolable principles the UK has long regarded as sacrosanct – respecting the sovereign rights of other countries to determine their own futures.The prime minister, keenly aware of the magnitude of this moment, sought to dial down how he intends to react and how he might hope others intend to react.He repeatedly said he saw no value in a \"trade war\" and while not ruling them out is clearly not keen on retaliatory tariffs, where the UK would charge US exporters to Britain higher taxes.Some others, notably France, have been more aggressive in their language, suggesting retaliation was necessary. That is not a uniformly held view around the European Union, but it does open up the possibility, at least, that the UK and the EU could end up in different positions on this.Sir Keir is leaning in, again, to his strategy of avoiding provoking Washington: he said he wanted \"calm discussion\" involving \"mature alliances\" but that close allies could disagree and \"being pragmatic doesn't mean being passive.\"The big question now is what happens next.The prime minister wasn't due to attend the World Economic Forum, of business and political leaders, taking place in Davos in Switzerland this week.But guess who is there on Wednesday? Yes, President Trump. EU leaders are also due to gather in Brussels on Thursday.No 10's current position is Sir Keir choosing to dash to the Swiss Alps remains unlikely, but is an option. Would a delegation of European leaders seeing President Trump face-to-face change the dynamic?Whitehall is having to prepare for the possibility that the answer to that is no and that the Trump administration is deadly serious about sticking to its strategy come what may.Let's see.Words like \"unprecedented\" and \"astonishing\" slosh around with predictable frequency with Trump in the White House.But those words are no less accurate for it, as the UK and Europe try to work out what on earth to do next.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNaomi ClarkeBBC NewsbeatPA MediaJacob Alon joins the ranks of Adele and Sam Fender who have previously won the awardScottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon has been named as the winner of the Brits Critics' Choice Award. The Fife-born musician saw off competition from soul singer Sienna Spiro and east London artist Rose Gray, known for her infectious dance-pop, to claim the title. Formerly named Brits Rising Star, the award showcases up-and-coming talent selected by a panel of industry experts.A shocked Jacob described the win as \"bonkers\" as the news was announced on BBC Radio 1's New Music Show.Jacob joins previous winners including Adele, Sam Fender and The Last Dinner Party.'I never would have expected it to get this far'The musician, who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, said they didn't think they were \"Brits material\" but were \"really glad\" the critics believed they were.Jacob built a reputation in Edinburgh's folk scene after a difficult stint at university and a turbulent period in London.The storytelling quality of the genre influenced debut album In Limerence, which discusses failed romantic relationships.Jacob thanked those who had recognised their work, saying: \"When I started making this album, when I write songs, it's so far away from any of this stuff and I never would have expected it to get this far. \"It feels like I'm getting away with something that I shouldn't be getting away with. \"So thanks for making me feel cheeky and very, very proud.\"BBC StudiosThe singer gained wider recognition following their appearance on Jools HollandThe musician said their family were \"buzzing\" when they were nominated, but feels their mum would have been \"just as proud\" if it had been a school assembly award. Jacob discovered a love of performing from a young age at a school talent show, but initially studied theoretical physics and medicine at Edinburgh University.After spending nights cramming for exams in the library and realising academia wasn't the world for them, Jacob eventually dropped out.As many have done in the past, Jacob moved to London to pursue music, but it was after returning to Scotland that things clicked into place. Jacob gained wider recognition following a November 2024 appearance on Jools Holland's BBC 2 show, which was booked after the singer had released only one single, Fairy in a Bottle.The song, performed on the programme barefoot, in a pair of golden-feathered trousers and a red shawl, was followed by a debut album last May.It secured a place on the Mercury Prize shortlist, and Jacob also became the first Scottish act to be named BBC Introducing Artist of the Year.The Brit award, in partnership with BBC Radio 1, has reverted to its original name this year to acknowledge the importance of critical acclaim for artists in the early stages of their career.The Brit Awards will be broadcast live from Manchester's Co-op Live on Saturday 28 February.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

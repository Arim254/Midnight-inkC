It empowered a high commissioner to behave like a dictator [and] Palestinian people bore the brunt,\" he said.</p><p>\"Recognition alone does not deal with all these historic problems which for Palestinians are not history but the living reality to this day,\" said Prof Kattan, an expert in public international law at the University of Nottingham.</p><p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) would not confirm whether ministers had been made aware of the legal petition saying it did not \"routinely comment on\" them, although the BBC understands that Deputy Prime Minister and former Foreign Secretary David Lammy is to ask officials to look into the submission.</p><p>It documents three decades of alleged abuses by UK forces during mounting violence until 1948, after which the UK rapidly withdrew and the State of Israel was declared.</p><p>The alleged abuses by British forces range from murder, torture, expulsion and collective punishment which the submission says repressed the Arab Palestinian population amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63145992\">In 2022, a BBC review of some of the historical evidence involved found details of arbitrary killings,</a> arson of entire villages, \"caging\" of civilians in the open air, the use of human shields by strapping them to the front of military vehicles and the introduction of home demolitions as collective punishment. </p><p>The evidence included audio recordings made decades later in which British soldiers and police officers described abuses. Some were conducted within formal policy guidelines for UK forces at the time or with the consent of senior officers.</p><p>The UK Ministry of Defence said in 2022 it was aware of historical allegations against armed forces personnel during the period, and any evidence provided would be \"reviewed thoroughly\".</p><p>During World War One, Britain invaded Palestine, driving out the Ottoman Turks, and it facilitated its promise for a Jewish homeland made in the 1917 Balfour Declaration. </p><p>In the decades that followed, violence mounted between Arabs and Jews. </p><p>An insurgency known as the Arab Revolt broke out against British rule from 1936 until 1939. It was brutally suppressed by the British leaving about 10% of the adult male Arab Palestinian population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled, according to one estimate.</p><p>The Palestinian petitioners seek to build on previous concessions made by the UK over colonial-era war crimes, including this year's apology for the 1948 Batang Kali massacre in Malaya and the settlement over abuses of Kenyans during the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s.</p><p>The decision by the UK, France and several other countries to recognise a Palestinian state saw them join more than 150 nations that already do so. </p><p>The move was welcomed by Palestinians - but rejected by Israel and the US, which argued it damaged efforts to mediate a ceasefire in the war in the Gaza Strip.</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Two women died attempting to cross the English Channel on Saturday morning, French officials have told AFP news agency.</p><p>The incident happened overnight off the coast of northern France, when about 100 people set off by makeshift boat to try to get to the UK, authorities said. </p><p>Sixty people from the attempt were rescued and are \"are currently being cared for by civil protection,\" according to French official Isabelle Fradin-Thirode cited by the AFP news agency.</p><p>A couple and their child suffering from moderate hypothermia were rushed to a hospital in Boulogne, she added.</p></div><div><p>French newspaper La Voix Du Nord reported that the two who died were both Somali women.</p><p>The incident overnight happened south of the beaches of Neufchâtel-Hardelot in the Pas-de-Calais region.</p><p>Separately, AFP also said the body of another migrant was found on Saturday morning in a canal leading to the sea in Gravelines, in a different incident.</p><p>At least 25 people have died so far this year trying to make the dangerous crossing in small boats.</p></div><div><p>On Friday, AFP said its team saw \"hundreds\" of migrants in the Gravelines area in northern France preparing to cross the Channel from the beaches as soon as the weather turned favourable.</p><p>Earlier this month, three people died - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgy0n4d99jo\">likely in a crush on the bottom of a packed boat</a> - off the coast of Calais during another attempted crossing.</p><p>Last year, 50 people died while trying to cross the Channel, according to incidents recorded by the French coastguard.</p><p>More than 30,000 people have reached the UK in small boats so far in 2025 and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8e1xkwd74wo\">more than 50,000 have crossed since Labour came into power in July 2024</a>.</p><p>The UK government has come under increased pressure over the number of small boats crossing into the UK and asylum seeker applications.</p><p>Recently France and the UK agreed on a \"one in, one out\" returns deal, which was designed as a deterrent to stop boats from crossing the Channel. It proposes that for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant who had not attempted a Channel crossing but with a strong case for asylum in Britain will come the other way.</p><p>Sir Keir Starmer has previously called the crossings \"totally unacceptable\" and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said the \"vile\" people-smugglers behind them are \"wreaking havoc on our borders\".</p></div>"

It's as simple as that.\"</p><p>The government says the scheme is designed to curb illegal immigration by making it harder for people without status to find jobs. Ministers argue this is one of the key pull factors for migrants entering the UK illegally.</p><p>Employers will no longer be able to rely on a National Insurance number - which is currently used as part of proof of right to work - or paper-based checks.</p><p>At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy - people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it - in theory - harder to abuse that system.</p><p>However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that while there are arguments \"for and against\" digital ID, making it mandatory \"requires a proper national debate\".</p><p>In a post on X she said: \"Can we really trust [Labour] to implement an expensive national programme that will impact all of our lives and put additional burdens on law abiding people? I doubt it.\"</p><p>Liberal Democrats' Shadow Attorney General Ben Maguire told the BBC the party was \"struggling\" to see how the policy would have a meaningful impact on illegal migration.</p></div><p></p><h2>Will digital ID be compulsory and what else could it be used for?</h2><p></p><div><p>Digital ID will be available to all UK citizens and legal residents, and mandatory in order to work.</p><p>However, for students, pensioners or others not seeking work, having a digital ID will be optional.</p><p>Officials also stress it will not function like a traditional identity card: people will not be required to carry it in public.</p><p>Ministers have ruled out requiring the ID for access to healthcare or welfare payments. </p><p>However, the system is being designed to integrate with some government services, to make applications simpler and reduce fraud.</p><p>The government said that, in time, digital IDs would make it easier to apply for services such as driving licences, childcare and welfare. It said it would also simplify access to tax records.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1a42/live/a09ded40-9ae8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1a42/live/a09ded40-9ae8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a42/live/a09ded40-9ae8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1a42/live/a09ded40-9ae8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1a42/live/a09ded40-9ae8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1a42/live/a09ded40-9ae8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1a42/live/a09ded40-9ae8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a42/live/a09ded40-9ae8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters prime minister sir keir starmer in a navy blue suit with a polka dot tie on and a mic on his lapel\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Announcing the scheme, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID.

    "body": "4 hours agoMark Savage,Music correspondentandLola Schroer,Entertainment reporterBBC / Press / Getty ImagesThe year's biggest artists included (L-R): Rosalía, Jarvis Cocker, PinkPantheress, Bad Bunny and Addison RaeSongs about love, sex, tax and demon hunters ranked among the best music of 2025, according to a \"poll of polls\" conducted by BBC News.We compiled more than 30 end-of-year lists from leading music publications to come up with a \"super-ranking\" of the year's best albums and singles, with artists including Pulp, Lady Gaga and Chappell Roan joined by newcomers like pop singer Addison Rae and indie band Geese.In total, the critics named more than 200 records among their favourites, although the year's biggest-sellers failed to impress them.Taylor Swift's blockbuster album The Life Of A Showgirl only picked up a handful of nominations. The year's biggest single, Alex Warren's Ordinary, appeared in just one list of 2025's best songs.Instead, critics selected music that shifted the tectonic plates of pop... Here's a guide to their favourites.The 10 best albums of 202510) Addison Rae – AddisonColumbia RecordsAfter a shaky start in 2021, Addison Rae's music career took flight with this collection of shimmering, trance-like hymns to desire. The desire for touch, the desire for fame, the desire for inner peace.Unlike most modern pop albums, it's the work of just three people, with Rae and her collaborators Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser establishing a stylish, spacey and occasionally off-kilter sonic palette all of their own.Singles like Diet Pepsi and Headphones On felt simultaneously classic and futuristic, marking Rae out as pop's newest It Girl.Listen to Diet Pepsi: Sensual, hypnotic and calorie-free pop.9) Lily Allen – West End GirlBMGHell hath no fury like a Lily Allen scorned.West End Girl is a savage and startlingly detailed portrait of a marriage being torn apart. Allen says some of the details have been exaggerated, but her pain is tangible amongst the artful pop beats and faux insouciance.The dirty laundry triggered an avalanche of press coverage when the album arrived in November, but the songs have lingered as everyone remembers just how well Allen can craft an intoxicating pop hook.Listen to Madeline: Where Allen confronts her partner's mistress, and recreates their texts.Lily Allen is 'vicious' and 'raw' on tell-all album8) Pulp – MoreRough TradePulp's first album since 2001, More, somehow manages to sound as if it was recorded and shelved in their mid-90s heyday.The lyrics are the only giveaway that this is the work of a band in their late middle age - as Jarvis Cocker sings movingly about stagnation, divorce and mortality. \"You've gone from all you that could be to all that you once were,\" he laments on Slow Jam.Yet, at 62, he remains stubbornly committed to the transformative power of love. And the reception Pulp received at Glastonbury this summer went a long way to proving him right.Listen to Spike Island: A spiritual sequel to 1995's Sorted for E's & Wizz. Pulp reveal first album in 24 years7) Dijon – BabyR&R / WarnerWhat a wild year it's been for Dijon Duenas. After contributing to Bon Iver's Sable, Fable and Justin Bieber's acclaimed comeback, Swag, he scored two Grammy nominations for his second album, Baby.It's a dazzling, harmony-rich R&B record, that channel-hops between genres and moods like a television tuned to the twin spirits of Prince and D'Angelo.The album's central theme is the ecstasy and chaos of fatherhood, with Dijon addressing the title track to his firstborn, then imploring his wife to expand the family on the subtly-titled Another Baby! Sleepless nights have never sounded so good.Listen to Yamaha: A swirling 80s funk groove allows Dijon to submerge himself in the bliss of enduring love.6) FKA Twigs – EusexuaAtlantic RecordsEusexua, FKA Twigs has said, is a word that describes \"the tingling clarity\" you get when you're struck by a new idea, when you kiss a stranger, or even \"the moment before an orgasm\".The album attempts to recreate that feeling with a series of abstract, futuristic soundscapes and deconstructed club tracks. Echoing Madonna's Ray of Light (most notably on Girl Feels Good), the hooks are as sharp as the dopamine is addictive.Listen to Girl Feels Good: A visceral ode to empowerment, femininity and healing on the dancefloor.5) CMAT - Euro-CountryCMATBaby / AWALCoronation Street! Social anxiety! Late stage capitalism! Jamie Oliver! Grief! Road rage!It's all there on Euro-Country, a riotously enjoyable romp through Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson's inner monologue. Along the way, she tackles everything from male suicide to the impossible beauty standards that had her \"trying to wax my legs with tape\" at the age of nine.Listen to Jamie Oliver Petrol Station: The only song of 2025 to address the need for tolerance through the prism of service station fast food.CMAT: I still face abuse over viral song4) Oklou – Choke EnoughTrue Panther SoundsFrench artist Oklou – aka Marylou Mayniel – described her debut album as a \"quest for meaning, of the need to be touched by anything\" in a world where our interactions are stripped of humanity and flattened onto a screen.Co-produced by Charli XCX collaborators AG Cook and Danny L Harle, it couldn't sound less bratty if it tried. It's an album of intimate, gauzy pop, almost entirely drumless and built around hypnotic musical loops that short-circuit your emotions. Unplug and absorb.Listen to Blade Bird: The album's swooning climax, based on a Basque poem about the tension between love and possession.3) Bad Bunny - Debí Tirar Más FotosRimas EntertainmentHe might be Spotify's most-played artist of the year, but Puerto Rico's Bad Bunny makes no concessions to commercial trends. His sixth album is a jubilant love letter to the music of his homeland, mixing traditional genres like plena, salsa and bomba with the hip-swaying pulse of reggaeton.The irresistible grooves dare you not to get up and dance, while the lyrics agonise about gentrification and capitalism stealing the island's old magic. Listen to DtMF: A lament for the loved ones he's lost, the album's title track translates as, \"I should have taken more photos\".Why Bad Bunny is refusing to tour the US2) Geese – Getting KilledPartisan / PIASA savage and unpredictable record, Getting Killed was apparently recorded in just 10 days. It finds the four members of Brooklyn-based Geese patchworking the best bits of Radiohead, the Strokes, Captain Beefheart and the Velvet Underground into something entirely new and unpredictable.Frontman Cameron Winter anchors the chaos with his singular warble, and lyrics that swerve wildly between irreverence and incisiveness. Listen to Taxes: Defiant, taut and full of swagger, Winter chants: \"If you want me to pay my taxes / You'd better come over with a crucifix.\"1) Rosalía - LuxColumbia RecordsIf music brings us closer to God, Rosalía wants her music to bring God closer to us. The Spanish singer's fourth album is an exhilarating - and profoundly moving - exploration of the human condition, that asks why the earthly and the holy have to be so far apart.It's a monumental work. She devoted an entire year to the lyrics alone, singing in 14 languages, over music that sits at the lesser explored intersection of classical, flamenco and avant-pop.In an interview with the New York Times, Rosalía agreed she was \"demanding a lot\" from listeners, \"but I think that the more we are in the era of dopamine, the more I want the opposite\".Accordingly, it's an album that reveals fresh new treasures on every listen, as Rosalía argues we're all capable of grace and beauty. We just have to open our hearts.Listen to Reliquia: As staccato strings are sucked into a vortex of electronic distortion, Rosalía sings about the sacrifices she's made for art and love, and concludes it's better to contribute to the world than take from it.Radical and Riveting: Rosalía's Lux reviewedThe 10 best singles of 2025Getty ImagesGhanaian-American singer Amaarae was recognised for her single SMO10) Wednesday - Elderberry WineThere's a sense of unease bubbling under this gentle indie rock song, as though singer Karly Hartzman is perpetually on the brink of divulging an uncomfortable truth. Built around the metaphor of elderberries, a fruit that can heal or poison depending on how it's handled, the song captures the tension of staying in a relationship you know is toxic. 9) Kehlani - FoldedIntroduced by nostalgic strings, Folded became Kehlani's first Top 10 hit in her native US, blending classic R&B themes of heartbreak and longing with modern production. Using the simple act of folding an ex-lover's clothes as jumping off point, Kehlani captures the  emotional push-and-pull of saying goodbye.8) Addison Rae - Headphones OnAddison Rae is a student of pop, and Headphones On is her master thesis – a hymn to music that whisks you away from the world for three minutes of distracted, hypnotic solace.7) Amaarae - SMOA seduction, a come-on, a hedonistic exploration of physicality. \"Ginga me,\" Amaarae sings repeatedly over a throbbing electro groove – referencing the fluid, hip-swaying movements of the Brazilian martial art Capoeira. You'll succumb, and you'll enjoy it.6) Bad Bunny - Baile InolvidableThis boisterous, captivating salsa was recorded live with student musicians from Puerto Rico's Escuela Libre de la Música (take that, AI). But the celebratory atmosphere masks a broken heart, as Bad Bunny is reminded of the ex who taught him to dance. \"I thought I'd grow old with you,\" he laments.NetflixK-Pop Demon Hunters' effervescent soundtrack was a breakout hit 5) Huntr/x – GoldenSometimes a song escapes its origins and goes into orbit. Golden was the last song written for Netflix's hit animation K-Pop Demon Hunters, but its soaring chorus became an anthem for anyone striving to achieve their dreams. An Oscar nomination beckons.4) Chappell Roan - The SubwayTwo things you can expect from Chappell Roan are theatricality and emotional honesty. The Subway delivers both, becoming a map of loss that carries listeners through a breakup on the streets and subways of New York - capturing that confusing limbo of experiencing grief and loneliness, surrounded by hundreds of strangers.3) Lady Gaga - AbracadabraA triumphant return to the sound of her debut album, Abracadabra takes all the Lady Gaga tropes – Nonsense lyrics! Demonic synths! Gothic choruses! – and dials them up to 11. An absolute banger.2) Olivia Dean - Man I NeedOlivia Dean says Man I Need is a song \"about knowing how you deserve to be loved and not being afraid to ask for it\". The object of her affections just needs a nudge in the right direction, and this playful, soulful melody should easily set the romance on track.1) PinkPantheress - IllegalOne of pop's most overused clichés is that falling in love is intoxicating, just like drugs! So it's a credit to PinkPantheress that she's made the idea sound fresh – zoning in on the fraught awkwardness of hooking up, whether it's with a dealer or a potential new partner. \"It feels illegal,\" she frets, as her heartbeat races with the drumbeat of this smouldering dance-pop anthem.The methodologyBBC News compiled more than 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines and critics - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles.Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album or single getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on.The results were the closest we've ever seen. Just 52 points separated Rosalía's Lux from the number two album, Geese's Getting Killed. In the singles countdown, PinkPantheress was the runaway winner - but the rest of the field was tightly packed, reflecting a year where there haven't been many universally popular, culturally dominant songs.The publications we surveyed included: Albumism, Billboard, Buzzfeed, Clash, Complex, Consequence of Sound, Dazed, Daily Mail, Dork, Double J, Entertainment Weekly, Exclaim!, The Fader, Flood, The Forty Five, Gorilla vs Bear, The Guardian, Independent, LA Times, Les Inrocks, Line of Best Fit, MOJO, Mondo Sonoro, NME, New York Times, Paste Magazine, Pitchfork, Pop Matters, Rolling Stone, The Skinny, Slant, Stereogum, The Telegraph, Time Magazine, Time Out, The Times, Uncut and Vulture.",

    "body": "6 hours agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".Monday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Then in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. Anti-government youth protesters in South Korea are taking cues from the American right's MAGA movement. Italy announces a fee for tourists to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome. Putin vows revenge on Ukraine after an oil tanker was blown up in the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians tell the BBC they were sexually abused in Israeli prisons. And how a lost radio play by Tennessee Williams was found more than four decades after his death, and has now been heard for the first time.\nThe Global News Podcast brings you the breaking news you need to hear, as it happens.

    "body": "Watch: Moment German engineer becomes world's first wheelchair user to go into spaceAn engineer from Germany has become the world's first wheelchair user to go into space. Michaela Benthaus, who suffered a spinal cord injury in a mountain bike accident seven years ago, had reached out to a retired space engineer online to see if her dream of being an astronaut was still possible. He then helped organise the historic 10-minute flight with Blue Origin, the space tourism company founded by Jeff Bezos. Ms Benthaus and five others blasted off from Texas on Saturday and reached a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space, known as the Kármán line.\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing in a video shared by Blue Origin.\"I didn't only like the view and the micro-gravity, but I also liked going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"New Shepard, Blue Origin's reusable sub-orbital launch vehicle, took off from the company's Texas launch pad at 14:15 GMT.Ms Benthaus, who works at the European Space Agency, said she had \"really, really figured out how inaccessible our world still is\" for people with disabilities following her accident.She made her own way from her wheelchair into the capsule, using a bench extending from the hatch. Hans Koenigsmann, the retired SpaceX manager who helped organise the trip, was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Ms Benthaus said. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?\" Koenigsmann said Ms Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. \"It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time,\" he said.Blue Origin said ground support equipment was added to help Ms Benthaus enter and exit the capsule. \"Michi's flight is particularly meaningful, demonstrating that space is for everyone, and we are proud to help her achieve this dream,\" Phil Joyce, senior vice-president of New Shepard, said. The cost of the mission, which is the 16th suborbital space tourism launch carried out by Blue Origin, has not been revealed. The company has taken dozens of tourists to space. In April, pop star Katy Perry, Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King were among six women blasted into space aboard a Blue Origin rocket for a flight that lasted about 11 minutes.The high-profile flights come at a time when private space companies are fiercely competing for dominance in space tourism.

    "body": "4 hours agoMany of the papers feature a portrait of Prince George accompanying his father, the Prince of Wales, helping to prepare meals at a London homeless shelter. The Sunday Mirror says the 12-year-old was \"shown around The Passage in London with Prince William, 43, who was taken there by Princess Di in 1993\".The Observer leads with an interview with Wes Streeting, in which he wonders \"why anyone would want to be PM\". The health secretary, who last month dismissed suggestions from the prime minister's allies that he was seeking to challenge for the leadership, discusses \"leadership, the doctors' strike and why UK taxes are too high\".Labour's \"parking space ban\" leads the Sunday Telegraph, which reports that the government plans to impose limits on \"the number of spaces on new housing developments\". While the government hopes it will \"discourage car use in favour of greener alternatives such as using public transport\", the paper quotes critics who say it amounts to a \"war on motorists\".The Sunday People's top story is the proposed ban on trail hunts. The \"cruel sport\", as animal rights campaigners call it, involves \"animals and pets... chased and killed by packs of hounds supposed to be following the scent\".EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa has been sent death threats via social media, reports the Sun on Sunday. It reports that police were called to the BBC studios, with an unnamed source telling the paper \"they [the threats] were sinister enough to raise the alarm and take action\".High street businesses fear this Christmas could be their last, according to the Sunday Express, as consumers reel from the Budget. Shops and pubs fear a looming recession as \"consumer confidence dries up, the economy stagnates and unemployment rises\", the paper reports. The Mail on Sunday leads with a \"furious landlord\" who has barred Chancellor Rachel Reeves from entering his pub \"over tax hikes crippling the hospitality industry\". Martin Knowles, who owns the Marsh Inn in Reeves's Leeds constituency, says he has been hit with a \"£2,500 hike in business rates\" since Labour won power in July 2024.\"Beijing buys up homes across London\", is the headline splashed across the front page of the Sunday Times. China's government boasts \"a portfolio of 50 properties in England, including multi-million pound mansion houses and blocks of flats in London\", according to the paper. It writes China is \"increasing its diplomatic presence as it prepares to build a new embassy in Britain\".The Independent leads with its interview of British man Aiden Aslin, who was \"sentenced to death for fighting Putin\". The paper reports \"he was captured and tortured by Putin's forces and condemned to die after a show trial\". Aslin, who returned to the UK in 2022 after being freed and is now \"back in uniform\", claims to \"know just how Kyiv can win\" its war against Russia, according to the paper.An extra 125,000 pints will be brought in for \"thirsty fans\" at Alexandra Palace for the Darts World Championships, the Daily Star reports. \"Super, smashed, great!\" is the headline, in reference to the catchphrase of TV show Bullseye's host Jim Bowen \"super smashing great\".

    "body": "Comedian Bowen Yang is leaving the cast of Saturday Night Live, and will no longer be part of the long-running sketch programme after the latest episode airs.In a post on Instagram, Yang declined the share the reason for his departure, which comes in the middle of the season, but said he is \"grateful for every minute of my time there\".\"I loved working at SNL, and most of all I loved the people,\" wrote Yang, who started  in 2018 as a writer for the NBC programme before joining the acting cast.Yang, 35, is the first Chinese-American staff actor in SNL's history, and has become one of SNL's most prominent cast members in recent years.In his Instagram post, Yang described the lessons he's learned while working at SNL.\"i learned about myself (bad with wigs). i learned about others (generous, vulnerable, hot),\" he wrote.\"i learned that human error can be nothing but correct. i learned that comedy is mostly logistics and that it will usually fail until it doesn't, which is the besssst.\"He also thanked other cast members, as well as Lorne Michaels, the long-time producer of the programme.Yang was behind some of the programme's most memorable characters and parodies, including as the iceberg that sank the Titanic and as disgraced ex-Congressman George Santos.Yang's final episode, airing on Saturday night, will be hosted by Ariana Grande, one of the stars of the film Wicked: For Good.Yang also had a role in the film, and has starred in previous films including The Wedding Banquet, Fire Island, Bros and the first Wicked film.For his work on SNL, he has been nominated for five Emmy Awards. He also co-hosts podcast Las Culturistas and is expected to voice a character in the Cat in the Hat animated film due to be released next year.",

    "body": "Anxious waits for arrivals are nothing new at Christmas as people track special deliveries.But for one Shropshire woman, the package two years ago was more precious than something due in the post. It was the child she adopted - the sister of the boy she had made part of her family the year before.\"[We were] on tenterhooks as to whether she would be here for Christmas,\" remembered Sarah, 44.She was not disappointed. In that December of 2023 she formally became a mum of two. Adopting siblings, she said, was \"the best decision I ever made\". It was, then, the best of times and the busiest of times. Christmas, she recalled, \"is carnage in the best possible way with small children\". And it was a journey to get there. It began when Sarah found out she would be unlikely to have a healthy pregnancy. Her story took a huge stride forward when she adopted her son in July 2022.Sarah described how she had read the then 17-month-old's profile prior to adoption and \"knew he was mine\". She said she \"got butterflies\".She then found out that her son's birth mother was pregnant, and decided to put herself forward as a potential parent for this new baby, should that be needed.The girl, the half sister of Sarah's son, was born on Christmas Day 2022, and the family became a trio the following December.They are about to celebrate their third Christmas together, but Sarah insists on trying to make \"every day special\".She said: \"If I see in a shop a toy or something that I think they'd like, I'll buy it, because it doesn't have to wait until one single day a year.\"Especially with adopted children, a lot of them have trauma in some way, shape or form.\"They can push you away because they feel unsafe. But if you can show them that you aren't going anywhere and you're there forever – if it means that once a month they get a treat – then so be it.\"And to be honest,\" she said, \"as long as the children are happy and content and have got somewhere safe, especially at Christmas, that's what matters.\"",

Train cancellations and diversions were reported in the area during the day.The killed elephants were later examined by veterinarians and buried.Assam has one of the biggest elephant populations in India, with nearly 6,000 animals recorded in the state.Local railway tracks are often crossed by elephant herds - but Saturday's incident happened at a location that was not a designated elephant corridor, the Northeast Frontier Railway says.",

    "body": "The US has seized an oil tanker that had recently departed from Venezuela, according to the US Department of Homeland Security.It is the second time this month that the US has seized an oil-carrying ship off the country's coast. The move comes after US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.Venezuela has condemned the latest US seizure, describing it as \"theft and kidnapping\". Venezuela has previously accused the US of trying to steal its resources. \"These acts will not go unpunished,\" a statement from the Venezuelan government said, adding that it intends to file a complaint with the UN Security Council and \"other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world\".The operation was led by the US Coast Guard, similar to the operation earlier this month. The ship was boarded by a specialised tactical team, and was in international waters when it was taken.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees the Coast Guard, shared a video of the operation on X. \"In a pre-dawn action early this morning on Dec 20, the US Coast Guard with the support of the Department of War apprehended an oil tanker that was last docked in Venezuela,\" Noem wrote.She posted a seven-minute video of the operation, which shows US helicopters landing on the deck of a ship with the name Centuries written on the side. \"The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,\" Noem wrote, adding: \"We will find you, and we will stop you.\"The Centuries is a Panamanian-flagged ship, but in the past five years it has also sailed under the flags of Greece and Liberia, according to records seen by BBC Verify.It is not on the US Treasury's list of sanctioned vessels.In recent weeks, the US has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.The US has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.The US has accused Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro of leading a designated-terrorist organisation called Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.The Trump administration accuses him and the group of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\".Following the seizure of the second ship, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X that the US will continue to \"unflinchingly conduct maritime interdiction operations... to dismantle illicit criminal networks.\" \"Violence, drugs, and chaos will not control the Western Hemisphere.\"Venezuela - which is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves - is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.Trump's announcement of a \"blockade\" came less than a week after the US seized an oil tanker believed to be part of the \"ghost fleet\" off the coast of Venezuela, which allegedly used various strategies to conceal its work.The White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port.Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.",

    "body": "Strictly winners crowned in glitzy live final5 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentWatch: Moment Strictly 2025 winners are crownedThis article reveals the outcome of the Strictly Come Dancing 2025 final.Former Lioness Karen Carney has been crowned this year's Strictly Come Dancing winner, becoming the first footballer to lift the glitterball trophy.She beat Love Islander Amber Davies and social media star George Clarke after winning the public vote in Saturday's live final on BBC One.Carney, who was paired with professional dancer Carlos Gu, said: \"I can't believe it, it's been the biggest privilege and honour,\" before adding she was \"lost for words\".It was an emotional night in the ballroom, as Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly hosted the final for the last time - with Queen Camilla among those paying tribute to the long-running hosts.Presenters Tess and Claudia say goodbye to Strictly Come DancingIn a message read out by judge Craig Revel Horwood, the Queen said Daly and Winkleman's \"warmth, compassion and sheer happiness\" had been at the heart of the show's success, adding: \"I think I speak for everyone when I say you have been utterly fab-u-lous\".Karen Carney and Carlos Gu with the giltterball trophy - their football-themed jive to One Way Or Another by Blondie earned them a standing ovationAs usual, one of the dances in the grand finale was chosen by the judges, one was their own favourite dance from the series, and the other was a show dance.The judges gave advisory scores but the public made the final decision.Carney and Gu performed routines including a show dance to Inner Smile by Texas, and an Argentine Tango to Red Right Hand by Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds.They also performed a football-themed jive to One Way Or Another by Blondie, earning them a standing ovation - and their second perfect score of the night.Amber Davies and Nikita Kuzmin were the first to take to the dance floor in the finalBut the winning duo faced stiff competition from the other remaining couples.Amber Davies and her partner, Nikita Kuzmin, were the first to take to the dance floor.The pair performed routines including a show dance to Rain On Me by Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, a Paso Doble to Dream On by Aerosmith, and a jive to Proud Mary.Meanwhile, George Clarke and his partner Alexis Warr reprised their Paso Doble to Game of Survival by Ruelle.They also did their show dance to Human by The Killers, and a Viennese Waltz to Somebody to Love by Queen.But after weeks of tangos, salsas and foxtrots, it was Carney and Gu's night as they topped the public vote.\"I just want to say thank you to everybody that has supported our journey, and supported us,\" said Carney.Gu told her she had \"changed my life,\" adding: \"To the girls and boys watching at home, dream big and be proud and never give up.\"Social media star George Clarke and Alexis Warr chose to revisit their favourite dance from the series, a Paso Doble to Game of Survival by RuelleOther highlights on the night included the boyband Five performing a string of their hits during the grand final.Most of the cast of 2025 also came back for one more routine.However, social media personality Thomas Skinner did not attend. Speaking earlier today on social media, he claimed the BBC rigged the vote that saw him leave the show.A BBC spokesperson rejected the allegation, saying Strictly's public vote was \"independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy\".Tess and Claudia's last finalIn October, Daly and Winkleman made the shock announcement that they would be stepping down at the end of this year's series.Daly has presented since the first series 21 years ago. Winkleman joined in 2014, having hosted Strictly's sister show It Takes Two since 2004.This was their last time presenting a Strictly final, and both were overcome with emotion as they signed off from hosting the show.During the live broadcast, as well as the tribute from the Queen, there were messages from TV cook Mary Berry, members of the crew and fans of the show.The Queen's message said: \"I have often thought that Strictly is not so much a show about dancing as about friendships: the bonds forged, the struggles overcome and the joy shared in undertaking a joint endeavour.\"If that is true, then perhaps yours has been the greatest Strictly partnership of all.\"The warmth, compassion and sheer happiness you have radiated with and from each other has been at the heart of the show's success.\"Daly and Winkleman's last ever appearance on the show will be the Christmas special, which airs on 25 December.",

But it is all worth it for our Hazlitt audience.\"Mr Wood said he was armed with nothing but Dame Sherie Trifle's recipe book, filled with his lines, an outrageous wardrobe and a performance degree from Canterbury Christ Church University.\"I did train to be a performer when I was at university, but I wasn't expecting my stage debut to be in a dress,\" he said.The senior technician ended up starring in all of the theatre's weekend performances of Dick Whittington & His Cat.Dan BaughPantomime dame Joe Meloy fell ill and was unable to perform at the Hazlitt Theatre in MaidstoneAudience member Rachel Gadd said: \"As someone who has seen a fair few pantomimes in their day, I can safely say this was the best show I've seen.\"Of course, the show was fabulous on its own, but with the wonderful James standing in, it really added another layer of charm. \"I think the act of stepping up and helping people out is really what Christmas is all about.\"Director and producer Martin Cleverley, on behalf of Parkwood Theatres, added: \"In over a decade of producing panto, the Hazlitt has never seen their light operator step in for the panto dame.\"2026 will see a new special clause that sees all technical staff add panto understudy to their job role.\"Professional dancer Brad Wright also stepped in for Jared Leathwood in the title role of Dick Whittington that night, while fellow professional dancer Luke Baugh stepped in for Emmanuel Duarte as Idle Jack earlier in the run.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoGeorgina HayesBBC ScotlandBBCRoss, Tom, Anne and William all revisited Lockerbie earlier in the year to pay their respectsWhen Anne and Ross Campbell were watching the news on the night of 21 December 1988, they already had \"go-bags\" ready.The Ayrshire-based couple were part of the Radio Amateurs' Emergency Network (Raynet), a UK-wide radio communications service.Staffed by volunteers, it was formed in the aftermath of the North Sea flood in 1953 with a simple aim: during major events and emergencies, licensed Raynet operators would step in to provide essential radio communications.When news broke that an aircraft had crashed in a small Dumfries and Galloway town, Anne and Ross got the call from their local controller: \"You're on standby for Lockerbie.\"Ross and Anne Campbell were part of the Radio Amateurs' Emergency Network (Raynet)At the time of the disaster, Anne and Ross, along with friends Tom Stewart and William Jamieson were all keen radio enthusiasts in their 20s and 30s.And they were all members of Ayrshire's Raynet chapter.\"You worked away, doing exercises for the council and road races, but you always had in the back of your mind, there could come a general emergency,\" said Ross.He had been involved in the group for a couple of years at the time but added: \"You never imagined something like Lockerbie.\"Pan Am 103 was flying from Heathrow to New York when a bomb exploded in the skies above the town, killing all 259 passengers and crew on board – as well as 11 people on the ground.It remains the biggest terror attack to have taken place on British soil.RaynetAnne and Ross were both involved in the rescue effortAs part of the search and rescue efforts, hundreds of volunteers arrived at the scene to help – including many from Raynet.Their expertise – and equipment – was desperately needed.Ross said: \"Strathclyde Police radios had their own frequency. \"Dumfries and Galloway Police had a separate one.\"Every police service had their own, as did ambulance services, so they couldn't communicate with one another.\"Each search party at Lockerbie was teamed with a Raynet operator who would send messages back to Lockerbie Academy, the disaster control room.They accompanied search and rescue dogs, air accident investigation units, the FBI, and the police.Volunteer Tom, who had been in the fire service for 10 years, made the call to Anne, Ross and William to tell them to report to the scene the following morning.RaynetThe young Ayrshire Raynet volunteers were called up to help with the Lockerbie recovery operationAnne and Ross were both stationed at Tundergarth, in the field where the plane's nose cone lay.\"I still remember the press, with huge lenses, leaning over the fence, trying to get pictures of them bringing the bodies out,\" said Anne.\"That horrified me, I just thought these people deserve a wee bit of respect.\"While Tom was used to scenes of emergency from his time in the fire service, nothing could have prepared him for what he saw.\"The devastation, it was horrendous,\" he said.\"For other members of the group that didn't have that background, it was harder.\"Tom's main role was with search and rescue dog teams, which had been tasked with searching for bodies and collecting debris and evidence from the crash.\"I can still remember the Chinook helicopters flying above.\"They were bringing out body bags and rescue equipment.\"We sent messages back, and the helicopter came with bags, and they came and took them away.\"The radio enthusiasts key to the Lockerbie bombing responseFor William, one of the most striking moments was passing on the message that his team had found evidence of an explosion.\"We came across a baggage container, and from the damage to the container, they knew instantly there was a bomb.\"I was asked if I could radio in saying we had found evidence of a bomb, but because the press were there, they were going to be listening, and I advised them I couldn't send that message because it would be on the telly before we even got back.\"We changed it to asking for an urgent recovery of that item.\"Earlier this year, William returned to Lockerbie for the first time in almost 38 years to pay his respects.\"I'd always meant to go back, but I've never been, because it does bring up memories,\" he said.William, who was 22 at the time, said one of his most harrowing memories was finding a passenger still in their seat. \"To find something like that and knowing there was nothing you could do to help them, it was certainly upsetting.\"Tom, who returned with his three friends, still struggles with what he experienced.\"I'd still never seen anything on that scale. \"I can still remember seeing people's letters and personal belongings and thinking that was someone's son, someone's daughter.\"Anne said: \"I'm proud that I managed to have a wee bit of input. \"But there were a lot of people who did a lot more than we did.\"Getty ImagesAnne and Ross were stationed at Tundergarth, in the field where the plane's nose cone lay.All four feel the role of volunteers needs to be acknowledged.Search and rescue teams and their dogs, the Salvation Army, the Women's Royal Voluntary Service, and locals from the town were all involved.\"They gave their free time willingly at Lockerbie and went back home and yet nobody knows of them,\" Ross said.Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Houston from Police Scotland's organised crime, counter terrorism and intelligence unit has thanked Raynet for the role they played.He told BBC Scotland: \"The assistance Raynet provided the police and other emergency services in the aftermath of the darkest day Lockerbie has ever endured will never be forgotten.\"We are grateful for their support and expertise that afforded vital communications between emergency services at such a critical time.\"Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of those who lost loved ones in 1988 and who continue to show incredible dignity and strength.\"Additional reporting by Charles Ross.If there are issues you would like to see covered, you can get in touch via BBC Your Voice.",

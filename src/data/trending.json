    "body": "8 hours agoJoe PikePolitics investigations correspondentGetty ImagesJim Murphy was Secretary of State for Scotland between 2008 and 2010A lobbying firm run by an ex-Labour cabinet minister asked companies for £30,000 to sponsor an event, including a \"photo opportunity\" with a minister and access to a \"VIP dinner\" with \"top advisers\" to Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.Arden Strategies, owned by MP turned lobbyist Jim Murphy, is hosting a \"Future of Tech Summit\" in London in July claiming attendees will be able to watch a \"fireside chat\" with Science Secretary Liz Kendall.A government source said Kendall \"was not aware of this invitation and she never agreed to attend this event\".Murphy's firm, one of the most prominent lobbyists of the Labour government, has apologised for what it described as \"errors\" and \"clumsy language\".It is unclear if it is still offering the sponsorship package.The BBC has obtained Arden's sponsorship document for the \"tech summit\" event. It shows that for £30,000 a company would be able to sponsor a drinks reception and receive a range of benefits.These include personal introductions to \"stakeholders\", a \"photo opportunity with the minister\" and one seat at a private \"VIP dinner with top advisers to the prime minister, chancellor and other senior tech policymakers\".A member of Sir Keir Starmer's team said: \"No Downing Street staff members have received a formal invitation to this dinner.\" A Treasury source said they were not aware of any of Rachel Reeves's advisers being invited.Arden Strategies said in a statement: \"Information about an event unfortunately contained very clumsy language by mistake which should never have been used and hadn't been approved. \"It was stupid to do and we apologise for this mistake. This included mentioning attendees who had not been confirmed. We are sorry for these errors.\"Arden Strategies has apologised for 'clumsy language' in its promotional materialMurphy, a former minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, founded Arden Strategies shortly after losing his parliamentary seat in 2015.It has lobbied Sir Keir's administration on behalf of arms manufacturers, oil companies and energy giants, according to the public register of consultant lobbyists.The company is not listed as a member of trade body Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA), which requires members to list all their public affairs clients.The total amount Arden spent is not known because the individual sums appear to have fallen below the threshold for sponsorship to be declared by MPs.Labour Party chair Anna Turley and business minister Blair McDougall used to work for the lobbying firm. Former Labour MP Holly Lynch is listed as a current employee.There is no suggestion Turley, McDougall or Lynch were involved in any events offering access to government employees.Murphy was a Labour MP for 18 years and held ministerial jobs in the New Labour years, including as Europe minister and Scottish secretary.He was shadow defence secretary and shadow international development secretary under Ed Miliband's leadership before briefly leading Scottish Labour and then losing his East Renfrewshire seat at the 2015 general election.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentOtherNearly 100 children were harmed by a Great Ormond Street Hospital limb reconstruction surgeon, a review has found.The investigation, published by the world-famous London hospital into Yaser Jabbar, found widespread evidence of unacceptable practice in the botched operations he carried out.Jabbar worked at the hospital between 2017 and 2022, providing care to 789 children – 94 of them came to harm, GOSH's report concluded.Most of those – 91 – were patients he did surgery on. He specialised in limb-lengthening and reconstruction for children with complex problems.The BBC has attempted to contact Jabbar. The hospital said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the harm caused.The treatments he provided, which included inserting metal plates, bone grafts and implants, are considered high-risk and some level of complications are to be expected.GOSH said it could not determine whether all the cases of harm were avoidable, but Jabbar's practice was substandard in many areas and this had undoubtedly caused harm.Constant painThe report highlighted cases of premature removal of bone fixation devices, operations carried out without a clear rationale, problems with how bones were pinned and making cuts into bones at the wrong level. The way complications were identified and managed was also criticised.More than a quarter of patients he operated on came to harm, the report said. Thirty-five had suffered severe harm. Another child suffered severe harm, but that was not related to surgery.The report did not detail individual cases, but families have previously spoken about the problems their children have experienced. FamilyBunty underwent multiple surgeries and her lower left leg was eventually amputatedOne girl, Bunty, who was born with a rare bone disease that caused her left leg to be bowed and short, was operated on multiple times by Jabbar and eventually had to have her lower leg amputated. This was classed as causing moderate harm.Her father, Dean Stalham, said the findings were \"too little, too late\" and the problems should have been spotted earlier.Lizzie Roberts, whose son Tate was operated on by Jabbar when he was 16 to treat the complications of a road accident 10 years previously, said the hospital had effectively \"marked its own homework\".Lizzie Roberts and Dean Stalham have both called for the police to investigate the caseShe says her son has been left in constant pain after having an unnecessary operation on his ankle that they did not consent to. The surgery was only meant to be on his knee, she says.He is now facing more surgery and has had to drop out of college. His case was also classed as one of moderate harm.Both families have asked the police to launch an investigation into the case. The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it would review the findings of the report to see if that should happen.Jabbar, who trained in the UK, is now understood to live abroad and no longer has a licence to practise medicine in the UK. Bleakest dayGOSH launched this investigation in 2024, bringing in independent doctors to review patient records, although the hospital itself pulled together their findings and have published them.The investigation was initiated after the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) carried out a review on behalf of the hospital. It came after concerns were raised by a member of staff.That review  said there were serious concerns in relation to working culture, with some staff upset about the standard of care and saying the environment was \"toxic\" and that some surgery done on children was \"inappropriate\" and \"incorrect\".Getty ImagesNHS England's London region is now carrying out a review into GOSH's handling of the case.GOSH said it had already acted on recommendations made by the RCS report, including introducing training on handling complaints, investing more in whistle-blowing support for staff and getting surgeons to discuss the most complex cases they are seeing with the National Royal Orthopaedic Hospital.Before the concerns were raised in June 2022, the trust said it had received seven complaints about Jabbar and looked into one serious incident, its handling of which was signed off by NHS England. The trust insists none of these suggested further investigation or action was needed.But a surgeon who worked in the same service as Jabbar – Sarah McMahon – is reported to have raised concerns to GOSH management in autumn 2021, but said nothing was done to address her warnings at the time, according to a statement made in parliament by her local MP Dame Meg Hillier.GOSH chief executive Matthew Shaw acknowledged this was the bleakest day in the history of the hospital.He said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the harm caused, but insisted the hospital had acted \"incredibly quickly\" once concerns were raised.He said in areas like this, which were hyper-specialised and where there were only a small number of surgeons in the NHS, it was harder to detect problems with practice.But he added in publishing these findings he hoped the hospital could \"starting building trust with families again because they rely on us for many of the things that their children need\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoJamie WhiteheadBBC News AlamyThe Royal Navy has tightened the rules of alcohol use aboard its ships to a maximum of 14 units a week per sailor. Under the new rules, Royal Navy personnel should not consume more than three units of alcohol per day and ships must enforce two alcohol-free days per week. Ships will now sell a range of zero and low alcohol drinks to encourage responsible drinking. The Navy said the new policy was in line with the UK chief medical officer's health advice and would \"ensure our people remain fit for naval operations\".  The new restrictions do not apply to sailors when they are not on board ships - including when on on-shore bases. Previous guidelines allowed sailors to have two cans of beer a day, which is roughly equivalent to more than three units, dependent on the strength.   These had to be signed out so there was a record of what had been drunk on board, and were paid for by the sailors themselves. A Navy source told the BBC that the new alcohol limits will be monitored in the same way, with sailors still paying for their own drinks. The new rules apply to all ranks but senior ratings will be able \"to use their discretion\" when applying the rules to themselves, the source added. If there were to be an incident on board where anyone drank too much and wasn't able to perform their duties effectively, the Navy source said that this would be dealt with in much the same way that it is now, which is on board the ship. The modern guidelines are a far cry from previous Royal Navy traditions. \"It was badly received. There was a lot of muttering below the decks,\" Commander David Allsop said at the time. The current UK chief medical officer's drinking guidelines, which were introduced in 2016, says men and women who drink regularly should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine.At the time the current guidelines were announced, the UK's chief medical officers said that research showed that any amount of alcohol could increase the risk of cancer.

The movie is an adaptation of author Holly Brickley's novel, set in the early 2000s, which explores a romantic relationship between college friends Percy and Joe. Fans of the novel were unhappy Marty Supreme star A'zion was due to play supporting character Zoe Gutierrez, described in the book as having Mexican and Jewish heritage. The 25-year-old actress announced she'd pulled out of the production, admitting she had not read the novel and saying she should have \"paid more attention\" to Zoe's background before signing up.A'Zion, whose mother is Jewish, was criticised for taking on the role, with users online arguing the part should have gone to a Latin American actress.Posting on Instagram, the actress agreed with fans, writing: \"I'd never take a role from someone else that's meant to do it.\" She went on to say she auditioned for Percy but was eventually cast as Zoe.\"I just cannot do it knowing more about Zoe now,\" she wrote.Getty ImagesOdessa A'zion starred alongside Golden Globe winner Timothée Chalamet in Marty SupremeShe's nominated in this year's Actor Awards - formerly known as the Screen Actors Guild Awards - for best female in a supporting role. A'zion says she loved the story of the book, but because she's been busy with other work she didn't have the time to read it.\"There are a plentitude of people more than capable of playing this role and I am NOT one of them.\"I can't wait to see who it ends up being,\" she added.BBC Newsbeat has asked A24 for comment on Deep Cuts, which is due to start filming next month.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDan JohnsonBBC correspondent, JerusalemReutersMost of Gaza has been reduced to rubble as a result of the warIsraeli media report that a senior security source has said the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza.Israel has previously cast doubt on figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.But their figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media.The war began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says at least 492 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.Israel has always disputed the Hamas figures and said before last year's ceasefire it had killed 1,600 fighters since 7 October 2023 and another 22,000 combatants in the war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously said it believed two or three civilians had been killed for every dead militant. Now a senior military source has indicated to Israeli journalists, including those from Haaretz and the Times of Israel, that the total number given by the Hamas health ministry is largely accurate, even though they have not been able to break down how many were combatants and how many died as a direct result of the fighting.Following the latest Israeli media reports, a military official said the details published did not reflect official IDF data. \"Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels,\" the IDF official said.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBen HattonBBC NewsPA MediaThe site of a drone attack in Kyiv earlier in January US President Donald Trump says Russia's Vladimir Putin has agreed not to attack Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and other cities and towns for a week due to \"extraordinary cold\" weather. Russia has not confirmed any such agreement, but Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed Trump's announcement and said he expected Russia to keep its promise.Trump did not specify when the pause would begin, but temperatures in the Ukrainian capital are due to plummet from Thursday night and reach -24C (-11F) in the next few days. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the bitter winter, as it has during cold periods since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Speaking at a televised cabinet meeting in Washington DC, the US president said: \"I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that.\"\"It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it,\" Trump added.The Ukrainians, he said, \"almost they didn't believe it, but they were very happy about it because they are struggling badly\". Later on Thursday, in a post on social media, Zelensky said Trump had made an \"important statement\" about \"the possibility of providing security for Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this extreme winter period\". \"Our teams discussed this in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We expect the agreements to be implemented,\" he said. The BBC understands that Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions - pausing its own attacks on Russian oil refineries in response.Last week, Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the UAE for the first trilateral talks since the war began.All sides described the talks as constructive, but there has been no announcement that Russia had agreed to pause its attacks for the duration of the extreme cold currently gripping the region.Instead, attacks have continued, crippling the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or electricity.Electrical companies carry out round-the-clock repairs, but their work can be quickly undone by Russian air attacks. Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJonny HumphriesNorth WestBBCInaayah Makda was struck by a wave as she sat on rocks on a beach in CasablancaA seven-year-old British girl is missing after being swept out to sea on the first day of a family holiday in Morocco.Inaayah Makda, from Blackburn in Lancashire, was hit by a large wave as she and her parents sat on rocks on a beach in Casablanca on Wednesday, her family have said. Her parents Zubair and Tasneem Makda were also knocked into the sea but lost sight of their daughter. Naseem Khan, a presenter for the Blackburn-based UCTV, posted on social media a voice note from Zubair in which he said he was \"praying\" for his daughter to be found but had received little help from the authorities.In the voice note, Zubair said: \"We were just on rocks... that were sort of spread apart. \"It's sort of like half a metre-high type of rocks and that's when the tide just suddenly just swept everyone out. \"Inaayah was on the rock behind me.\"He added: \"I pray she's OK and she's on a rock or something and she's just waiting for somebody to rescue her.\"I just pray she's not gone and she's not left us. He added: \"I've always said that she's a special girl.\"Zubair and Tasneem, described as hard-working professionals, were on their first night of a week-long family holiday when it happened. A relative, who did not wish to be named, said the tide appeared to be a long way out when they first arrived on the beach but came in very quickly - within about 20 minutes - catching them by surprise. \"There were no warnings or signs there for tourists,\" she said. 'We're devastated'The family ended up cut off and surrounded by water, when a wave knocked Inaayah one way and her parents the other, the relative said.She disappeared from view before her father could reach her. The parents, who are still in Casablanca, have reportedly turned to a private search operator with a helicopter to assist with the search. A neighbour of the family, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC Inaayah, a pupil at Roe Lee Park Primary School in Blackburn, was a \"lovely, bubbly, cheeky little girl\".She said she was the only child of her \"hardworking\" parents, and was \"their whole world\".\"We're all just in shock. We're devastated,\" she said.Gillian Wilton, head teacher at Roe Lee Park Primary School, Blackburn, said: \"We are extremely upset to hear the news of Inaayah Makda, who is currently missing in Morocco.\"Our immediate and heartfelt thoughts are with her, her parents and family at this devastating time.\"We will continue to pray for Inaayah's safe return and know that all our school community will have her in their thoughts and prayers.\"The school would also like to offer our continued support to our pupils and parents.\"She asked that parents contact the school if they needed any help and support. Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain said he was \"heartbroken\" by the incident and had been in touch with Inaayah's family. He said: \"I'm aware the family is doing all that they possibly can to locate Inaayah. My understanding is they've been out on the beach all day trying to locate her. \"It's a dreadful and distressing situation and given that they're in a foreign land they deserve all the help that they possibly can obtain.\"He added: \"I am urgently raising this matter with the UK authorities, including the Foreign Office, to ensure every possible step is being taken to support the search efforts and to provide the family with all the assistance they require at this deeply distressing time.\"The Foreign Office said it was \"supporting the family of a British national reported missing in Morocco\" and was \"in contact with local authorities\".More like this",

    "body": "10 hours agoKevin Peachey,Cost of living correspondentandEmer Moreau,Business reporterGetty ImagesWomen affected by changes to the state pension age have reacted with fury after ministers again rejected their claim for compensation.The government reconsidered the case after a new document came to light, but has again concluded no compensation should be paid.Campaigners say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in their state pension age, which brought it into line with men.The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group said the latest decision demonstrated \"utter contempt\" for those affected.SUPPLIEDAngela Madden has been leading the Waspi campaign for yearsAngela Madden, who chairs the group, told BBC News that the decision was \"appalling\".\"We know it's a political choice. We know the government could pay us if it wanted to,\" she said.The group was seeking legal advice about the decision, she added.\"We're not frightened of the government. We're not frightened of legal action.\"The government said the vast majority of 1950s-born women already knew the state pension age was increasing, thanks to a wide range of public information, including through leaflets, education campaigns, in GP surgeries, on TV and radio, in cinemas, and online.Others, however, said they were unaware of the changes.In 2024, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between £1,000 and £2,950 each for those affected.While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it and the government rejected it.  Speaking in the House of Commons, Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the government accepted that \"individual letters about changes to the state pension age could have been sent earlier\".He repeated the apology given by his predecessor Liz Kendall over when the letters were sent.But he said the government also agreed with the ombudsman's previous finding that \"women did not suffer any direct financial loss from the delay\".The emergence of a 2007 survey, which had not been handed to Kendall, prompted a review of the government's decision, with McFadden promising to check no other documents had been overlooked.Now, the government has said a flat-rate compensation scheme for those affected would \"cost up to £10.3bn and would simply not be right or fair given it would be paid to the vast majority who were aware of the changes\".More individual compensation \"would not be practical to set up\", it said.McFadden said on Thursday that overall, the evidence suggests that most of those affected would not have read \"an unsolicited pensions letter, even if it had been sent earlier\".He also said that those who knew the least about pensions — \"the very women who most needed to engage with a letter\" — were the least likely to read it.Pat PollingtonPat Pollington says the Waspi campaign will go onPat Pollington, 71, said state pension changes meant she worked for years longer than she had expected.She described the government's handling of the situation as a \"fiasco\", but said she was \"not in the least surprised\" by Thursday's decision.She added that compensation looks expensive, but is only a drop in the ocean for the government, which she said is focused on the wrong priorities.'Dashed hope'The Conservatives accused the government of \"cynical politics\", while Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling MP said affected women will feel \"utterly betrayed\" by the decision.\"False hope was given to them in the autumn, and so that hope has been dashed,\" he said.Ann Davies MP, the work and pensions spokesperson for Plaid Cymru, said: \"The changes to the state pension age were poorly communicated, rushed through, and fundamentally unfair.\"An apology without compensation is not justice and these women deserve far more than words.\"",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Francis Roig and Emma Raducanu began working together in AugustBySarah RendellBBC Sport journalistBritish number one Emma Raducanu has split with coach Francis Roig after her exit from the Australian Open.The 23-year-old lost to Austria's Anastasia Potapova in straight sets in the second round at Melbourne Park.Raducanu and Roig - who helped Rafael Nadal win 16 of his 22 major titles - began working together in August.\"Thank you for our time together,\" Raducanu posted on Instagram.\"You have been more than a coach to me and I will cherish the many good times we spent together on and off the court.\"While we have come to the conclusion together that we ought not to move forward, please know I am very grateful for all you have taught me and fond of our time shared.\"Roig's departure means the 2021 US Open champion is searching for the 10th coach of her career.After her Australian Open exit, Raducanu said: \"I want to be playing a different way. I just want to hit the ball to the corners and hard. \"I feel like I'm doing all this variety, and it's not doing what I want it to do. I need to work on playing in a way more similar to how I was playing when I was younger.\"Some interpreted the comments as friction between the player and her coach. Those rumours were confirmed by sources who spoke to BBC Sport.Asked at the time if she was on the same page as Roig, Raducanu said: \"I didn't play how I wanted to play because I wasn't hitting any shot particularly well. It's tough to take an assessment when you're completely off.\"Me and Francis have done some amazing work together in the past few months and I've improved so many different aspects of my game. I think it's difficult to say we don't agree.\"Raducanu is next scheduled to play at the Transylvania Open in Romania from 1-7 February.Roig was the ninth person to coach Raducanu since 2021, with Nick Cavaday - her childhood mentor - holding the job for the longest spell.He worked with Raducanu from 2024 to 2025, but had to step back because of health issues.The Briton was coached by Nigel Sears when she made her breakthrough at Wimbledon in 2021.Andrew Richardson was Raducanu's coach when she won the US Open in stunning fashion as a teenage qualifier, but he only held the position for two months and they parted ways weeks after her Grand Slam victory.Raducanu also had brief stints with Torben Beltz, Dmitry Tursunov, Sebastian Sachs, Vladimir Platenik and Mark Petchey.",

    "body": "Polar bears on Norwegian islands fatter and healthier despite ice loss, scientists say9 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondent Watch: The BBC's Victoria Gill looks at why are these Norwegian polar bears getting fatterScientists expected the opposite, but polar bears in the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard have become fatter and healthier since the early 1990s, all while sea ice has steadily declined due to climate change.Polar bears rely on sea ice as a platform from which to hunt the seals that they rely on for blubber-rich meals. The bears' fat reserves provide energy and insulation and allow mothers to produce rich milk for cubs.Researchers weighed and measured 770 adults in Svalbard between 1992 and 2019 and found that bears had become significantly fatter.They think that Svalbard bears have adapted to recent ice loss by eating more land-based prey, including reindeer and walruses.Jon Aars/Norwegian Polar InstituteResearchers weighed, measured and assessed the body condition of 770 polar bearsWatch: Where the Polar Bears Wait on BBC Iplayer Trouble in Arctic town as polar bears and people face a warming worldDuring the same period that this research was carried out, global temperature rise has increased the number of ice-free days per year in the region by almost 100 - at a rate of about four days each year. \"The fatter a bear is the better it is,\" explained lead researcher Dr Jon Aars from the Norwegian Polar Institute. \"And I would have expected to see a decline in body condition when the loss of sea ice has been so profound.\"Trine Lise Sviggum Helgerud/Norwegian Polar InstituteWalruses have been officially protected in Norway since the 1950s, after they were hunted to near extinction. That protection has boosted their numbers, and apparently provided a new source of fatty food for polar bears.\"There are a lot more walruses around [for them to hunt] these days,\" said Aars. \"It is also possible that they are able to hunt seals more efficiently.\" He explained that, if seals have smaller areas of sea ice available to them, they will  congregate in those smaller areas, presenting easier collective pickings for bears.Jon Aars/Norwegian Polar InstituteOther recent research on Svalbard bears showed that more ice-free days reduced survival in cubsWhile this is unexpected good news for these Arctic predators, the researchers think it is unlikely to last. As the sea ice continues to decline, bears will have to travel further to access hunting grounds, using more energy and depleting precious fat reserves.The charity Polar Bears International points out that Svalbard's polar bears were some of the most heavily-hunted in the world, until international protections were introduced in the 1970s. Experts think the new findings could be linked to the population recovering from that hunting pressure. That, combined with an increase in the number of walruses - and of reindeer - in recent decades, appears to have provided the bears with a temporary boost. Victoria Gill/BBC NewsElsewhere in the Arctic, the decline in sea ice is bringing bears closer to human communities as they search for food. Dr John Whiteman, chief research scientist at PBI said the results were \"positive in the short term\".\"But body condition is only one piece of the puzzle. Other recent research on these bears found that more ice-free days reduced survival in cubs and in subadult and old females.\"Elsewhere in the Arctic, climate change is having a very different effect on polar bears. There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. In Canada's Western Hudson Bay, where the most southerly and best studied bears live, a decline in the population has been directly linked to warming temperatures.Whiteman added that that the long-term picture for polar bears was clear - they need sea ice to survive. \"Ice loss ultimately means bear declines, but [this study shows] that the short-term picture can be very region-specific.\"\"In the long term,\" he told BBC News, \"if ice loss continues unchecked, we know the bears will eventually disappear.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoSteve Swann,Home affairs reporterandAleem Maqbool,Religion editorGetty ImagesOn Wednesday, Stephen Cottrell addressed the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Sarah Mullally, at her confirmation ceremony at St Paul's CathedralA victim of sexual abuse by a Church of England priest has said she is \"disgusted and appalled\" by a decision not to hold a disciplinary hearing into the Archbishop of York's handling of her abuser.In 2024, a BBC investigation revealed that as the Bishop of Chelmsford, Stephen Cottrell had allowed David Tudor to remain in post as a vicar under him for nine years, despite knowing about his history of sexual misconduct.On Thursday, the president of tribunals, a Church-appointed lawyer who rules on internal disciplinary matters, decided that Cottrell \"had no power to remove or suspend David Tudor from ministry\".One of Tudor's victims says the decision \"sends a deeply troubling message about accountability\" at the top of the Church.Allegations against David Tudor stretched across numerous decades from the 1980s onwards.In 1988, Tudor was convicted of indecently assaulting three girls when he was a vicar and school chaplain in Surrey and was jailed for six months, but after serving his sentence had his conviction quashed on technical grounds.Tudor had earlier been acquitted of indecently assaulting another 15-year-old school girl, although he had admitted to having sex with her when she was 16.The new statement from the Church president of tribunals says David Tudor \"had a sexual interest in teenage girls and was prepared to exploit his position to groom them, in gross breach of trust, with a view to a sexual relationship\". \"As a charismatic young vicar, he was well placed to abuse teenage girls in this way,\" the judgement says.In 1989, Tudor was banned for sexual misconduct by a Church tribunal, but five years later was allowed to return to ministry.He eventually went on to become an area dean in charge of 12 parishes in Canvey Island in Essex.In 2010, Cottrell was appointed Bishop of Chelmsford, and David Tudor's boss, and acknowledged that during his first week in office he was briefed on longstanding safeguarding concerns about the priest.By that stage Tudor had been barred by the Church from being alone with children and was not allowed to enter schools in Essex.By 2012, Cottrell also knew that Tudor had paid a £10,000 settlement to a woman who says she was sexually abused by him from the age of 11. But in 2015 Cottrell made Tudor Honorary Canon of Chelmsford Cathedral.In 2024, Mr Cottrell said he had been faced with a \"horrible and intolerable situation\" regarding David Tudor, that he \"lived with every day\". But subsequent reporting by the BBC revealed that Mr Cottrell had publicly referred to Tudor, who is now banned from ministry for life, as a 'Rolls Royce' priest.Safeguarding advocates and another senior member of clergy, like the Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley, said they felt Cottrell could have acted earlier and could have removed the priest.In his ruling on Thursday, the president of tribunals said Cottrell did not have the power to remove the priest, but viewed the renewal of Tudor's contract as area dean in both 2013 and 2018 as the most serious allegation against him.He reports that Cottrell had \"explained that in 2018 he was reluctant to re-appoint David Tudor but was told that there was nobody suitable to replace him as area dean.\" Tudor was then given an additional two-year contract.The president of tribunals also says that Cottrell \"now accepts that this was a mistake, which did not take account of the pain which this would cause to Tudor's victims and that these appointments should not have been made\".The ruling suggests he agreed with Cottrell's assessment but that the president of tribunals says that \"the risk presented by David Tudor was being regularly monitored.\" He did not feel the matter needed further investigation.Debbie, not her real name, says that between the ages of 13 and 15 she was sexually abused by Tudor. Reacting to Thursday's ruling, Debbie told the BBC the decision not to hold Cottrell to account for his actions is \"appalling\".\"When senior leaders fail to act on serious safeguarding warnings and allow known risks to continue unchecked, they should be held responsible - not quietly absolved. This decision reinforces the sense that the Church of England protects its hierarchy far more rigorously than it protects vulnerable people.\"\"Turning a blind eye, failing to act decisively, and allowing someone who posed a risk to continue in ministry is not acceptable in any organisation — least of all the Church.\"David Tudor was only suspended in 2019 when a police investigation was launched after another woman came forward alleging he had abused her in the 1980s.Tudor was banned from the Church of England in October 2024 after he admitted historical sex abuse allegations relating to two girls.Last November a Church tribunal upheld a new complaint that Tudor sexually abused a 15-year-old girl in the 1980s.The ruling from the Church's president of tribunals reports that Stephen Cottrell was \"glad to have the opportunity to respond to these very legitimate concerns and questions\".\"It gives me an opportunity to apologise for oversights and mistakes that were made\"But the ruling also shows for the first time the involvement of Dame Sarah Mullally, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, in decision-making on the Tudor case.Last year, when she was Bishop of London, she was asked to decide if the complaint against Cottrell should be put before a disciplinary tribunal. Following advice from her legal officer she requested a formal written answer from Stephen Cottrell in relation to his re-appointment of David Tudor as area dean but otherwise dismissed the complaint against him.That was challenged by the woman who brought the complaint against Cottrell which is why it was looked at by the Church's president of tribunals.He has ruled that Dame Sarah's decision was \"plainly wrong\" and that \"the complaint needed to be properly investigated and should not have been dismissed as lacking sufficient substance.\"Advocates for victims and survivors of church abuse have long complained about bishops making rulings about each other in relation to safeguarding cases.Earlier this month, in a separate case, Stephen Cottrell made a decision that Dame Sarah Mullally had no case to answer in relation to a complaint about her handling of a complaint of abuse by a priest in the London Diocese.",

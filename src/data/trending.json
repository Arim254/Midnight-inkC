    "body": "2 hours agoJoe TidyCyber correspondent, BBC World ServiceBBCThéodore remembers the AI slop that tipped him over the edge.The image was of two emaciated, impoverished South Asian children. For some reason, despite their boyish features they have thick beards. One of them had no hands and only one foot. The other was holding a sign saying it's his birthday and asking for likes.Inexplicably they are sat in the middle of a busy road in the pouring rain with a birthday cake. The image is full of tell-tale signs that it was made with AI. But on Facebook it went viral with nearly one million likes and heart emojis.Something snapped in Théodore.\"It boggled my mind. The absurd AI made images were all over Facebook and getting [a] huge amount of traction without any scrutiny at all - it was insane to me,\" says the 20-year-old student from Paris.So Théodore started an account on X, formerly known as Twitter, called \"Insane AI Slop\" and started calling out and poking fun at the content he came across that was fooling people. Others took notice and his inbox soon became flooded with people sending submissions for popular so-called AI slop.Left: Théodore. Right: “Baby Bubbles and Babbles” Facebook page.Théodore (left) started an online campaign to poke fun at AI 'slop' on social media, including a fake image (right) that received nearly one million likesCommon themes started becoming apparent - religion, military or poor children doing heartwarming things.\"Kids in the third world doing impressive stuff is always popular - like a poor kid in Africa making an insane statue out of trash. I think people find it wholesome so the creators think, 'Great, let's make more of this stuff up,'\" Théodore says.Théodore's account soon swelled to over 133,000 followers.The onslaught of AI slop - which he defines as fake, unconvincing videos and pictures, made  quickly - is now unstoppable. Tech companies have embraced AI. Some of the firms say they are starting to crack down on some forms of AI 'slop' - though many social media feeds still appear to be full of the content.Over just a couple of years, the experience of using social media has changed profoundly. How did it happen, and what effect will it have on society?And, perhaps most pressingly of all, how much do the billions of social media users actually care?Social media's 'third phase'In October, during another jubilant earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg happily declared that social media had entered a third phase, which is now centred around AI.\"First was when all content was from friends, family, and accounts that you followed directly.\"The second was when we added all of the creator content. Now as AI makes it easier to create and remix content, we're going to add yet another huge corpus of content,\" he told shareholders.Meta, which runs social media sites Facebook, Instagram and Threads, is not only allowing people to post AI generated content - it's launched products to enable more of it to be made. Image and video generators and increasingly powerful filters are now being offered across the board.When approached for comment, Meta pointed the BBC to January's earnings call. In that call, the billionaire said the firm was leaning even more into AI, and made no mention of any clampdown on slop.\"Soon we'll see an explosion of new media formats that are more immersive and interactive, and only possible because of advances in AI,\" Zuckerberg said.YouTube's CEO, Neal Mohan, wrote in his 2026 look-ahead blog that in December alone more than one million YouTube channels used the platform's AI tools to make content.\"Just as the synthesizer, Photoshop and CGI revolutionized sound and visuals, AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" he wrote.The CEO also acknowledged that there are growing concerns about \"low-quality content, aka AI slop\". He said his team is working on ways to improve systems to find and remove \"low quality, repetitive content\".ReutersMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors that AI \"makes it easier to create and remix content\"But he also ruled out making any judgements on what should and shouldn't be allowed to flourish. He pointed out that once-niche content like ASMR (soothing sounds designed to make your scalp tingle) and live video game-playing is now mainstream.According to research from AI company Kapwing, 20% of content shown to a freshly opened YouTube account is now \"low-quality AI video\".Short-form video in particular was a hotspot, with Kapwing finding it featured in 104 of the first 500 YouTube Shorts clips shown to a new account created by the researchers.The creator economy seems to be a big driver as people and channels can earn money from engagement and views. Judging by the views on some AI channels and videos, people are indeed drawn to the content - or the algorithms that dictate what we see are, anyway.According to Kapwing, the AI slop channel with the most views is India's Bandar Apna Dost, which has 2.07 billion views, netting the creators an estimated annual earnings of $4m (£2.9 million).But there is something of a backlash taking place too.Under many viral AI videos, it's now common to see a furious flurry of comments decrying the content.Giant monsters and deadly belly parasitesThéodore, the student from Paris, helped to drive this backlash.Using his newfound influence on X he complained to YouTube moderators about the flood of weird AI cartoons that got huge numbers of views. In his view the were disturbing and harmful, and in some cases appeared to him to be aimed at children.The videos were called things like \"Mum cat saves kitten from deadly belly parasites\", and showed gory scenes.Another short clip showed a woman in a night dress who eats a parasite and then turns into a giant angry monster that is eventually healed by Jesus.'Sprung Nexus' YouTube accountThéodore thought some of the AI cartoons he saw on YouTube were disturbing. YouTube says they removed the videos flagged to them for violating their community guidelinesYouTube removed the channels, telling us they did so because they violated their community guidelines. They said they are \"focused on connecting our users with high-quality content, regardless of how it was made\", and said they are working to \"reduce the spread of low quality AI content\".But that experience, plus many others like it, have ground Théodore down.UnknownSome of the AI 'slop' on social media is downright strange, Théodore saysEven seemingly cosy lifestyle sites like Pinterest - the forum for recipes and interior design ideas -  have been affected.Users have become so frustrated by the deluge of AI slop that the company introduced a new opt-out system for AI-generated content - but this relies on users admitting that their perfect-house imagery is AI made.Fury in the comments sectionOn my feed (and I'm aware that everyone's feed is different - including the comments) - the backlash to AI slop has become incessant.Whether it's TikTok, Threads, Instagram or X - there seems to be a people-power movement against this content.Sometimes the number of likes for the AI backlash comments far exceed the original post. Such is the case with a recent video showing a snowboarder rescuing a wolf from a bear. The video itself had 932 likes - versus 2,400 likes for a commenter who wrote, \"Raise your hand if you're tired of this AI s**t\".But of course it all feeds the beast.All engagement is good engagement for social media platforms where keeping us scrolling is key.So does it actually matter if the amazing, heartwarming or shocking video on your social feed is real or not?The 'brain rot' effectEmily Thorson, associate professor at Syracuse University in the US, who specialises in politics, misinformation and misperceptions, says it depends on what people are doing on the social media platform.\"If a person is on a short-video platform solely for entertainment, then their standard for whether something is worthwhile is simply 'is it entertaining?',\" she says. \"But if someone is on the platform to learn about a topic or to connect with community members, then they might perceive AI-generated content as more problematic.\"How people feel about AI slop also depends on how it is communicated.If something is made clearly as a joke, it seems to be taken as such. But when AI slop has been created specifically to deceive, it can anger people.One AI-generated video I saw recently is emblematic: an incredibly realistic, natural-history-style video of an astonishing leopard hunt. In the comments, some viewers were fooled; others were unsure.\"What documentary is it from?,\" one commenter asked. \"Please - it is the only way to [prove] no AI.\"UnknownA backlash has grown against AI 'slop', with lots of comments under videos and photos now pointing out if something is AI-generatedAlessandro Galeazzi, from the University of Padova in Italy, researches social media behaviour and echo chambers.He says that verifying whether or not a video is AI takes mental effort, and over the long run, he fears people will simply stop checking.\"My feeling is that the flood of nonsense, low-quality content generated using AI might further reduce people's attention span,\" he says.He distinguishes content that is intended to deceive with the more comical and obviously-fake AI slop, like fish with shoes, or gorillas lifting weights at the gym.But even that more whimsical content might also have a damaging impact. He talks of the risk of \"brain rot\" - the idea that our constant exposure to social media is harming our intellectual abilities.\"I would say AI slop increases the brain rot effect, making people quickly consume content that they know is not only unlikely to be real, but probably not meaningful or interesting,\" he says.Cuts to moderation teamsBeyond the slop, some AI-made content can have far worse implications.Elon Musk's companies xAI and social platform X were recently forced to change their rules after the chatbot Grok was being used to digitally undress women and children on X.And in the aftermath of the US attack on Venezuela, fake videos were spread of people crying in the streets and thanking the US. Content like this can shape public opinion and give the impression that the US raid was more popular that it might have really been.This is especially concerning as so many people use social media as their only source of news, analysts say.Dr Manny Ahmed, CEO of OpenOrigins, a company that distinguishes between AI and real  images, says we need a new way for real content posters to be able to prove their clips and pictures are genuine.More from InDepth\"We are already at the point where you cannot confidently tell what is real by inspection alone,\" he says. \"Instead of trying to detect what is fake, we need infrastructure that allows real content to publicly prove its origin.\"You might think this is something that social media companies could take on. But many, including Meta and X, have cut their moderation teams down and embraced a more collective approach. They now lean towards relying on users to label things as fake or misleading.Slop-free social media?So if the existing tech giants are broadly happy to let the slop flow, could a new social media platform rise up, promising a slop-free alternative, and eventually challenge the incumbents?It seems unlikely because detection of AI is becoming harder and harder. Machines are no longer able to accurately detect if a video or image is definitively fake, and machines would struggle even more on the subjective judgement of whether or not content counts as 'slop'.However, if a new social media does come along and people vote with their feet (or eyeballs and thumbs, more accurately), it just might move the dial. I'm reminded of the rise of social media challenger BeReal, a French app that gained popularity during the pandemic, which encourages users to show their authentic selves via non-filtered selfies at random times.BeReal hasn't yet reached the same heights as the Facebooks and Snapchats of the world, and probably never will. But it did make the other platforms sit up and in some cases, they copied the idea.Perhaps that could happen again if an anti AI slop challenger makes a move.As for Théodore, he feels that the battle is lost and that AI slop is here to stay.In spite of the submissions still coming into his mailbox from his now 130,000 followers, he doesn't post as much anymore and has largely resigned himself to the new normal of life online.\"Unlike a lot of my followers, I'm not dogmatically against AI,\" he says. \"I'm against the pollution online of AI slop that's made for quick entertainment and views.\"Top image credit: BBC; AI image generated with Adobe Firefly.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "15 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,in Doha, Qatar,andJack BurgessEPAIran is due to hold live fire naval drills in the Strait of HormuzIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any attack on his country would spark a regional conflict, as the US continues to build up its forces nearby.\"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.Donald Trump earlier said Iran was in \"serious discussions\" and he hoped they would lead to something \"acceptable\", while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN he was \"confident that we can achieve a deal\" on Tehran's nuclear programme.Araghchi said: \"Unfortunately, we have lost our trust [in] the US as a negotiating partner,\" but added the exchange of messages through friendly countries in the region was facilitating \"fruitful\" talks with Washington.Iran's top security official Ali Larijani had previously said a framework for negotiations was progressing.As part of its build up of forces, the US has sent its aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region and late last week US Central Command said it was operating in the Arabian Sea.\"[Trump] regularly says that he brought ships... The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things,\" added Khamenei.Iran had been expected to begin a two-day live-fire naval exercise on Sunday in the Strait of Hormuz - one of the world's most important shipping lanes and a key route for energy supplies. However on Sunday Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) navy had no plans for such an exercise.Around a fifth of the world's traded oil passes through the waterway, which is about 33km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point between Iran and Oman. Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait if it were attacked. The US has warned Iran against any \"unsafe and unprofessional behaviour\" near its forces in the area.Araghchi responded by saying: \"The US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.\"On Saturday, two explosions in Iran heightened anxiety in the country. Local authorities said a blast that killed one and hurt 14 at a building in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas was caused by a gas leak. Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.In the south-western city of Ahvaz, at least four people were killed in another explosion, with local authorities again blaming a gas leak, according to Iran's Tehran Times.On Thursday, Trump said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid US military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.In his remarks on Sunday, Khamenei accused protesters of attacking police, the IRGC and other facilities including banks and mosques.\"The coup was suppressed,\" Tasnim quoted him as saying.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoPeter HoskinsBloomberg via Getty ImagesGold and silver prices have continued to fall after a dramatic reversal of a rally that had pushed precious metals to record highs.In Asia trade on Monday, spot gold prices fell more than 9% to $4,403 (£3,222) an ounce, while silver slumped by 15% to less than $72 an ounce.Prices had hit fresh records in January as investors parked money in so-called \"safe haven\" assets due to geopolitical uncertainties.Markets had also been worried about the independence of the US Federal Reserve, but metals prices fell on Friday after President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh, a former central bank governor, as its new chair. The naming of Warsh was welcomed in general by the financial markets and the dollar rose by 1% on Friday against a number of currencies.While the dollar ticked up, spot gold recorded its sharpest one-day drop since 1983 with a fall of more than 9%, while silver plunged 27%.\"The clear catalyst for Friday's sell-off appeared to be news... that Kevin Warsh had secured the nomination for Fed chair,\" said analysts at Deutsche Bank.As well as a continued sell-off among commodities on Monday, Asian stocks also fell, with South Korea's benchmark Kospi leading losses as it dropped by more than 5%. Elsewhere in the region, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 3% and Japan's Nikkei 225 was more than 1% lower.In global energy markets, the price of crude oil fell more than 5%. This is attributed to a number of factors including major oil producers agreeing to keep output unchanged and signs of de-escalating tensions between the US and Iran.The rise in the value of the US dollar may also have had an impact, as the oil price is denominated in dollars and it makes it more expensive for non-US buyers.With financial markets spooked by concerns including Trump's tariffs and fears that artificial intelligence-related stocks were overpriced, gold and silver repeatedly hit new record highs.Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to cut interest rate at least twice in 2026. Gold tends to be seen as a more attractive investment when interest rates are low.One of the biggest appeals of gold is its relative scarcity. Only around 216,265 tonnes of the metal have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council trade association.While economic worries can help push up the value of gold, prices can just as easily fall when those concerns ease or investors feel the gains have been overdone.Mark Matthews, head of research for Asia at Bank Julius Baer, told Reuters that one of the likely explanations for sharp falls of the past couple of days \"is that precious metals prices collapsed simply because they had already gone parabolic in the previous week\".\"Once profit taking started, it just snowballed.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoLucy HookerGetty ImagesJoin the gym, run up a mountain, sign up for spin classes. We are constantly being told to go to great lengths - and get very sweaty - to get fit.What if you just don't have the time or inclination?Jo Blodgett has the answer: activity \"snacks\" that you can almost effortlessly add in to your daily schedule. Blodgett is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health at University College London and has studied the impact that small bursts of action can have on your health.High intensity exercise - getting out of breath, getting your heartbeat up - is really beneficial, but it is only part of the picture, she told the BBC Radio Four podcast What's Up Doc?Here she explains how you can get fitter without a special outfit or a gym membership.1. Fit small bursts of activity into your dayGetty ImagesSpin class is not for everyoneThere are loads of ways you can add \"exercise snacks\" into your day, says Blodgett. Officially she calls it \"vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity\" or \"VILPA\" - essentially briefly increasing your effort during routine activities.\"It's about finding opportunities in your daily life that are going to push you a little bit more,\" she says.She suggests:Taking the stairs and the lift - Walking all the way to the 12th floor might be unrealistic, so walk up two floors then get in the liftGetting off the bus early – cycling to work is great, but if you need to take the bus, get off and walk the last stop as fast as possible. No lycra needed.Picking up your pace – you might already go for walks, try speeding up between two lamp postsFortunately, if you are not currently moving much, adding in just three or four bouts of intense movement, lasting one or two minutes each, can make a big difference to heart disease and life expectancy.2. Don't rely on a few gym sessionsGetty ImagesIf you do already manage to fit in regular gym workouts, or a game of football once a week, you can stop feeling smug now. Plenty of us are what Blodgett calls \"active couch potatoes\".Of course those activities are \"a good thing\" she says, but they won't make up for sitting all day at work staring at a screen or spending the evening slouching on the couch.\"Thirty minutes in the gym is only a tiny part of it\", she points out. \"What about the other 23-and-a-half hours?\"If that is you, she advises:Standing up - get up from your desk regularlyGoing for a walk - use half your lunchtime for a leg stretch instead of looking at your phoneMeetings on the go - think West Wing, walk and talk. This works for a lot of phone meetings tooThe evidence suggests sitting only for very short periods is best. \"Every 15, 30 minutes, can you stand up, shake around, sit back down?\" says Blodgett.This does not mean you should quit the gym.There is still a hierarchy, with higher intensity activity, that raises the heart rate, still offering the biggest fitness and health gains, followed by moderate activity such as walking, says Blodgett.3. Reduce the time you are not movingGetty ImagesHealth guidelines tend to focus on how much vigorous exercise you should be aiming for.Blodgett suggests flipping that and seeing if you can reduce the time you are not moving.A few countries including Canada and Australia have started using this message. Assuming you sleep for eight hours, at least half of the time you're awake - eight hours - should be spent on the move.Blodgett says:Keep moving - aim for less than eight sedentary hours a day. The more you can cut that back the better.Let children go free - Advice in Australia is that pre-schoolers should not be restrained in a pushchair or car seat for more than an hour at a time. On rainy days try playing with balloons indoorsLean in to daily chores - Carrying groceries, pushing the lawnmower and tidying the house are all ways to keep on the move and help with strength and balanceThere is no golden rule for how much is enough, says Blodgett. The more you move the better.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "5 hours agoKoh EweCCTVA Guangdong court convicted more than 20 of the Bai family's members and associates of fraud, homicide and injuryChina has executed four members of the Bai family mafia, one of the notorious dynasties that ran scam centres in Myanmar, state media report.They were among 21 of the family's members and associates who were convicted of fraud, homicide, injury and other crimes by a court in Guangdong province.Last November the court sentenced five of them to death including the clan's patriarch Bai Suocheng, who died of illness after his conviction, state media reported.For years, the Bais, Mings and several other families dominated Myanmar's border town of Laukkaing, where they ran casinos, red-light districts and cyberscam operations.Among the clans, the Bais were \"number one\", Bai Suocheng's son previously told state media after he was detained.The Bais, who controlled their own militia, established 41 compounds to house cyberscam activities and casinos, authorities said. Within the walls of those compounds was a culture of violence, where beatings and torture were routine. The Bai family's criminal activities led to the deaths of six Chinese citizens, the suicide of one person and multiple injuries, the court said.The Bais rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing - who now leads Myanmar's military government.The military leader had been looking for co-operative allies, and Bai Suocheng - then a deputy of the warlord - fitted the bill.But the families' empires crashed in 2023, when Beijing became frustrated by the Myanmar military's inaction on the scam operations and tacitly backed an offensive by ethnic insurgents in the area, which marked a turning point in Myanmar's civil war.That led to the capture of the scam mafias and their members were handed to Beijing. In China, they became subjects of state documentaries which emphasised Chinese authorities' resolve to eradicate the scam networks. With these recent executions Beijing appears to be sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the United Nations.Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese as well.",

    "body": "17 minutes agoHafsa KhalilEPAAn aid lorry passes by the Rafah crossing during a trial reopening on SundayPalestinians have started to re-enter the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt after it reopened for the movement of people.The crossing has largely been closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was captured by Israeli forces.The long-delayed reopening is a key part of the first stage of US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, which began in October.Only dozens of people will be able to cross in both directions each day. Humanitarian aid and commercial goods will still not be allowed through.Around 20,000 sick and wounded Palestinians are waiting to leave Gaza for treatment.Israeli reports say only 50 patients - accompanied by two relatives - will be allowed to exit each day, and that 50 of the tens of thousands of people who left Gaza during the war will be allowed to return.The World Health Organization (WHO) will oversee the transfer of patients from territory under Hamas control, transporting them by bus through territory controlled by the Israeli military to the crossing, BBC News understands.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned that anyone who crossed the Yellow Line, which marks Israeli-controlled territory under the ceasefire deal, would be \"met with fire\".The Rafah crossing will be run by supervisors from the European Union and local Palestinian staff, while Israel will carry out remote security checks.On Sunday, Israeli authorities said a trial opening of the crossing was carried out and completed.One Palestinian official familiar with the arrangements for the trial run told the BBC around 30 Palestinian staff members had arrived at the Egyptian side of the crossing, ahead of the operational phase.Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan says the reopening of the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under a previous ceasefire deal in January last year.Before being seized by Israel in 2024, the crossing was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the conflict and a key entry point for humanitarian aid.In December, the Israeli government said the Rafah crossing would open to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza. But Egypt said the crossing would only be opened if movement was allowed in both directions, enabling the return of tens of thousands of Palestinians who fled Gaza.The crossing's opening was also delayed due to the Israeli government making it conditional on Hamas finding the body of the last dead Israeli hostage in Gaza.Last week, the Israeli military said it had retrieved the remains of police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili at a cemetery in northern Gaza.He was one of the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies during their attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed around 1,200 people.Israel's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed more than 71,790 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "7 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterThe Kennedy Center in Washington DC will be closed for a two-year renovation beginning in July, US President Donald Trump has announced.Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday that the centre would close on 4 July this year \"in honour of the 250th Anniversary of our Country\". The move follows several artists cancelling performances at the storied institution after it was recently renamed as the Trump Kennedy Center.Shortly after taking office, the president fired several of the board members at the centre and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board.The new board renamed the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Several musical acts, including Wicked composer Steven Schwartz and a group called Doug Varone and the Dancers, cancelled performances at the centre in the following weeks because of the name change. On Thursday, the venue hosted a premiere screening of a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump.The US president said there would be a \"scheduled grand reopening\" of the facility and that the renovations had already been financed. \"I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for construction, revitalisation, and complete rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest performing arts facility of its kind, anywhere in the world,\" he wrote.\"In other words, if we don't close, the quality of construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many events using the facility, will be much longer.\"Trump had lambasted the physical state of the centre and had worked with the US Congress to allocate more than $250m (£182m) to rebuild it, one of many renovation projects he has taken on in his second term. Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Last December, Democratic US Representative Joyce Beatty filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name for that reason. Some members of President John F Kennedy's family have also denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".",

    "body": "How Grammy winner Olivia Dean became Britain's new global star5 hours agoMark Savage,Music correspondentandPaul Glynn,Culture reporterGetty ImagesThe 26-year-old has scored an international hit with her second album, The Art of LovingBritish singer Olivia Dean has confirmed her status as one of pop's biggest breakout stars by winning the Grammy Award for best new artist in Los Angeles on Sunday.Dean went into the ceremony as the front-runner, thanks to joyful, soulful romantic pop songs like Man I Need and So Easy (To Fall In Love), which became transatlantic hits last year.Despite competition from fellow Brit Lola Young and R&B artist Leon Thomas, she came out on top, making her the first Brit to win best new act since Dua Lipa in 2019.\"I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant,\" she noted while accepting her award. \"I'm a product of bravery and I think those people ought to be celebrated.\"She added: \"We're nothing without each other.\"The star also performed a buoyant version of her UK chart-topper Man I Need, in the week it reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100.Her golden gramophone trophy marks her out as one of pop's most promising new names, joining former best new artist winners like Amy Winehouse, Billie Eilish, Adele and Olivia Rodrigo.She was presented with her award by last year's recipient, pop star Chappell Roan.The moment marked the culmination of a slow-burn success that began with Dean's first EP, OK Love You Bye, in 2019. Since then, she's experimented with numerous genres and sounds before settling on the pillowy, jazz-toned sounds of her second album, The Art of Loving.Late night conversationsBorn and raised in Highams Park, north-east London, Dean knew she wanted to be a singer from an early age.From a distance, she'd watched her cousin - So Solid Crew rapper and actor Ashley Walters - top the charts; but it was another Londoner who really inspired her.\"People always try and say something cool when they talk about their first record - but I remember my Granny taking me to Woolworths to buy Leona Lewis's A Moment Like This on CD single,\" she told BBC News two years ago.Her debut album, Messy, was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize; but it was last year's The Art Of Loving that really put her on the map.An intimate portrait of matters of the heart, it  reached number one in the UK album charts and earned her three concurrent Top 10 singles.The entire album was composed and recorded in a rented house in East London, where Dean shunned A-list writers and asked her closest collaborators to spend two weeks, mixing sessions with late night conversations over good food and \"lots of red wine.\"That easy-going, free-flowing approach is all over the record – whose stories of love and loss are conveyed with an easy informality, like your best friend spilling their secrets.Man I Need became her breakout single in the US. Speaking to the podcast…And The Writer Is, she said it had been inspired by Michael Jackson's 1987 single The Way You Make Me Feel and Haribo's insanely fizzy Tangfastic sweets.\"I came in that day and there was a lot of energy in the room,\" she recalled. \"And I was like, 'Guys, let's make something really fun. I want to make something I can dance to. I want to make something that when I perform live, it's just gonna be like a Tangfastic.\"We started with the drum beat and I was like, 'Yeah, I want to do something kind of like Michael [Jackson]'s The Way You Make Me Feel-esque'\"And I sat at the Wurly [a Wurlitzer electric piano] and we kind of just, like, wrote it.\"ReutersOlivia Dean had an outfit change before performing her track, Man I NeedIt's not just the music that has made Dean stand out.Early in her career, she railed against being pigeon-holed as an R&B artist, when her music spanned genres like pop, alternative and folk, alongside throwback soul.\"I have sometimes felt quite boxed in, like I have to make 'urban' music,\" she said, but \"I feel like I can do anything\".Last year, she made headlines again after demanding, and obtaining, a refund for fans who had bought resale tickets for her US tour from Ticketmaster.The star wrote an open letter to ticketing companies after some tickets were listed at more than 14 times their original face value, with prices rising above $1,000 (£750).Dean called the practice \"disgusting\" and \"vile\", prompting Ticketmaster to announce a price cap on resale tickets, and refund fans \"for any markup they already paid\" on its service.Showing that she's unafraid to stand up for her fans, earned the singer praise from all quarters of the industry - including Sir Elton John, who interrupted the singer's camping trip to offer congratulations on her award nominations.Alexander FjodorovOn Sunday, the singer also fended off influencers-turned-pop stars Addison Rae and Alex Warren to top the best new artist category, as well as girl group Katseye, rock star Sombr and US indie pop band The Marías.For the second year in a row, all eight nominees performed during a special segment at the early part of Sunday night's ceremony - dubbed the biggest night in music.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloCorbis via Getty ImagesCrown Princess Mette-Marit said she regretted having any contact with Epstein at allNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has said he agrees with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's admission of \"poor judgement\" after it emerged she had extensive contacts with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The princess features hundreds of times between 2011-14 in the latest files released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein.This latest embarrassment for the royal family comes on the eve of her son's seven-week trial in Oslo on 38 charges including rape and assault.Princess Mette-Marit married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon as a commoner when her son Marius Borg Høiby was four and is in line to become queen when her husband accedes to the throne.As the content of her email exchanges began to emerge, the princess released a statement on Saturday saying: \"I showed poor judgement and regret having any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.\" She went on to express her \"deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the abuses committed by Jeffrey Epstein\".Although the prime minister did not go further than agreeing with the princess's admission of poor judgement, his implicit criticism of her is considered unusual.  Støre said he also believed that ex-Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland had exercised \"poor judgement\", after it emerged that he had planned a family holiday on Epstein's private island, though he then cancelled it.The latest cache of Epstein files reveals that Princess Mette-Marit spent four days at Epstein's house in Palm Beach, Miami in January 2013 and, in one email from the HRH Crown Princess account, Epstein was asked whether a mother should suggest naked women carrying a surfboard for her son's wallpaper.US Department of JusticeThe warm nature of the correspondence has appalled commentators in Norway, with one message implying she was aware of his initial jail term in 2008.Norway's royal family has been buffeted by a succession of scandals of late, including the marriage of the crown prince's sister, Princess Märtha Louise to a self-styled American shaman.Now, as Norwegians prepare for the trial of Marius Borg Høiby, questions are being asked about his mother's failure to realise the toxic nature of maintaining contact with Epstein, and the role of her advisers.Her 29-year-old son, who is not part of the royal family, denies the most serious charges against him. One charge of rape involves intercourse while a woman was asleep. Three others allege sexual assault while women were incapacitated, which also counts as rape in Norway.If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in prison.No member of the royal family will attend the trial, which starts at Oslo district court on Tuesday. However, in an emotional statement to reporters last week, Crown Prince Haakon said \"our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by this case... we understand that this is a difficult time for many of you, and we sympathise\".Although his stepson was not a member of the royal family, he said: \"We care about him, and he is an important member of our family.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoNew revelations from the US Department of Justice's latest release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein fill many of Monday's papers. \"Mandelson under fire as files appear to show Epstein sent him $75,000 (£54,800),\" reads the Guardian's headline, reporting \"bank statements appear to show three payments of $25,000 (£18,270) referencing the former UK business secretary being sent from Epstein's JP Morgan bank accounts\". Lord Mandelson said he had no record or recollection of receiving the sums and did not know whether the documents were authentic. He repeated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\".The Financial Times leads with newly released documents appearing to show Lord Mandelson telling Epstein that US bank JPMorgan should \"threaten\" the UK over a proposed tax in 2009. Emails show Lord Mandelson, who held the business secretary portfolio at the time, was \"trying to 'amend' a supertax on bank bonuses\" through Epstein's Wall Street connections, according to the paper. In a statement to the BBC, Lord Mandelson said: \"Every UK and international bank was making the same argument about the impact on UK financial services. My conversations in government at the time reflected the views of the sector as a whole not a single individual.\"Lord Mandelson \"faces order for Epstein evidence\", writes the Daily Telegraph in its headline, as \"US Congress believes Labour peer has information on paedophile's enablers\". The committee \"spearheading\" the release of the Epstein files \"said it was poised to issue the Labour peer with a demand to testify in Washington DC\", according to the paper. The committee cannot compel testimony from foreigners, as the paper notes.The Metro says the latest release of Epstein files causes \"embarrassment of riches for old pals of Epstein\". It writes the \"paedophile billionaire... sent Mandelson $75,000 (£54,800)\", while emails from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson \"asking Epstein to marry her also emerged\". Meanwhile, \"pressure also grew on Andrew to testify before the US Congress... days after images showed the former Duke of York on all fours touching a woman\". The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Lord Mandelson and Mountbatten-Windsor are \"urged to testify to US Congress after Epstein revelations,\" according to the i Paper, in order to \"bring justice for Epstein victims\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is also \"under pressure to remove Mandelson's peerage and kick him out of the Labour Party,\" the paper said. On Sunday night, Lord Mandelson resigned his Labour membership.\"A second Jeffrey Epstein victim claims she was flown to the UK for a sexual encounter with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor,\" the Daily Mirror reports, citing comments from US lawyer Brad Edwards who also represented late accuser Virginia Giuffre. The former prince has not responded to the fresh accusations and has previously denied all wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Daily Mail also leads with the woman who alleges \"Jeffrey Epstein flew her to Britain for sex\". According to the paper, \"the unnamed woman says she was taken to Buckingham Palace for tea afterwards\".The Times writes that the woman's allegations against the former prince means the \"Metropolitan Police are facing calls to reopen the case\" against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The police force had previously not carried out a criminal investigation into the former prince, at the time saying \"international authorities were best placed\" to look into past allegations. The prime minister \"suggested voters were tricked into leaving the EU,\" writes the Daily Express in its lead story. It says Sir Keir is coming \"under fire for trying to 'rewind' Brexit\", quoting Reform UK leader Nigel Farage who says the prime minister is \"determined to drag us back under the heels of Brussels\".\"Motor racing ace Lewis Hamilton is dating US reality star Kim Kardashian\", reports the Sun in its front page scoop. The paper writes Kardashian \"jets in for a night at hotel\" in the Cotswolds, citing unnamed sources.And finally, the Daily Star reports \"sumo wrestling is one of Britain's fastest growing sports\", under the headline \"Sumomania!\" There has been an \"eight-fold\" increase  in the number of clubs offering the sport over the past three years, the paper writes.Lord Mandelson's resignation from the Labour party broke too late for the papers, but the front pages do reflect the added pressure he is coming under after the latest revelations related to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.According to the Daily Telegraph, Lord Mandelson is set to be summoned to US Congress to give evidence about his links to Epstein. Sources close to the House Oversight Committee, which the paper says has \"spearheaded\" the release of the Epstein files, say they are \"poised to issue\" Lord Mandelson with a demand to testify in Washington DC. The committee cannot compel testimony from foreigners, as the paper notes. The i newspaper says Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is also facing calls to give evidence to help \"bring justice\" for Epstein's victims.Mountbatten-Windsor is also on the front page of the Times. The paper reports that the Metropolitan Police are facing calls to investigate new allegations that a woman claimed she was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with the former prince. Mountbatten-Windsor has not responded to a request for comment but has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.The i newspaper reports that the over-50s are being encouraged to stay in work for longer for the benefit of the UK economy, as well as their own pension pots. Cabinet Office analysis shows that boosting what's referred to as the \"silver economy\" could drive innovation and generate employment opportunities.The Times says ministers are paying hospitals in England £3m a month to remove patients from waiting lists, which the paper says is making it look like the NHS is treating more people than it actually is. It is part of a process known as \"validation\", getting hospital trusts to review and update lists and removing those who no longer need care. An NHS source has said the practice allows other patients to receive treatment faster.And many of the papers carry photographs of the bizarre moment when the heavyweight boxer Jarrell Miller lost his hairpiece during a fight at New York's Madison Square Garden over the weekend. The Guardian says he appeared to laugh the incident off even though his \"flyaway toupee\" stole the show, while the Daily Mail says it was \"hair-raising\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByAmy LofthouseBBC Sport senior journalistWith his Australian Open triumph, the name of Carlos Alcaraz is now engraved on all four Grand Slam trophies.There is just one thing you need to know.\"I don't like being called Carlos,\" he said in 2022.\"Honestly, Carlos seems too serious to me, like I've done something wrong. I like Carlitos or Charlie.\"Once a young prodigy who smashed racquets when things did not go his way, Alcaraz has secured a spot in the history books as the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam.He is the world number one, has seven major titles to his name and is one half of a potentially era-defining rivalry.But before all that, he was Carlitos from Murcia.Watching Alcaraz is, for the most part, like watching sunshine personified. There is a carefree joy in his shot-making; the huge forehand that goes blasting through every surface, the drop shots and volleys that few would dare try.Then there is Alcaraz himself. He runs around the court with a puppyish enthusiasm, a huge smile never far from his face. The sleeveless shirts, the cries of 'vamos!', the ill-advised buzzcut in New York all add to the theatre.Alcaraz plays by the motto passed down to him by his grandfather - cabeza, corazon, cojones. Head, heart, balls. A reminder to be brave in the big moments, to truly go for what you want. It has served him well throughout his career.Tennis, Alcaraz told Vogue, external in 2023, is in his blood. His great-uncle built the club in Murcia where generations of the family would play. His father, who played until he could no longer afford to, was a director there. Alcaraz's siblings all play tennis, with eldest brother Alvaro acting as hitting partner and unofficial barber.Given his first racquet aged four, Alcaraz spent much of his time there. His first coach, Kiko Navarro, told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller that the young Alcaraz got angry a lot.\"When he was a child he broke a lot of racquets and I had to take him crying to the hotel or home,\" he said in 2024, while Alcaraz described himself as \"a bad loser\".IMG agent Albert Molina watched an 11-year-old Alcaraz play a Futures tournament in Murcia. \"You could already see his winning character, bravery and daring,\" he told the ATP Tour website in 2021., external\"He had such a variety that he would often get it wrong. In one point he would approach the net, open up angles, play a slice, a lob...\"Sound familiar?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A painting of a young Carlos Alcaraz on the walls of his old school in MurciaIt was Molina who would link Alcaraz up with a man who came to be ubiquitous in his early success. He invited Juan Carlos Ferrero, the Spanish former world number one who won the 2003 French Open, to watch him. Alcaraz played a tournament at Ferrero's academy and, in Ferrero's own words: \"I saw something different.\"He told BBC Radio 5 Live in 2024: \"You could see he was more dynamic than the other players. He wanted to be a professional and the parents and I talked about how he needed to go there [to Ferrero's academy], sleep there and practise as the others players do.\"In 2018, Alcaraz moved to Villena to train under Ferrero, who had spent an underwhelming seven months coaching then world number four Alexander Zverev. Ferrero turned down other offers to become the youngster's full-time coach. Alcaraz would come to regard Ferrero as a second father.Some coaches would try to change Alcaraz's natural game and reel in his tendency for the unorthodox. Ferrero did not. He wanted Alcaraz to \"have joy on the court\", knowing that when Alcaraz felt his best, the tennis would follow.\"I always try to play happy tennis,\" Alcaraz wrote in TNT's Players Voice, external in 2023. \"I consider myself a happy person off the court, so I try to play that way.\"However they defined it, it worked. He made his debut on the Challenger circuit - the rung below the main ATP Tour - as a 15-year-old in 2019. He hoovered up four titles and beat another notable teenage prodigy named Jannik Sinner in Alicante. He became the first player born in 2003 to win a match at that level.It was the first of many records.Image source, Getty ImagesAlcaraz made his ATP Tour debut as a 16-year-old at the Rio Open. At 406th in the world, he was a massive underdog against compatriot and 41st-ranked Albert Ramos Vinolas. But there were glimpses, even then, of what Alcaraz would become.The forehand was big, set up by the top-spin backhand. The approaches to the net were confident, the movement smooth, the ability to get the crowd behind him apparent even then. On show too were the lapses in concentration, none more egregious than a double fault in the second set that sent the match to a decider.Alcaraz quickly found himself 3-0 down in the third. Momentum - and physicality - was with his more experienced opponent. But Alcaraz found the burst of energy that five years later would propel him to an astonishing French Open title. He saved three break points, reeled off five games a row and won the deciding tie-break to claim victory at 03:00 local time.\"I always have positive thoughts,\" Alcaraz said afterwards. \"I always think I can win, no matter who the opponent is.\"If you don't think you can win, you shouldn't go on the court.\"Breakthrough after breakthrough followed. He first gained attention at the 2021 US Open, with victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas making him the youngest man to beat a top-three player at a major. A year later, on his way to the Madrid title, he became the only man to beat Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic back-to-back on clay. The inevitable Slam triumph followed in New York, Alcaraz claiming the number one ranking to boot.By the time he won Wimbledon in 2023, ending Djokovic's dominance of Centre Court in five thrilling sets, Alcaraz was a global superstar.Image source, Getty ImagesAlcaraz once said he feared tennis becoming an \"obligation\" - that it would one day become a grind, rather than a fight to be enjoyed.Not all of Alcaraz's career has been plain sailing. He was left in tears after losing the Olympic final to Djokovic in Paris in 2024 and smashed a racquet in a shock loss to Gael Monfils a month later. A grim run was capped by a listless second-round exit at the US Open weeks later.When it is all working, Alcaraz's tennis is a thing of beauty. The drop shots come seemingly out of nowhere and are particularly mesmeric on the clay, barely spinning over the net to send a pop of red dust up into the air. The shots he makes while running into the corners should not, by rights, be landing in. But they do, drawing gasps from the crowd.When it is not quite clicking, it can look awful. Because of the carefree way Alcaraz plays, it can be misconstrued as him not caring. Alcaraz's choices on the court can drive certain commentators to distraction. Why is he going for the volley when his opponent is there waiting? Why is he going for another highlight-reel winner when the safer choice is there?But that is the way Alcaraz plays. That is his happy tennis. He does not play just for himself. He plays for the crowd, the fans, the moments that go viral on social media. He draws you in with the fist pumps, the point to the ear to make more noise, the ball zipping through the court faster than your eye can keep up with. Former world number one Andre Agassi, commentating for the BBC at Wimbledon, put it best. \"It's like Alcaraz has the touch of [Roger] Federer, the court coverage of Novak and the RPMs of Nadal,\" he said. \"I'm so glad I'm just watching instead of playing when I see somebody like Alcaraz.\"Image source, Getty ImagesFor childhood coach Navarro, he takes pride from Alcaraz's behaviour. \"How humble he is, that everyone loves around the world,\" he said. \"Nothing in him has changed since he was a child. I wanted him to be the same Carlitos and I feel very proud of it.\"Alcaraz's practice sessions at Slams always draw a crowd - and that is the way he likes it. At Wimbledon, he opted to practise on the outside courts, rather than on the official practice site that is tucked away from spectators. People stood four rows deep, crowded around the stairs and hanging over the hoardings to catch a glimpse. Those who had scrambled to get seats on were treated to the full Alcaraz show, the Spaniard laughing and joking with the crowd and trying out the occasional trick shot. There was a smile for everyone as, escorted by security, he walked through walls of fans around the grounds. Every \"good luck Carlos\" was greeted by a \"thank you\".The attention must be exhausting, particularly during an emotionally-taxing Slam, but Alcaraz thrives on it. At Wimbledon, he ate at a local Italian restaurant just down the road from the grounds. A photograph of him with the owner hangs above the bar. During the meal, Alcaraz posed for photos with anyone who asked and did the same when he left.Image source, Getty ImagesAt the US Open, before his fourth-round match against Arthur Rinderknech, Alcaraz high-fived every person on the front row, and after his victory, signed every oversized tennis ball that was handed to him. On court, he lives every moment. He laughs in disbelieving joy at his opponent's shot-making. He will cup his ear to the crowd, urging them to make more noise, drawing them in all the time. Alcaraz is popular with his peers and rivals. Facundo Bagnis described him as \"an even better person than he is a player\", while legend Bjorn Borg said he was \"surprised\" by \"what a great guy\" he is. It could be down to the familiarity that Alcaraz keeps within his team. Ferrero was a constant in his life for years until their surprising split at the end of 2025 and his family are never far away.After his quarter-final victory over Alex de Minaur in Melbourne, Alcaraz said some players had joked he could \"play a football match with your team\". Brother, dad and uncle were all in his support box, along with his long-time agent and fitness coaches.\"I'm just really proud and really happy to see my dad because experiencing and living these kind of things, it was his dream when he was playing tennis,\" Alcaraz said. \"I'm really happy to see him making his dream.\"Image source, Getty ImagesHis progress in Melbourne - a Slam at which he had never gone beyond the quarter-finals before - was serene. Backed by a tweaked serve, he did not drop a set until a gritty semi-final in which he was racked by full body cramps and taken to the limit by Zverev.He was not the overwhelming crowd favourite in the final against Djokovic and was blasted off court in the first set. But Alcaraz showed real maturity to stay focused and turn the match around, ultimately overcoming the greatest men's player of all time to achieve history.More records and majors will undoubtedly come. But while he takes his work seriously, tennis will never be the defining thing in Alcaraz's life.\"I want to sit at the table with the Big Three,\" Alcaraz said in his Netflix documentary. But from what I've experienced, I'd choose happiness over massive success.\"Because happiness is already success.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alcaraz with his brother and father after his Australian Open winTennis",

    "body": "17 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterPA MediaThe billionaire brothers behind gambling giant Betfred have topped a list of the UK's 100 biggest taxpayers, which also features Harry Styles, Anthony Joshua and JK Rowling.Fred and Peter Done, who founded the Warrington-based business in 1967, lead the annual Sunday Times Tax List for the first time, having paid an estimated £400.1m tax bill over the past year.Manchester City's Erling Haaland, 25, is the youngest person to appear on the list - at number 72 - with a projected £16.9m tax payment, while Liverpool's Mo Salah is believed to have a £14.5m bill.The list shows a total of £5.758bn was paid by the top 100 taxpayers, up from £4.985bn the previous year.Harry Potter author and tax list regular JK Rowling ranked 36 with a £47.5m bill, musician Ed Sheeran came in at 64 paying £19.9m, while boxer Joshua, who is 100th on the list, paid £11m.Styles, the former One Direction member-turned-solo artist, made a £24.7m tax payment and was among the new entries on the list.Wetherspoon founder Sir Tim Martin appeared eighth on the list with a tax contribution of an estimated £199.7m.Getty ImagesHaaland is the youngest person on the list, coming in at 72The Done brothers, whose estimated bill rose from £273.4m recorded in last year's Sunday Times list, were among 45 of the top 100 taxpayers found to have been paying more than last year.The compilers of the list suggested the increased tax paid by the top 100 was in part down to a rise in corporation tax from 19 to 25% that was introduced in 2023 by the previous government, and a higher tax rate on dividends.Financial trading entrepreneur Alex Gerko was second on the list with £331.4m in tax, followed by hedge fund boss Chris Rokos, who paid £330m.Six taxpayers feature on the list despite leaving the UK in the past year, amid reports of wealthy individuals relocating to avoid higher taxes and the end of non-dom status. They include Revolut founder Nik Storonsky, Wren Kitchens' Malcolm Healey and sports promoter Eddie Hearn.According to the Sunday Times list, the top 10 UK taxpayers are:Fred and Peter Done and family - Betfred - £400.1mAlex Gerko - trader - £331.4mChris Rokos - bond trader - £330mStephen Rubin and family - Chair of Pentland Group - £325.6mDenise, John, and Peter Coates - Bet365 - £227.1mPeter Hargreaves - Hargreaves Lansdown cofounder - £210mTom Morris and family - Home Bargains - £209.1mSir Tim Martin - JD Wetherspoon pubs - £199.7mMike Ashley - retail - £175.9mDame Mary, Douglas Perkins and family - Specsavers - £121.7mRobert Watts, who compiled the list, said: \"This is an increasingly diverse list, with Premier League footballers and world famous pop stars lining up alongside aristocrats and business owners selling pies, pillows and baby milk.\"This year there's been a big jump in the amount of tax we've identified - largely because of higher corporation tax rates.\"HMRC does not comment on individual cases so the BBC cannot verify the estimates provided by the Times.Correction - a previous version of this story wrongly stated that many on the list were paying more after changes to corporation tax rates and other taxes by the Labour government - the increase to corporation tax was actually made in 2023 by the previous Conservative government.More on this story",

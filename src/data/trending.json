    "body": "Top run-scorer, wicket-taker and champion - T20 World Cup predictionsThe 2026 World Cup is almost upon us.India are defending champions after their 2024 win and have home advantage as co-hosts alongside Sri Lanka.Can anyone stop them? And who will be the best batters and bowlers?Here are the Test Match Special team's predictions before it all gets under way on Saturday, 7 February.Who will win?Former England bowler Steven Finn: It is hard to look beyond India, but the romance of South Africa winning after how close they got to winning by reaching the 2024 final is something I would like to see.I do actually think England are dark horses to win the tournament given how well they played in Sri Lanka and the options they have.Former England bowler Alex Hartley: No team has ever won a men's T20 World Cup on home soil, so I'm going India.Former England bowler Tymal Mills: India will be tough to beat in their own conditions. Obviously all their players are well-accustomed to playing on those decks, so I'll go with India.England and Scotland bowler Kirstie Gordon: It is probably a popular answer but it is hard to look past India in their own conditions. They look incredibly strong and well balanced. I would love to see South Africa give them a scare.As for Scotland, it is hard to say given their lack of preparation time, but they have some excellent players and will be keen to show they deserve to be there.I think they will beat Italy and Nepal but West Indies and England's firepower could be too big a hurdle.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Superstars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma played in India's 2024 T20 World Cup win but both have since retired from the format at international level BBC cricket reporter Henry Moeran: India will be hard to beat at home, and having won the last two global white-ball events will be full of confidence.But as we saw in the final of 2023, home pressure can sometimes be a hindrance and so many top players from around the world having Indian Premier League experience means knowledge of conditions perhaps will not be as significant.South Africa could be a threat having broken their hoodoo with the Test Championship win.TMS commentator Prakash Wakankar: While India will be among the favourites, the pressure will be immense.I would never write off Australia, and South Africa are really well placed with the variety in their bowling and depth in their batting.If pressed, I would go for a repeat of the 2023 50-over final between India and Australia, but hopefully with a different result...TMS commentator Daniel Norcross: India. It is the obvious choice but that is because India come into this World Cup in formidable form and have home advantage.In addition, if their match with Pakistan does not go ahead, they will not only pick up two points without playing a game but will also not have to leave India.TMS commentator Aatif Nawaz: Though both England and Pakistan are heading into the World Cup with strong form, getting the better of India will be a Herculean task.BBC cricket writer Matthew Henry: I was all set to try and be clever. Like before the 2023 50-over World Cup in India, Australia have lost their past two series.At that World Cup, Australia were without Travis Head for the start. This time Josh Hazlewood was set to miss the opening weeks but now he has been ruled out entirely, they surely have little chance.India it is.Who will be the leading run-scorer?Finn: England's Phil Salt. He has been outstanding in both the IPL and T20 internationals recently. Opening is the best place to bat in India and expect the top run-scorer to bat in the top two.Hartley: Australia's Ashes hero Travis Head. He's become more consistent over the last 18 months and also plays with complete freedom. He does not care about getting out which will help him push the boundaries.Mills: I'll go with South Africa captain Aiden Markram. He's in good form at the moment and he does well in India too.Gordon: India's Abhishek Sharma. He's got a ridiculous strike-rate and has provided so much firepower at the top of the order for India recently. First World Cup. Home conditions. Are the stars aligned?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Abhishek has a strike-rate of 194.74 across his 37 T20 international innings - the highest of any player to have batted as many timesMoeran: It might be his debut tournament, but Abhishek is a brilliant player and I think he will do some serious damage to bowling attacks.Norcross: Abhishek. The Indian opener is in frighteningly good form and will have plenty of opportunity to go big on friendly, run-drenched pitches at home in India.Nawaz: Abhishek is the smart bet. He will open for India and doubtless hit sixes for fun. He stands head (sorry Travis!) and shoulders above everyone else in T20 cricket right now.Wakankar: Head is my pick. He is just so dominant in this format. His hand-eye co-ordination is of a different level.  He has been top of the pops for Sunrisers Hyderabad consistently in the IPL and knows the conditions really well.Henry: India captain Suryakumar Yadav scored 242 runs at 80.66 during the recent series win over New Zealand. One thing that could stop him may be the form of others in India's top order denying him enough time at the crease.Which other batter will be one to watch?Hartley: Sherfane Rutherford. He had a great SA20 campaign with 334 runs and a strike-rate of 165. Nothing beats watching a West Indian when they get going.Mills: South Africa's Dewald Brevis, who I played with recently at the SA20.Obviously people know about him, but he probably hasn't really exploded in terms of international cricket just yet. He played some special innings for us.Finn: So much has been talked about Brevis from a young age and it finally feels like he has come of age. A fantastic SA20 - 370 runs and a strike-rate of 156.11 - should give him confidence.Gordon: I'm going to go for New Zealand's Finn Allen. He's off the back of a great Big Bash campaign for Perth Scorchers, where he was the leading run-scorer with 466 in 11 innings. It seems like his batting has really matured in the last couple of years.Norcross: Allen is hit and miss, but if he gets going those small grounds in India won't be able to contain his monstrously destructive hitting.Moeran: Tom Banton of England looked in excellent touch with an unbeaten 54* in the second T20 in Sri Lanka and feels a very different player to his first iteration in the England side back in 2019 and 2020.Henry: Brevis is a good shout. England have seen what Pathum Nissanka, now sixth in the world T20 rankings, can do in recent weeks.Nawaz: Let's go for someone a little less obvious. Wayne Madsen. Obviously Italy are unlikely to go past the group stage but the 42 year old's storied career feels like it has one more fairytale chapter in it...Who will be the leading wicket-taker?Finn: Kuldeep Yadav. He could clean up in the group stage, looking at India's opponents, and wrist spin is always a potent wicket threat as the tournament wears on.Mills: It is hard to look past Jasprit Bumrah, an outstanding bowler across all formats but particularly within T20 and he'll obviously play a huge part in India's claim to winning the title.Gordon: Australia's Nathan Ellis. A highly skilled T20 bowler who can bowl in all phases but is especially strong at the death. He often goes under the radar in a top-quality attack but regularly bowls some of the toughest overs.Moeran: How can we look past Bumrah? He won India the tournament two years ago in the final against South Africa and will again be key. Few bowlers can do what he does, and his overs at the death will be integral.Hartley: I do not like copying my friends but, as they have said, how do you look past Bumrah? I want to pick a spinner and I want that man to be Varun Chakaravarthy but I'm not sure he will play all the games.Nawaz: I'm certain it will be a spinner. There are so many to chose from, but I'll go with Adam Zampa. He was one of Australia's few positives in their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Pakistan.Wakankar: I expect Hardik Pandya to be that person, fitness being the only challenge. He is the key cog in the India team for sure as their main seam-bowling all-rounder.Norcross: Abrar Ahmed. A left-field pick maybe but hear me out.Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka where the pitches have shown strong signs of favouring spin.The bespectacled leg-spinner recently had the Australians in a pickle and has a great chance to bag a hatful of wickets in the opening group stage against weaker teams.Henry: The leading wicket-takers in the past three editions of the IPL have all been seamers. Always improving, always moving the new ball, I'll go with South Africa's Marco Jansen.What about a bowler to watch out for?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Australia all-rounder Cameron Green appeared to question the legality of Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq's action during their recent T20 series. Tariq has twice had his action cleared by authorities in Pakistan Hartley: Pakistan's Usman Tariq - not for the amount of wickets he will or won't get but the hype around his controversial bowling action.Finn: Tariq was relatively unknown until recently. Mystery spinners who burst on to the scene usually have a good first tournament, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him do well.Gordon: Azmatullah Omarzai. I could have picked one of a few bowlers from Afghanistan, who I think could cause an upset in the group of death which also includes South Africa and New Zealand.A spinner might have been the common choice but Omarzai has been central to them becoming a more balanced team.Mills: Maybe someone like Noor Ahmad from Afghanistan, the left-arm wrist spinner. Obviously all eyes will be on Rashid Khan but Noor is an excellent bowler in his own right as well.Moeran: South Africa quick Anrich Nortje is in fine form, taking a stack of wickets in the SA20 for Sunrisers Eastern Cape as they won the tournament. He knows the conditions, knows his game and can bowl economical and rapid spells.Wakankar: I have a nagging suspicion it could be someone like Chakravarthy, given the Indian conditions.He is deceptive and has a way of picking up wickets. His mystery element still seems to get batters in the key middle part of the innings.Nawaz: Saim Ayub from Pakistan. He has established himself as a genuine all-rounder over the past 12 months and been very effective in the powerplay.I know it is a big call to go with an opening batter as bowler to watch - but that's how good he's been.Norcross: Keshav Maharaj. The South African slow left-armer is in the form of his life.A complete master of his craft, he will be desperate to go one better after South Africa's loss in the final last time around.Men's ICC T20 World Cup 20267 February 2026 - 8 March 2026Live ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "body": "Having won only one of their past six Premier League games and drawn 2-2 at Tottenham after being 2-0 up, can second-placed Manchester City get back on track at Liverpool on Sunday?\"I wouldn't rule City out of anything at the moment\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. \"But the way they folded in the second half against Tottenham was a real worry.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.His guest for week 25 is Gladiators star Apollo, real name Alex Gray, who supports Newcastle.Before becoming a Gladiator, the 6ft 6in Gray played Premiership rugby for three teams and also American Football for NFL side Atlanta Falcons.He is part of Channel 5's Big Game Night NFL coverage and they are live on Super Bowl Sunday on 8 February from 22:30 GMT.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own Premier League predictions below - and for the Super Bowl too!The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, BBC / Hungry Bear MediaImage caption, In 2017, Gray became the first British rugby player to sign for an NFL team when he joined the Atlanta Falcons practice squad as a tight endThe NFL's influence can be seen in the Premier League through the kind of choreographed corner routines that are now commonplace, and Apollo can understand why Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has shared ideas with Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay.Apollo told BBC Sport: \"While football is quite a free-flowing game you do have these set-pieces and if you need some inspiration of how to make things happen then the NFL is a good place to look at, because that's what they do all day every day - not just on offence but on defence as well.\"What you are always trying to get in the NFL is mismatches, and that's exactly the same in football for some of the big guys coming in and trying to put the ball in the back of the net with a header or whatever.\"The level of detail that goes into that in the NFL is incredible. I remember my days there in training camp would start with breakfast at 7.30am and some days you wouldn't leave the meeting rooms until 11pm.\"We were only on the field for two hours max and in the gym for another hour, and the rest would be meetings and analysis.\"The scrutiny on every individual is so high so I can see why other sports would look at that and try to implement it themselves to find some weakness in the opposition armour. Arteta must have been thinking it is a way to help his team win games.\"Chris Sutton and Apollo - aka Alex Gray - were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.Image source, BBC / James Stack / Hungry Bear Media LtdImage caption, Gladiators star Apollo played Premiership rugby for Newcastle Falcons, London Irish and Bath, and captained England at Under-16, Under-18 and Under-20 level, as well as playing for England Sevens. One of Chris Sutton's seven cats is also called Apollo, but he wasn't named after him. Sutton also has seven dogs, tooPremier League predictionsFriday, 6 FebruaryElland Road, 20:00 GMTI am at this game and we are getting to the stage where it really matters how the teams fighting relegation do in their head-to-head-battles like this.I think the bottom two, Wolves and Burnley are down, but you don't know what West Ham will do from here.There are signs they may click, so with Leeds and Nottingham Forest both on 26 points, this is big for both of them.From a Leeds point of view, their home form has carried them a lot this season. They got walloped at Elland Road by Arsenal last weekend but they just have to put that behind them for this game because, as the season has gone on, they have proved they can be competitive.Forest's away form is actually better than their home form - they have picked up 14 points on the road compared to 12 at the City Ground, in the same number of games.Sean Dyche's side were comfortable with 10 men in the draw against Crystal Palace last time out and they have won their past two away games, against Brentford and the Hammers. Overall, they are unbeaten in four league games, which is the longest they have gone without losing all season.As you can see, I've looked into all the stats for you - but will my research help me get my prediction right? Probably not.This is going to be a very tight affair and Forest won't worry about having much possession, but scoring goals has been a bigger problem for them because they have missed Chris Wood badly - only Wolves have scored fewer than them.Forest have brought in 6ft 7in striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli to try to fill the gap left by Wood's long-term knee injury but he has not been in great form in Serie A this season.So, after a great deal of thought, I am going to back Leeds at home - although now I've said that it will probably end up as a 1-1 draw.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Apollo's prediction: When I looked at the fixtures I was thinking about who in the Gladiators supports who. Two of the guys, Giant and Hammer, are big Forest fans so I am going for a Leeds win here. It should be a good game though. 3-2AI's prediction: 2-1Saturday, 7 FebruaryOld Trafford, 12:30Manchester United were slightly fortunate to beat Fulham last time out. A draw would have been about right.Still, it was big for Benjamin Sesko to get their winner and I have got to say he put it away very nicely, especially because he should have scored with a header earlier in the game.Tottenham, meanwhile, produced a great comeback against Manchester City. I've talked about how much I rate Dominic Solanke and when he is up for Spurs, they are in a much better place as a team.There is a danger of getting carried away with United under Michael Carrick, and I am expecting Solanke to score again here, but it still feels like United will find a way to win it.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Apollo's prediction: Tottenham have an affinity with the NFL and I've been to a couple of games there so I am backing them here. 0-1AI's prediction: 2-2Vitality Stadium, 15:00Losing back-to-back home league games against Everton and Brentford has been a real killer for Aston Villa, who have so many injuries to contend with in their midfield.After a long wait for a win, Bournemouth have now won three of their past four league games - and I make them favourites at home here.Villa thumped the Cherries 4-0 at Villa Park in November, and I have got a lot of their players in my Fantasy team, but this is going to be a very different game.I've gone for 2-1 wins in my first two games and I don't really want to go for that scoreline again here, but I feel like I have no choice. I do think Villa will score - Morgan Rogers is always dangerous and Tammy Abraham is a clever signing up front - but Bournemouth will edge it.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Apollo's prediction: It's great for Villa to be in a title race. 1-2AI's prediction: 1-2Emirates Stadium, 15:00I am not going to say 2-1 for this one. Instead it will be another Arsenal clean sheet - they have already kept 12 in their first 24 league games, two more than any other team.It's a shame Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka is not fit to face his old club at the Emirates. When he played for the Black Cats against Arsenal in their draw at the Stadium of Light, they were the first team I saw who really rattled the Gunners.Xhaka's experience has helped to glue together a Sunderland side with a lot of young players this season, but they coped all right without him against Burnley on Monday.This is a much tougher game for them, obviously, and Sunderland's away form is nowhere near as strong as it is at home.Arsenal swept Leeds aside 4-0 last weekend, when everyone thought they were having a bit of a blip.They showed their strength in depth at Elland Road, when they lost Bukayo Saka in the warm-up, and I can see them winning comfortably this time too.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Apollo's prediction: This is very easy for me because Legend and Fire both support Arsenal and are real die-hard fans - Legend even has a cannon tattoo - so being absolutely honest I would love Sunderland to win, and do it for the north-east! 0-2AI's prediction: 4-0Turf Moor, 15:00I think Burnley are down but this is their chance to prove me wrong. They need it to be - they are at home, against a team one place above them in the table, so this is their big chance to end their long wait for a win.I just don't see it happening for the Clarets, though.As I said earlier, I am not sure which West Ham side will turn up but they have shown some improvement recently, especially in attack.I don't think the Hammers will keep a clean sheet because they have had only one all season - the fewest by any top-flight team - but I don't see Burnley beating them.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Apollo's prediction: My cousins are lifelong Burnley fans and season-ticket holders so if I didn't back them here, I'd be in a lot of trouble. The former NFL player, JJ Watt, is a co-owner of the club too, so for the NFL links and family ties, it's got to be a home win. 2-1AI's prediction: 1-2Craven Cottage, 15:00Everton asked about Fulham forward Harry Wilson on deadline day. He has been a revelation this season and they won't be looking forward to facing him on Saturday.The Toffees have got something after falling behind in their past three league games, including the last-gasp equaliser against Brighton that saw poor David Moyes booked for his celebration - there is no way you should get a yellow card for that.This is going to be another close game and it smells of another 2-1 to me, but I am not going to go down that road again this week.Instead, I'm going for a different scoreline but sticking with a narrow Fulham win. Marco Silva will feel his side deserved something from Old Trafford and it will be him celebrating at the final whistle this week, not Moyes.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Apollo's prediction: We don't like draws in the NFL but this might up all-square. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-1Molineux, 15:00Chelsea were accused of being too negative in their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal in midweek, but I can't see that being the case here.I was far too optimistic about Wolves last week when I said they would draw with Bournemouth and I am not making the same mistake this time.The games have been coming thick and fast for Chelsea and I actually admire their manager Liam Rosenior for the way he changed things up in their 3-2 comeback win over West Ham after being 2-0 down.Wolves boss Rob Edwards has probably got one eye on preparing for next season in the Championship, and his side will be one step nearer to that after this game.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Apollo's prediction: I went to a couple of Chelsea games when I lived in London and they will get the job done here. 1-2AI's prediction: 1-2St James' Park, 17:30You just wonder how much Newcastle have got left in the tank after their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday.The Magpies have a few injuries to contend with too, with Anthony Gordon the latest player to be sidelined, so they will have to dig deep and hope Bruno Guimaraes is back fit in time for this game.Brentford got one heck of a win last time out at Villa, and their manager Keith Andrews deserves a lot of credit for getting that result despite being down to 10 men for the entire second half.The Bees are always so well organised at the back, and how Eddie Howe's side try to break them down will be the key to this one.As good as Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade is with his back to goal, he doesn't run in behind. Doing that, and attacking with pace, is how Eddie Howe's side look the most dangerous - Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga will have to do that here, and I fancy Yoane Wissa to score against his former club.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Apollo on why he supports Newcastle: I am from a small town in County Durham - my grandmother went to school with Sir Bobby Robson - so I had the choice of Newcastle, Sunderland or Middlesbrough. I know it is absolute blasphemy to say this, but I like to see all the north-east clubs do well.Newcastle are my team though, because that's who I went to watch first - I went to see them against Ipswich in 2000, and Alan Shearer scored a couple - and it is my city as well. I played rugby for them and I lived there. It's a fantastic place and it's even better when the team is going well.Apollo's prediction: This is going to be a Newcastle win, it's just a case of how much. Brentford's performance coach Ben Ryan used to coach me for England Sevens, then he went to Fiji and got a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, so it would be nice to get one over him as well. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-1Sunday, 8 FebruaryAmex Stadium, 14:00Palace have brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen, and kept Jean-Philippe Mateta, so Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has got some options up front.I normally predict a draw in this game, and it ended up 0-0 at Selhurst Park in November. This time, though, I fancy Brighton. The Seagulls didn't quite get over the line against Everton, but them conceding late on actually won me some points. I am going for them to keep a clean sheet here though.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Apollo's prediction: Palace to edge it. 0-1AI's prediction: 2-1Anfield, 16:30It will be interesting to see if Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola starts with Omar Marmoush up front ahead of Erling Haaland after his two goals against Newcastle in midweek, but their attack looks strong anyway with Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo in the team.The same applies to Liverpool, who have got a striker in form in Hugo Ekitike, while Florian Wirtz is playing with confidence too.City will have moments where they will create chances, but Liverpool are going to have opportunities at the other end as well - there will be a few goals in this game.Sutton's prediction: 2-2Apollo's prediction: This is the 'Super Bowl' game of the weekend in the Premier League so I've gone for an NFL-type score as well as a football one. 22-31 (2-3)AI's prediction: 2-2And what about the Super Bowl?Super Bowl, Levi's Stadium 23:30 GMTI haven't got a clue about the NFL and I never played gridiron - my nose would be too big and would stick out of the helmet - but I am going for the Seahawks to down the Patriots on Sunday.Seattle is a really nice place and I played in their stadium for Celtic, so they get my backing here... although that's probably bad news for them, going by how I've done at predictions this season.Sutton's prediction: 28-10Apollo's prediction: The Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Aden Durde, was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program that took me to Atlanta. If he gets a Super Bowl, it would be the biggest accomplishment from someone from Britain in the NFL. 21-18AI's prediction: 23-27How did Sutton do last week?For the second successive week, the outcome went to the final game.Chris, the BBC readers and AI were all level on 80 points going into Monday's match between Sunderland and Burnley, with his guest - boxer Francesca Hennessy - on 40 points.Chris and Francesca went for a 1-0 Black Cats victory, the BBC readers thought they would win 2-0, while AI picked a 1-1 draw.Sunderland were 2-0 up after 32 minutes but the BBC readers' hopes of an outright win were scuppered when Chemsdine Talbi scored their third goal, 18 minutes from time.That meant Chris and the BBC readers tied for victory - they both managed six correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 matches in week 24, for a total of 90 points.AI managed five correct results with one correct score for a tally of 80 points, while Francesca also managed five correct results but with no exact scores, leaving her on 50 points.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJaroslav LukivNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer promised his client's full co-operation with the investigationPolice in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of \"aggravated corruption\". Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat. Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe. His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: \"We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.\"Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.\"The police added that further details would be given \"at a later stage\".Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was \"important that the facts of this case are brought to light\".He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.\"Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,\" he told Reuters news agency. Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit \"the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible\".Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.",

    "body": "17 hours agoBecky Morton,political reporterandPaul Seddon,political reporterReutersLord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador in Washington in December 2024Documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US are due to be released, following pressure from MPs.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has acknowledged the vetting process included discussion of Lord Mandelson's continued relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted.However, he has accused Lord Mandelson of lying throughout the process and misrepresenting the extent of their relationship.The BBC understands Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.It was essentially a two-stage process: an initial due diligence check prior to his appointment, followed by security vetting. So how did it work? Due diligenceThe due diligence check was carried out by a team at the Cabinet Office on behalf of Downing Street, as the prime minister was responsible for the appointment.The point of this check is to identify reputational risks or potential conflicts of interests that may need to be considered during the hiring process. Sir Chris Wormald, the UK's top civil servant, has previously confirmed to MPs that this was largely based on public information, such as media reports.At the time, it was public knowledge that the peer had maintained his relationship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor in 2008.In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail.The only non-public information that featured, Sir Chris added, were records of a meeting Lord Mandelson facilitated between Epstein and Sir Tony Blair that have since been disclosed by the National Archives.Lord Mandelson's file included information about his previous roles inside and outside government, and his \"professional and financial relationships\".His prior relationship with Epstein was listed as a reputational risk, Sir Chris added, alongside his previous two resignations as a minister during the last Labour government. Follow-up questionsAfter reviewing the file, No 10 sources said Sir Keir asked Lord Mandelson to address three specific questions, which were sent to him via email by the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.These questions were: why has he continued contact with Epstein after he was convicted? Why was he reported to have stayed in one of Epstein's homes while the financier was in prison? And was he associated with a charity founded by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell that the financier had backed?At the time, his answers were considered sufficient for him to be appointed to the role, meaning he then underwent security vetting. No 10 will no doubt face pressure to release them as part of the disclosure process approved by MPs.Security vettingIn addition to providing information about his private interests, Lord Mandelson would have undergone security vetting before taking up the role.The Foreign Office, which is responsible for Britain's overseas embassies, says all ambassadors are required to go through developed vetting (DV), the most intrusive process required to access the most secret government information.Security vetting is carried out by United Kingdom Security Vetting (UKSV), a specialist agency within the Cabinet Office.The process is designed to make sure those being vetted are unlikely to abuse their access to secret material, or be subject to blackmail or bribery.According to government guidance, those undergoing DV are required to fill out various questionnaires including information about their personal finances, internet use, medical conditions, and email addresses they hold.Several checks are carried out, including on candidates' credit history and to check if they have any criminal records. Those being vetted also have to undertake an interview with a specially trained vetting officer, which can cover areas including candidates' health, friendships, family and sexual history. The UKSV decides whether or not to award security clearance, and can attach mitigations, such as being prevented from seeing certain information.The results of this vetting are kept within a tight circle and only the vetting agency and the security team can see the contents. Ministers, including the prime minister, never see the details.Ultimately, Lord Mandelson was announced as the UK's ambassador to the US in December 2024.However, after less than a year in the role, he was sacked last September following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences.The government said the depth of their relationship was not known when he was appointed.However, the PM is now facing questions over whether the information in the public domain was enough to raise alarm bells.

    "body": "5 hours agoScott DuffieldGetty ImagesThree African countries have agreed to take back foreign offenders and illegal migrants after the UK Home Secretary threatened them with visa penalties.A month after the threat from Shabana Mahmood, Namibia and Angola agreed to cooperate on returns. The Home Secretary has now also secured cooperation from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\"My message is clear, if foreign governments refuse to accept the return of their citizens, then they will face consequences,\" she said following the agreement.The UK government had previously warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the DRC if their governments did not improve co-operation on removals.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto. It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".While setting out changes to the UK's asylum system in November, Mahmood warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with returns policies. Penalties included an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.Following the agreement with the three countries, Mahmood said: \"Illegal migrants and dangerous criminals will now be removed and deported back to Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"\"I will do what it takes to secure our order and control to our borders,\" she added.The government says over 3,000 people from these three countries could be eligible to be removed or deported due to the cooperation.The Home Secretary has indicated that ​countries which refuse to work with the UK on returns cannot expect a normal visa relationship, with further threats expected for lack of cooperation.It is understood that India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Somalia and Gabon are all resistant to returns deals and it is possible that the government could look at sanctions for those countries.",

Louvre MuseumOne of the crown's golden eagles is missing but all the emeralds and most of the diamonds remainTwo of the thieves got inside by cutting through the window with power tools. They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the area, and cut through the glass of two display cases housing jewellery that once belonged to French royalty or its imperial rulers.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for less than four minutes before making their escape on two scooters waiting outside.Police have arrested four male suspects who prosecutors allege are the thieves - but the mastermind behind the raid has not been tracked down. The seven other items of jewellery taken, including a diamond-studded tiara that belonged to Eugenie and necklaces, ear-rings and brooches remain missing.ReutersThe undamaged crown of French Empress Eugenie - seen here in a photograph from 2025",

    "body": "4 hours agoBBC\"PM battles for survival\" headlines Metro over Sir Keir Starmer's appointment of Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US. At the time of the appointment, it was public knowledge that Mandelson had maintained a friendship with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor. Sir Keir has told critics \"you're helping Reform\" by discussing the matter, according to Metro. The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. The PM's apology for \"believing Mandelson's lies\" tops the Independent. The paper reports that pressure from Labour MPs is now building \"to sack key aide Morgan McSweeney\".\"Labour 'women in grey suits' may be sent to No 10 to tell PM to resign\", writes the i Paper, a reference to the so-called \"men in grey suits\" who told Margaret Thatcher to resign in 1990. MPs believe the PM is now \"toast\", but Health Secretary Wes Streeting and former Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner \"won't challenge the Prime Minister yet\", according to the paper.The Times leads with the PM being labelled \"gullible and weak\" by former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman. The paper says Sir Keir's apology to Epstein's victims for Mandelson's appointment comes as \"Labour dismay grows\".The Daily Star says Sir Keir is \"in firing line\" over the fallout from the Epstein files. It headlines on \"the spy who failed me\" adding that the PM \"blamed Britain's spies\" for the appointment of Lord Mandelson to the role of ambassador to the US.The Guardian writes that Starmer is \"in appeal to Labour MPs as pressure grows for No 10 reset\". The paper also reports a private jet owned by \"Trump friend\" and \"Florida property tycoon\" Gil Dezer was used for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation flights. \"Starmer apologises to Epstein victims as crisis over Mandelson ties deepens\" headlines the Financial Times, with one minister saying that the PM could see an \"unedifying end\". The paper also splashes on more details from the Epstein files, saying Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor \"touted felon's business during Queen's visit to UAE\".Former Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner has told friends she is \"ready to go\" on a leadership campaign, according to the Daily Mail. \"As Starmer fights for his political life\", she is \"primed to strike\", it adds.The Daily Telegraph reports that an unresolved investigation into Angela Rayner's taxes could thwart any potential bid for the party leadership. Australian actress Margot Robbie is splashed on the front page as the film adaptation of \"Wuthering Heights\" premieres in London - \"it's me, Cathy\", the Telegraph captions the shot.Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney's son has been \"offered Man U deal\" leads the Sun. The \"teen is target\" as the paper headlines \"on me red, son\". \"Daily statins safe for millions more to take\" writes the Daily Express. A major review has found that the \"cholesterol-busting drugs are not responsible for side effects\", it reports.The Daily Mail believes that the former deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, is eyeing Sir Keir's Starmer job. \"I'm ready to go\" is its headline, reflecting what she's said to have told one Labour MP as the prime minister, in the paper's words, \"fights for his political life\". But the Daily Telegraph reports some MPs, including allies of the former deputy prime minister, believe she may be unable to stand while she awaits the outcome of an HMRC inquiry into her failure to pay a £40,000 stamp duty bill on a flat.The Daily Mirror says there is a \"Keir and present danger\" to the prime minister's tenure because of Lord Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. According to the i Paper, Labour MPs are \"wargaming\" how to get rid of Sir Keir. The paper says they are considering sending a delegation of senior female MPs to Downing Street to tell him to stand down as Tory men in grey suits told Margaret Thatcher to go in 1990.The Times reports that Sir Keir Starmer, his ministers and advisers will be forced to disclose all communication with Lord Mandelson before and after his appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US. The disclosure is expected to be the biggest release of previously confidential government documents since the Covid inquiry. The paper says the release has the potential to be \"politically explosive\".\"Daily statins safe for millions more to take\", declares the main headline in the Daily Express. The paper says a \"landmark study\" has found \"incontrovertible\" evidence that the drugs are not behind conditions such as memory loss, dementia and depression. Writing in the Express, Professor Bryan Williams of the British Heart Foundation says there's \"absolutely no doubt\" that \"statins save lives\". But the paper's editorial says while medicines play a \"crucial role\" for many \"getting active is the prescription\" they need.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "10 hours agoPaul Seddon,Political reporterandJack Fenwick,Political correspondentReutersThe US has backed the UK's deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a key military base, Downing Street has told the BBC.On Thursday, Donald Trump signalled his approval for the move, describing Sir Keir Starmer's agreement as the \"best he could make\".It comes just a few weeks after the US president prompted fears in Whitehall that he would withdraw his support, after he branded the deal an \"act of great stupidity\".Trump's comments led to additional talks between officials to confirm continued American support for the agreement, which will impact the future of a joint UK-US airbase. During a conversation on Thursday, the two leaders \"agreed on the importance\" of the deal to secure the base, Downing Street said.A spokeswoman said they agreed the UK and US would \"continue to work closely on the implementation of the deal\".In a post on his Truth Social platform earlier on Thursday, Trump wrote that his discussions with Sir Keir had been \"very productive\".He added: \"I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make.\"\"However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,\" he said.Asked about Trump's comments, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: \"He spoke with Prime Minister Starmer directly, he understands Prime Minister Starmer's position - and he supports it.\"\"But as the president reiterated in that statement, of course, the United States reserves the right to protect our assets.\" Greenland rowWarren Stephens, the US's ambassador to the UK, said while the \"ideal\" outcome would be for the UK not to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, it was the \"best deal on the table for successive UK governments\".Echoing the president, Stephens said the US \"retains the right to maintain and to reinforce our security interests on Diego Garcia if needed in the future\".He added in a post on Truth Social: \"The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\"Trump's criticism of the agreement came during an international row over his threats to take control of Greenland.The comments threw into doubt whether the US would continue to support the Chagos deal. At the time, Downing Street said it believed the US still supported it, despite the president's comments.Officials in London and Washington have since been involved in talks to determine whether US support for the agreement still stood.The BBC understands those talks, which included two direct phone calls between Starmer and Trump, have now been completed.'Appalling surrender'A draft law to ratify the Chagos Islands deal is making its way through Parliament but has been delayed since the president's outburst last month.Sir Keir has insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.The deal has been heavily criticised by the Conservatives and Reform UK, who argue it undermines national security because of Mauritius's ties to China.Conservative shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti Patel, said Trump's statement \"recognises a critical weakness in the surrender deal\" about the lease arrangements.\"The Conservative Party's view is unchanged,\" she added. \"We have led the fight against this appalling surrender and we will continue fighting it to the end.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoKali HaysTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe price of Bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level in 15 months despite US president Donald Trump's personal and public support of cryptocurrency.A single Bitcoin is now worth $66,000 (£48,700), its lowest level since October of 2024, with the price down 24% since the start of this year.The drop followed months of surging Bitcoin prices, which saw the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $122,200 in October.Investors were encouraged by Trump's involvement in the sector and his outspoken support for cryptocurrencies, as well as promises to ease legislation on the industry.Key cryptocurrency terms and what they meanAmong Trump's first actions upon re-entering the White House in January 2025 was an executive order aimed at making the US the \"crypto capital of the planet\".In his first year back in office, Trump launched a personal brand of cryptocurrency, with the bulk of profits going into his own companies. And he continued his involvement with World Liberty Financial, an investment vehicle for other crypto assets that is owned by the Trump family.  During the Trump administration so far, he has signed a law to support federal backing of cryptocurrency, dissolved a Department of Justice team focused on enforcement of crypto regulation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped crypto-related enforcement work and investigations.  Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee in November called out Trump's \"pro-crypto agenda\", noting that the president had amassed crypto holdings worth more than $11bn and gained personal income of $800mn from crypto transactions since taking office.With Thursday's drop, Bitcoin prices are down 32% in the last 12 months and are trending toward prices seen in early 2024 and 2021.Bitcoin is the world's largest and generally most well-known cryptocurrency, a form of digital-only money that is not controlled by a centralised financial institution.Why has Bitcoin lost value?Bitcoin prices tend to be volatile, but analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note on Wednesday that the latest drop was \"triggered by\" Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh, as the new chair of the Federal Reserve. Some believe he will take a more \"hawkish\" approach, keeping interest rates higher, whereas looser monetary policy tends to support investment in assets such as crypto currencies.Bitcoin prices have been trending down for the last four months, Deutsche noted, and there has been growing negative sentiment around cryptocurrency more broadly.\"This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,\" it said.While Deutsche does not expect crypto to disappear, it also did not predict Bitcoin would return to Trump-driven highs.The bank said the digital token was moving from being a \"purely speculative asset\" into a more realistic phase as an asset that \"needs to find its specific role\".William Barhydt, chief executive of Abra Capital Management, an investment firm focused on crypto assets, agreed that cryptocurrency is maturing, but he expects prices to rebound.\"I wouldn't say that it has to rebound, but I can't see how it doesn't,\" Barhydt said, noting that this is not the first time Bitcoin has seen significant swings in value.\"The only way it doesn't is if we end up in some kind of war,\" Barhydt added.  Other popular cryptocurrencies are Ethereum and Solana. Their prices have both dropped roughly 37% so far in 2026. According to CoinGecko, which tracks the performance of thousands of cryptocurrencies, the market has lost over $1 trillion in value in the last month alone and $2 trillion in value since the market peaked in October.Stifel, a US-based investment and research firm, said in a note to investors that Bitcoin prices may drop as low as $38,000. The firm pointed to a new trend of cryptocurrency more closely following the prices of the US Dollar.",

    "body": "Increase school funding to meet need for special education, MPs urge8 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPA MediaEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson is trying to build a consensus around the SEND reformsSchool funding for special educational needs (SEND) should be increased and protected to meet the rise in demand for support, a group of MPs has said, as ministers consider major reforms.The cross-party group of mostly Labour MPs called on the government to \"align funding to need\" and give schools \"inflation-proofed\" budgets in its plan to overhaul SEND provision in England.The proposals are challenging for the government, which faces significant pressures from the rising costs of a SEND system, widely considered to be in crisis.The Department for Education (DfE) said it was investing more in schools as it seeks to improve outcomes for children with special educational needs.While the department said school funding is increasing by £1.7bn in 2026-27, budgets appear to be tight once rising SEND costs are taken into account.The government has decided to pay SEND costs currently covered by councils from 2028, a move that is forecast to create a £6bn pressure.In recent analysis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the government had three options for addressing this pressure: increase education funding, reforms to slow the growth of SEND spending, or cuts.There is a risk of a backlash against reforms among parents and Labour MPs who are worried SEND support could be limited in some way.Labour MP Neil Duncan-Jordan, who rebelled against the government's welfare reforms last year, said any changes to SEND provision had to be \"driven by making the system better, not by saving money\".\"We need buy-in from parents for this to work,\" the MP for Poole said.\"The last thing any government needs is an army of parents who are against them because they think they're making their lives worse.\"Local authorities have a legal duty to meet the needs of eligible pupils but are struggling to afford the mounting costs of this as demand grows. More than 1.7 million children in England have special educational needs and the number has risen considerably in recent years.Public spending on children with high needs has increased from £7.5bn in 2016 to £12bn in 2025, a real-terms rise of 66%.A government policy paper that is expected to propose changes to SEND provision is due to be published in February, after being delayed.The Department for Education launched a survey last year and the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on SEND submitted proposals, which have been seen by the BBC.Ministers 'in listening mode'In the submission, the group said: \"Inflation has eroded the real value of core funding in schools and special places; restoring it and protecting early help budgets will underpin timely support.\"The MPs also said national SEND policy \"should align expectations and funding with the level of need settings are now asked to meet\".The APPG also called for more investment in early years and a national SEND workforce plan.Anything perceived as cuts would alarm many involved in the APPG, a group that is keen to influence Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson as her department prepares the reforms.In recent months, ministers have been meeting Labour MPs from the group to get their input and build support for the reforms, should they be voted on in Parliament.Ministers have faced calls not to scrap education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which are legal documents guaranteeing bespoke support for pupils assessed as having high needs.One MP said ministers are \"in listening mode\".Labour MP Jen Craft said money is not being spent well in the SEND systemLabour MP Jen Craft, a vice-chair of the APPG who is the mother of a disabled daughter with an EHCP, recently met Phillipson to discuss SEND issues.The MP for Thurrock said improving early intervention and making mainstream schools more inclusive could lead to a reduction in high-needs support and save money.\"The system is not necessarily focused on the needs of the children it is supposed to be there to help,\" Craft said. \"There's an enormous amount of money in the system but it's not being spent well.\"She has organised events to gather the views of pupils, parents and teachers on SEND provision in her Thurrock constituency.In a report, she wrote: \"The government should look closely at its plans for SEND funding, particularly the discrepancies between local authorities, the potential to ringfence budgets, and investment in early years to prevent children's needs escalating.\"All parties in Westminster agree the SEND system in England needs reforming.The Conservatives and the Green Party have not set out clear policies.The Liberal Democrats have outlined five fundamental principles that should underpin the coming reform, including a \"fair funding system\" that incentivises schools to accept SEND pupils.Reform UK is developing its own SEND policy and is expected to set out some of its ideas early this year.\"SEND needs reform not more money,\" Reform MP Richard Tice said. \"It has had billions more in recent years and outcomes have not improved at all.\"A DfE spokesperson said the government was spending £200m on giving all teachers SEND training and at least £3bn on creating 50,000 new specialist places.The spokesperson said the SEND reforms \"will be driven by our mission to improve outcomes for all children\".The department, the spokesperson added, was \"laying the groundwork for an inclusive education system where children are supported at the earliest stage and can thrive in a school that meets their needs, close to home\".",

    "body": "The difficult question of what it would take to stop Putin fighting in Ukraine47 minutes agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also huge dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoRoddy RobertsonA historic former railway bridge has been cordoned off by police after a section of it collapsed into the River Spey in Moray.The Spey Viaduct, an iron girder structure near Garmouth, was completed in 1886 and while no longer used for trains, was popular with cyclists and walkers.Images on social media showed one of its supporting stone piers was leaning at an angle and part of the metalwork had twisted and fallen into the river. Local SNP MSP Richard Lochhead said people in the area would be devastated and questioned whether the structure has been adequately maintained. Drone footage shows bridge collapsed into the River SpeyHe said: \"The local community will be heartbroken by the collapse of the much-loved Spey viaduct, which is not only an iconic structure but also incredibly popular with walkers, cyclists, and tourists.\"I'm now in touch with Moray Council seeking answers around when and by whom the structure was last checked, and what happens next with regards to the future of the bridge.\"Roddy RobertsonOne of the supporting stone piers could be seen at an angle in the riverTrev MooreDrone footage showed how a section of the bridge had twisted and fallen into the riverThe bridge spans 350ft (107m) over the River Spey, regarded as the fastest flowing river in ScotlandThe railway line closed in the 1960s but the bridge, also known as the Garmouth Viaduct, was later paved. The Speyside Way, a long-distance trail which traces the River Spey from the Moray Firth to the Cairngorms National Park, passes the east end of the bridge.It is also part of the National Cycle Network.Moray Council, which manages the trail, said the bridge would remain closed until further notice.Roddy RobertsonThe bridge has been cordoned off and Moray Council says it is closed until further noticeA council statement said: \"Our engineers are aware and will assess the situation before further detail can be provided.\"Members of the public and media are asked to keep their distance from the rest of the bridge structure.\"Do not pass the police cordon in place and do not climb on any part of the bridge - thank you for your co-operation.\"Local councillor Shona Morrison said she was \"incredibly saddened by the news\". \"The viaduct holds such a special place in my family's heart,  it is devastating to see the collapse of such a well-loved and iconic landmark.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoAlex BoydGetty ImagesFive men have been arrested in Germany suspected of being involved in a plot to drive a vehicle into people at a Christmas market.Three Moroccans, an Egyptian and a Syrian were detained on Friday over the plan to target a market in the southern Bavarian state. Authorities said they suspected an \"Islamist motive\".Prosecutors said the Egyptian - a 56-year-old - was alleged to have \"called for a vehicle attack... with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible\". The Moroccans allegedly agreed to carry out the attack.Officials in Germany have been on high alert after previous attacks at Christmas markets, including in Magdeburg last December that killed six people.Authorities did not say when the planned attack was supposed to take place or which market was the target, though said they believed it to be one in the Dingolfing-Landau area, north east of Munich.German newspaper Bild reported the Egyptian man was an imam at a mosque in the area.Police said the Moroccan men - aged 30, 28 and 22 - were arrested accused of having agreed to commit murder, while the Syrian man, a 37-year-old, was accused of encouraging the suspects \"in their decision to commit the crime\".The five suspects appeared before a magistrate on Saturday and remain in custody.Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's state interior minister, told Bild the \"excellent cooperation between our security services\" had helped to prevent \"a potentially Islamist-motivated attack\".Christmas markets are popular festive attractions throughout Germany, frequently attracting large crowds and significant tourism.Security at events has been increased in recent years, since an attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoEmily AtkinsonWatch: Eyewitness captures moment man tackles and disarms Bondi shooterA \"hero\" bystander who was filmed wrestling a gun from one of the Bondi Beach attackers has been named as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed.Video verified by the BBC showed Mr Ahmed run at the gunman and seize his weapon, before turning the gun round on him, forcing his retreat. Mr Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father of two, remains in hospital, where he has undergone surgery for bullet wounds to his arm and hand, his family told 7News Australia.Fifteen people died and dozens were injured in the shooting on Sunday night, which took place as more than 1,000 people attended an event to celebrate Hanukkah. Police have declared it a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.Mr Ahmed's cousin, Mustafa, told 7News Australia late on Sunday:  \"He is a hero, 100% he is a hero. He has two shots, one in his arm and one in his hand.\"In an update early on Monday, Mustafa said: \"I hope he will be fine. I saw him last night. He was alright but we're waiting to see what the doctor (says).\"Police say that the two shooters involved were a father and son aged 50 and 24. They confirmed that the 50-year-old man died at the scene while the 24-year-old remains in hospital in critical condition.The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention has been shared widely online.It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of shot.Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker, whom he tackles.He manages to wrestle the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker begins to retreat back to the bridge.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.The same attacker is later seen on the bridge picking up another weapon and firing again.Another gunman also continues firing from the bridge. It's unclear who or what they are aiming at.Mr Ahmed managed to wrestle the gun from the attacker in the struggle At a news conference late on Sunday, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns paid tribute to the bravery of Mr Ahmed, who was unnamed at the time.\"That man is a genuine hero, and I've got no doubt there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.\"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said: \"We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.\"These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.\"Speaking at a White House Christmas reception, US President Donald Trump also praised Mr Ahmed, saying he had \"great respect\" for him. \"It's been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,\" he said.

    "body": "53 minutes agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, SantiagoReutersJosé Antonio Kast will be inaugurated as Chile's president in March next yearChile has elected the far-right wing José Antonio Kast to be its next president, after an election campaign that was dominated by themes of security, immigration and crime.Kast won decisively with more than 58% of the vote in his third attempt at running for president.It marks the biggest shift to the right since the end of Chile's military dictatorship in 1990. Kast has openly praised Chile's former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.He beat the governing left-wing coalition's candidate, Jeannette Jara, from the Communist Party.At a gathering of his supporters in the capital Santiago, many draped in Chilean flags, chanting and taking selfies, there was jubilation as the results came through.\"I'm happy we can recover the country's security and patriotism,\" said Augustina Trancoso, donning a red \"Make Chile Great Again\" cap.\"We've been trying to win an election for years,\" said Belem Valdivieso. \"In Chile, you used to be able to walk the streets peacefully, lately we've experienced problems with insecurity. I'm hoping his promises will be kept and he'll focus on security.\"Throughout the campaign, Kast portrayed Chile as a country that was descending into chaos and insecurity. He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.Kast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president. He has pledged a border wall on Chile's porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia, maximum-security prisons, and mass deportations of irregular migrants, many of whom are from Venezuela.Augustina Trancoso voted for Kast in Sunday's presidential electionChile is one of the safest and more stable countries in South America, but a rise in immigration and organised crime in recent years has concerned many voters. Kast regularly drew links between the two.His critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.One voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast's policies but ended up voting for Jara. She said she felt \"like a false sense of insecurity is becoming widespread.\"\"In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here. It just doesn't add up for me.\"Chile's murder rate is now falling, and some studies suggest those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average. But the perception of growing insecurity was the motivation for many of Kast's voters.\"We are transforming into Colombia, a lot of terrorism, thieves, robbery, society is very unsafe,\" one voter Max Struber said.\"It may sound harsh to say it, but we need the government to continue Pinochet's work. Human rights abuses existed, that's true. But as a government it was good, we used to have peace and tranquility.\"Kast's brother was a minister during Pinochet's dictatorship, and his father was a member of the Nazi party. Pinochet was an army general who led a US-backed military coup in 1973 and established a 17-year-long military dictatorship that was marked by brutal human rights abuses, forced disappearances and free-market economic policies.ReutersCommunist Party member Jeannette Jara was the left-wing coalition candidateChile's current left-wing President Gabriel Boric, who could not run again, had suffered from low approval ratings. Kast's rival Jeannette Jara may have suffered by being seen as a \"continuity vote\".A supporter at his victory party, Francisco Otero, said neither candidate represented everybody perfectly, but that a continuation of the government was seen as \"much worse\".After the result Jara posted that \"democracy has spoken loud and clear\" and wished Kast \"success for the good of Chile.\"\"We will continue working to advance a better life in our country,\" she added.Her supporters fear Kast's election marks a return to Chile's far-right past.\"Kast's family helped the dictator Augusto Pinochet,\" Ricardo Herrera said, adding that he lived through Pinochet's dictatorship and it was \"brutal\".Some are sceptical, though, that Kast will actually do what he's pledged.\"Kast says he wants to expel 360,000 undocumented migrants. He won't be able to do that. It's physically impossible,\" one voter Hector Lunes said.Ricardo Herrera, who lived through Pinochet's rule, voted for Jeannette JaraKast has also been firmly against abortion, even in cases of rape, and environmental protection policies.His victory will likely be welcomed by investors as he has pledged a free-market approach to economics to shrink the state and deregulate certain industries.This was the first presidential election in Chile where voting was mandatory and registration was automatic for those eligible.This left some voters feeling like they had to pick whichever they say was the \"least-worst\" option.\"I don't know if I'd say the lesser of two evils, but I think Chile needs a change,\" Claudio Sanjuez said, \"and I clearly think Kast could be that alternative\".\"Both candidates were like opposite extremes,\" Cintia Urrutia said, but added she'd hoped for Jeannette Jara who she perceived as more \"centrist\".Kast's victory in Chile follows a string of elections in Latin America that have shifted the region to the Right in recent years – including in Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.He will be inaugurated on 11 March 2026. At rallies, he regularly counted down the days until this date warning undocumented immigrants that they should leave before then if they ever want the chance to return.",

    "body": "46 minutes agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentThe new chief of MI6, Blaise Metreweli, will warn of \"the acute threat posed by Russia\" when she makes her first public speech later. She will highlight so-called hybrid warfare, which includes incidents such as cyber attacks and drones suspected of being launched near critical infrastructure by Russian proxies.Ms Metreweli will describe this as \"an acute threat posed by an aggressive, expansionist and revisionist Russia\".Referring to the war in Ukraine, she will insist that Britain will be keeping up the pressure on President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine's behalf.Ms Metreweli, who took over as head of the Secret Intelligence Service in the autumn, is the first woman to head Britain's overseas spy agency. She took over from Sir Richard Moore on 1 October.Monday's speech will point to the recent sanctioning of Russian entities accused of conducting information warfare, as well as two China-based companies sanctioned for their \"indiscriminate cyber activities against the UK and its allies\".Western sanctions have certainly damaged Russia's economy, driving its exports eastwards towards China and India. But they have singularly failed to change President Putin's determination to wage war on Ukraine until it gives in to his demands for territory and ultimately, loyalty to Moscow.It is also clear from Ms Metreweli's speech that a special area of interest for the new spy chief is technology.Having joined MI6 in 1999, she has arrived at the top job via Q Branch. Named after the fictional MI6 division in Ian Fleming's spy books, this is the real life, in-house, top secret part of the Secret Intelligence Service that designs the sorts of gadgets and gizmos that enable agents to communicate with their handlers, without being detected and caught.In her speech later she is expected to call on all her intelligence officers to master technology, \"not just in our labs, but in the field, in our tradecraft.. We must be as comfortable with lines of [computer] code as we are with human sources, as fluent in Python as we are in multiple languages\".Python, a programming language, may surprise some as an example to pick, since it has been around for more than three decades. But her point will not be lost on the men and women who have chosen to work in the shadowy world of espionage.In an age where data is key, where spies can no longer rely on false identities when biometric scanning can unmask them in seconds at borders and checkpoints, MI6 needs to prove that it can still be relevant.Elsewhere, the Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Richard Knighton, will on Monday call for a \"whole of society approach\" to building national resilience, in the face of growing threats and uncertainty.In a speech to the Royal United Services Institute in London, Sir Richard is expected to say that defence and resilience need to be a higher priority for everyone, not just those in the military.It is the latest in a string of warnings that the UK needs to be more ready than it is now to meet a growing volume of threats.Sir Richard is expected to say that the situation is more dangerous than he has known during his entire career.Russia has made it clear that it wishes to challenge, limit, divide and ultimately destroy Nato, he will say. Britain's response needs to be about more than simply strengthening the armed forces. Deterrence, he will say, involves harnessing the UK's power, from its universities to industry, the rail network and the NHS.\"A new era for defence doesn't just mean our military and government stepping up - as we are - it means our whole nation stepping up,\" he will say.Addressing a skills gap highlighted in a recent report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, Sir Richard will talk about the need to work with industry and young people and will announce £50m for new defence technical excellence colleges.In recent weeks, both France and Germany have outlined plans for voluntary national service.Last year, the then-Conservative government set out its own compulsory proposals, which Labour dismissed as a gimmick.But the debate about how Britain as a whole should respond to an increasingly uncertain world is gathering pace.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoYasmin RufoGetty ImagesAt first glance, my emails are polite and warm, after all \"I'm just checking\" in on a deadline but \"no worries either way\". However, a closer look reveals my messages are punctuated by unnecessary apologies, smiley faces, exclamation marks and even kisses.I like to think I'm being friendly and approachable, but according to experts, these linguistic habits may be quietly undermining how seriously I'm taken at work.Careers coach Hannah Salton and etiquette coach William Hanson explain why so many of us write like this and the impact it could be having on how we're perceived, and even promoted at work. Is your punctuation extra?\"Thanks very much!\" I've replied to many an email - my punctuation may be extra but a full stop feels blunt.People use exclamation marks to show \"positivity and enthusiasm,\" says Hannah.Women use them three times more often than men, a recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found.She thinks that’s likely down to the idea that \"women are often judged more harshly than men when they are direct and are called bossy and other gendered negative words\". And while a single exclamation mark isn't the problem the cumulative effect can be, warns Hannah. “If it looks fake or like it's covering up insecurity it could impact credibility,” she explains.Would you kiss them in real life?Written communication is notoriously easy to misread, which is why many of us insert an emoji as a picture of our warmth or humour.But etiquette coach William Hanson warns this can backfire. \"One emoji can mean different things to different people or something entirely unintended,\" he says.\"It would be better if people used words and a good command of English,\" he advises.Emojis can have an \"infantile connotation\" which could lead to people perceiving you as younger, less senior, capable or responsible, he says.\"I would not put an emoji in an email,\" he says. \"You can be friendly in your writing and remain professional at the same time.\" And when it comes to signing off with a kiss, he says: \"I would never put a kiss on the end of an email unless I would kiss them on the cheek in real life.\" Softening language can dilute authority\"Just checking that you're following me and this all makes sense?\"Emails containing reassurance checkers can be self-depreciating,\" Hannah says, adding that over time, that tone can subtly shape how someone is perceived.\"As a manager, it's a difficult balance of being liked and respected and if you're not direct, there's a risk of creating an impression of being less capable,\" she says.\"There are definitely times where communicating in an overly apologetic or overly measured way can make you come across as less impactful.\" \"A lot of it is unconscious,\" Hannah says. \"No one reads an email and thinks 'oh, they don't back themselves', it's more subtle than that.\"But if you're consistently communicating in a people-pleasing way, that can build up an impression of someone who doesn't back themselves, or who is potentially less competent.\"What to cut out of your emailsHere are some of the things you might want to consider losing to appear more professional, our experts suggest:Qualifying words such as \"just\" (\"just checking\", \"just wondering\")Pre-emptive apologies like \"sorry to bother you\" or \"I'm sure you're really busy but…\"Reassurance checkers such as \"does that make sense?\", \"hope that's ok\" or \"no worries either way\"Exclamation marksEmojisKisses or overly warm sign-offsHannah and William stress it's not about stripping all warmth or personality from professional communication. \"Personal style is important,\" Hannah says. \"Showcasing personality at work is not a bad thing. You don't want to feel like you have to filter everything you write and remove any personality from it.\"But at the same time you shouldn't use certain words and symbols \"as a tool to be liked\". A practical way to spot and reduce these habits without losing personality is to pay attention to the emails you receive and notice how different styles make you feel - what sounds clear, confident or reassuring, and what feels excessive, she says.Salton says AI tools can also be useful for reviewing drafts and removing excess filler or qualifier words.",

    "body": "'Everyone says it'll never be me' - Brown University student on surviving two mass shootings4 hours agoNada TawfikandPratiksha Ghildial,in Providence, Rhode IslandBrown student speaks to BBC after surviving second school shootingWith the holiday break just around the corner, 21-year-old Mia Tretta was in her dorm with a friend studying for their final exams.Just like other students at Brown University, she was distraught after receiving an active shooter alert from the university's department of public safety.But the difference for her is she has lived through this once before.Mia was shot in the 2019 mass shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California. She told the BBC it shattered her sense of safety and innocence.\"Everyone always tells themselves it'll never be me,\" she said. Mia TrettaMia spent more than a week in the hospital recovering after the 2019 shootingA 16-year-old boy shot her in the stomach and four others; two of them died including her best friend.A junior in high school at the time, Mia spent more than a week in the hospital recovering. She still has bullet fragments in her stomach, and has had multiple surgeries for nerve pain and to fix a hole in her eardrum.Attending Brown University, on the other side of the country, in Rhode Island, was meant to get her far away from what happened, in order to feel safe again. She told herself at least it wouldn't happen again, until it did.\"Gun violence doesn't care if you've already been shot before, and it doesn't care what community you're in,\" she said.\"It's an epidemic that touches every single community.\"Mia now feels a mixture of fear, confusion and anger. Americans, she says, shouldn't accept mass shootings as a fact of life.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMia spoke about gun violence during a visit to the White House in 2022Her generation has grown up practising active shooter drills in schools, and she is not the only student at Brown University who has now lived through their second school shooting.At a press conference on Sunday, the mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, was asked what could be done to stop the \"uniquely American experience\" of mass shootings on campuses. He was reluctant to weigh in with the investigation ongoing and the victims still recovering, but he shared a conversation he had had with one of the injured students. \"When I was at the hospital today - one of students that showed tremendous courage literally said to me, 'you know that active shooter drill they made me do in high school it actually helped me in the moment',\" he said.\"Which at the same time provided me hope, and was so sad. They shouldn't have to do active shooter drills but it helped, and the reason it helped and the reason we do these drills is because it's so damn frequent.\"Driving around campus, there is still a heavy police presence even though the lockdown has been lifted. One student, who was leaving for the holidays, said: \"Our perfect bubble, that we've been in for so long, just shattered.\"",

    "body": "More than 700 migrants crossed the Channel on Saturday after a four-week gap in small boat crossings, according to the latest Home Office figures.The arrival in Dover of 737 migrants on 11 boats marked the end of the longest period without any small boat crossings in seven years.It brings the total number of people making the Channel crossing so far this year to 40,029, surpassing 2024, when there were 36,816 for the entire year.The last recorded arrivals before Saturday were on 14 November, marking the longest uninterrupted stretch since 2018.December is typically a quieter month for crossings due to adverse weather conditions and this is thought to have contributed to the lull. In recent months, the UK government has ramped up efforts to tackle small boat crossings but the measures are not expected to have an immediate impact.Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy met ministers from other European nations last week to discuss reforms to the European Convention on Human Rights that would make it easier to deport illegal migrants.In November, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced asylum changes that include making refugee status in the UK temporary and subject to review every 30 months.The changes would also see refugees sent home if their country is deemed safe.The UK government's \"one in, one out\" agreement with France began in August and as of 27 November 2025, 153 people had been returned through the scheme.A Home Office spokesperson said previously the \"number of small boat crossings are shameful and the British people deserve better\".\"This government is taking action,\" they added. \"We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.\"",

    "body": "Image source, GettyBySimon King Lead Weather Presenter and Ema SabljakBBC England Data UnitWe've had songs written about it, it features on Christmas cards and films - with almost every advert throughout December showing it.Most of us will dream or romanticise about a white Christmas, but how common or not is it to have one in the United Kingdom?According to the Met Office, an \"official white Christmas\" has happened more often than not since 1960, but new analysis of its data by the BBC shows that locally, snow falling on Christmas Day is rare for most of us.And there have been fewer stations reporting a white Christmas in the past two decades across the UK, according to the data.The Met Office officially defines a white Christmas as one where snow is reported to fall at any of its weather stations in the 24 hours of Christmas Day.If there was no snow falling but snow already on the ground, this is not defined as a white Christmas.On this definition, three out of four Christmases since 1960 have seen at least a flake of snow fall somewhere in the UK.Analysis of Met Office data by the BBC shows at a very local level it's unlikely you will have experienced many white Christmases where you live.For example, during the most recent white Christmas in 2023, snowfall was only seen at three stations in the Highlands and one in Aberdeenshire.Use the tool below to see how many white Christmases have been reported at weather stations near you.While the official definition of a white Christmas has changed in the past, along with the number of stations and how it is observed, the data will still include all recorded instances of snow falling on Christmas Day.'It probably frightened Father Christmas'Ian Currie from London was 12 years old when he was given a weather station for Christmas in 1962. It included a rain gauge, a funnel and a brass container. On Boxing Day, he said it snowed so much, his instruments were buried.\"I remember the milk bottles freezing with a column of ice,\" said Mr Currie, who went on to become a weather forecaster, author and editor of Weather Eye magazine.\"Couldn't be better timed to encourage a young weatherman in the making.\" \"The classic white Christmas that I remember was 1970,\" he added.\"It snowed heavily the day before and over Christmas Day and Boxing Day - metres of snow fell.\"He recalled \"a terrific flash of lightning and almost instantaneous crash of thunder, which woke quite a few people up - and probably frightened Father Christmas\".Image source, GettyImage caption, There is lots of nostalgia about waking up on Christmas Day with a blanket of snow with more fallingDreaming of a white Christmas?The classic \"white Christmas\" idea is thought to originally come from the Victorian era when snowy winter days were much more frequent than today.Coincidentally this is a period when sending Christmas cards first became widespread, depicting the snow scenes of the time, a tradition that continues to the day.Christmas movies originating from the United States also show snowfall on Christmas Day, something more common in parts of North America.While it is likely somewhere in the UK will see snow falling at Christmas, for the majority, this will not be the case.Most white Christmases are found, perhaps unsurprisingly, in Scotland where over the past 65 years, 43 were \"white\". Northern Ireland had the least with less than a third of those years recording a white Christmas.In fact, Northern Ireland has not recorded a white Christmas for 14 years.Across England you will have most likely experienced a white Christmas in the North West where nearly 40% of years recorded snow on Christmas Day since 1960.Quite a contrast to the South East where since 1960, London has only seen five Christmas Days where snow fell, the last one more than two decades ago in 2001.Image source, NASA WorldviewImage caption, On Christmas Day in 2010 there was widespread lying snow across the UKYou might remember Christmas of 2010 when most of us would have opened the curtains on Christmas Day to a Christmas card scene with snow on the ground.About 80% of weather stations recorded lying snow that year but only 30 stations had snowfall meeting the definition of a white Christmas. Compare this to 2004 when snow was observed at 146 weather stations.Francesca Di Giuseppi, principal scientist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, was in Reading over the Christmas period in 2010 and remembers having snowball fights with the friends she lived with.Image source, Francesca Di GiuseppiImage caption, Scientist Francesca Di Giuseppi said she had found the snow \"actually quite magical\"\"We made a snowman - I remember not having a carrot to put on the nose, so we ended up with an apple,\" she said.\"We were a household of southern Europeans, not very used to snow in our home countries. It was actually quite magical.\"She said she believed the excitement over white Christmases stemmed from snow slowing things down, meaning it is an excuse be at home with family and \"see the beauty of nature\".White Christmas and climate changeThe Met Office data analysed by the BBC suggests there have been fewer widespread white Christmases in past two decades.While we cannot use what happens on one day of the year to assess whether the decline is due explicitly to climate change, scientists suggest a white Christmas will become less likely in the future.According to the Met Office, the UK has already warmed by 1C since about the 1950s and we have seen less frost and snow as a result.In the 1990s and early-2000s there were five years with a widespread white Christmas where more than 100 weather stations reporting falling snow.But in the past 20 years the most stations reporting a white Christmas was 30 in 2010.So far in the 2020s there have already been four white Christmases declared with snowfall reported somewhere in the UK but falling snow was only confirmed by at most six stations in a year.While better technology means recording snowfall at just one location in the UK has increased the likelihood of having a confirmed white Christmas, the number of stations actually seeing snow on Christmas Day appears to have declined.Our winters are expected to get warmer and wetter and a Met Office spokesperson confirmed snowy spells were \"becoming less frequent as our climate warms\".They added \"natural variability means cold, snowy periods will still happen\", but we can expect \"fewer frost and snow days\".Additional reporting by Alix Hattenstone.",

    "body": "Kemi Badenoch says the Conservatives will scrap the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles due to come into force in the UK if they win the next election.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Conservative Party leader said the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate (ZEV) was a \"well-meaning but ultimately destructive piece of legislation\".From 2030, all new cars will have to be electric or hybrid as part of government efforts to meet a legally binding aim of achieving \"net zero\" by 2050.The Conservative leader's comments come after her meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has lobbied the EU to water down its own plans for a ban.Net zero refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere.Six EU countries, including Italy, have recently called on other member states to rethink plans to phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, saying it could hurt industrial competitiveness.Badenoch suggested the EU had signalled it would drop a full ban, adding: \"The reality is that the EU's change of heart on EVs will leave Labour even more isolated, and by pressing ahead alone, we are placing our domestic industry at a disadvantage while giving others the opportunity to dominate global supply chains.\"She said the only \"winners in this economic self-harm are China\".The Conservative leader added that her government would still move towards a \"transition to cleaner transport\" but one driven by \"affordability, practicality and technological progress\" rather than \"unrealistic mandates that weaken domestic manufacturing and empower foreign competitors\".She said scrapping the mandate would give \"space\" to rebuild the UK's car industry.UK car firms were said to have been split over the 2030 deadline, with some calling for more support to be able to meet it.In its latest Budget, the government announced an extra £1.3 billion investment into the UK's Electric Car Grant scheme to encourage drivers to make the switch to EVs.Chancellor Rachel Reeves also announced that drivers of battery electric cars, which includes plug-in hybrids, will be charged 3p per mile for the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty from April 2028, with some arguing the move could make electric cars less appealing.The ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars was originally introduced in 2020 by then Prime Minister, Conservative Boris Johnson - Badenoch, a cabinet member at the time, opposed the plans.It was later pushed back to 2035 by Rishi Sunak, with Labour pledging to bring it forward in its 2024 election manifesto.A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said the government remained \"committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales\".They said: \"More drivers than ever are choosing electric\".The next UK general election must be held by 15 August 2029, but the prime minister can opt to call an election at any point before this.",

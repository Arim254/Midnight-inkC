    "body": "3 hours agoGettyA \"technical fault\" halted the National Lottery's Lotto draw on Saturday evening.It is understood that viewers watching the rollover saw the programme abruptly cut off after the bonus ball failed to drop on the draw machine. The operator Allwyn confirmed the draw had been paused \"due to the bonus ball not dropping\" and would resume as soon as possible with an alternative machine and \"under the supervision of an independent adjudicator\".The winning numbers were later drawn on Saturday evening. It is not yet clear what caused the earlier glitch.A spokesperson said earlier: \"We expect to complete tonight's Lotto draw and publish the verified results on national-lottery.co.uk later this evening and apologise for the delay.\"The stream for the draw on the National Lottery YouTube channel was unavailable on Saturday evening. The National Lottery operator changed for the first time in 30 years in 2024. Camelot had run the lottery from its base in Watford since the game's launch in 1994, but its licence ended in January last year. A 10-year licence was given to new operator Allwyn, which has continued to oversee the draw from the former Camelot offices.International operator Allwyn Entertainment is owned by Czech oil and gas tycoon Karel Komarek.

    "body": "6 days agoMegan BonarBBC ScotlandPA MediaThe US talk show host was invited to dinner by members of the Royal Regiment of ScotlandA kilt might not be the first thing on your list when you're a TV superstar packing for an autumnal holiday in Scotland.But that's exactly what American comedian and talk show host Jimmy Fallon was left scrambling for when he was unexpectedly invited to a black-tie dinner while on a trip to Aberdeenshire.Luckily, his hotel's night manager was on hand to give him a loan of his own kilt.The comedian was welcomed to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater by officers from the 5Scots regiment who served him Scotch eggs and Buckfast.Fallon rose to fame as a cast member on the comedy sketch series Saturday Night Live before becoming the host of a late-night talk show.PA MediaJimmy dined on Scotch eggs and Buckfast tonic wineSpeaking about his trip, in a video shared on TikTok, Fallon said he travelled to Scotland to take a trip on the Royal Scotsman when he had a chance encounter with some soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland.The comedian was visiting the River Dee near Balmoral Castle when some members of the King's royal guards, the 5Scots battalion, recognised him and invited him to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater for dinner.The invitation, along with its black-tie dress code, left him with a dilemma - where to get a suit or a kilt, at such short notice.He approached staff at the Fife Arms where he was staying who went the extra mile to help their guest.Fallon said: \"I called the night manager and I talked to him. I said 'I need to get a kilt tonight' and he goes 'I'll figure something out', so Muir gave me his own kilt.\"The manager pieced together a full ensemble of kilt, jacket, sporran, hose and brogues.Scotch egg and BuckfastThe SNL actor said his hosts were \"psyched\" he wore a kilt and he \"had the best dinner ever\".He dined on venison Scotch egg washed down with Buckfast tonic wine, which Fallon said had left him feeling a bit worse for wear.He left the evening with his very own kilt, fitted by the battalion's tailor and a Glengarry hat he proudly wore during the video.Major Thomas Blair, commanding officer of 5Scots, said: \"What started as a chance meeting near Balmoral turned into a brilliant evening.\"It's not every day you get to meet a Hollywood A-lister, and we were delighted to welcome him to Scotland - in true Scots style.\"Within 5Scots, Balaklava company has a number of ceremonial roles in Scotland and forms the royal guard at Balmoral.The infantry company welcomed the King to Balmoral when he arrived for his summer residence earlier this year.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoLiberal Democrats have signalled they intend to use their next Opposition Day debate to discuss \"officially removing\" Prince Andrew's Duke of York title and his \"continued use of Royal Lodge\", the Sunday Times reports. MPs will \"defy years of convention\" to discuss the royal's future, who the paper says faces a \"pincer movement from parliament and Buckingham Palace\" to formally strip him of his dukedom and banish him from the 30-room mansion in Windsor.An investigation into \"who trolled Virginia Giuffre\", the prominent accuser of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is the lead for the Observer. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is plotting a \"mansion tax raid on homes\", according to the Mail on Sunday. The paper reports she plans to impose a charge of 1% of the amount by which a property exceeds £2m, a \"class war plan\" which critics say would \"punish hard work and aspiration\". The chancellor's tax plans also lead the Independent, which reports that Reeves is \"under pressure\" to break a Labour manifesto pledge and tax the highest earners. It comes as the chancellor looks to plug a £40bn \"black hole\" in the Budget. The Sunday Telegraph reports that Labour plans to give workers a day-one right against unfair dismissal risks \"crippling the jobs market\", according to the government's \"favourite\" think-tank. The Resolution Foundation tells the paper that it will oppose plans that give \"little obvious gains to workers\". More than 90% of councils will house asylum seekers by the end of the year, leads the Sunday Express. Around 40,000 people will be given taxpayer-funded homes across England, the paper writes, \"as ministers ramp up efforts to close migrant hotels\". Comedian Ben Elton tells the Sunday Mirror that he \"saved the most celebrated brain in showbiz\" in 1992, after he took Stephen Fry to hospital following a \"cocaine binge\". At the time, doctors said Fry was \"minutes from death or brain damage\". Sunday People reports on the \"forest lair\" of Christian Brückner, the man investigated in connection to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Brückner has not been charged and denies any involvement in the case.\"Privates on parade\" is the splash for the Daily Star, which reports that the number of British troops accused of \"flashing\" has risen 300% in the past year.

    "body": "3 hours agoGabija GataveckaiteBBC News NI Dublin correspondentPA MediaCatherine Connolly arriving at Dublin Castle ahead of the official confirmation of her victoryIndependent left-wing politician Catherine Connolly has been elected Ireland's 10th president after a landslide victory over her rival Heather Humphreys.A seasoned politician and political performer, Connolly has been a TD (member of parliament) since 2016 for the Galway West constituency and also served as the Dail (Irish parliament) deputy speaker.Connolly had the support of Ireland's major left-wing opposition parties, including Sinn Féin, the Irish Labour Party and the Social Democrats.The campaign machineSeen very much as an anti-establishment candidate, in recent weeks the 68-year-old began insisting her campaign was a \"movement\".She had been eyeing the presidency for a number of years and was the first candidate to announce she would run back in July.To get on the ballot, a candidate must have the backing of 20 members of parliament or the backing of four city or county councils.She already had more than the required 20 parliamentarian signatures even without the backing of Ireland's main opposition party Sinn Féin, whose campaigning machine weighed in behind her around halfway through.She had only two competitors - Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys and Fianna Fail's Jim Gavin, candidates put forward by the two major parties in government.PA MediaCatherine Connolly's team ran a slick social media campaignMr Gavin withdrew from the campaign earlier this month, but remained on the ballot securing 7.2% of the total poll in the end.Connolly's composed debating style as well as a slick social media campaign garnered much praise and attention, particularly from younger voters.She had a viral moment with a social media video of her doing keepie uppies with a football and taking on young people on the basketball court. Her impressive athletic attributes were viewed hundreds of thousands of times online.Her main rival Humphreys failed to generate the same positive attention.Challenging momentsThe biggest points of scrutiny levelled at Connolly throughout the campaign focused on her views on foreign policy and the Israel/Hamas conflict.Connolly is an outspoken supporter of Palestine and frequently speaks about the \"genocide\" in Gaza and criticises \"atrocities\" committed by Israel.Ireland is viewed internationally as being one of the most pro-Palestinian countries in Europe and Irish government ministers are often criticised as being antisemetic by Israeli politicians.She sparked debate when she told BBC News NI during the campaign that Hamas was \"part of the fabric\" of Palestinian people.Connolly has also been a critic of Nato and Fine Gael have hit out at her during the campaign for not being critical enough of Russia.How will her presidency be different to Higgins?The head of state role in Ireland is mostly a ceremonial role and it is not executive. The president and the government are separate so they have no say in government policies.Current president Michael D Higgins has often privately irked Irish ministers during his 14-year tenure by what has been perceived as criticism of government policy. He has been outspoken on Ireland's housing crisis and is also supportive of Palestine.Connolly and Higgins have a history. Even though Connolly previously served as an Irish Labour councillor, she left the party after they did not add her as a running mate alongside Higgins on the Galway ticket.Sinn Féin leader and opposition leader Mary Lou McDonald told BBC NI she believed Connolly would make the role her own.\"Catherine brings her authentic self to this role and I am not convinced that you ever have an Uachtarain [Irish president] that is simply a heat and repeat of a previous Uachtarain,\" she said at Dublin Castle.Even though she is a Palestinian supporter and previously criticised the US and UK governments' roles in the conflict, Connolly told a TV debate last week she would not refuse to meet figures such as US President Donald Trump.\"If it's just a meet and greet, then I will meet and greet. If the discussion is genocide, then that's a completely different thing. But I doubt that will be the discussion with the president,\" she told the debate.What's her relationship with Northern Ireland?Connolly sought out to establish herself as a United Ireland candidate and said she would like to see it during her presidency, which runs for seven years.She travelled to Northern Ireland during her campaign and her support of a United Ireland is believed to be one of the reasons she received Sinn Féin backing.McDonald said Connolly appreciated \"the preparation\" for a United Ireland \"needs to happen now\" and that she would \"exercise that soft power\".\"This is an exciting time,\" she added.\"She's the right woman in the right place at the right time.\"What will her priorities be?During the campaign, Connolly vowed to return a part of her presidential salary - which comes in at around €350,000 (£305,000).Connolly said she would give back a \"substantial\" portion of the salary to projects.Speaking after her win at Dublin Castle she vowed to be an \"inclusive\" president for all stating the Irish people can \"shape a new Republic\".\"I will be a president who listens and reflects and who speaks when it's necessary,\" she said.\"I will be a voice for peace, a voice that builds on our policy of neutrality, a voice that articulates the existential threat posed by climate change, and a voice that recognises the tremendous work being done the length and breadth of the country.\"",

    "body": "An unnamed donor is giving $130m (£100m) to the Pentagon to help pay US troops during the government shutdown, sparking ethics concerns. US defence officials confirmed the gift, which President Donald Trump said will make up for shortfalls in paying the country's 1.32m service members, but declined to identify the donor. Trump has provided a few clues, though, saying on Saturday \"he's a big supporter of mine\" and a US citizen. The government shut down more than three weeks ago, after lawmakers failed to approve a funding deal. The Trump administration paid troops last week by shifting $8bn from military research, but it is unclear what will happen on the next payday at the end of the month.Now in it's 25th day, the shutdown is poised to become one of the longest in US history.\"The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters on Friday, adding that the money was allowed under the department's \"general gift acceptance authority.\"Trump had previewed the donation on Thursday, while also declining to identify the donor, saying, \"he doesn't really want the recognition\".Before leaving for Asia on Saturday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the donor is \"a great gentleman\", \"a patron\", a \"patriot\" and a \"wonderful man\" who \"doesn't want publicity\".\"He prefers that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from,\" Trump said. \"In the world of politics you want your name mentioned.\" \"He put up $130 million in order to make sure — that's a lot of money — in order to make sure that the military got paid, and he's a big supporter of mine,\" he continued.The funds amount to around $100 per servicemember. While the White House was able to reallocate defence funds to pay troops last week, it remains to be seen what will happen on the next payday for the military, on  31 October. Congress has been unable to pass a bill that would keep troops being paid during the shutdown.Most government workers have been furloughed, or in some cases, told to work without pay while the shutdown lasts. According to defence department rules, donations over $10,000 must be reviewed by ethics officials \"to determine whether the donor is involved in any claims, procurement actions, litigation, or other particular matters involving the Department that must be considered prior to gift acceptance.\"Donations from non-American citizens require additional scrutiny. While unusual, the Pentagon does sometimes accept gifts from donors, but they normally must be given to fund specific projects, such as a school, hospital, library, museum, or cemetery. Critics questioned why the US military would accept anonymous funds.  \"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" said Delaware Senator Chris Coons, the top Democrat on the Senate's defense appropriations subcommittee.",

This means Axel's take on using make up to create glamorous creatures and creepy monsters is perfect for this time of year.There’s something special about Halloween that allows people to let their guard down and fully express themselves, Axel says. \"Nobody really cares what you’re doing because everyone’s crazy and weird looking.”BBC Bitesize asked Axel to show us how to create three seriously spooky glow-ups.How to paint a frightening Frankenstein’s monster headImage gallerySkip image galleryImage source, Axel A D BrownImage caption, Step 1Start with a clean, moisturised face.

Axel says this really brings a look to life.Prosthetics for beginnersAdding prosthetics to a more basic makeup look can really up the fear-factor.  Axel suggests starting off with things that are very easy to buy.“ and cotton wool can go a long way.”They suggest applying a layer of the latex, adding some cotton wool which should stick to it but still be mouldable, then add colour with makeup: “You can make scars from that, gashes or boils. You can really do a lot.”From fake blood to fashionSince appearing on Glow Up, Axel has been busy on a variety of big projects including a gory horror film. As the lead makeup artist they designed a rig of tubes, hidden under prosthetic skin, so when characters were \"attacked\", fake blood could spurt out of their fake wounds.Axel has also been working on makeup for the catwalk show of fashion designer, Jean Louie Castillo. This also has the spook factor Axel says. \"He [Jean Louie] loves to have special effects makeup creating ghouls that walk the runway. It's very gothic, very edgy, and right up my street.”Whether you're welcoming trick or treaters on your street, or off out to a ghoulish party, BBC Bitesize hopes you find the perfect inspiration to get your spook on this Halloween.All episodes of Series 1 to 7 of Glow Up are available on BBC iPlayerThis article was published in October 2025",

    "body": "3 days agoHsin-Yi LoSouth EastBears 'enjoy life to the full' after major rescueTwo bears rescued from \"deplorable conditions\" in Armenia by an East Sussex charity have been making the most of their new lives in a bear sanctuary.Giant Siberian bear Max and Syrian bear Minnie were living in a bus depot for the entertainment of travellers until they were saved in 2018. The rescue operation was carried out by International Animal Rescue (IAR), based in Uckfield, and the Foundation for the Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets in Armenia.Alan Knight, IAR president, told the BBC it was \"heart-warming\" to see how healthy and playful Max and Minnie were \"after years of cruelty and neglect\". \"They are seizing a second chance to enjoy life to the full,\" he added.International Animal RescueMax had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before the rescue crew cut through the bars of the cage using an angle grinderThe IAR said it took a year to persuade the bears' captor to agree to their release. Mr Knight said the pair had been kept in a cage that had been welded shut for more than 10 years.\"Being kept in such a small cage and knee deep in excrement, we couldn't get into the cage to rescue them,\" he said.International Animal RescueKeepers say Minnie enjoys applesAs Max weighed 500kg (1,102 lb) he had to be moved in a horse trailer while Minnie was transported on a deep bed of straw in a transport crate.Mr Knight said Max had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before emergency services cut through the bars of the cage using angle grinders.\"The bears were kept in deplorable conditions and we were desperate to set them free,\" said Mr Knight.International Animal RescueKeepers say Max is \"playful\" and \"keeps everyone entertained\"The charity said Max and Minnie have learnt to forage for food hidden in their enclosure in the wildlife rescue centre in Urtsadzor, and are responding to natural bear instincts, including going into hibernation.It adds the bears are regularly treated with fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. The keepers say Max is the \"playful one\", enjoying tree-climbing, tossing logs and balls into the pool and \"keeping everyone entertained\". Meanwhile, Minnie leaves the hard work of shaking apples out of the wobble tree to Max, while waiting patiently to retrieve her share of the fallen fruit.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "The best time to turn on the heating – according to you2 hours agoEmer Moreau and Connie BowkerAbbi LilyAbbi, who makes personal finance content on social media, says she and her partner delay turning the heating on, to save moneyThere are few things British people love more than talking about the weather, and as winter approaches, this can often take the form of: \"Have you turned the heating on yet?\"You may get different answers depending on where in the country you are - the northern and western parts of the UK are generally colder and wetter than the east and south. But temperatures across the country are due to drop this weekend. And on Sunday the clocks go back, marking an official end to British Summer Time - and the return to darker evenings as winter draws in.So will you wait until a particular date to reach for the thermostat? Or until the temperature drops below a certain point?'We hold off for as long as possible'Abbi Lily, who makes personal finance content under the moniker abbitalksmoney, says she and her partner try to \"wait until the absolute last minute\" before turning the heating on, in order to save money.They're currently using blankets and jumpers to stay warm \"so we can hold off as long as possible\", but they don't have a hard and fast rule about when the heating goes on.When she spoke to the BBC earlier this week, Abbi said it was still quite mild where she lives near Bournemouth.\"I'm wearing shorts today!\" she said.The Energy Saving Trust recommends setting the thermostat to anywhere between 18C and 21C for most people.The World Health Organisation (WHO) also recommends 18C for \"healthy and well-dressed people\". For older people, children and people with illnesses or disabilities, the WHO recommends 20C.Some people might keep a closer eye on the outside temperature, instead of their thermostat. Simon King, the BBC's lead weather presenter, says 15C tends to be the magic number. \"If the temperature is regularly below this for a few days or more, that is when people tend to switch their heating on.\"Temperatures across the UK are expected to fall this weekend as colder air from the Arctic spreads in, he adds.Cold arctic air will affect all of the UK this weekendRather than monitoring the temperature too closely, Gemma Bird from Essex waits until a certain date to turn the heating on.\"Growing up, my mum would only let us turn on the heating on 1 November,\" says Gemma, who shares money-saving household tips on Instagram.\"I remember thinking I'd never be like that, but obviously with the cost of everything now, I say: 'Is it 1 November? No? Put an extra blanket on.'\" Indeed, for many households, the question of when the heating goes on is about money, not health or comfort.'Our Aga is like having a permanent fire in the house'Aimee Blakey lives with her husband Sean and their son in a detached 1980s house in Wiltshire. The couple both come from farming backgrounds, she says, where they were taught: \"If you're cold, you put a jumper on. If you're really cold, put a dressing gown on.\"Aimee had always wanted an Aga, but buying a new one was too expensive when they started renovating two years ago. They were able to get a second-hand one, which they're now \"obsessed with\".Aimee BlakeyAimee and Sean had a second-hand Aga installed in their home last yearAn Aga is an iron cooking range which absorbs heat and then releases it slowly, so the cooker stays warm even when it's not in use. Agas originally ran on slow-burning coal, but today's models are powered by gas, electricity or biofuel. They can be expensive to run but, for Aimee and Sean, it saves them money on heating costs.\"It's like having a fire permanently in the house,\" she says. They first used the Aga on 1 October, but haven't switched their oil boiler on yet.Aimee says she was worried about the cost of running the Aga when it was installed a year ago, but it's currently costing them less than the £100 a month they had budgeted for oil.\"Because it's oil we can fill it up at any time. We filled it up during the summer when it was cheaper.\"'In the US, we turn on the heating when it's cold. Over here, it's a hot topic!'American-born Olivia Carney lives in Greater Manchester with her British husband. She says she's amused by the \"unspoken competition of who can turn it on the latest\".\"In the US we kind of just turned it on whenever it was cold,\" Olivia, 33, says. But in the UK, \"it's a hot topic in the office\".\"There seems to be a clear divide of people waiting until the absolute last minute or people who are just like, 'Yeah, no, I'm not gonna be cold in my own house.'\"Olivia first turned the heating on in mid-October, with the thermostat set to 18C \"so when it warms up to that it turns off\".Olivia CarneyOlivia Carney finds the British obsession with the heating funnyCaitlin Robinson, who studies energy and infrastructure-based inequality at the University of Bristol, says bills are still much higher than they were before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leading to a spike in the cost of gas and electricity.Dr Robinson says it can be \"tricky to give advice\" on lowering energy bills because most people are \"sensible\" and \"savvy\" anyway, especially if they're on a low income.Her research indicates that it's not just low-income households that are making considerable cutbacks on their heating, as evidenced through the \"record levels of energy debt\" in Britain.People struggling to pay their bills can experience heavy stress, Dr Robinson says.Mental health can also suffer if people aren't having people around to the house because they can't heat it, leading them to become socially isolated. Privacy, too, can be in short supply if families are only heating one or two rooms in a house and people have little space to themselves.Gemma, who works from home, wears tights under her clothes and swears by her electric blanket. \"I can turn [the heating] on if I have to, but obviously there are loads of people who can't, which is awful.\" More on this story",

    "description": "US President Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertise",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring former President Ronald Reagan.In a post on social media on Saturday, Trump called the advert a \"fraud\" and lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship. \"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" he wrote.After Trump on Thursday withdrew from trade talks with Canada, the Ontario premier said he would take down the advert. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause his province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the US, telling reporters that he made the decision after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney \"so that trade talks can resume\". He also said it would still run over the weekend, including during games for the World Series, which features the Toronto Blue Jays against the Los Angeles Dodgers.Canada is the only G7 country that has not reached a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to charge steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.In his post, sent while he was traveling to Asia, Trump seemed to say he was adding 10 percentage points to those taxes.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.The advert, which was sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use it.In his post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said that the advert should have been pulled down earlier.\"Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,\" he wrote, while flying to Malaysia.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Both Trump and Carney will be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Malaysia, but Trump told reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One that he does not have any \"intention\" of meeting with his Canadian counterpart during the trip. In his post, Trump also accused Canada of attempting to manipulate an upcoming US Supreme Court case which could end his entire tariff regime. The case, to be heard by the highest US court next month, will determine whether the tariffs are constitutional. On Thursday, Trump posted that the advert was designed to \"interfere\" with \"THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE EVER\".Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, said in a statement to the BBC.The Reagan ad is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.In a video posted on Friday, Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"",

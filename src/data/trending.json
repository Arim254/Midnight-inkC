    "body": "Two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter have been killed in Syria in an ambush by an Islamic State gunman, the US Central Command has said.Officials said three other service members were injured in the attack, during which the gunman was \"engaged and killed\".US President Donald Trump wrote on social media that it was \"an ISIS attack\" against the US and Syria and said there would be \"a very serious retaliation\".The identities of those killed are being withheld for 24 hours until their next of kin have been informed, the US Central Command said.In a post on X, the US Central Command said the attack was \"the result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman\", while a Pentagon official said initial assessments showed the attack was \"likely\" to be carried out by the Islamic State group.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security force.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.The ambush occurred in Palmyra, located in the centre of the country, while the soldiers were \"conducting a key leader engagement\", according to Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell.A Pentagon official said: \"This attack took place in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"Trump added that the three injured US soldiers were \"doing well\". Syria's state news reported that two Syrian service personnel had also been injured.US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said: \"Let it be known, if you target Americans - anywhere in the world you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Syria recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.Last month, President Ahmed al-Sharaa met with Donald Trump at the White House in a visit that the Syrian leader said was part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.The global coalition is aimed at eliminating the remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, said: \"I strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist ambush targeting a joint US–Syrian government patrol in central Syria.\"We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.\"",

    "body": "The Metropolitan Police has said it will \"take no further action\" over claims Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked his police protection officer for information on accuser Virginia Giuffre.The allegations, first reported in the Mail on Sunday in October, said the then-prince gave the officer Ms Giuffre's date of birth and social security number, just before the paper published a photo of the pair meeting in February 2011.On Saturday, the Met said a further assessment \"has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct\".Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has not commented on the reports, but has consistently denied all allegations against him.A spokesperson for the police force said: \"The Met remains committed to thoroughly assessing any new information that could assist in this matter.\"To date, we have not received any additional evidence that would support reopening the investigation. In the absence of any further information, we will be taking no further action.\"As with any other matter, should new and relevant information be brought to our attention, including in any information resulting from the release of material in the US, we will assess it.\"Ms Giuffre took her own life earlier this year. In a statement on Saturday, her family said they were \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision to drop the investigation \"without explanation and without speaking to us\".They added: \"With the Epstein files about to be released by Congress since the passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, we are surprised that the Metropolitan Police didn't wait to see what further evidence might appear.\"While we have hailed the UK's overall handling of the case of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor previously, today we feel justice has not been served.\"Ms Giuffre said she was among the girls and young women sexually exploited by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy circle.She claimed she was forced to have sex with the then-Prince Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London, in 2001.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges related to Epstein, her former boyfriend - he died in a New York police cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.In her memoir, published posthumously, Ms Giuffre described her allegations against the former prince in detail.She alleged the third time she had sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was on Epstein's island, as part of what she called \"an orgy\".She also recalled seeing a picture of Epstein and the former prince together in New York in 2011, saying she was \"revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll\" but \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein\".In an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor said he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\", and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"He reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, formally ending a civil sex assault case against him in the US.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein. He has always denied allegations of wrongdoing related to Epstein.Earlier this year he was stripped of his title as prince following weeks of intense pressure over his links to the convicted sex offender. He had previously given up his other royal titles - including the Duke of York.He is also due to leave his mansion in Windsor, the Royal Lodge, by next October. It's expected he will move to Sandringham, in Norfolk, early next year.On Friday, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was one of a number of high-profile figures to feature in photographs released by Democrats, showcasing Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful.Epstein was associated with many well-known figures, and merely being named in files related to the disgraced financier is not an indication of wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned.A cropped section of a picture showing the former prince talking to Microsoft founder Bill Gates was included in the latest batch of photographs.It was a cropped version of an image taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, with the original version showing them in conversation with King Charles.",

They subsequently underwent further IVF treatment but on that occasion it failed.Despite the \"gut-wrenching grief\", the Saers did not give up, vowing they would try again as they were \"fighters\".They then welcomed daughters Ida,12, followed by Coral, nine.HandoutBecky and Ben Saer said they were \"absolutely thrilled\" with the podcast prizeHaving come a long way, they decided to launch their podcast, Becky and Ben's Fertility Spotlight, to share \"the ups and downs\" of their IVF journey to help other couples undergoing similar struggles. \"All we want to do is to be honest about our experiences, our struggles and how we managed them,\" Mr Saer said.

    "body": "8 hours agoTom McArthurandIlma HasanWatch: Anger and chaos in Salt Lake stadium, Kolkata as Messi leaves event earlyAngry fans attending Lionel Messi's tour of India ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch after his appearance at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium.Thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to catch a glimpse of the football star, but were left disappointed when he emerged to walk around the pitch, and was obscured by a large group of officials and celebrities.When the Argentina and Inter Miami forward was whisked away early by security after around 20 minutes, elements of the crowd turned hostile.West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.ReutersAs it became apparent Messi's appearance had ended, local media say the scene turned ugly Messi is in India for his 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour', a series of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi. His tour began with the unveiling of a 70ft (21m) statue of himself in Kolkata, which had been assembled over the course of 27 days by a 45-strong crew. Messi appeared virtually due to security concerns.Thousands of fans travelled to the city's stadium for a chance to see the footballer in person.They were chanting, buying jerseys and wearing \"I love Messi\" headbands.Messi initially walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended on Saturday, some frustrated fans stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, as others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.The 2022 World Cup winner - considered one of football's greatest ever players - had been expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium, the AFP news agency reports.\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi... Why did they call us then... We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face\", a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.One angry fan told the Press Trust of India news agency people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\"I paid Rs 5,000 for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians. \"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"Messi was accompanied on his brief visit by his Inter Miami teammate and Uruguay star Luis Suarez, and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul.Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan also met Messi earlier in the day, according to the Reuters news agency.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesMessi waving to fans as he arrivedThousands of fans had gathered for the eventKolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and has a large football fanbase in an otherwise cricket-crazed country.In the city, it is common to see hundreds of thousands of fans gather at stadiums at a derby of local clubs.The BBC has contacted Lionel Messi's representatives for comment.Announcing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the incident at the stadium.\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" the chief minister said on X.A police official told reporters that the event's \"chief organiser\" had been arrested, without giving any further details, AFP reports.Authorities will look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets, the official added.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the \"private event\".In the early hours of Saturday, thousands lined the roads and congregated outside the hotel where Messi was staying to try and catch a glimpse of him.Hitesh, a 24-year-old corporate lawyer, flew nearly 1,900 kilometres from the south Indian city of Bengaluru.\"For me it's personal. You can see I am quite short, and I love to play football with my friends,\" Hitesh told the BBC, standing in front of the statue.\"Messi is the player I related with the most, no one can match his talent. He gives me hope that with talent you can do anything.\"It is just a small part of India's homage to the former Barcelona and Paris St-Germain forward.Fans can also visit a \"Hola Messi\" fan zone with a life-sized replica Messi sitting on a throne, a hall adorned with some of his trophies, and a recreation of his Miami home complete with mannequins of the player and his family sat on a balcony.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoLaura KuenssbergPolitical editorEveryone should \"follow the rules\"  when guidance on single-sex spaces is released, the new head of the equality watchdog has told the BBC. Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), said \"things could be sorted out if there is goodwill and recognition that everybody has rights\", and that \"nobody is expecting there to be a toilet police\".The guidance, for businesses and services, was drawn up after a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in April that legally a woman should be defined by biological sex for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010.The BBC interview, to be broadcast on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, is Dr Stephenson's first in her new role.The EHRC's guidance was passed to the government three months ago, but it has yet to publish it formally, which would give the code of practice legal force.It aims to provide advice to businesses and services - such as women's refuges, gyms, hospitals or shopping centres - about how the Supreme Court ruling should work.Seen by the BBC after it was leaked, the 300-page document says single-sex spaces should only be open to people of the same biological sex, otherwise they cease to be single-sex areas. That would mean, for instance, that a trans woman – a biological male who identifies as a woman - would not be able to use women's toilets and changing rooms.The guidance says it may be legitimate for businesses or services to ask people to provide confirmation they are of the eligible sex \"by proportionate means\".This has all caused controversy and anger among some transgender campaigners.Dr Stephenson told the BBC: \"Nobody is expecting there to be a toilet police. \"But equally if there are situations where there are complaints about regular problems, then people might need to... improve signage, improve explanations, or make sure they have got alternative provision.\"She said she expected both service providers and people using these services to \"follow the rules\". Dr Stephenson was challenged on what facilities trans people should use if there were no alternatives, or what businesses should do if they did not have the space or resources to make extra provision.She said: \"There's often unisex provision and where there isn't, as I say, we need to think more broadly about how we make sure those that those facilities are available…\"If you've got, you know, two self-contained cubicles, one of which is labelled men and one of which is labelled women, then the most sensible thing in those circumstances for a service provider to do is to make both of those unisex.\"Dr Stephenson was appointed to the role in July and she started earlier this month. It was greeted with hostility by some trans campaigners, in part because she had donated money to the case of lawyer Allison Bailey, who won part of a tribunal claim that she was discriminated against because of her gender-critical views.In our interview, Dr Stephenson was adamant she could still be objective when considering trans issues. She said she donated to the case because she was frustrated by situations where \"women were being harassed and losing their jobs on the basis of lawfully held beliefs\". She said she had been concerned by the experiences of some women \"when trying to have meetings to discuss proposed changes in the law\".\"I thought it was important that actually in a democracy, if there is a proposed change to the law, people should be able to meet and discuss those changes without violence or intimidation,\" she said.  \"If that's taking a side, it's taking a side on the side of kind of democratic norms and open discussion and dialogue.\"The full interview will be on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.

    "body": "Migrants have been pictured arriving in Dover on Saturday after the longest period without any small boat crossings in seven years.Photos appeared to show dozens of migrants wearing life jackets being brought in to Dover, Kent, aboard a Border Force vessel.Before the weekend, no migrants had made the journey for four weeks, according to Home Office figures. The last recorded arrivals before Saturday were on 14 November, marking the longest uninterrupted stretch since 2018. December is typically a quieter month for crossings due to adverse weather conditions, and this is thought to have contributed to the lull.Home Office figures on the number of migrants that arrived in the UK on small boats on Saturday will be published on Sunday.So far this year, 39,292 people have made the Channel crossing, the highest figure for any year other than 2022 when there were 45,774 arrivals.More than 187,000 people have arrived in small boats since figures were first recorded in 2018.The UK government has ramped up efforts to tackle small boat crossings in recent months, but the measures are not expected to have an immediate impact.At the Labour Party conference, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would \"smash\" people smuggling gangs and cut the number of crossings by 2029.Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy met with ministers from other European nations last week to discuss reforms to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to make it easier to deport illegal migrants.In November, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced asylum changes including making refugee status in the UK temporary and subject to review every 30 months, and sending refugees home if their country is deemed safe.A \"one in, one out\" pilot agreed between the UK and France began in August. Under the scheme, for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in Britain comes the other way.As of 27 November 2025, 153 people had been returned through this arrangement.",

    "body": "The British Medical Association (BMA) has warned against public \"scaremongering\" over the current flu outbreak as its members vote on whether to carry out planned strikes in England next week.It comes after Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he was \"extremely worried\" about the \"double whammy\" of rising numbers of flu patients in hospitals and forthcoming resident doctor strikes.BMA resident doctors committee chair Dr Jack Fletcher said that while the union was not \"diminishing\" the impact of flu, Streeting \"should not be scaremongering the public into thinking that the NHS will not be able to look after them.\"The result of a BMA ballot is due on Monday. If it is rejected, a five-day strike will begin on Wednesday.The government says a deal offers legislation that prioritises British medical graduates for speciality training jobs starting next year and offers to cover the costs of training expenses such as exam fees.The deal does not include a pay rise. Writing in the Guardian, Sir Keir Starmer said pay for resident doctors - the new name for junior doctors - has increased by 28.9% over the past three years.In a statement released on Saturday morning, the BMA called on the health secretary to \"focus his time and attention on offering a deal that will stop next week's strikes going ahead, rather than making claims that strike action could cause the NHS to collapse.\"The BMA has written to chief executives of NHS Trusts in England saying it recognised that, in the event of a strike, resident doctors may be required to return to work to \"maintain safe patient care\".The letter, signed by BMA council chair Dr Tom Dolphin, says: \"As doctors, we at the BMA wish to ensure that patients remain safe\".A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the secretary of state had \"listened to resident doctors' concerns and worked constructively to put forward an improved offer on the table\".Speaking to LBC earlier this week, Streeting said the current situation was \"probably the worst pressure the NHS has faced since Covid\".He questioned why the BMA hadn't taken up his offer of pushing the strike back to January \"if they wanted to just give me a kicking\".\"I can only assume that the reason why they refuse to do that is because they know that this week will be most painful for the NHS,\" he added.Echoing the health secretary, the prime minister said the \"reckless\" strikes \"should not happen\" while the NHS is facing its \"most precarious moment since the pandemic\".Sir Keir wrote in the Guardian on Friday that the BMA had been sent a new offer as well as a chance to reschedule the strikes until after Christmas.\"Don't get me wrong – of course I would rather they were cancelled... But under the circumstances, I wanted to be sure we have left no stone unturned in our efforts to protect the NHS,\" he said.The BMA said it will ask its members whether the government's offer will be enough to call off Wednesday's strikes.If members indicate yes, then they will be given time to consider the offer in more detail and a formal follow-up referendum would be held on ending the dispute completely.Some experts say flu has come early this winter, and it looks to be a particularly nasty season because of a new mutated version of the virus which is circulating.Many are calling it \"super flu\", but it is not more severe nor harder to treat.An average of 2,660 patients per day were in hospital with flu in England last week – the highest for this time of the year since records began in 2021, and up 55% on the week before, NHS England said.It is important to note that the records only date back to 2021 and so do not capture the two worst flu seasons of the past 15 years, which were seen in 2014-15 and 2017-18.Flu cases are also rising in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, figures show.However, the medical director for the NHS in London, Chris Streather, said the flu situation was \"well within the boundaries\" of what the NHS could cope with and that hospitals were better prepared for large disease outbreaks since the Covid pandemic.Speculation is probably not helpful and can cause people to worry, he added.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJames Cook,JerusalemandRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, IstanbulIsrael said it killed a senior Hamas commander on Saturday in a strike on a vehicle inside Gaza.In a joint statement, the Israeli military and security agency Shin Bet announced it had \"eliminated\" Raed Saad, the head of weapons production for Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in Gaza city.Saad had been regarded as one of the most prominent Qassam commanders and led several brigades during Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israeli communities east of Gaza City. The Hamas-run Civil Defence spokesman, Mahmoud Basal, told the BBC that four people were killed in the strike. He said multiple passers-by were also injured by the blast.A local Hamas official in Gaza told the BBC that the strike also killed Saad's aide and another lower-ranking official identified as Abu Imad al-Laban.The BBC is prevented by Israel from reporting independently from inside Gaza and is unable to verify details of the incident. The IDF and ISA joint statement added that Saad had been \"responsible for the deaths of many soldiers\" killed in the Gaza Strip as the result of explosive devices.Saad is believed to be a member of the newly formed five-member leadership military council established since a ceasefire took hold in October. Israel has attempted to kill him on multiple occasions.One of the most notable attempts was during a surprise Israeli operation in Gaza City in March 2024, when Israeli forces reportedly sought to arrest or kill him. Sources at the time said Saad had been inside the targeted complex but managed to escape moments before the raid.He has long been considered one of Israel's most wanted Hamas figures, with Israeli attempts to kill him spanning more than two decades.Saturday's attack happened on the Palestinian-controlled side of the so-called Yellow Line which has divided Gaza since an unstable US-led ceasefire came into effect on 10 October.Israeli forces control the area to the east of the line, which includes just over half of the Gaza Strip.The first phase of US president Donald Trump's 20-point plan for peace in the region required the return of all 20 living and 28 dead hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.About 1,200 people were killed in the attack and more than 250 people were taken hostage.All have been returned except for the remains of an Israeli police officer, Ran Gvili, 24, who is believed to have been killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action.The diplomatic focus is now shifting to the next stage of President Trump's plan which would require the disarmament of Hamas as part of what it calls the de-radicalisation and redevelopment of Gaza.It envisages Gaza being run by the \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee,\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Trump.Security would be provided by an International Stabilisation Force although its make up remains unclear.The eventual aim is for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take control of the territory, and for Israeli forces to withdraw, after which \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\". Many aspects of the plan are controversial in Israel where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state.Trump is due to meet Netanyahu to discuss the plan in the US on 29 December.",

    "body": "An eyebrow tip and McDonald's footage: Takeaways from Luigi Mangione's evidence hearing 19 hours agoMadeline HalpertGetty ImagesMr Mangione has watched as the court plays body camera footage from the day of his arrestLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a case that sparked national attention, watched as new testimony and never-before-seen footage from the day of his arrest in a McDonald's was unveiled during a hearing this week.Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges related to the 2024 murder of Mr Thompson, a father of two, as well as federal counts that carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing is focused on the defence's attempts to keep certain evidence out of the trial, which has not been scheduled yet, including items found in his backpack during his arrest and statements he made to officers.During the first two weeks of the hearing, supporters of Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family and Ivy League graduate - filled the back rows of the Manhattan criminal courtroom, some wearing a pin portraying him as a saint-like figure.Prosecutors and Mr Mangione's legal team are expected to question over a dozen witnesses from the day of his arrest, including the employees who spotted him and the police who arrested him.Here is a look at some of the key pieces of evidence discussed that offer a window into Mr Mangione's trial.An eyebrow giveawayThe pre-trial hearing has centred on the small-town McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where officers were shocked to find the high-profile suspect days after Mr Thompson was fatally shot - and hours from the busy Midtown Manhattan crime scene.Witnesses suggested the arrest may never have occurred there if not for one of  Mr Mangione's key features: his eyebrows.During the first day of the hearing, prosecutors played a call to police from a McDonald's employee about a tip from a customer in the restaurant.The employee said the customer thought a patron looked like the suspect in the United Healthcare CEO shooting. The patron was well covered, wearing a black hoodie, a medical mask and a tan beanie. But one key detail stuck out.\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".New York County District Attorney's OfficeProsecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"'Preposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald'sDozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.A fake name leads to an arrestWatch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald'sIn the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.Bullets, a journal and cash: a peek into Mr Mangione's backpackThe pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.New York County District Attorney's OfficeEvidence found during Mr Mangione's arrestVideo played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.The hearing is expected to continue into next week.",

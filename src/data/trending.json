There are around 32,000 asylum seekers currently being housed in hotels. Adam and Chris discuss whether this will help with government’s pledge to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.\nAnd, there are fears of mass killings as Sudan’s civil war appears to have reached a significant turning point. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 14 million have fled their homes. Adam is joined by chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet and Kholood Khair a Sudanese political analyst and director of Khartoum think tank Confluence Advisory.\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

Will Kamala Harris (and Donald Trump) run for president again?AmericastAvailable for over a yearIt’s just over a year since the 2024 presidential election but attention is already turning to 2028 with both candidates from last year’s race expressing a desire to run again. Kamala Harris told the BBC over the weekend that she “wasn’t done” with public service, while Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he’d “love” to stand again for a third term. We answer your questions on whether Donald Trump plans to override the constitution for a third term in office, and whether he’d have support of the American public.\nMeanwhile, the president is back in construction, this time building a new ballroom at the White House, which has involved demolishing the 103-year-old East Wing in the process. We answer your questions on whether Trump is allowed to demolish parts of the White House and who’s actually paying for the changes. \nAnd, after Kamala Harris’s interview with the BBC, Justin and Anthony take a bit of time off air to chat through some of the issues she spoke about with Laura Kuenssberg and the circumstances surrounding Joe Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the election. \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "1 hour agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesTiphaine Auzière is one of Brigitte Macron's three childrenBrigitte Macron's daughter has told a court in Paris that sexist cyber-bullying negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.Tiphaine Auzière, 41, is the step-daughter of French President Emmanuel Macron. She took the stand on the second and final day of the trial of 10 people accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims over Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality.Mrs Macron, 72, has long been the target of conspiracy theories which allege she is a transgender woman.\"It is important to be here today to express the harm my mother has faced. I wanted to give an account of what her life has been like since the moment she started being targeted by these attacks,\" Ms Auzière said. She added she had noticed a change and a \"deterioration\" in her mother's health since claims around her gender and sexuality began swirling. Mrs Macron \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... She knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories,\" Ms Auzière said. She said that not a day went by that the claims were not somehow reported to her mother - \"even by someone who means well and feels for her\". While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Ms Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.\"She hasn't been elected, she hasn't asked anything of anyone, and she comes under attack.\"Prosecutors are seeking suspended prison terms of three months to 12 months for the accused, and fines of up to €8,000 ($9,300). Getty ImagesBrigitte and Emmanuel Macron married in 2007, when he was 29 and she was 54Among the defendants - all aged 41 to 65 - are an elected official, a gallery owner and a teacher.One - a man named Aurélien Poirson-Atlan - is accused of telling his 200,000 online followers that Mrs Macron is a transgender woman and that the 24-year age gap between her and Emmanuel Macron amounts to \"state-sanctioned paedophilia\".Mr Poirson-Atlan told the court on Tuesday that he was a \"satirist\" who had just wished to put forward \"a point of view different to that of the mainstream media\". Two other defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were already found guilty of slander last year for claiming that France's first lady had never existed, and that her brother had changed gender and started using her name. They were later acquitted by a court of appeals.Other defendants also said they had employed their \"freedom of expression\". One requested the Macrons publish photos of Brigitte Macron pregnant to prove she is a biological woman. The Macrons have already said they will present such evidence in court proceedings against US right-wing influencer Candace Owens. Owens has repeatedly promoted her view that Brigitte Macron is a man and in March 2024, she claimed she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on the allegation.Earlier this year the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, told the BBC the couple would present photographic and scientific evidence to a US court to prove Mrs Macron is a woman.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.Mrs Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple ended up marrying in 2007, when Mr Macron was 29 and Mrs Macron was 54.",

    "body": "20 hours agoJames BartlettGetty ImagesEver since her death in 1986, it was taken as common knowledge that Elsa Lanchester - who became a horror movie icon by playing the title character in the Bride of Frankenstein - had been cremated and her ashes sprinkled in the ocean.But then Scott Michaels, the founder of Dearly Departed Tours, discovered that her cremated remains were interred in a rose garden under her married name, Elsa Lanchester Laughton.\"For almost 40 years no one had made the connection – until now,\" he says.Mr Michaels, 63, is a historian who specialises in the dark side of Hollywood. A go-to for programmes about dead Hollywood celebrities and murder, he has consulted for Quentin Tarantino's Manson murder film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Mr Michaels' museum of memorabilia and oddities was also a local must-see, before it closed during the pandemic, for its eclectic collection, which included the Buick Electra that Jayne Mansfield died in in 1967.Deeply passionate about unsung Hollywood, he has also made it a habit to organise fundraisers and events for marginalised, forgotten or cult actors, like Schlitzie (\"Pinhead\" in Freaks) and Ken Weatherwax (\"Pugsley\" from the television Addams Family).It was this interest that led Mr Michaels to delve further into what happened to the remains of Lanchester.Getty ImagesThe 1935 film turned Lanchester into a Universal Horror starBorn on October 28, 1902 in Lewisham, London, Lanchester was a child actor in theatre and cabaret, and even made records of Victorian songs and ballads.At 25 she met and married fellow actor Charles Laughton, and starred alongside him as Anne of Cleves in 1933's The Private Life of Henry VIII, for which Laughton won the Best Actor Oscar.He played the title role in The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1939, and the couple worked on twelve films together, most notably Witness for the Prosecution in 1957, for which they were both Oscar-nominated.Lanchester had been nominated before, in 1949's Come to the Stable, and after Laughton's death she continued to work steadily, including on a number of Disney films including Mary Poppins and That Darn Cat!.Actor Bruce Davison played Willard alongside Lanchester as his controlling mother Henrietta. He speaks fondly of that time, and especially of her sense of humour.\"She told me: 'You know when a director is giving you a load of codswallop? What you do is say 'Oooh, that's very interesting, let me do that.' And then just do whatever the hell you want!\" he laughs.Davison also recalled something that would tantalise horror fans today.\"I used to take a Super 8 camera to set, and one time I filmed her at the top of the stairs when she did The Bride for me, staring down and giving me that sneer! She was glad for the Bride role,\" he added, \"she understood what it had done for her.\"Getty ImagesLanchester's iconic look as the Bride has become a beloved Halloween costume and an instantly recognisable lookAlthough the Bride of Frankenstein – in which Lanchester's own long hair stretched up over a wire beehive contraption to startling effect - did indeed earn her a place in film history, the issue of what exactly happened to her remains after her death was less well recorded.In her autobiography, Lanchester wrote that she did not like the location of her husband's burial plot in Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills cemetery – Laughton died in 1962. She wrote she would prefer to be cremated with no funeral service, which is partly why everyone assumed for decades she had her ashes scattered.An interest in death began early for Mr Michaels, who was born and grew up in Detroit. He recalls seeing the tented graveside set-up at a family funeral and asking his mom \"are we going to the circus?\" He was three years old.More than that, the family home was on one of the most dangerous intersections in the city. A young Mr Michaels heard – and saw – so many car accidents that it almost became business as usual, and the springboard for an unusual career celebrating those who have died, he says.When he learned of Lanchester's interment, during the course of his regular research into historic death certificates, he decided she would be his next memorial project.Her seven-minute, dialogue-free appearance alongside Boris Karloff as the Bride was legendary – she deserved to have her legacy remembered.She was, after all, basically the only female star of the Universal Horror cast, he says.\"Many people also forget that she played Mary Shelley, who tells her frightening tale of man trying to play God to poets Shelley and Byron, at the beginning of the film,\" Mr Michaels says.Interest in Lanchester had been sparked earlier in the year when Universal Studios released merchandise and special editions of Bride of Frankenstein to celebrate the film's 90th anniversary. In July, a blue plaque was unveiled at Lanchester's childhood home in Battersea, London, that also noted her mother Edith, who was a socialist, feminist, and suffragette.It was a surprise when Mr Michaels discovered that Lanchester's agent, Herschel Green, had interred her at Valhalla Memorial Park, in North Hollywood - and that her ashes had not been scattered as had been widely believed.\"Maybe she didn't really care much about what happened after she was gone,\" he suggests.In less than 36 hours, Mr Michaels had crowdfunded enough for a formal wall marker to recognise this horror legend. The unveiling ceremony will be held on 28 October – her birthday.\"I wanted to celebrate on her 123rd birthday,\" Michaels says, \"and honestly I forgot that it was just a few days before Halloween.\"James Bartlett is a culture/travel journalist and true crime author living in Los Angeles'The paradox of horror': How scary films can soothe your anxiety",

    "body": "A plane crash near Kenya's coast has killed 10 European tourists and a local pilot, officials have said. The aircraft was flying from the popular beach resort of Diani to an airstrip in the world-famous Maasai Mara game park when it went down at 05:30 local time (02:30 GMT), the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) said. Mombasa Air Safari said the plane was carrying eight Hungarians, two Germans and a Kenyan pilot, all of whom had been killed in the crash. \"Our primary focus right now is on providing all possible support to the families affected,\" it added in a statement.Local media have published images of the plane in flames, with debris scattered at the site of the crash.Kwale County Commissioner Stephen Orinde told the BBC that the plane crashed about 10km (six miles) from Kwale town after flying out of Diani.It was on its way to Kichwa Tembo, an airstrip in Maasai Mara, popular with holidaymakers because of its wildlife. \"The passengers were all tourists,\" Orinde said.He said that investigations into the cause of the crash were ongoing but suggested it could have been due to bad weather.\"The weather is not very good here at the moment. Since early in the morning, it is raining and it is very misty, but we cannot preempt [the findings],\" Orinde said.In August, a light aircraft belonging to the medical charity Amref crashed on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi, killing six people and injuring two others.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentGetty ImagesNearly half a million under-16s in England use taxis, buses and other transport funded by their local authorities to get to school, according to government estimates.The new data comes amid warnings from councils about the growing cost of providing transport for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). A head teachers' union said the transport played a \"crucial\" role in getting many children to school, but councils were having to make cutbacks.The data suggests that 6% of all pupils in England receive funded transport, and that 40% of those pupils aged under 16 (180,000) have Send.Local authorities spent £1.5bn on transport for under-16s with Send in the 2023-24 financial year, about two-and-a-half times what it was in 2015-16.The new data from the Department for Education (DfE) - which is the first of its kind - is based on voluntary submissions from three quarters of local authorities in February and March.It suggests that, across England:470,000 pupils under the age of 16 (6% of the total) use home to school transport 50,000 pupils over 16 also use funded transport9% of under-16s who receive funded transport because of Send travel alone in single-occupancy vehiclesLocal authorities in England are required by law to arrange funded transport for children who live a certain distance from school, who cannot walk because of Send or mobility problems, or who cannot walk due to safety reasons.  The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said the pressure had ramped up over the past three years. \"Continuing to fulfil the current statutory responsibilities for home to school transport is becoming increasingly financially unsustainable, posing a real threat of bankruptcy for some, and necessitating cuts to other vital aspects of children's services provision in many more,\" it said in a report this summer.'Equality of opportunity is really important'Mum Ailith says she may need to drive two hours each way to get her daughter Talia to school after she turns 16Ailith Harley-Roberts, a Send parent and campaigner, is concerned that her 15-year-old daughter Talia's travel funding to and from school will stop at 16.This will be a \"massive issue\" for the family's income, Ailith says, if she and her husband have to drive several hours a day to drop Talia off instead.Their council, Leeds City Council, announced earlier this year that Send students aged over 16 will no longer be provided with council-funded school transport in order to save the local authority £800,000. The council has said it was a \"decision no one wanted to make\", but the service was not sustainable in its current form.Ailith is campaigning against the changes.\"I want her to be in a place of education, which is her right, that best meets her needs,\" she says. \"I don't want to put her somewhere that 'will do', just because of the issues with transport.\"Many children with Send need specialist provision, and cannot go to a local mainstream school, she says.\"I think it's really important to remember that people have a right to their education,\" Ailith says.\"That equality of opportunity is still really important.\"Rob Williams, senior policy advisor at school leaders' union the NAHT, said funded transport \"plays a crucial role\" in helping many children \"attend school regularly and develop their independence\".\"However, a growing number of councils are reducing transport provision due to increasing budgetary pressures, and when children simply cannot get to school this threatens to deepen existing attainment gaps and place even more pressure on already stretched parents,\" he added.Ministers have faced calls not to cut education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children and young people with Send.Last month, the education committee recommended that the government keep them.The National Audit Office has previously said the Send system in England is \"broken\", not financially sustainable and failing to deliver better outcomes for children and young people.Cllr Bill Revans, Send spokesperson for the County Councils Network, said the current system \"does not work for young people, families and councils alike\".The DfE announced last week that it was delaying reforms to the Send system and other policy proposals for schools in England until next year.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there would be a \"further period of co-creation, testing our proposals with the people who matter most in this reform\".Cllr Revans said that delay was \"massively disappointing\", but that it was vital the government used the time to \"set out genuine root and branch reform to the system\".School Standards Minister Georgia Gould said the schools white paper would \"ensure more children can have their needs met in their local school\".She said work had already begun to improve the system, and added: \"My message to families is that it won't stop here. We're absolutely determined to deliver a better system that supports your children at every stage.\"Over the next few months, I'll be meeting with more parents across the country to make sure your experiences are at the very heart of our reforms.\"Additional reporting by Wesley Stephenson and Hayley Clarke.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura Gozzi,London and Abdujalil Abdurasulov,WarsawRussian troops are making a concerted push in eastern Ukraine and have gained a foothold in the strategic hub of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says. Moscow's soldiers outnumber Kyiv's 8-1 in the area and Ukraine cannot match that, Zelensky added while insisting Russia had not yet \"achieved the planned result\". Russia has been trying to capture Pokrovsk for two years. The key supply and transport hub provides supplies and reinforcements to the eastern front - and it would get Moscow closer to occupying the entirety of the Donetsk region. It would also put towns of the heavily fortified \"fortress belt\" - Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - within easier reach of Moscow. Zelensky said drone imagery showed that around 200 Russian soldiers were inside Pokrovsk. Describing the situation as \"difficult\", he said earlier that there was widespread fierce fighting and \"sabotage groups\" had entered the town. However, he rejected reports by Russia's Chief of General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, that Ukrainian troops had been completely surrounded. In an update on Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had encircled Ukrainian troops around the main railway station and cleared the city's Troyanda district of Ukrainian forces.One soldier from Ukraine's 155th Brigade, Artem Pribylnov, rejected the notion that Ukrainian troops had been encircled in a \"cauldron\" at Pokrovsk.\"But the war has changed and it's very technological now,\" he said. In previous assaults there had been a path out of the cauldron that troops could drive in and out of, he said, but now drones controlled access points, which made it \"extremely dangerous\".\"Perhaps that's why Russians claim they've encircled Pokrovsk even if there is no physical encirclement of the city?\" he suggested.According to Capt Hryhoriy Shapoval, spokesperson of Ukraine's East operational group, 79 attacks had been repelled near Pokrovsk since Monday - almost a third of the total 218 assaults recorded across the entire front line.He said that Russian troops had concentrated a large number of troops and equipment near Pokrovsk and that they were using armoured vehicles to cover their infantry. \"So it's hard to stop them,\" he said.He added that Kyiv's troops normally used drones to counter the Russians' advance but foggy and rainy weather conditions had made it harder to detect and destroy infantry troops.The situation in and around Pokrovsk exemplifies the high cost of shifting the front line forward, even just by a few metres. Last week, Ukrainian media reported that Russian forces were engaging in street battles and targeting Ukrainian positions, including drone operators.Away from the towns, drone technology means both Russian and Ukrainian forces are able to pound one another deep on either side of the front line.Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 is almost into its fifth year. Moscow's troops currently occupy about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Kyiv's defence capabilities are shrinking and Zelensky has said Ukraine needs  financial support from its European allies to continue fighting Russian forces for another two or three years. European leaders have so far failed to divert €140bn worth of Russian frozen assets to Ukraine - a move which would require complex legal machinations and which was blocked by Belgium at an EU summit last week. The proposal will be revisited in December.Zelensky said he had told his European counterparts that while Ukraine was \"not going to fight for decades... you must show that for some time you will be able to provide stable financial support to Ukraine\".The Ukrainian president also said he hoped a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday would result in a decision by China to cut its support for Russia. Last week Trump slapped Lukoil and Rosneft - two major Russian oil companies - with sanctions, and urged Turkey and China to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.\"I think this may be one of [Trump's] strong moves, especially if, following this decisive sanctions step, China is ready to reduce imports\" from Russia, Zelensky told journalists earlier this week.",

    "body": "18 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesWhen you see the 5G symbol at the top of your phone, you probably assume you're getting faster internet speeds - the kind promised when it first arrived five years ago.Mobile networks told us that 5G would provide us with faster downloads, smoother streaming and instant connectivity.It has received lots of investment from mobile operators and the government but has faced several setbacks, particularly as 5G requires a lot of masts because it delivers faster speeds over shorter distances.New research suggests that the 5G symbol you see on your screen might not match what you're actually getting in terms of internet speed.Tests carried out by research group PolicyTracker, and shared with BBC's Morning Live, found that nearly 40% of the time a phone displays the 5G symbol, it is actually using a 4G connection.That means you could be paying for, and seeing, 5G while your phone quietly sticks to slower speeds.The peak theoretical download speed for 5G is up to 20,000 megabits per second which is fast enough to download 18 HD films in under a minute, but for many of us our speed is far lower than that.The research comes as some mobile networks begin rolling out \"standalone 5G\" - a new service that, they say, promises true 5G speeds all the time. In order to benefit from this you will need to purchase a specific phone plan which often comes with a higher price tag.What should I do if I'm not getting 5G?If you have a contract that includes 5G, but you don't think you're getting a regular and reliable 5G signal you should: Check your speed: Use an online speed test to see your real download and upload rates Check your coverage: Ofcom's mobile coverage checker shows which network offers the best 4G or 5G signal in your area. Once you enter a postcode, you'll see whether a 4G/5G signal is available locally and whether the signal is good or variable. It can also show you which provider has the best coverage for the area. Contact your provider: If you're not happy with the coverage and signal strength of your current provider it's worth contacting them to explain the problem and see what advice they can provide you with.Change provider: If you're not locked into a contract it can be simple to swap to another provider that offers better coverage.'Not worth it'PolicyTracker conducted 11,000 tests across central London, the outskirts of Birmingham and a village in North Lincolnshire, using four different phones connected to four different network providers.It found that while phones often display the 5G logo, the data being transmitted is still carried by older 4G infrastructure.The difference isn't always obvious to users, but it can mean slower downloads and buffering in places where they expect the ultra-fast network.The issue comes down to how mobile networks currently define 5G.Martin Sims from PolicyTracker explains that the symbol on your phone shows the \"presence\" of a 5G signal in the area, but doesn't guarantee that your phone is connected to it.He says that even with the \"standalone 5G\" service, your phone can still drop down to 4G if a faster connection is not available. He says that for most people, \"standalone 5G isn't worth it as it's not very good value for money because the contracts are expensive\". He adds that the coverage is still patchy, even in big cities like London although he does say this new service means \"you're more likely to get better service in busy areas like train stations\". Consumer expert, Jasper Griegson from the complaints service Resolver told the BBC that customers are entitled to clarity.You think you're getting one thing but you're not and accuracy is key,\" he said. \"The consumer rights act has very strict rules about how accurate things have to be in other contexts, so why does that differ here?\"In response, Mobile UK, the trade body representing Britain's major mobile operators, confirmed that the 5G icon doesn't necessarily mean a live 5G connection.It said the symbol indicates a user is in a 5G-enabled area, and that networks \"dynamically and seamlessly steer customers to the best connection, whether 4G or 5G, based on real-time factors like signal strength\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoJessica Rawnsley and Gabriela PomeroyGetty ImagesHurricane Melissa, the world's strongest storm of the year, has made landfall in south-western Jamaica.Ahead of its arrival, the BBC spoke to locals and tourists who described frantic preparations, empty shops from stockpiling and the general sense of fear on the Caribbean island.\"The doors are being blown off by the wind,\" Kabien, a mother of three, said.\"I am trying to use my own manpower to stop the wind blowing in the door,\" she added with evident panic in her voice.Kabien, who runs a beauty salon in Santa Cruz - where residents were warned to take shelter - said she couldn't make it to one in time as it was too far away and \"it is now too dangerous to leave the house\". Follow live: Hurricane Melissa hits Jamaica with violent winds as authorities warn of 'catastrophic' floodingWhy Hurricane Melissa is so dangerous\"There is water coming through the roof of the house,\" she said. \"I am not okay.\" Her three young children are \"very, very scared\", she added. Damion, a computer scientist living in Kingston, told the BBC he had woken on Tuesday to winds \"so strong you would not be able to stand up\" outside.At his mother's home, an hour away in Manchester Parish, \"the winds have been so strong part of the roof has lifted off\", he said.Simon Johnson, 33, who lives in Harbour View in Kingston with his wife and two sisters, said the family had experienced hurricanes before - \"but not one of this size\".Living just 200m (200yds) from the harbour, he told the BBC he was \"feeling anxious\".\"We have put plywood on the front of the house to protect against rain and wind,\" he said. \"We have sandbags around the doors and we have tied down the shutters to protect the windows.\"They have stockpiled a week's worth of food, he added, but many of the supermarkets are empty and he could not find any bread in the neighbourhood.'Catastrophic and life-threatening'For days, people in Jamaica have waited and prepared as Hurricane Melissa made its slow approach to the coast.The strongest storm on record for the island nation - and the strongest globally this year - the National Hurricane Center warned of \"catastrophic and life-threatening\" conditions once it landed in Jamaica, with torrential rainfall, deadly flash flooding and landslides.Three \"storm-related deaths\" on the Caribbean island have already been attributed to the storm - as people prepared by cutting down trees - as well as four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.The storm is expected to be particularly devastating along the coast of Kingston, where much of the country's critical infrastructure is located, including the international airport and power plants.Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued by the government for at least seven areas in the southeast classified as high risk - with airports and schools across the country shuttered. Power outages have rippled across Jamaica, with more than 200,000 people currently without electricity, according to the government.Thousands of residents have taken refuge in government shelters, but many are thought to be reluctant to leave their homes.Getty ImagesA man installs storm shutters in Portmore; preparations for Hurricane Melissa have been ongoing for days across JamaicaGetty Images'The birds have all gone'Tourists have described being \"stuck in limbo\" with the country's two international airports closed, flights cancelled and limited information from airlines.Rebecca Chapman, who travelled to Jamaica for her 25th wedding anniversary, said she had arrived on Thursday evening just as storm preparations began.She is staying in Lucea, half an hour from Montego Bay on the coast, along with her husband and their three teenage sons.\"There's this weird roar that sounds like it's coming from the sea,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme before the storm hit on Tuesday. \"It's really odd, like something's coming. The birds have all gone so it's all gone really quiet. It's like a ghost town.\"\"The trees are snapping, the wind is slamming into our rooms and the rain is relentless,\" Keira Witcomb said.Ms Witcomb, who travelled to Jamaica from the UK for her mother's wedding, said they were \"absolutely terrified\" and \"scared for our lives\".Alex Baskeyfield, from West Yorkshire, is currently staying in the town of Negril on the west coast of the island with his wife and their 13-year-old daughter. He tried to leave Jamaica in the days before the storm hit but all departing flights were fully booked.He described the atmosphere as \"strange and unusual\" with \"extreme preparations\" under way at his hotel - including windows shuttered with wood, everything being tied down, and ceiling fans and televisions removed. \"There's been an army of people for the last 48 hours unscrewing anything they could,\" he added. \"You do get a real sense that something incredibly serious is about to happen.\"The Foreign Office has advised Britons in Jamaica to follow local authority advice, \"especially in the event of any evacuation orders\".",

She is due in court again on Monday.In May, she was stopped at Tbilisi International Airport after 12kg (26lb) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lb) of hashish were found in her luggage. Miss Culley  previously claimed she was tortured to bring the drugs.Under the plea bargain agreement, her family paid 500,000 Georgian Lari (£137,000) to reduce her sentence.More than 90% of drug-related crimes in Georgia are resolved through plea bargains.ReutersLyanne Kennedy, speaking to reporters outside court, said her 19-year-old daughter was \"looking strong\"Speaking outside court, her mother said: \"We've confirmed that the funds have been sent but they need to confirm that they have been received and that is not going to happen until tomorrow.\"She is looking big, pregnant, but she is looking strong.\"Malkhaz Salakaia, representing Miss Culley, said the negotiations \"are nearing completion\".\"Plea bargain conditions are known to the family,\" he said.\"There is a technical issue to be resolved which will take a few days.\"Mr Salakaia previously said he planned to appeal to the president of Georgia to pardon her after finalising the plea deal.Rayhan Demytrie/BBCBella Culley is being detained at prison number 5Miss Culley initially went missing in Thailand before being arrested at Tbilisi International Airport on 10 May.It is understood she arrived on a flight from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates and police seized drugs from a travel bag.At a hearing in July, she pleaded not guilty to charges of possession and trafficking illegal drugs and claimed she had been \"forced to do this through torture\".\"I just wanted to travel,\" she said. \"I am a good person. I am a student at university. I am a clean person. I don't do drugs.\"More on this story",

    "body": "8 hours agoLiv McMahon,Technology reporter and Osmond Chia,Business reporterAmazon has confirmed it plans to cut thousands of jobs, saying it needs to be \"organised more leanly\" to seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI).The tech giant said on Tuesday it would reduce its global corporate workforce by \"approximately 14,000 roles\".Earlier reporting had suggested it was planning to lay off as many as 30,000 workers.Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, wrote in a note to staff that the move would make the company \"even stronger\" by shifting resources \"to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs\".She acknowledged that some would question the move given the company was performing well.At the end of July, Amazon reported second quarter results which beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn).But Ms Galetti said the cuts were needed because AI was \"the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet\" and was \"enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.\"\"We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\" she added.The note, shared with Amazon employees earlier on Tuesday, said the company was \"working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted\" - including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon.Those who cannot will receive \"transition support\" including severance pay, it said.The BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK.The company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide.This includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures that Amazon submitted to the US government last year.Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services.Amazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency.Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks.\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" he said then.Amazon has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years.It laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic.After the company posted its latest financial results in July, its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter left some sceptical of whether - or when -  its enormous AI investments would pay off.Slower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors.Amazon will report its latest results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September.Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said the wider industry would be watching Amazon closely as it embarked on its latest round of cuts.\"We are already seeing jobs in software development be shed thanks to the capabilities of some of these AI tools, and the big companies will be looking to redistribute and restructure their workforces accordingly,\" he told the BBC. \"They have the data and can apply AI in a way that unfortunately means job losses are inevitable.\"Additional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tJan 3, 2026 8:00am PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tCritics Choice Winner Predictions: Timothée Chalamet, Jessie Buckley and a Close Race Between ‘Sinners’ and ‘One Battle After Another’\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFocus Features / Warner Bros. / Netflix / A24\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe 31st Critics Choice Awards arrive Sunday with Chelsea Handler set to return as host. This year, Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” leads the nomination tally at 17 nods, but Variety is projecting a big night for Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” when winners are announced live on E!\n\n\t“One Battle” is projected to take best picture, director and adapted screenplay. However, we are also forecasting that “Sinners,” the vampire-tinged epic will take home the most trophies with six including original screenplay for Coogler. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARTY SUPREME, Timothee Chalamet, 2025. © A24 / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe current expectation for the acting races suggest a strong night for a quartet of performances tied to four different films: Timothée Chalamet for “Marty Supreme,” Jessie Buckley for “Hamnet,” Benicio del Toro for “One Battle After Another” and Amy Madigan for “Weapons.” If that quartet holds, it would signal a more fluid and wide open race and reflecting broad enthusiasm across the top tier rather than turning the ceremony into a single-movie coronation.\n\n\n\tStill, the acting races are where the upsets tend to live. Best actor has two obvious alternatives with win-worthy narratives and passionate pockets of support: Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle” and Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon.” Best actress is similarly primed for a late surge, with Rose Byrne in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” representing the kind of critics-forward pick that can surprise if the vote splinters. \n\n\tSupporting actor has its own volatility, with Stellan Skarsgård for “Sentimental Value” and Sean Penn for “One Battle After Another” both positioned as credible spoilers. And supporting actress may be the flashpoint category of the night, with Ariana Grande for “Wicked: For Good” and Teyana Taylor for “One Battle After Another” standing as the most headline-ready threats to any presumed frontrunner. Even Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas has the chance to spoil.\n\t\n\n\tThe Critics Choice Association, comprising of roughly 575 voting members, has historically served as a reliable barometer for Oscar momentum. Last year’s best picture winner “Anora” used its CCA victory to reassert itself in the race after Golden Globe and SAG Awards shutouts, ultimately carrying that momentum to Academy Awards glory. However, this is a different time as this marks the first major awards ceremony of the year, and Oscar voting set to begin on Jan. 12. A great speech and a huge victory can be a game-changer in a race this tight.\n\n\tBelow are category the predicted winners.\n\t\n\t\tFilm\t\n\n\nBest Picture: “One Battle After Another” (Alternate:

    "body": "\n\tThe team behind Yash‘s “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has revealed the first look at Tara Sutaria as Rebecca, continuing a series of character unveilings that have amplified anticipation for the 2026 theatrical release.\n\n\tFollowing reveals of Kiara Advani as Nadia, Huma Qureshi as Elizabeth and Nayanthara as Ganga, the poster introduces Sutaria’s character as a figure combining fragility with underlying strength. The image presents Rebecca in an unraveled state, suggesting a character navigating vulnerability while maintaining an instinct for authority and survival.\n\t\n\n\tSutaria made her film debut with “Student of the Year 2” in 2019, winning the Zee Cine Award for Best Female Debut. Her subsequent work has included action films “Marjaavaan,” “Heropanti 2” and “Ek Villain Returns,” alongside the survival thriller “Apurva” in 2023, which critics noted offered her expanded dramatic range. “Toxic” marks her first pan-India production.\n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\t\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\t“I’ve always felt an instinctive love to protect Tara. Perhaps because she is a guarded soul or perhaps it’s the armor she’s comfortable with. And perhaps it doesn’t need to be defined,” said Mohandas. “I realized early on that the best way to reach her was not by pushing, not by demanding more, but by allowing her the space to simply be. That choice shaped our equation which turned out calm, deeply professional, and perfectly aligned. She observed more than she spoke. She listened more than she revealed. And I often wondered if I should guide her more closely. But in her silence, something powerful was brewing. When she finally stepped into her performance, what emerged was nothing short of breathtaking which is born from an inner understanding she carried all along. She surprised me completely, and in the most beautiful way. I have no doubt she will surprise everyone else too.”\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tWritten by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic: A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has been shot simultaneously in Kannada and English, with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\tThe production features National Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer TP Abid. Action choreography comes from Hollywood’s JJ Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside National Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tClay, the lead character in “The Dutchman,” is having a hellish night in New York City, the kind of night that could end his life or change it in gravely material ways. One person he encounters advises him to “heed the warnings of those before you, so your fate can be different.” And thus this adaptation of Amiri Baraka’s celebrated 1964 play, “Dutchman,” about race and Black identity, announces its intention to offer an alternate, updated interpretation of a seminal text. The film adds modern references and takes place in the present, but its treatment of the play’s themes remains murky and marred by an inability to let go of what director Andre Gaines evidently considers to be a sacred text. \n\t\n\n\tThe adaptation, which Gaines wrote with Qasim Basir, begins in a marriage therapy session. Clay (André Holland), a successful Black businessman, is trying to understand why his wife Kaya (Zazie Beetz) cheated on him, though he seems defensive and unable to open up emotionally. The therapist (Stephen McKinley Henderson) urges him to listen to his wife. Despite the palpable tension between the spouses, their commitment and love is apparent. They are not on their way to separation, but perhaps to a greater understanding of one another’s needs. \n\n\n\tOn his way to a Harlem fundraiser for a friend running for office (Aldis Hodge), Clay encounters a strange white woman on the train. From the moment she sets her eyes on him, Lula (Kate Mara) seems determined to shock, seduce, taunt and repel Clay. One minute, she invites him to her bed, and the next, she’s threatening to call “rape.” She insists on accompanying him to the party where she’s determined to cause a ruckus and upend his relationships with his wife, friends and community. What is driving her fixation on Clay is never explained.\n\t\n\n\tIn Baraka’s play, Clay and Lula serve as allegorical representations of Black assimilation and white supremacy, respectively. Written and performed at the height of the Civil Rights movement, “Dutchman” was audacious and ahead of its time. Its provocative themes and the visceral ways in which it dealt with them challenged audiences. In trying to open it up for a 2026 audience, Gaines and Basir add dimension to Clay, while leaving Lula little more than a mechanism of confrontation. That imbalance — one main character rendered flesh and blood while the other never comes to life — hinders the central narrative of the film. \n\n\tThe play takes place on a subway train, and though that remains a pivotal setting, Gaines’ opens up the drama, situating Clay and Lula within a broader social landscape, reinforcing the idea that their encounter is not isolated but embedded in the violence of New York City. His framing of their scenes together, whether on the train, in her apartment or within a large party full of people, allows the actors to play well off each other. \n\n\tStrangely, “Dutchman” is overtly referenced multiple times in the script. Clay is given a printed version of the play by his therapist early on. He is shown a miniature version of a theater where his “character” appears as a small toy to be manipulated. He catches a glimpse of a TV production playing on the display window of an electronics store as he’s walking around with Lula. \n\n\tHenderson plays several roles and keeps appearing as specter throughout the proceedings to comment and call back to the play. His character is sometimes referred to as Amiri and quotes directly from the play and from other well-known texts about American Black identity. This meta incorporation of the play adds a sense of déjà vu to the film, suggesting that what’s happening to Clay could be a rite of passage that every Black man must face in this country.\n\n\tGaines and Basir’s adaptation adheres to the play’s intellectual origins. However, they never manage to make the story emotional, maintaining its themes without modernizing them. Perhaps that’s the point: Contemporary African American men must constantly deal with their identities and the way white society sees them. If the reason for this adaptation is to continue that conversation for a new generation, then they have succeeded. \n\t\n\n\tHolland brings vivid shading to a role written as a symbol of his race and nationality, making him the main reason to watch this adaptation. He’s immediately believable as a man in love who is also hurting, as a man with desires he’d rather not acknowledge, and as an ambitious person who believes he deserves his success — all themes that the text hints at, and which Holland bring to life while matching intensity with vulnerability. In his last monologue, he adds notes of sarcasm to cover the righteous anger his character feels, giving the film the explosive ending it has been building toward, even it didn’t quite earn it.\n\n\t“The Dutchman” exists in a tense space between reverence and reinvention. It is an adaptation so aware of the power and legacy of Baraka’s text that it never fully trusts its own instincts. The result is a film that provokes thought more than feeling, one that invites discussion, while denying audiences the emotional dimension that might have driven home its relevance. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil, Bari Weiss‘ pick to try to turn around the ratings-challenged “CBS Evening News,” vowed that the nightly news program he will anchor starting next week will be “more accountable and more transparent” than under legendary broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite.\n\n\tOn Thursday, Jan. 1, Dokoupil shared his views on the state of journalism — and how “CBS Evening News” will be different with him as anchor.\n\n\n\t“People do not trust us like they used to,” Dokoupil said in a video uploaded to social media and the outlet’s website. “On too many stories, the press has missed the story. And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “And I know this because, at certain points, I have been you. I have felt this way too. I have felt like what I was seeing and hearing on the news didn’t reflect what I was seeing and hearing in my own life. And that the most urgent questions simply weren’t being asked.”\n\n\tDokoupil’s message was met with a healthy dose of skepticism and some scorn — and he responded directly to several critics on his Instagram account, as highlighted by Guardian media reporter Jeremy Barr.\n\n\tOne commenter wrote, “I grew up on Cronkite. Too bad CBS has lost its Tiffany shine. But good luck to you anyway.” Dokoupil responded, “What did you love most about him? I can promise you we’ll be more accountable and more transparent than Cronkite or any one else of his era.”\n\t\n\n\tDon Dahler, a journalist who is a former CBS News correspondent, posted, “Tony, you know I have enormous respect and affection for you. I know you’re a solid journalist and legitimate heir to the big desk at CBS-News. But this sounds like it was written by Bari Weiss.” Dokoupil responded, “nope, I wrote it. I spent the first half of my career as a print journalist. If the Internet had never been invented, I probably still would be a print journalist. Writing is my first form.”\n\n\tBravo host Andy Cohen also commented on Dokoupil’s post: “Listening too much to experts? Wtf.” To that, Dokoupil replied, “Andy, I love ya. But can you really not think of any examples where academic advice turned out narrow or bad? I basically gave you a multiple-choice list. It’s possible you were living outside or above the issues I mention.” \n\n\tDokoupil in his post original post said viewers have questioned CBS News’ coverage of topics like “NAFTA or the Iraq War”; “Hillary Clinton’s emails or Russiagate”; and “more recently, COVID lockdowns, Hunter Biden’s laptop or the president’s fitness for office.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, another commenter wrote on Dokoupil’s post, “I have very little faith that this is true. We watched your company twist itself into a knot to make itself attractive to it’s [sic] new parent company. I doubt you will be permitted to share the news in an unbiased way. You will show stories of everyday Americans who fight against addiction, job loss, etc. but the policy decisions contributing to their plight will stay in the background. Call me doubting Thomas, show me that I’m wrong.” To that, Dokoupil responded: “Hey, I hear ya. They’re just words right now. But hold me to them.”\n\n\tOne of the most-liked comments on the Dokoupil New Year’s Day post was: “Too late… Bari Weiss has destroyed this network.” Another commenter wrote, “Absolutely fucking insane to basically say ‘we’re going to dumb this down because facts coming from academia are uncomfortable for you.'”\n\n\tDokoupil was appointed anchor of “CBS Evening News” last month by Weiss, the editor in chief of CBS News and founder of The Free Press.

    "description": "\n\tUnder the oversight of Bari Weiss, CBS’s newly revamped weeknight news program is waving the American flag — and it’s not apologizing for its pro-U.",
    "body": "\n\tUnder the oversight of Bari Weiss, CBS’s newly revamped weeknight news program is waving the American flag — and it’s not apologizing for its pro-U.S. editorial stance.\n\n\tOn Friday, the program released a statement outlining “five simple principles” that will inform the show’s presentation of the news under anchor Tony Dokoupil, who was previously a morning news anchor on CBS. According to CBS News, what had formerly been a “38-page handbook” is now “5 simple values.”\n\t\n\n\tDokoupil was appointed to the anchor chair of “CBS Evening News” last month by Weiss, the editor in chief of CBS News and founder of The Free Press, which describes itself as “a new media company built on the ideals that were once the bedrock of American journalism.” Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison acquired The Free Press in a reported $150 million deal and installed Weiss to oversee CBS News’ editorial operations in what he said was an effort to restore viewers’ trust in the outlet.\n\n\n\t“When the new ‘CBS Evening News’ kicks off on Monday, we promise to live by these five simple principles – from our very first show on the road, to our first broadcast on the new set in New York, and every one after that,” the show said in a series of posts on social media.\n\n\tOne of the principles outlined by “CBS Evening News” was this: “We love America. And we make no apologies for saying so. Our foundational values of liberty, equality and the rule of law make us the last best hope on Earth.” The news show said that “We aim to do our part every night: One way to think about our show is as a daily conversation about exactly where we are as a country and where we are going.”\n\t\n\n\tThe unusual pro-American pledge by the broadcast journalism outlet will reinforce speculation that Ellison put Weiss in charge of CBS News in an effort to boost its appeal among MAGA supporters generally — and with President Trump specifically. After Trump complained recently that “60 Minutes” was not treating him fairly (by airing an interview with Marjorie Taylor Greene), Weiss pulled a “60 Minutes” segment critical of the administration’s deportation of migrants to a brutal El Salvador prison, claiming the piece needed more reporting that represented the White House’s perspective.\n\n\tOn Thursday, Jan. 1, Dokoupil shared his thoughts on the state of journalism in the U.S. ahead of his taking over as “CBS Evening News” anchor. \n\n\t“People do not trust us like they used to,” Dokoupil said in a video shared on CBSNews.com. He continued: “On too many stories, the press has missed the story. And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or, we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\n\tHere are the “five simple principles” that “CBS Evening News” says it will be guided by with Dokoupil as the anchor:\n\n\nWe work for you. That means you come first. Not our advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests, including the corporate owners of CBS News.\nWe report on the world as it is. We’ll be honest and direct with you. That means no weasel words or padded landings. We’ll tell you what we know, when we know it. Well update our reporting when we uncover new facts. And we’ll admit when we get it wrong.\nWe respect you. We believe that our fellow Americans are smart and discerning. It’s our job to present you with the fullest picture — and the strongest voices on all sides of an issue. We trust you to make up your own minds, and to make the decisions that are best for you, your families and your communities.\nWe love America. And we make no apologies for saying so. Our foundational values of liberty, equality and the rule of law make us the last best hope on Earth. We also believe in Franklin’s famous line about America as a republic — if we can keep it. We aim to do our part every night: One way to think about our show is as a daily conversation about exactly where we are as a country and where we are going.\nWe respect tradition, but we also believe in the future. We embrace the tools that allow us to reach you where you are. Some of you will watch this show on linear television. Others will increasingly watch it on social media. What we can guarantee is that the tools will continue to change — but some things never will. One of those things is honest journalism.\n\n\n\n\t“CBS Evening News” with Tony Dokoupil premieres Monday, Jan. 5, at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a revealing new documentary about his life and career, Chevy Chase alleges that he suffered physical abuse as a child at the hands of his mother and stepfather.\n\n\tIn “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” which debuted Jan. 1 on CNN, Chase and his family and friends said he was beaten, locked in a closet and continually woken up with violence.\n\n\tChase’s parents divorced when he was about 4 years old, and both of them quickly remarried. He described his stepfather, John Cederquist, as “humorless.” Chase’s stepbrother, also named John Cederquist, said, “My father had a flash anger, and he could lash out with a single blow…He did not take to anything that he perceived as insolence. Chevy was insolent.”\n\t\n\n\tChase’s wife, Jayni, said the first time she stayed overnight with Chase and woke him up, he “shuddered.” “He explained, ‘Well, my mother would wake me up slapping me.’ From the time he was a little guy, wham!” she said.\n\n\n\tChase’s mother, Cathalene Browning, is described in the documentary as “a bag of cats, certainly on the schizoid spectrum.”\n\n\t“This was an out-of-control woman who I look back on and I say I feel sorry for her,” Chase said. “She had her own issues — bad ones. But, she was physically abusive to me.”\n\n\tPeter Aaron, a friend of the comedian’s, said Chase told him stories about the “terrible things that would happen to him as a young man — things like being locked in the closet.” Chase’s brother, Ned, added, “There was a cellar, and he was sent down there because of really messing up in school.” \n\n\tIn an interview with The New York Times published Friday, Chase alluded to being “slapped with a yardstick on your bare ass and on the backs of your legs until they’re so bruised that somebody else notices.”\n\t\n\n\tChase would get punished for receiving poor grades in school, but, ironically, he said he was failing academically because of the abuse. “Whereas others would concentrate on their homework, I didn’t have a chance at that,” he said. “I was always worried about one thing or another that had to do with my own health.”\n\n\tChase detailed one incident in which he and Ned were eating breakfast, and their stepfather came downstairs “and started slapping me across the back of the head.” Ned recalled, “I stood up and made it clear I didn’t think this was a time for corporal punishment. And John Cederquist sat down, and I sat down.”\n\n\t“I knew at that time that Ned was there for me,” Chase said. “That was a big moment for us.”\n\n\tWhen asked by director Marina Zenovich if there was a time when Chase walked away from his mother and stepfather and never saw them again, Chase pretended to swat a fly on his forehead, then licked his fingers as if eating the imaginary bug. “Sorry?” he asked, half-smiling.\n\n\tChase’s family and friends described how his trauma informed his comedy — a “coping mechanism” — and how it may have contributed to his struggles with depression in his later life. “It shaped him. He used comedy, he used humor as a way to mask what was going on inside. And that’s continued. It continues to this day,” said Emily Chase, his youngest daughter. “He will joke around from morning until night, and you won’t know what’s going on. … That’s how he always dealt with problems in his life.”\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” is now available to watch on CNN’s streaming platforms.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParenting doesn’t come with a user manual and there’s never going to be a perfect solution to every situation. But this award season is full of films with mothers who make decisions and sacrifices that will be debated well beyond WhatsApp chats, school drop offs and personal therapy sessions.\n\n\tIs the decision that Teyana Taylor’s “One Battle After Another” revolutionary activist Perfidia Beverly Hills makes to go on the lam and abandon her young child an act of selfishness and self-preservation? Or is it a means of saving her daughter from the dangers of growing up with her, someone who regrets becoming a parent? Is it right for “Sinners’” Grace (Li Jun Li) to sacrifice the last surviving humans at a juke joint to a swarm of vampires if it means she may be able to save the child she has back at home? Is Rose Byrne’s Linda in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” acting on the best interest of her daughter’s medical care? Or is she burned out and drowning in the exhaustiveness of feeding tubes, doctor’s appointments and everything else life throws at her?\n\t\n\n\tMary Bronstein, who wrote and directed “Legs” based on her own experiences (and who appears in the film as a doctor unsympathetic to Linda’s plight), says that “there’s a fantasy fulfillment” to her film; that she couldn’t speak out in parenting support sessions or leave her child at a hotel unsupervised… but Linda can.\n\n\n\t“When you have a child with special needs, or when you’re in a crisis situation with your child, everybody is placating you and trying to make you feel better by saying, ‘It’s not your fault,’” she says.\n\t\n\n\tShe describes these feelings as both confusing and guilt-inducing because “you’re also positioned as the main person that’s in charge of helping your child.”\n\n\tTold from Linda’s point of view, “Legs” shows a caretaker unraveling. The disorder the character’s daughter has is deliberately never named. Bronstein says that choice was made because, if it was named, then it becomes a movie “about a specific illness that a mother is trying to fix or find a cure for.” The daughter’s face is also hidden for most of the movie, and much screentime is fixated on Linda, with her increasingly greasy hair and dark shadows under her eyes. Bronstein also added the sly twist that Linda is a therapist, meaning her entire world is supposed to be about caring for other people.\n\n\t“A big part of this movie centers on the trauma that Linda is experiencing, that Linda holds within her body,” Bronstein says. “The trauma of different things that have happened with the daughter, those are things that she has hidden away in the back of her mind. And one very major one reveals itself to her and slaps her in the face.”\n\n\tBronstein says that “with trauma, I believe that you do hold it in your body somewhere and, if you don’t deal with it, it’s going to get you at some point. And you can’t run away from it, because it’s not external; it’s internal.”\n\n\tWhatever audiences might think of Linda and her decisions, the concept of parental trauma is also seen on film this year in mothers who adhere closer to the textbook definition of “good” parents. Jessie Buckley’s Agnes in “Hamnet” is angry at herself as much as she is guilt-ridden that she couldn’t save one child because she was so fixated on protecting another. Kate Hudson’s wounded musician Claire in “Song Sung Blue” can only see to help her daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) after she puts on her own oxygen mask and gets sober. “KPop Demon Hunters’” Celine (Yunjin Kim) teaches her adoptive daughter to feel shame and hide her true self rather than discuss her otherness.\n\n\tIn director Eric Lin and screenwriter Marilyn Fu’s “Rosemead,” which is based on a true story covered in a 2017 Los Angeles Times piece, Lucy Liu’s Irene must weigh how her own terminal cancer diagnosis will impact her teenage son Joe’s (Lawrence Shou) newly diagnosed schizophrenia. Coping with all of this, as well as the recent loss of her husband to cancer and cultural stigmas toward therapy, Western medicine and mental disorders, Irene uses stoicism to hide her own fears. She both supports her son by joining him in his therapy sessions, even if they make her uncomfortable, and attempts to protect him from ostracization within the community by lying about why he’s there when he’s seen going into these sessions.\n\t\n\n\t“I think there’s a shame behind it [and] I don’t think it’s just solely the Asian community,” she says of reaction to Joe’s diagnosis and treatment. “It’s a stigma that everyone holds that therapy is for someone who really has a problem, and nobody wants to be known as somebody who has a problem or an issue.”\n\n\tThe reality, she continues, “is that we all have to process something that happens to us, whether it’s severe or not.”\n\n\tIn fact, the movie centers so much on Irene’s dedication and concern for her son that it’s easy to forget just how sick she is until her doctor gives her the final diagnosis.\n\n\tLiu thinks Irene’s grief over the loss of her husband plus “the secrecy and the hiding and the stories she made up to try to fit into society, and to also make sure that her son was not sequestered from the community or from other kids … that struggle already was so difficult on top of the physical illness that she was experiencing.”\n\n\t“The corporal body was weak, but her inner willpower and her courage and her love for her son was really strong,” Liu says. “That dynamic tension [and] that urgency sort of fills the time on screen. Her personality comes through with the urgency of trying to save her son because she’s losing her son even though he’s right there in the house.”\n\n\tThe movie ends with Irene making the only decision she deems possible, a parental act of both love and fear.\n\n\t“It’s definitely going to spark conversation, and it should really create a comfortable, safe place for discussion and reaction because it is such a powerful moment of choice for her,” Liu says of the finale. “It’s obviously not for everyone, but it’s a haunting reality that that if it weren’t true, nobody would believe it. I think the legacy that she left behind is something to hold up in our community and others to say that things can become like this if you don’t take these simple steps.”\n\n\tLiu says that parents are taught to be present and work with their children in their current situations, but they also inevitably “futurize or try to live in another fantasy world.” She says she thinks Irene’s decision is “symbolic of how lonely she was and how isolated she was, and how real it was to her.”\n\n\tShe doesn’t know if her own family has experiences with mental disorders, saying, “I don’t know enough about my history because there has been so much secrecy in our own family.” But she says she has seen in society that “everyone wants to solve the puzzle — and it’s not a puzzle to be solved. It’s a puzzle to be lived. And that’s something that people just don’t want to believe because they’re not really living it the way that you are.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSecuring the rights to use a song in film or TV is a challenging and expensive task — and the more iconic the song, the more challenging and expensive the clearance is likely to be.\n\n\tSo when two of Prince’s most legendary songs, “When Doves Cry” and “Purple Rain,” appeared in the finale of “Stranger Things,” it was obvious that therein lay a tale. And the tale is even more complicated than virtually anyone would have thought.\n\t\n\n\tWhy? Not only because of the challenges in clearing the songs with the Prince estate — but because of the show’s plot: The two songs required for that segment of the show had to be the first and last songs on one side of a single vinyl album, which, to use a reference from the show, is like a Rubik’s Cube for the music supervisor, and much more challenging than selecting Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill,” Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” or any of the show’s many other iconic music moments.\n\n\n\tThe hard work paid off: Since the episode debuted on New Year’s Eve, “Purple Rain” has seen a 243 percent increase in Spotify global streams and a 577 percent surge in global Gen-Z streams specifically, Variety can exclusively reveal. “When Doves Cry” also saw a 200 percent boost in global streams, as well as a 128 percent increase in Gen Z streams. \n\n\tAnd as you’ll see below, Nora Felder, president of Picture Music Company and a veteran music supervisor who has been on board for the entirety of “Stranger Things,” was more than up to the task — which doesn’t mean it was easy! Variety caught up with Felder on Friday afternoon to find out how she got it done …\n\t\n\n\tDid you do anything special for the finale?\n\n\tYes, I saw it in a theater with my family — I’ve never seen “Stranger Things” like that, with an audience. It was the first time I was able to really experience how they’re so emotionally attached to the characters — they were cheering and shrieking, some of them were crying. I can’t think of another way I would rather have seen it. \n\n\tI think the music in the show does so well because it stems from the fans being so attached to the characters and the stories, and the music extends their journeys, so they naturally become attached to it as well.\n\n\tMusic plays a bigger role in “Stranger Things” than a lot of similar episodic shows or films. Was that intentional from the jump?\n\n\tI think the intention was just to find songs to push the narrative of the story, and rolling up our sleeves and keying in on “What is the right song for this character?” and “What is the right song for each moment? Should this be score or a song?” I can’t speak on behalf of the Duffers, but I don’t think there was an overall sense of “We’re going to create something that’s going to make music such a main character that it’s going to blow up all over their world!” No, they just wanted songs that accented their characters, pushed the narrative, and showed the attachment of music to the characters — and how music can sometimes save you. \n\n\tDid we know the Clash was going to have a moment? Or Kate Bush or Metallica, or possibly what’s going on now? No, it’s always been about what is the most effective choice to either move this narrative or represent the true essence of this character. And I think that because we always constantly stayed true to that, the show became what it was. \n\n\tThose two Prince songs were a surprise, and I’m sure it was a challenge clearing them. Why those songs? And how do you think they spoke to those moments in the show?\n\n\tI’m glad you say “do you think” because songs can be interpreted in so many different ways. But they came about in a similar way to Kate Bush and “Running Up That Hill”: They were not scripted. They were “TBD” moments in the two spots in the script where a song needed to play: [SPOILER ALERT] for the scene when Hopper and Murray set off the bomb detonation to collapse the Upside Down gate, which was set off from the record player. So it needed to be the first song from one side of a [vinyl album], and then it needed to segue to the last song on that same side of the [same album], to play through Eleven’s emotional stand against that leads into the collapsing dimension of the Upside Down. So they needed to hit those two spots.\n\t\n\n\tThe Duffers reached out to me about this before the scene was shot — I didn’t even have a shooting schedule, I think they had just written the script and only the cast had seen it. They’d been going through songs, I think they were asking for ideas from the cast. And they said, “This one is a little more tricky because of the way the scenes are going to be set up: We need something preferably from 1987 — but it could be from before — the songs have to be from the same artist; and the first song has to start the A or B-side of an album by that artist, and the second song has to end the A or B side of that album. \n\n\tThat is an incredibly narrow window!\n\n\tExactly! So my heart stopped, like, ooh, that’s a tough one. And remember, the scene’s not shot yet, so I haven’t seen the footage and this is just me imagining it in my head — and it’s got to play through this big, emotional, sad scene that’ll lead into a dimension collapsing! I’ve been doing this for 20 years, but there’s still always a first. \n\n\tObviously I have various ways of finding music: Sometimes songs just pop into my head — and I know the ‘80s quite well — sometimes it’s just e-surfing, Spotify or streaming this or that; sometimes it’s just driving in a car and somebody drives by with a song playing; and I also have 15,000 or 20,000 CDs and albums. But for this one, I needed to go to my research books. I found a couple that listed the albums [by side], and I literally had to go and flip through the book for ideas and then see if the first and last tracks on a side could line up to our needs. And in a lot of cases, they just didn’t. I mean, I stayed up all night, and I think I came up with just two ideas.\n\n\tJust to step away from Prince for a second, in these situations, I like to give the Duffers a lot of different flavors to choose from to find what works best. Like in the scene where [SPOILER ALERT] Karen is fighting the monster to save Holly, I tried all kinds of songs, from Frank Sinatra to you name it, and they fell in love with the ABBA song, “Fernando,” which was actually the first song I sent them.\n\t\n\n\tSo what was the other album you sent them, along with Prince’s “Purple Rain”? \n\n\tPart of me doesn’t want to say what it is, because I don’t want people to feel bad. But I did send a classic artist from the ‘70s, big artists, and I said, “We could end it with this, but I’m not sure about the starting song — and honestly, I don’t even know if those guys will clear it, and it’s going to cost megabucks.”\n\n\tOr, I said, “We could end it with ‘Purple Rain’ and start with ‘When Doves Cry’ — but honestly, I don’t even know if I can clear it.” I mean, I had not heard of [“Purple Rain”] clearing before, although I know now that it did clear for something right after Prince died [in 2016] — there was a relationship with someone who did a [“Black-ish”] series episode about a character mourning Prince’s death, but that was a one-off situation.\n\n\tSo the Duffers wrote back to me and said, “Do you think we could get this cleared?” And I’m like gulp, “I’m really not sure, but I’d be willing to try.” And they said, let’s try. Double gulp! Because this means they really want it — they weren’t having me clear anything else.\n\n\tThe good news is, I majored in English in college, and that helped with creating what I call “theses”: where you give the rights owners all the information of how the song’s going to be used, and the backstory of it, the meaning of it — Jennifer Barron, my clearance coordinator, and I went deep on this one. So we spoke to Marty Silverstone at Primary Wave. He goes, “Well, we all know it’s a tough one, but let’s try.” I said, “If there’s anything that they might clear it for, it would be ‘Stranger Things,’ right?” He goes, “Let’s hope!,” because the estate has so many approvals.\n\n\tThen I talked to Joy Murphy at Universal Music Publishing [which administers the songs’ publishing], and she said the same thing — “Nora, let’s give it a try, we’ll do everything we can to position this in the right way.”  So that was two. Then I had Thuy Lam at Warner Records — which controls the master [recording] — who I’d been down this road before with Kate Bush, and she said, “We support this.” And then we waited — that was grueling, and it took a few weeks — we were getting closer to shooting and so the Duffers made a plan to shoot the scenes in a way where the song could be added later. But shortly after that, I got the answer that [the Prince tracks were approved.]\n\t\n\n\tNow, I know the Duffers feel that Prince’s estate cleared the songs because of Kate Bush, and I’m sure that had something to do with it, as the parties reminded them of the impact the show had with “Running Up That Hill.” And I did tell them I thought this was going to be one of the most significant moments in the season, although no one has a crystall ball. But still, for the rights owners, it’s not just about the money, it’s about what lines up with what Prince would have wanted, and to do it in the most respectful manner possible. As we do with the trickier clearances, I do believe the hard work we put into the “theses” made sure everyone fully understood these uses and what they meant to the characters.\n\n\tFor “Running Up That Hill,” though, there were hundreds of other songs that could have worked, you didn’t need songs that began and ended an album side.\n\n\tYeah, for [the Kate Bush slot], I had 9 or 10 other songs in my pocket — but I said, “This is the best one. This does everything we want it to do.” I don’t think it could have been [as good with] anything else — because the lyrical content lined up so perfectly with what the characters were going through and needed to do. You know, they needed to step outside of their own world and step into someone else’s shoes to truly understand and reconnect. I’m not saying we couldn’t have gotten something else, but I don’t know if it would have lined up as perfectly, not only with the melodic structure in the building, but also with the intricate message that seemed to speak on a deeper level and relate to our characters. \n\n\tAlso, those two Prince songs are so heavily associated with the “Purple Rain” film and the emotions and visuals that go with it — was that a concern?\n\n\tNo, not for me, and the Duffers never mentioned that. We’ve never been against using songs that have been tied to other stories because this is a completely different, unique story. And again, going back to the special relationship that the fans have with this show, once you attach it to their characters and this story, it’s almost as if it takes on a different meaning. And remember, a lot of the young people are not going to have that association. Even the older people that knew and grew up with these songs, they’re listening to it in a different way. \n\t\n\n\tThey kind of line up in that way as well, because “Purple Rain” is obviously the climax of that film, and here it’s part of the climax.\n\n\tYeah, when things are beginning to be resolved and [SPOILER ALERT] Eleven has made her decision that she needs to cease existing in order to save them. And “When Doves Cry” — doves have always represented love and peace, right? And in this case, they’re crying because they’re sorrowful — if we want to get heavy here, and pretend we just smoked some pot together (laughter). \n\n\tBut from what I’ve always understood, the song is about the conflicts that exist within relationships, right? So to me, it was interesting to put the song in that spot, because they’re feeling hopeful, but things aren’t resolved — their mission is not done; there’s still people in danger; the world is not one. So even though the song has a kind of a lightness to it, I think that’s why it worked well. And “Purple Rain” has always symbolized the chaotic, sad world that we live in, but it’s also ultimately about redemption, love, and transformation.\n\n\t[Marty Silverstone, President of Global Sync at Primary Wave Music, tells Variety: “We’re thrilled that we could play a part in bringing these very special uses to life and have Prince’s music included in the phenomenon that is ‘Stranger Things.’ You have to admire the unique connection the show has with its fanbase, its brilliant music curation over its entire run, and its spotlight on the cosmic importance of music in the lives of young people, and all people!”]\n\n\tOK, can I guess the other one you considered? Led Zeppelin? The Eagles?\n\n\tNo, it wasn’t the Eagles. And I’m not going to say Led Zeppelin didn’t come up — I tried Led Zeppelin, but it didn’t work because I was thinking “Stairway to Heaven” and it wasn’t a first [song on album side] and a last situation. And I thought maybe Pink Floyd with “The Wall,” but I can’t remember if the right song was an ending or not. I don’t know how many times I went through this: One song would work and the other one wouldn’t. I mean, that’s why I stayed up all night with my books!\n\n\tAre you having separation anxiety now that the show is over?\n\t\n\n\tI’m sad, but I’m about to go into “Yellowjackets” right now, literally on Monday. And I love that show. And I’m working on the Duffer Brothers’ other project that they’re executive-producing, “The Boroughs,” that’s coming out this year. And then we’ll see about after that! I really want to take some time and find something really special to work on.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat does it mean to bring a child into today’s world? Based on some of this year’s buzziest films, that question is on the minds of contemporary directors and writers.\n\n\tFrom the postpartum loneliness and depression that many mothers face depicted in Lynne Ramsay’s “Die My Love,” the multi-generational fight for meaningful change in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” to the never-ending economic stresses placed on family in Park Chan-wook’s “No Other Choice,” many of this year’s films take an unflinching look at the anxiety parents — and, in turn, their children — face in today’s increasingly politically volatile world.\n\t\n\n\tIn appreciating the links between these different stories, “Train Dreams” director and co-writer Clint Bentley says: “The world, for most of us, feels like it’s turning on its axis a bit. Whether we live in Des Moines or Dubai, we feel like the world is changing in a way we can’t quite understand, and that there might be a kind of end-of-the-world feeling even as we’re all going on. Part of that is through, ‘What do I give to the next generation? How do I take care of my kids and give them something when everything seems like it’s fucked up, and that we all kind of fucked it up?’”\n\n\n\tIn tackling grief, Oscar winner Chloé Zhao’s (“Nomadland”) period piece “Hamnet” explores how the death of William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) and Agnes Shakespeare’s (Jessie Buckley) son led to the creation of the much-studied play “Hamlet.” When author and co-writer Maggie O’Farrell, herself a student of English literature, read large Shakespeare biographies, she found herself “really angered” at scholars who claimed it was “impossible” to know whether the revered playwright grieved or not.\n\t\n\n\t“I threw the book across the room because you just think, ‘What are you talking about? Of course he grieved.’ And even if child mortality was high in the 16th century, which of course it was, it doesn’t make it any less devastating when your child dies,” O’Farrell says. “I refuse to believe that anywhere in the world at any point in time, it’s anything less than catastrophic to lose a child. In a way, I wanted to put Hamnet center stage and say to people, ‘We owe this child so much.’”\n\n\tBeyond some of the film’s brutally devastating scenes, which feature Agnes fighting to cure her children of the plague, Zhao and O’Farrell tap into how art can serve as a transcendent, cathartic force, as Shakespeare’s writing ensures Hamnet isn’t forgotten. O’Farrell says: “That’s why the line ‘Remember me,’ which the book ends with, has always been very important because I just wonder if that’s why Shakespeare wrote it. But obviously, Agnes and him had no idea for how many hundreds of years Hamnet would [actually] be remembered.”\n\n\t“Train Dreams,” which follows the life of an ordinary man (Joel Edgerton) in the early 20th century across the Pacific Northwest, serves as a great companion piece to “Hamnet” for its meditative exploration of grief. However, Bentley also wrestles with “the real tragedy” of parents having to spend long periods of time away for work: “You’re always kind of catching up and just when it feels you’re getting used to being back home, you’re leaving again. A lot of people experience that whether you’re a filmmaker, truck driver or somebody needing to leave their country.”\n\n\tSome directors, including Cherien Dabis, found the process of making their films cathartic and inspirational in their own right. For Dabis, writing, directing and acting in “All That’s Left of You,” a decades-spanning personal tale of a Palestinian family’s fight for survival, became a way to understand her own intergenerational trauma.\n\n\t“I definitely wanted to draw attention to the struggles of families under occupation, but especially parents who don’t really have the ability to protect their kids anymore,” Dabis says. “Often, what we see in Palestine is kids who, at some point, realize, ‘Well, my parents can’t protect me, so what use are they?’ It’s like parents lose all authority. I think that’s a problem; that’s something that we need to take a look at.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film, which is Jordan’s Oscar entry for Best International Feature, also deals with the loss of childhood innocence, as the young child Noor watches his father being stripped naked by Israeli soldiers. The father-son relationship quickly deteriorates in the years following the humiliation, and the scene was inspired by Dabis’ own experience — her first memory of traveling to Palestine.\n\n\t“My family was held at the border between Jordan and the West Bank for 12 hours; my parents were interrogated multiple times. The soldiers searched through all the contents of our suitcases and then ordered all of us to be strip searched, including myself and my baby sisters, who were age three and one,” Dabis recalls. “It was one of the first moments in my life where I really understood, viscerally, what it meant to be Palestinian.”\n\n\tIn varying ways, political pressures around the world have found their way into these films. Bentley, himself a father, explains how parents have to reckon with not just what it means to bring a child into the world, but how to prepare them for its realities: “[For example], how do I prepare them for the fact that it’s going to be hard to find a job with AI taking everything over? What do you do? The powerlessness of a parent really feeds into that.”\n\n\tAs many of these directors have traveled around the world with their films — both “Train Dreams” and “All That’s Left of You” started their campaigns at Sundance, and “Hamnet” bowed in Telluride and Toronto — they’ve realized how universal these stories can be in their specificity.\n\n\t“I’m always so excited when it feels like there’s something in the zeitgeist and filmmakers are capturing it. They’ve come together and made films at a similar moment in time, therefore creating a cultural dialogue — it’s almost proof that we’re all connected somehow,” Dabis says. “Even prior to this year, there have been trends toward really talking honestly and openly about motherhood in a way that empowers women.”\n\n\tTo unpack the unspoken pressures of motherhood, Mary Bronstein’s anxiety-including “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” situates the viewer in the subjective experience of one mother’s (Rose Byrne) life as she struggles to care for her child suffering from a mysterious illness. What’s inventive about the craft, here, is Bronstein choosing to have the child’s face be off-screen for most of the runtime, allowing the sound design to put viewers on edge.\n\t\n\n\t“I couldn’t think of another film that really reflected the feelings and experience I was having that got into the existential confusion of identity,” Bronstein says. “My film can be abstracted out to the feeling of disappearing into a care-taking role and how to hold onto your identity. Can you be an individual and a mother at the same time?”\n\n\tWhile Bronstein has received positive feedback from mothers feeling seen for the first time watching the film, especially in today’s climate with rights for women being taken away, what has pleasantly surprised her is hearing from young people who are finally understanding what their mother went through in raising them.\n\n\t“It can feel like a betrayal to the love of your child, and what I’m expressing in the movie is that it’s not. We should be able to talk about these difficult things and the loss of identity that women feel, and the scary parts of being in charge of another living human,” she says. “For women, there’s a freedom in seeing somebody finally express that to you.”\n",

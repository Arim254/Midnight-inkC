    "body": "\n\tCANNES — Robbie Brenner told Mipcom attendees that the toymaker is focused on stepping up its TV development and production now that the Mattel Studios arm has been unified under her leadership as president and chief content officer. \n\n\tBrenner spoke Tuesday with Leo Barraclough, Variety‘s international features director, in the keynote address on Day 2 of the Mipcom content market. Brenner detailed her unlikely journey from independent film producer to Mattel Studios leader. She reflected on the out of the box success of “Barbie,” which was Mattel’s first feature film effort under the new regime led by CEO Ynon Kreiz, who recruited Brenner to the toymaker in 2018 to drive the key component of his strategy to transform Mattel into a media and entertainment firm in addition to its consumer toy and game businesses.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s not very often get to go to work and dream every day,” Brenner said of her role. After joining the company she was impressed at Mattel’s culture of detail and innovation. She appreciates Mattel’s history of “having the integrity to make these toys the best they can be,” Brenner said. Her job is to “find ways to honor that and celebrate the brands do it I a way feels interesting an out of the box and unexpected.”\n\n\n\tBrenner explained to Barraclough how Mattel tries to cast the creative auspices of its projects well with distinctive writers, directors, producers and stars who have a feel for the material. Travis Knight, the writer-director steering Mattel’s second feature film release, “Masters of the Universe,” is a “fanboy” who grew up playing with the action figures and knows the mythos behind them. The live-action film starring Nicholas Galitzine, Camila Mendes and Idris Elba bows June 5, distributed by Amazon MGM Studios.\n\t\n\n\t“He knows the characters,” she said of Knight. “His attention to detail has been wonderful to watch.”\n\n\tThe same is true for Daniel Kaluuya, who is taking on a fresh take on the purple dino for A24, with Ayo Edebiri co-starring. Stunt peformer turned director Sam Hargraves is in the driver’s seat for the “Matchbox” feature in the works with John Cena and Jessica Biel. And one day before Brenner’s Mipcom appearance, her studio unveiled a pact with M. Night Shamalayan to develop a series based on the iconic  Magic 8 Ball toy.\n\n\t“Television is a big push for us – I feel good about where my team is,” Brenner said. Brenner had been the company’s head of film. She was promoted in June to oversee TV as well. She firmly believes there will be benefits to the tighter alignment. \n\n\t“Everything historically has been so separated” between film and TV at studios,” Brenner said. “Everything really is so blended today….For us to all exist under the umbrella together — we figure out what is the best past forward for each one of these brands to navigate that together as television and theatrical.”\n\n\t(Pictured: Variety’s Leo Barraclough with Mattel Studios’ Robbie Brenner at Mipcom in Cannes on Oct. 14)\n",

    "body": "\n\tD’Angelo, who died Tuesday at the age of just 51, was indisputably a musical genius, but he didn’t leave much behind: Just three studio albums and an under-the-radar live set over the course of two decades, and a handful of remixes and loose tracks, so a “10 greatest songs” (out of maybe 35 original compositions) seems kind of pointless — just cue up any of a dozen “greatest hits” playlists and click.\n\n\tBut his discography is deep enough to hold some hidden gems, most of them covers or live tracks or both, notably  remixes; and we’ll throw in some rarities like his live sets with Questlove — which were mostly soul covers from the ‘60s and ‘70s — and the “Soul Blends” cassette, which was the first whiff we got of “Voodoo” back in the fall of 1999 and was remixed by a then-little-known New York DJ named Mark Ronson.\n\t\n\n\tBut scroll down as we go deep into the crates and uncover for some vintage deep cuts from one of the leading lights of R&B. \n\n\n\n\n\t“I Found My Smile Again” (1995)\n\n\tAn outtake from “Brown Sugar” and a rare unreleased D’Angelo original, this song — which premiered on the soundtrack of the 1996 blockbuster “Space Jam” film — only saw the light of day because, according to Questlove, the film’s producers blanched at the song they originally submitted: an early version of “Playa Playa,” which was finally released on “Voodoo” nearly four years later (which gives a sense of how long “Voodoo” was in the oven). The song fits in perfectly with “Brown Sugar” and would slot nicely between sides one and two.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t“Can’t Hide Love” (live 1995)\n\n\t“Live at the Jazz Cafe” was such a low-key release that many people don’t know it existed before it was re-released in 2014, to capitalize on the excitement around “Black Messiah.” The album was originally an EP, then re-released in Japan with a bonus cut, and finally the full set, nearly 20 years after it was recorded. But this set, captured live shortly after the release of D’Angelo’s debut, captures him in full flight as a 21-year-old, with his paramour at the time, the late Angie Stone, delivering stellar backing vocals. The album includes three covers — his take on Smokey Robinson’s “Cruisin’,” also featured on “Brown Sugar”; the Ohio Players’ “Heaven Must Be Like This,” only on the Japanese version; and finally this faithful but stunning take on Earth Wind & Fire’s classic “Can’t Hide Love.”\n\n\n\n\n\t“Heaven Must Be Like This” (live 1995)\n\n\tAnother “Jazz Café” track, this Ohio Players over was originally relegated to the Japanese version of the EP and is curiously not available on the otherwise-full version of the album or Spotify, suggesting that D’Angelo himself was unhappy with the track. It’s hard to understand why he would be: It’s a beautifully sung version, featuring raindrop-like electric piano, a full horn section and some gorgeous backing vocals from Stone.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Me and Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine” Def Squad remix / DJ Premier remix (1996)\n\n\tThe one full collaboration between D’Angelo and the great DJ Premier, “Devil’s Pie” (originally released on the “Best Man” soundtrack two years before it appeared on “Voodoo”) was enough to have fans thirsting in vain for more. But lurking deep in the crates on vintage EMI Records 12” singles are some remixes from D’s first album, including ten different mixes of one of his all-time great love songs, “Me and Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine” (guess they had bigger budgets back then). It’s an embarrassment of riches, but the two winners are the DJ Premier remix and the even more innovative “Def Squad Remix,” featuring Erick Sermon and Redman.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Your Precious Love” with Erykah Badu (1996)\n\n\tThis cover of the Marvin Gaye-Tammi Terrell duet, featured on the “High School High” soundtrack, was recorded well before these two stellar singers became neo-soul icons. It sticks closely to the original arrangement, but the two deliver the song — a classic from the Ashford and Simpson catalog — with the reverence it deserves.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Girl You Need a Change of Mind” (1996)\n\n\tAnother cover, this one by original Temptations member Eddie Kendricks, from his second solo album. This is the classic-soul D’Angelo that fans jonesed for, complete with string stabs at the end and stellar falsetto. It’s of a piece with “Brown Sugar” but already anticipating the hard funk of “Voodoo” — from Spike Lee’s 1996 film “Get on the Bus” about a group of Black men traveling cross-country to participate in the Million Man March.\n\n\n\n\n\t“She’s Always in My Hair” (1997)\n\n\tIt’s a bit surprising that D’Angelo didn’t record more Prince covers, given the vast influence and his reverence for the man, and it figures that when he did, he’d dig deep into the crates. This psychedelicized track — the 1985 B-side of “Raspberry Beret,” fact fans — is one of the best of Prince’s many non-LP tracks, and was often performed live during D’Angelo’s “Brothers in Arms” jams with Questlove.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Everybody Loves the Sunshine” (1999)\n\n\tThe great jazz musician Roy Ayers should be renowned far beyond jazz circles, yet this is probably his most well-known song. Released as the B-side of the European CD single of “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” the song is perhaps deservedly obscure (and apologies for including it in an article with the word “classic” in the headline — hopefully we make up for it with the bonus cut below), as D’Angelo and Questlove are just jamming tentatively on the track. However, it’s the Brothers in Arms covering Roy Ayers.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t“Glass Mountain Trust” with Mark Ronson (2010)\n\n\tThis bizarre track from Ronson’s oddly obscure third solo album “Record Collection” may be the deepest cut here: The album doesn’t come up in Ronson’s Spotify discography (it’s credited to “Mark Ronson and the Business Intl”) and is one of the strangest songs in both of their catalogs. Led by blaring ‘80s synthesizers and a pounding beat, the song features a distorted lead vocal from D’Angelo, who accompanies himself on multitracked backing vocals with the occasional soul shriek thrown in for good measure.\n\n\n\n\n\tQuestlove and D’Angelo SuperJam (live at Bonnaroo Festival, 2012)\n\n\tThe “Brothers in Arms” played several public jams on classic R&B covers during this era, at least two of which (witnessed by this writer) were a bit disorganized and shambolic. However, for this set at Bonnaroo, they delivered the goods: With a directive not to play any D’Angelo or Roots songs, they were accompanied by a stellar hybrid band featuring stellar bassist Pino Palladino, members of the Roots, D’Angelo’s Vanguard and even longtime Prince saxophonist Eric Leeds, and tore up covers of songs by the Funkadelic, the Ohio Players, Jimi Hendrix, Sly & the Family Stone, Prince (of course), the Time and even Led Zeppelin and the Beatles. Highlights are featured in this multi-part mini-documentary about the set. \n\n\n\n\n\tBONUS:\n\n\t“Nothing Even Matters” with Lauryn Hill (1998)\n\n\tIt’s absurd to call a song from one of the top-selling albums in history a “deep cut,” yet this soulful duet is tucked away as track 12 on “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” and is often overlooked. The two harmonize beautifully, freestyling over the song’s last couple of minutes, underpinned by D’Angelo’s unmistakable electric piano embellishments.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s fitting that Michael Mann should be honored at the Lumière Festival in Lyon, since the director of “Ali,” “Heat” and “The Insider” began his filmmaking career in France. After graduating from the London Film School in 1967, Mann — who grew up in Chicago and switched course from a literature degree to filmmaking after seeing Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” — was dead-set on directing dramatic features.\n\n\tIn the meantime, he found his way to Paris, documenting the student uprisings of 1968 as they happened. Mann adopted the protestors’ slogan, “Prenez une caméra et descendez dans la rue” (or “pick up a camera and take to the streets”), achieving what the American networks could not: He talked student leaders Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Alain Geismar and Alain Krivine into granting him interviews, edited into a segment called “Insurrection” and broadcast on NBC. Mann subsequently reshaped that footage into an abstract 8-minute short film (“Jaunpuri”), which screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1971.\n\t\n\n\tSkip forward 10 years, and Mann was invited to world premiere his first theatrical movie, “Thief,” in competition at Cannes — quite an honor for a helmer so early in his career. “At that time, ‘The Jericho Mile,’ which is the Movie of the Week I did before ‘Thief,’ got theatrical distribution and was playing on the Champs-Élysées down the street from ‘Thief,’” Mann explains. “It was completely bizarre, particularly in those years when you couldn’t make a movie on an iPhone, after a decade or more of trying to get a film made, to have two of them [released] at the same time.”\n\t\n\n\tHosted by Cannes chief Thierry Frémaux, the Festival Lumière will screen all 12 of Mann’s theatrical features this week, before presenting him with the Lumière Award, following a master class on Friday, Oct. 17. The retrospective will also include his pilot for the Max series “Tokyo Vice” — the apotheosis of where Mann’s elevated aesthetic and commitment to authenticity intersect — and “The Jericho Mile,” a sports movie shot inside Folsom Prison featuring real inmates as extras.\n\n\t“Human intelligence does not diminish when you confine a geographical space. If anything, the opposite happens,” says Mann, who was impressed by the prisoners’ interest in the craft. The director remembers one who asked him questions for half an hour, by the end of which he understood the principles of blocking and coverage.\n\n\tThe production arranged for several inmates to get Taft-Hartley permits, Mann explains, “which meant they got SAG minimum, on their commissary as opposed to making, you know, three cents an hour stamping license plates or something.” The one condition: There couldn’t be a race war between Folsom’s three gangs — the Black Guerrilla Family, the Bluebirds (a precursor to the white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood) and “La eMe,” Mexican Mafia — or the warden would pull the plug.\n\n\tThree minutes into the movie, a member of the Black Brotherhood tells a journalist, “Everything’s for real. That’s our motto,” and while that isn’t exactly Mann’s mantra, the sentiment certainly aligns with his commitment to authenticity.\n\n\t“The real is where I go. That’s where richness is for me: in real people, real circumstances, real trials and emotional tidal waves that happen to people,” Mann says. That applies whether he’s telling contemporary stories such as “The Jericho Mile” and “The Insider” or adapting a work of historical fiction, à la “The Last of the Mohicans.”\n\n\tFor that film — a pre-revolutionary American epic starring Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe — Mann not only insisted on period-accurate set dressing and wardrobe, but also endeavored to channel the psychology of the time: What a young woman growing up in London’s updwardly mobile Portman Square neighborhood in 1757, would have thought, what kind of music she might have listened to (the answer: Handel) and so on.\n\t\n\n\t“The Insider” was inspired by Mann’s friendship with Lowell Bergman, the “60 Minutes” producer (so ferociously embodied by Al Pacino) whose bombshell segment featuring a Big Tobacco whistle-blower spooked the upper ranks of CBS. Mann had been talking to Bergman about other projects when the network self-censored his interview with Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe in “The Insider”), giving him personal insight into a big-business scandal.\n\n\t“Whether I’m doing ‘Manhunter’ or ‘Heat 2’ or ‘The Insider,’ it’s the deep dive into real people … what it felt to be in their shoes and look through their eyes,” Mann says. “That’s what occupies me in the writing or the preparatory stage of it, and that’s where I find things that you cannot make up.”\n\n\tIn the case of “Manhunter,” Mann had been in contact with a convicted killer named Dennis Wayne Wallace, around whom he was trying to write an original screenplay, when he read Thomas Harris’ “Red Dragon.” The novel presented Mann with a plot in which to place his character, overwriting Harris’ ideas for “the Tooth Fairy” serial killer Francis Dollarhyde with details that interested Mann about Wallace, who had a fantasy relationship with a woman.\n\n\tWallace had told Mann that their love song (in the killer’s imagination, at least) was “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” which is why the director used that music over the end credits. More important still was Dollarhyde’s dark humor, also drawn from Mann’s correspondence with someone who had truly been capable of such crimes. “Just because something’s real doesn’t mean you have to use it,” Mann clarifies. The director, who defined the ultra-stylized ’80s look of “Miami Vice” and brought a similarly heightened aesthetic to “Manhunter,” famously fills entire notebooks with the research and background material that go into preparing each project.\n\n\tIn “Thief,” he cast John Santucci, the thief on whom James Caan’s title character was based, as a corrupt cop. But his commitment to authenticity went one step further: “All the props in ‘Thief’ weren’t props. They were all his burglary tools,” Mann says. The thermal lance Caan uses to penetrate the safe was Santucci’s own burning bar. Other facets, like problems the characters had with wives and kids came from Mann’s interviewing Santucci and immersing himself in the man’s life. (Mann helped him get a SAG card and made him a series regular on his series “Crime Story” in the late ’80s.)\n\t\n\n\tIn studying both criminals and law enforcement officers over the years, Mann has repeatedly been fascinated by both the complexities and contradictions in their personalities. “I’ve interacted with some spectacular people in law enforcement who do things that are quite incredible and so complicated, they could be CEOs of major Fortune 500 companies, and nobody will know because they’re taking down Khun Sa, who was responsible for producing 65% of the world’s heroin.”\n\n\tMann invites interactions with anyone who could potentially be a character, adapting their life experience into details for his movies. Perhaps the most impactful example is Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson, whose experience informed aspects of Mann’s spectacular 1995 crime film “Heat.” Adamson once told Mann about how he’d sat down to coffee with Neil McCauley, a highline professional thief he later killed in a shootout — the basis of a dramatic tête-à-tête between Pacino and Robert De Niro in what has arguably become the director’s most iconic scene.\n\n\tAccording to Mann, Adamson highly respected his quarry. “When he met him, he realized they had a kind of unique rapport. He really liked this guy, and at the same time, as he put it, he’d blow him out of his socks without thinking twice about it.” Mann appreciated that paradox and understood why McCauley might agree to meet with Adamson at the Belden Deli on Clark St. in Chicago. It was a way for both men to assess one another, since they understood — as the audience does in “Heat” — that they were on a collision course where only one would walk away alive.\n\n\tI’m partial to the terse, reality-based psychology of “The Insider” and “Thief,” and the sleek, darker-than-noir elegance of “Collateral.” Still, “Heat” is Mann’s most elaborate film — in terms of both logistics and the sheer breadth of its ensemble — and the one many consider to be his masterpiece. In making it, Mann issued a challenge to himself: Could he construct a vast panoply of three-dimensional people (where even the most minor supporting characters have fully imagined lives) and program a meticulously precise structure that brings everything to that explosive collision?\n\n\tNo wonder it’s the only sequel he intends to make. The way Mann works, his characters are so fully realized that their lives seem to continue even when the cameras aren’t rolling. It’s only a matter of time before they do on “Heat 2” (which picks up right after the original with Val Kilmer’s character, Chris Shiherlis, a role Leonardo DiCaprio has reportedly been considering). The novel’s been published, and the notebook is being prepared. Because when Mann calls “action,” he means it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMorris Chapdelaine always has a daunting stack of scripts on his desk. As an indie producer, he reads about three a week and farms out the rest to interns and film students, who send back detailed coverage reports. But he struggles to get through them all.\n\n\tAt a film festival, some friends suggested he investigate artificial intelligence to help with his workload. “I was a little arm’s length with anything AI-related,” he says. “Some of it scares me.”\n\t\n\n\tBut Chapdelaine did some research and eventually signed up for Greenlight Coverage, which uses large language models to summarize scripts and grade elements like plot, character arcs, pacing and dialogue on a scale of 1 to 10. It even gives a verdict: Pass, consider or recommend.\n\n\n\tHe found the AI more honest than human feedback — even his own — while it doubled his reading pace.\n\n\t“It’s such a time saver,” he says. “And it’s getting better and better.”\n\n\tIf AI does anything well, it’s summarizing written material. So of all the jobs in the development pipeline, the most vulnerable may be the very first: the script reader. The industry’s initial gatekeeper could someday be a software program.\n\n\tIn fact, machines are already playing a role. At WME, agents and assistants use ScriptSense, another AI platform, to sort through submissions and keep track of clients’ work. Aspiring screenwriters are also turning to AI tools like ScreenplayIQ and Greenlight to provide feedback (sometimes too flattering) on their drafts.\n\n\tAt the major studios, human story analysts still dig through piles of submissions much as they’ve done for 100 years. But as AI creeps into everyone’s workflow, they worry about their jobs.\n\t\n\n\tJason Hallock, a story analyst at Paramount, recalls his first unsettling experiments with ChatGPT, the bot that launched the current AI frenzy. “How quickly am I going to be replaced?” he wondered. “Is it six weeks? Or six months?”\n\n\tWorking with the Editors Guild, which represents about 100 unionized story analysts, he decided to find out. Earlier this year, he set up an experiment. He would ask AI tools to cover some scripts, then stack up their reports against coverage generated by humans. It was a test to see if he and his colleagues could compete.\n\n\tSince the dawn of Hollywood, story analysts have been its threshing machines, separating the wheat from the chaff. AI proponents argue that algorithms can make that process more efficient, more objective and thus more fair, allowing new voices to be heard instead of relying on readers who bring their own subjective tastes to their job.\n\n\tBut something could also be lost. A human reader is the first to sense whether a script has potential, whether the characters are engaging and whether the story sweeps you up and has something new to say. Can AI do that?\n\n\t“The most important thing I’m looking for is ‘Do I care?'” says Holly Sklar, a longtime story analyst at Warner Bros. “An LLM can’t care.”\n\n\tYet AI seems to be coming regardless. So rather than ignore it, some are trying to understand it. \n\n\t“Nobody wants to lose their job,” says Alegre Rodriquez, an Editors Guild analyst who participated in Hallock’s study. “We’re not sticking our head in the ground pretending it doesn’t exist, and we’re not cowering waiting for them to give us a pink slip. I think people are dusting themselves off and saying, ‘How do I stay in this game?'”\n\n\tKartik Hosanagar is a Wharton business professor and an internet marketing entrepreneur. He’s also a film enthusiast with a couple scripts in his drawer — a drama about a startup and a thriller about a murdered Indian diplomat. As a Hollywood outsider, he struggled to sell his screenplays. That led him to develop an algorithm to level the playing field by assessing talent objectively. That venture didn’t pan out, but the next one did: Hosanagar developed ScriptSense, now one of the buzzier AI script platforms. The pitch: “Evaluate 100x the screenplays.”\n\t\n\n\t“There’s a huge unread pile,” Hosanagar says. “This is a great way to clear the pile and figure out where to focus your attention.”\n\n\tIn March, Hosanagar sold his company to Cinelytic, a service provider that is integrating ScriptSense into a suite of management tools. “It’s about saving time,” says Tobias Queisser, the company’s CEO. “Opportunities get left aside because there’s not enough capacity to look at all the stuff. Unknown writers never get a chance because their script is not submitted by a top agency.”\n\n\tScriptSense provides summaries, character breakdowns, comps and casting suggestions. The tone is relatively neutral. It doesn’t offer praise or criticism.\n\n\t“Our design philosophy was that we’re not going to make the decision for you,” Hosanagar says. “You will never see a statement where it says ‘Amazing!’ or ‘Reject it.'”\n\n\tThe platforms geared toward screenwriters have a different philosophy. Jack Zhang, the founder of Greenlight, believes in the power of AI to make critical judgments. “What AI really does well is being the average of things,” he says. “In terms of feedback, you are trying to reach a wide audience. You want the average person to like your work. That’s where AI really shines.”\n\n\tScreenplayIQ offers qualitative assessments but not numerical scores. The program summarizes plots and evaluates characters’ “growth” and “depth,” helping writers see their work from an outside perspective. “Our objective is to support writers where they feel they’re struggling and want support,” says developer Guy Goldstein. “It’s holding a mirror up to your script. You wrote it with an intention; it’s seeing if that intention came through.”\n\n\tTo test the AI platforms, Hallock needed scripts. Screenwriters can be sensitive about feeding their material into AI models, as they assume it will be used for training. But a close friend was willing to provide some old screenplays for the cause. One was an unproduced script for the Syfy channel about a killer insect. Another was pitched as “‘Heart of Darkness’ in outer space.” The author didn’t mind if AI trained on that. \n\n\t“He said he hoped it would make the AI dumber,” Hallock says.\n\n\tHe gathered a few others and gave them all to human analysts. He then compared their coverage with the loglines, synopses and notes produced by six AI platforms. The results were both encouraging and unnerving. \n\t\n\n\tThe AI-generated loglines were indistinguishable from the human ones — maybe even a little better. The differences began to show with the AI-generated synopses. “They tend to have 11th-grade-essay quality,” Hallock says. “It uses the same kinds of constructions, like ‘Our story begins with…'”\n\n\tThe more complicated the script, the more likely AI was to get things wrong — to misattribute the action of one character to another and to hallucinate plot points.\n\n\tThe humans won hands down when it came to notes, which require actual analysis rather than just distillation. The AI programs were “an almost total fail across the board,” Hallock says.\n\n\tThe “‘Heart of Darkness’ in space” script got a “recommend” though it had made the rounds in Hollywood 20 years ago and didn’t sell. That was a consistent issue. Instead of offering unvarnished criticism, Rodriquez says, the models were “biased towards the writer.”\n\n\t“They would definitely tell you everything that was positive and working well,” she says. “But when you had to get down to problems, they couldn’t necessarily identify them.”\n\n\tIn some cases, AI programs weren’t evaluating; they were cheerleading.\n\n\t“It’s got that puppy-dog quality,” Hallock says. “It wants to please you.”\n\n\tOne romantic comedy was praised by AI as “a compelling, well-crafted coming-of-age story balancing humor, heartbreak, and bittersweet realities of navigating one’s thirties. Strong character development makes this a standout work.”\n\n\tThe human reader, meanwhile, was underwhelmed: “Familiar template of female friends in Las Vegas. Potential as light streaming content, especially with Sydney Sweeney. Bawdy language, but jokes don’t land hard; lacks bite of ‘Girls Trip’ or ‘Bridesmaids.'”\n\n\tZhang defends Greenlight’s taste, saying that only 5% of the scripts submitted to the platform get a “recommend.” “That’s very few,” he says. “I wouldn’t say there’s huge inflation.”\n\n\tHosanagar says ScriptSense doesn’t make recommendations in part because AI can be too sycophantic. “Can AI get to a point where it can be truly critical?” he asks. “I think it can get there. We’re not there yet.”\n\n\tMany of the analysts were heartened by the study, Rodriquez says. AI might be faster, but it can’t pluck something original and brilliant out of the pile.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s still going to require a human being to look at those reports and review material,” she says. “It doesn’t save as much time as they think it does.” \n\n\tAnd those who over-rely on it might miss out on something great. But the study was not entirely reassuring, concluding, “Studios may be tempted to forgo quality and accuracy in favor of cheap and fast.”\n\n\tThe makers of the AI models say those fears are misplaced. “It’s not about taking away jobs,” Queisser says. “We see it as an enhancement for humans.”\n\n\tChris Giliberti, CEO of Avail, says story analysts are already using his AI platform to do routine tasks, which frees up time to undertake more challenging analytical work. “It’s unstoppable,” he says. “The cat’s out of the bag. This is making people’s jobs and lives easier.”\n\n\tSklar, however, worries about where this is headed. Today’s executives value human input. But a younger generation may be coming up that is more comfortable with AI summaries. She fears that some in Hollywood — “the cost-slashing folks who don’t understand all of what we do” — will come to view her role as superfluous.\n\n\t“That’s what keeps me up at night,” she says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Candy’s son, Chris, said during a recent event promoting the new documentary “John Candy: I Like Me” (via People) that it was “heart-wrenching” to see resurfaced press interviews in the film where journalists openly mocked Candy’s weight to his face.\n\n\t“I was kind of shocked to see how interviewers treat him,” Chris said. “That was just kind of heart-wrenching. And I also could see how he got more frustrated and he found ways to deal with that… I learned through the process of this [documentary] that he was so nervous about eating in front of people because of paparazzi. He developed a poor eating habit where he’d be like, ‘Alright, well I’m not going to eat all day. I’m going to eat at night.’”\n\t\n\n\tChris continued, “When I hear stories like that I just felt so bad for him because it’s like, ‘How cornered are you?’ And you really want in those moments, as his son or as his friend, to be able to grab him by his shoulders and say, ‘Why the fuck do you have to do this? Just who cares? Have a sandwich and get mad about it.’”\n\n\n\t“John Candy: I Like Me” hails from director Colin Hanks and producer Ryan Reynolds. The movie, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival before making its streaming debut Oct. 10 on Amazon Prime Video, contains many examples of interviewers essentially calling Candy “fat” to his face during press junkets. \n\n\t“You look at interview after interview and horrible things are being said and questions are being asked in incredibly insensitive ways,” Hanks told Variety before the film’s TIFF premiere. “It’s tough to see how uncomfortable John was in almost every clip. And he had good reason, because some of the things that people said were disgusting and would not be tolerated today.”\n\t\n\n\tReynolds revealed during a Q&A at TIFF that he personally called one of the journalists who mocked Candy‘s weight after seeing archival footage of the insulting incident while working on the documentary as a producer.\n\n\t“There was a lot of things we left out of the documentary, journalists just saying stuff. One of them I called,” Reynolds said about the journalist who was caught on camera making inflammatory comments about Candy’s weight. “I didn’t put it in the movie, but I called this journalist just to see.”\n\n\t“I wasn’t trying to shame him or teach him a lesson,” Reynolds continued. “[I told him] I took it out of the movie, but I’d put it in the movie if you wanted to talk about it, because maybe you have something to say about it, about your journey whenever it comes to something like that. We had such a thoughtful conversation about it.”\n\n\t“John Candy: I Like Me” includes interviews with dozens of the late comedian’s former co-stars, including Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Catherine O’Hara. The movie is now streaming on Prime Video.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Motion Picture Association, the trade group that represents major Hollywood studios, apparently didn’t get a heads up that Meta‘s Instagram was going to borrow the MPA’s PG-13 ratings framework for its new teen settings in the app.\n\n\t“The Motion Picture Association was not contacted by Meta prior to the announcement of its new content moderation tool for Instagram Teen Accounts,” MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin said in a statement. “We welcome efforts to protect kids from content that may not be appropriate for them, but assertions that Instagram’s new tool will be ‘guided by PG-13 movie ratings’ or have any connection to the film industry’s rating system are inaccurate.”\n\t\n\n\tA rep for Instagram did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\tEarlier Tuesday, Instagram announced that it was revamping its Teen Accounts to be “guided” by the MPA’s PG-13 movie rating. What that means, according to Instagram, is that users of teen accounts (supervised by a parent) will be restricted to seeing content that contains the level of nudity, sexual expression, profanity, drug use, violence and other adult-oriented themes that they they would expect to see in a PG-13 movie.\n\n\tThe MPA (formerly the Motion Picture Association of America) introduced its film-ratings system in November 1968 under then-chairman Jack Valenti. Since then, the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA) has operated the voluntary film-rating system with a Ratings Board comprised of parents who must have a child between the ages of 5 and 15 when they first join (and who can serve up to seven years or until their youngest child turns 21). The Ratings Board watches every movie in its entirety and assigns it a rating and descriptor that aligns with the views of the majority of American parents. Over 90% of parents say CARA’s film ratings help them make better viewing choices for their families, according to the MPA.\n\t\n\n\tMPA member studios are Netflix, Paramount Pictures, Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, Sony Pictures, Universal Studios, Walt Disney Studios and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKirsten Storms offered “General Hospital” fans an update on her health Monday evening, sharing that she is scheduled for a surgical coiling procedure “sometime in the next two weeks” to address a brain aneurysm that her doctors discovered in a January scan.\n\n\tIn a statement on social media, the longtime soap actress, who has been featured on “General Hospital” for 20 years, wrote that the discovery “majorly freaked” her out. She added that she “wanted to post this because even though my brain seems to be sorta lowkey rebelling against me, it does allow me to understand that we’ve all got times when things aren’t great. If we can, we will do our best to do what is best for ourselves and loved ones.” \n\t\n\n\tPer the Mayo Clinic, a coiling procedure involves “feeding a soft, flexible wire into the aneurysm via a catheter. The wire coils inside the aneurysm and seals off the aneurysm from the artery.” The surgery is done as a preventative to keep the aneurysm from rupturing. \n\n\n\tStorms also addressed a false online rumor that Storms had been hospitalized in January because she “tried to ‘unalive'” herself, when she was actually meeting with her neurosurgeon for a brain scan to monitor a cyst. “I couldn’t understand why a person would make up something that terrible, when they had no idea why I was really there,” she wrote. “There are a few really bad apples out there”\n\n\tStorms took a hiatus from “General Hospital” to move from Los Angeles to Tennessee in July, with her role of Maxie being temporarily played by Nicole Paggi.\n\n\t“Since the January scan showed a new, but *very small*, squatter (aka cyst) on my brain stem – it was clear I needed [to] change some things in my life asap,” Storms wrote in her most recent post. “For my own personal reasons, no longer living in Los Angeles was very important to me. The biggest reason for the move was [my daughter] Harper, but a lot of it was for my physical and mental health.” \n\t\n\n\tStorms previously underwent a craniotomy in 2021 for the removal of noncancerous cysts from her brain.\n\n\tStorms has since returned to “General Hospital” in pre-taped scenes, but she remains on leave from the long-running series. In prior social posts, the actress has floated that she could be “back in December, maybe November.” She first joined the soap in May 2005. \n",

    "body": "\n\tUniversal Music Publishing Group has inked the Marías to an exclusive, worldwide music publishing agreement. \n\n\tKnown for their fusion of alternative, psychedelic rock, jazz and Latin, the Latin Grammy-nominated band is comprised of Atlanta-raised María Zardoya, Los Angeles native Josh Conway, Jesse Perlman on guitar and Edward James on keys.\n\n\tZardoya said, “We’re thrilled to sign with Jen and Ana Rosa at Universal Music Publishing. Having spent some time with them alongside Jody Gerson, we trust they’re the perfect partners to guide us through the next phase of our collective and individual writing career(s).”\n\t\n\n\tMost recently, Zardoya released her debut solo album under the moniker Not for Radio entitled “Melt.” Beyond their own records, the Marías have also collaborated with Bad Bunny, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco, and toured with Billie Eilish on her sold-out arena run.\n\n\tUMPG’s Jennifer Knoepfle, executive vice president and head of U.S., and Ana Rosa Santiago, senior VP of Latin music, said, “It’s so exciting to work with a band like the Marías who are so clear and singular in their vision. They have cultivated a devoted audience over the last several years and are now on the cusp of the global stage. We could not be more ecstatic to partner with them at such an exciting time.”\n\n\t+ Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Chappell Roan, Dina LaPolt, Larry Mestel and Girls Make Beats were recognized by the Songwriters of North America (SONA) at the Warrior Awards on Oct. 12 in Los Angeles. \n\n\tSONA additionally awarded Toby Lightman with the 2025 Emerging Songwriter Warrior Award, presented by YouTube Songwriters.

    "body": "\n\tLaurie Metcalf’s four decades-long acting career spans comedy and drama across television, film and stage. However there’s one dream she has yet to fulfill.\n\n\t“I’ve always wanted to do a musical,” Metcalf tells me. “But my range of notes is only about seven notes. It would have to be an extremely specific part. I don’t know if that would ever be in my future, but I think it would be such a rush to be in a musical.\n\n\n\t“I’m going to start manifesting it,” she adds with a laugh.\n\t\n\n\tMetcalf is currently on Broadway in the preview run of Samuel D. Hunter’s “Little Bear Ridge Road,” a family drama about a woman (Metcalf) who reunites with her estranged nephew (Micah Stock). Opening Oct. 30 at the Booth Theatre, the play marks Metcalf’s seventh collaboration with director Joe Mantello.\n\n\t“I’m a little tired, but this is my favorite place to be,” Metcalf, who earned Tonys in 2017 and 2018 for her work in “A Doll’s House, Part 2” and “Three Tall Women,” tells me over the phone on a recent Friday afternoon. “We have two previews under our belt and I’m going in for notes this afternoon. We’re fine-tuning things. This is my happy spot.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLaurie Metcalf and Micah Stock in “Little Bear Ridge Road.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto: Julieta Cervantes\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Little Bear Ridge Road” comes on the heels of the release of “Monster: The Ed Gein Story,” the Netflix series starring Charlie Hunnam as serial killer Ed Gein’s and Metcalf as his domineering and religious fanatic mother Augusta Gein. After co-creators Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan pitched her the project, “I agreed to do it without even having seen a script,” Metcalf recalls.\n\t\n\n\tThis latest installment of Murphy’s “Monster” franchise focuses on Ed’s relationship with his mother and how her abusive actions may have contributed to his horrifying killing spree in the mid-1950s. “It’s nature versus nurture, right?” Metcalf says. “I think it’s both cases for him.”\n\n\tOne of the series’ most powerful and disturbing scenes shows Augusta scolding a grown-up Ed as he stands in front of her completely naked. “I’m sitting in that chair looking at a grown man, but I’m lecturing him like he was seven years old,” Metcalf explains. “I’m not seeing him as a grown man, but seeing him still under my care and under my sick supervision. It’s a mother-son teaching experience. It’s simplistic, but warped. But mentally, it was helpful to see him like that.”\n\n\tMetcalf gives high praise to director Max Winkler. “Despite the subject matter and the tone of the series, the shooting space was really fun,” she says. “It’s hard to picture that sort of work being fun, but it was because it was very collaborative. Max is so open to accidents that might happen in the scene. He would feed me things in between takes that we could do. Some he used, some he didn’t. I really liked working that way. The job itself was a wonderful set to be on, despite how dark it is.”\n\n\tAfter filming “Monster” and a week before heading back to Broadway, Metcalf wrapped her next television project, Dan Levy and Rachel Sennott’s eight-episode Netflix mob comedy “Big Mistakes” about two siblings (Levy and Taylor Ortega) who are caught up in organized crime. Metcalf plays their mother. \n\n\t“I read the pilot, and then I wrote my agent immediately saying, ‘100% want to do this,’” says Metcalf, who earned three Emmys for her work on “Roseanne” and another for a guest spot on “Hacks.” “I saw how unique it was for a single camera, half-hour comedy.”\n\n\tI tell Metcalf that I grew up in a mob neighborhood in Queens, NY. “You’re gonna like this,” she says. “It’s very, very funny and very unexpected. I don’t think the audience ever gets out ahead of where it’s going.”\n\n",

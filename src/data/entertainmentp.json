    "body": "\n\tCharter Communications has launched its first App Store as part of a big push to promote its broadband and video services as offering not just cable channels but easy access to an array of streaming platforms. \n\n\tWith its “Seamless Entertainment” campaign, fronted by Tracy Morgan in a series of cheeky spots, Charter aims to position itself much as Amazon Prime Video and Roku do with subscribers as being their portal to subscriptions to Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+ et al. \n\t\n\n\tCharter hosted an event Oct. 9 in Manhattan as part of Advertising Week to show off the new features and positioning of its pitch to customers. The goal is to convince consumers that Charter can be one-stop shopping for the strong broadband service required to watch all those bandwidth-hungry streamers. It is also looking to explain the complicated concept that Charter customers who subscribe to traditional TV packages at present also have access via authentication to key streaming apps. That includes the ESPN app that Disney launched in August.\n\n\n\tThe ESPN streamer features as a vast amount of games and shows that do not run on linear ESPN. But anyone who pays for linear ESPN via a traditional Charter cable package is able to access the streaming app at no extra charge. The problem for Charter and ESPN is, most traditional cable consumers aren’t aware of this.\n\n\tThe landscape of how TV packages are bought and sold has changed immeasurably in the last 15 years, since Netflix revved up its streaming menu with acquired and original series. Charter’s push is part of a gradual industry shift back toward bundled packages of entertainment from multiple programming sources. Cable operators such as Charter and its biggest rival, Comcast, are working to fix the customer service mistakes of the past in order to sell themselves as the best value option for consumers. \n\t\n\n\tChris Winfrey, president and CEO of Charter, sees the App Store as being a funnel for bringing consumers to a more expansive Charter-provided video and broadband package, once they realize the cost of paying for streaming apps a la carte. In every way, the pay TV business is moving back toward bundling.\n\n\t“We have a distribution platform that’s much larger than our video subscribers, because the broadband connectivity service that we provide that provides a couple of things. One is the ability to think about the video business a little differently. But also, we have 30 million broadband customers, a majority of which don’t have video anymore, and that gives us an opportunity to go sell a la carte. To the much broader base of broadband customers, we will be selling AMC+, ESPN, Paramount+ and HBO Max,” Winfrey said. “Whatever the customer wants to have, we can provide it in that video app store, and maybe, ideally, one day they say, look, it’s adding up to a lot of money. For $100 I could get video included as part of that.”\n\n\tAt the Spectrum event, Winfrey was pressed during a Q&A with CNBC reporter Alex Sherman about the miscalculations over the past decade and a half that led U.S. cable operations to lose some 35% of their customers. Winfrey, a 15-year Charter veteran who was upped to CEO in December 2022, pointed to the sea change in Hollywood’s content licensing strategies as streaming platforms came along with big budgets for acquired and original series. It happened gradually, but it hurt both programmers and distributors in the long run.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCNBC’s Alex Sherman, Charter’s Chris Winfrey, AMC Networks’ Kristin Dolan and ESPN’s Jimmy Pitaro\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The idea that you could sell content that was unprotected from an authentication standpoint, with no advertising, with no brand, [and thinking] that was going to be incremental subscribers was a bigmistake,” Winfrey said. “And once that happened, and you started to bring entities that for long periods of time could sell your content at a discounted rate and have a loss for a long period of time, the cat was out of the bag.” Winfrey noted that Disney et al “started to naturally chase the direct to consumer, reclaim back the content.” And the fact that Netflix was a darling of Wall Street encouraged the spending boom that has also up-ended Hollywood. \n\t\n\n\tCable still has an image problem, Winfrey acknowledged, but now they’re the ones drawing more heat from investors because their broadband service remains fundamental to residential and business customers. In essence, Hollywood has learned the benefits of distribution partnerships versus going it alone with direct-to-consumer divisions that racked up enormous startup costs.\n\n\t“And now we look pretty good, because we can put it back together in a way that I think is good for the consumer, actually does the best that we possibly can for the programmer’s profitability as well, and gets us the value utility,” Winfrey said.\n\n\tThe Charter presentation also emphasized enhancements made to the voice remote control service that Charter has developed in tandem with Comcast. Charter and Comcast are also partners in the Xumo Stream Box platform designed to make it easy for consumers to shift between linear and streaming platforms.\n\n\tAlso joining Winfrey at the event were ESPN chief Jimmy Pitaro and AMC Networks CEO Kristin Dolan. Both AMC and ESPN have worked closely with Charter in recent months to reach carriage deals that incorporate apps such as Disney+, Hulu and ESPN and the AMC+ premium drama service. Programmers have to bring streaming apps into the mix to bring value to cable distribution partners. The days of securing big automatic rate increases with every new cable carriage deal are long over.\n\n\tThe conversation among Winfrey, Dolan and Pitaro underscored how layered the pay TV marketplace has become with the introduction of more options including the rise of free streaming channels and apps. Whether small (AMC) or large (Disney), programmers need the support from MVPDs because the ability to bundle disparate services and content from multiple providers makes for a more compelling consumer offering.\n\n\t“There’s two different customers, a streaming-only, or broadband-only, customer that takes streaming products is one type of customer, and then somebody that still watches traditional linear for the mostpart. The Venn diagram is not as big as you would think,” Dolan said.\n\n\tPitaro praised the “seamless entertainment” initiative as the right approach at a moment of rebuilding for the TV eco-system. The end result of a tough negotiation that included a nearly two-week blackout of Disney channels on Charter in 2023 was a much closer working relationship between the two.\n\t\n\n\tEven as ESPN went standalone for the first time, “we also decided internally that we were going to remain committed to the pay TV environment, and the best way to demonstrate that commitment was by adding value once we launched,” Pitaro said. “We made all of the product enhancements within the ESPN app available to charter subscribers. So fire up the ESPN app, you authenticate it and and you have access to deeper personalization, all the interactive features that we now have within the app, like fed fantasy, stats integration, commerce integration, all that is available to the Charter subscriber. And so that’s our way of adding more value to that, to that environment.”\n\n\tHere’s one of the Tracy Morgan spots that aims to translate Spectrum’s pitch to consumers:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil – Ingrid Guimarães, one of the most popular comedic actors in Brazil, is pivoting from blockbuster comedies to drama with “Minha Criança Trans?” (“My Trans Child?” in literal translation). The project is currently in development, with production slated to begin in 2027. Guilherme Coelho and Mariana Ferraz will produce for Matizar Filmes, alongside Guimarães. \n\n\tVitrine Filmes, the major independent distributor behind “The Secret Agent,” will handle Brazilian distribution and co-invest in the project’s development.\n\t\n\n\tGuimarães has long been widely bankable in the South American country, and holds the record for the star with the largest national box office of the decade at just over R$23 million (US$4.2 million). The actor, who began her career on television, made a successful move to the big screen with hits such as the “Head Over Heels” franchise and “A Boyfriend For My Wife.” She is currently shooting the Amazon-set comedy “Pé no Chão” for Prime Video Brazil.\n\n\n\t“Minha Criança Trans?” will be written by Thamirys Nunes and based on her own experiences of raising a trans child. Nunes’ struggles to find appropriate support — legally and socially — leading her to create the eponymous NGO to help families facing similar issues while raising trans children. A work that blends personal memoir and social reflection, Nunes shares her experience as a mother discovering that her child is transgender, recounting a powerful journey of acceptance, learning, and family transformation.\n\n\tThe film marks a significant turning point in Guimarães’s career, as it is the first time she stars in a drama after over a decade of comedy hits. Speaking with Variety, the star says the story is a “powerful reminder that love transcends labels.” “Bringing it to the screen is both an artistic challenge and a deeply personal mission. It’s my first drama on screen, inspired by something so true, as it is the story of Thamirys.”\n\t\n\n\t“The film promises to offer a fresh and courageous cinematic perspective on gender identity and family, strengthening Brazil’s growing commitment to telling stories that matter,” she adds.\n\n\tVitrine Filmes director Letícia Friedrich says the company is proud to be “developing a film that will spark important conversations in Brazil and beyond.” “At Vitrine Filmes, we believe in the power of cinema to spark empathy and drive social change. ‘Minha Criança Trans?’ is a deeply moving story that speaks to the heart of contemporary society. We look forward to sharing it with audiences everywhere.”\n\n\tMatizar Filmes’s Coelho says it’s an “honor” to produce Guimarães’ landmark first dramatic role. “She will move audiences as a mother who, out of love, must reinvent herself,” with Ferraz adding: “The film explores motherhood, listening, and acceptance with sensitivity and strength, inviting viewers to follow an intimate and transformative journey. We’re thrilled to witness this encounter between a beloved actress and a story that calls for both delicacy and courage.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDean Norris and Stephen Dorff have joined the cast of “Elastic Hearts,” the U.S. feature debut from Danish writer-director Milad Schwartz Avaz, Forty Five Films has revealed. \n\n\tThe pair join previously announced leads Cole Sprouse (“Riverdale”) and Darby Lee-Stack (“The Holdovers”) in the intimate, character-driven drama set in contemporary America. Plot details remain under wraps, with Sprouse playing Oliver and Lee-Stack taking on the role of Allie. Principal photography is scheduled to wrap Oct. 12, following a Sept. 8 production start.\n\t\n\n\t“Making an indie film can feel like a steep climb on day one,” said Avaz. “With our high ambitions for ‘Elastic Hearts’ becoming a global film, bringing in Dean Norris and Stephen Dorff has turned that climb into momentum. They came for the script and are giving it everything.”\n\n\n\tAvaz previously described the project as “a deeply personal film about love and the choices that shape us.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker’s credits include the series “Alfa,” which screened at Berlinale, the critically acclaimed “While We Live” and “STHLM Blackout,” which marked the first Scandinavian Prime Original. Avaz was named one of Variety‘s Europeans to Watch in 2018.\n\n\tMisam Avaz produces for Forty Five Films, with Christoffer Jindyl serving as executive producer for Shotgun Productions. Behind the camera, director of photography Albert Salas, a Cannes Lions and Tribeca and Camerimage winner for “Obey,” is lensing the project, while Allan Funch (“If I Die Today”) handles editing duties. Tobias Kropp (“Fixer”) will compose the score, with Lindsey Weissmueller serving as casting director and Paul Merryman as line producer and UPM.\n\t\n\n\tPost-production is expected to wrap around New Year’s, with the picture ready by March 2026. The film will be submitted to leading 2026 festivals following completion.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil – Brussels-based company Best Friend Forever has acquired international rights to Priscilla Kellen’s animated feature “Papaya” following its world premiere at the Rio Film Festival earlier this week. Animation specialist label Gebeka Films acquired French distribution rights to the title, which will be released in the country next year.\n\n\t“Papaya” is Kellen’s feature debut following years of experience in the industry, including directing the TV-Series “Vivi Viravento” for Discovery Kids and working as the assistant director in Alê Abreu’s Oscar-nominated “The Boy and the World.” Abreu serves as the artistic supervisor in “Papaya,” a dialogue-free animation about a tiny papaya seed wandering through the Amazon forest. Passionate about flying, it must keep moving to avoid rooting. Through perseverance, the seed discovers the power of her roots, triggering a revolution that transforms her world and fulfills her dreams in an unexpected way.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking about the film, Kellen said the story was “born from a deep connection with nature and the idea of transformation.” “I wanted to tell a story about movement, growth, and the courage to take root. Having Best Friend Forever and Gebeka embracing the film gives me confidence that Papaya will reach hearts around the world.”\n\n\n\tMartin Gondre and Charles Bin from Best Friend Forever have called the animation “a beautiful ecological and universal tale about the cycle of life.” “Without dialogue, it creates its own very poetical musical language, with an explosion of colors. We love how it introduces young kids to the length of a feature film.”\n\t\n\n\tLetícia Friedrich, the film’s producer under her Boulevard Filmes banner, said she is “thrilled” to partner with Best Friend Forever and Gebeka Films. “This collaboration reinforces our belief in the universal strength of Brazilian animation and in stories that connect across cultures and ages. It’s a joy to see this delicate and powerful film finding its wings internationally.”\n\n\tBest Friend Forever’s 2025 fall line-up is headlined by Valentyn Vasyanovych’s TIFF Platform Winner “To The Victory!” and TIFF sci-fi title “Egghead Republic” by Pella Kågerman and Hugo Lilja. The company was launched in Cannes in 2019 and is a sister company of Paris based Indie Sales. The management is handled by Indie Sales former Head of Marketing & Festivals Martin Gondre & former entertainment lawyer Charles Bin, alongside Indie Sales’ co-founder Nicolas Eschbach.\n\n\t“Papaya” is produced by Letícia Friedrich of Boulevard Filmes, in co-production with Birdo Studio, Alê Abreu, and Priscilla Kellen. “Papaya” is a production from Boulevard Filmes. The film will be released in Brazil by Cajuína Audiovisual.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHot Lithuanian producer Marija Razgutė of M-Films, credited for the award-winning films “Slow” in Sundance 2023 and “The Visitor” in Karlovy Vary this year, has unveiled a teaser trailer of the absurdist drama “Hunger Strike Breakfast,” by Karolis Kaupinis. \n\n\tThe helmer’s sophomore pic after his signature debut “Nova Lituania,” Lithuania’s choice for the 2021 Oscars, is world premiering today in competition at the Warsaw Film Festival, ahead of its national roll out in January 2026 via CinemaAds.\n\t\n\n\tIn the clip, one of the characters, Sigitas Bickus (Paulius Pinigis), cites U.S. alternative food guru Paul Bragg’s book” The Miracle of Fasting,” saying that ‘hunger cures all ills’ to a small group of TV journalists, on the verge of embarking on a hunger strike to protest against the occupation of their TV building by Russian troops. As in “Nova Lituania,” the helmer twists real events and tense geo-politics to convey a deeply humanistic tale with warmth and humor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe film is inspired by a little-known protest during Lithuania’s independence struggle in 1991, when three TV employees launched a hunger strike to reclaim the national TV building from the Soviet army.\n\n\tIn the pic, we follow Lithuanian TV star Daiva (Ineta Stasiulytė) who loses her job when the TV studios are taken over by Russian soldiers. Together with a few colleagues-including her TV boss (Arvydas Dapšys) and a compassionate local dweller (Paulius Pinigis), Daiva starts a hunger strike in a small trailer facing the TV station. Beyond political motives, the group yearn for human warmth and connection.\n\t\n\n\tKaupinis, who came up with the characters after conducting multiple interviews with the real strikers says: “On the surface it was a political fight, but the motivation for it was long-surpressed feelings of loneliness, guilt, desire for something big, important, beautiful and warm.”\n\n\tHimself a former TV presenter and editor of a weekly program dedicated to current political affairs, the helmer explains that conversations at the time with elder TV colleagues about those events triggered his interest. “During the pandemia and Russian war in Ukraine, it felt like a proper metaphor for my own current Lithuanian society – a tiny makeshift trailer, people on hunger strike, aggressive enemy on one side and indifferent neighbors on the other side. \n\n\tTerrible loneliness in times of chaos and a hunger strike as an opportunity to get closer to people sharing a fellow fate.” Although he was only five years old in 1991, Kaupinis still has vivid memories of the temporarily occupation of the TV building in Vilnius which ended up with the death of 14 civilians. “These are my first visual memories. My family lived on the same street where the main Soviet army base, the so-called “Northern Town” (Šiaurės miestelis) was located. I used to watch the tanks manouvering inside the base from my friend’s appartment window on the fifth floor.”\n\n\tHe goes on: “I remember my father leaving to defend the Parliament, fear at home, my mother and grandparents in front of TV and the trembling voice of the presenter that “they are already inside the building.” Then TV going off-air. I also remember the next morning, when we went for groceries with my grandma and the sidewalks on the street were shattered due to the movement of tank columns. I asked her why the sidewalks are like that and she replied with “Russkies, kid. Russkies,” using a Lithuanian derogatory term for Russians.\n\n\tConnecting the constant threat from Russia during Lithuania’s struggle for independence with current times, Kaupinis says: “Lithuanians have to “resist by all means. And never let it happen again.”\n\n\tAn active political commentator at home, the helmer believes in a two-way resistance: “In our current situation [resisting] outside means military force and inside means black political technologies covering as political movements.”\n\t\n\n\t“At this very moment, Lithuanian cultural field is beginning this fight,” he observes. “A pro-Russian political project covering itself as an ethno-centrist populist party is torpedoing our democratic foundation and has just been assigned to rule the Ministry of Culture by the ruling coalition that thinks you can tame the Trojan horse by letting it inside the city. We treat it as a gravest mistake and will resist it by all means available!”\n\n\tGoing back to his movie, Kaupinis hopes that his work, depicting the frailty of democracy, will help audiences “to reflect. People must come to conclusions themselves. I hate art as a political tool, but I like when art causes political shifts.” He also wishes that after watching the pic, audiences will come out with “a feeling of warmth and hope, a desire to talk to another human being and listen in this time of divisiveness.”\n\n\tProducer Razgutė who teamed up with Kaupinis on two of his shorts and the acclaimed “Nova Lituania,” says their intention was “to craft a film that adds a touch of humor to the somewhat absurd scenarios surrounding Lithuania’s fight for independence, while still acknowledging the serious personal dilemmas and historical events involved. In the current surroundings, we feel that the film is getting more relevant every day.”\n\n\tRazgutė also underlined the director’s visual talent, expressed through the lens of “Nova Lituania” cinematographer Simonas Glinskis. “While “Nova Lituania” was very stylised, as it captured the interwar years, here Karolis and Simonas decided to portray this world through colors and grain, as the 1990s were ‘greyish’ times.” \n\n\tFully shot in Lithuania in five weeks, the film was co-produced with the Czech Republic’s Background Films and Latvia’s Tasse Film, with support from the Lithuanian Film Centre, Eurimages, Creative Europe MEDIA, the Czech Film Centre, Latvian Film Centre, and Lithuanian pubcaster LRT.\n\n\tPilot Film will handle the national roll out in the Czech Republic and Baltic Content Media in Latvia. At press time, Razgutė was in discussions for sales in remaining territories.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMost might flinch when pairing a wholesome family brand with an R-rated fugitive thriller. Toys “R” Us Studios, however, saw nothing but upside in “Roofman.”\n\n\tThe film — a true account of a prison escapee holed up in a North Carolina big-box store (guess which) — was hardly what Kim Miller Olko would call “the most positive, family-friendly story.” Yet the Toys “R” Us Studios president was enthused by the prospect of a feature-length spotlight, no matter the tone — and she grew even more gung-ho once her cross-promotional offers to Paramount came back with a polite no thanks.\n\t\n\n\t“We went on social media and launched what we jokingly called a harassment campaign,” Olko quipped during her opening MipJunior keynote on Saturday. The strategy had two goals: to rattle the studios into paying attention and to reassure consumers that a present-day Roofman wouldn’t actually be able to hide in a modern store. The gambit paid off, culminating in a social media event where Channing Tatum fielded questions live on Instagram from an actual Toys “R” Us. \n\n\n\t“We were very excited,” Olko said. “The promotion we’re getting is incredible.” \n\n\tThe strategy reflected the showman’s flair Olko brings to her role as Toys “R” Us CMO. She honed those chops over more than a decade as a senior executive at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, overseeing one of modern media’s most startling reboots — transforming the domestic impresario into an improbable Sports Illustrated cover girl and an affable foil for Snoop Dogg. \n\n\tSince 2021, Olko has sought to do the same for a retail brand now under the wing of WHP Global and repped by mascot knows as Geoffrey the Giraffe. \n\t\n\n\tWithout breaking any major news—though she did reveal that the studio’s live-action feature already has an undisclosed writer and international star attached—Olko used her opening keynote to spotlight the company’s media relaunch. Introducing the new tagline, “Same Magic, New Method,” she explained how Toys “R” Us plans to transform decades of goodwill (“every millennial was a Toys ‘R’ Us kid,” she noted) into a nimble, modern licensing and media strategy — centered, of course, around a brand mascot with a famously long neck.\n\n\t“I thought it was really, really lucky that now I had a giraffe that didn’t talk,” she laughed. “After you work for a major celebrity, it was nice to have a moment of silence.” \n\n\tToys “R” Us has since built a new backstory for its mascot — giving him an exact age (“I did a lot of studying and [found that] Elmo’s three and a half. So I figured if Elmo could be three, then Geoffrey could be nine and a half”) and a precise birthday that partners could leverage for a retail bonanza each Oct. 17. Now, Olko’s primary goal is to give Geoffrey the media presence he deserves, securing 1.1 million followers on TikTok and carving out his own spot in the Manhattan skyline for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\n\tThe studio will continue its digital push with new episodes of the YouTube series “Geoffrey Vision,” while teaming with Nickelodeon to reformat content from the “Geoffrey’s World Tour” travel series into an interactive game show. Olko also defended the company’s use of AI, partnering with OpenAI on the first-ever Sora-created brand film, which premiered at Cannes Lions last year.\n\n\t“That really launched a very big conversation around whether this was good for content or not,” Olko said. “Toys ‘R’ Us Studios isn’t becoming an AI studio, but we definitely have it in our toolbox.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHong Kong-based PCCW Media has locked in Hulu as the U.S. home for its six-episode drama “The Season,” a collaboration with SK Global.\n\n\tThe deal, finalized earlier this month, comes ahead of the show’s international market debut at Mipcom, where Fremantle will shop the title to buyers worldwide with support from De Maio Entertainment. Viu, which commissioned the project, retains rights across its 15-market footprint and will stream the series as original programming.\n\t\n\n\tSK Global, the production company behind “Crazy Rich Asians,” “Thai Cave Rescue” and Emmy-winning “Delhi Crime,” partnered with PCCW Media to develop the series.\n\n\n\tThe drama unfolds during Hong Kong’s summer social season, centering on an affluent group whose carefully maintained facade begins to crack when an outsider enters their world. The show promises a visually lush exploration of wealth, loyalty and deception set against the city’s harbor culture.\n\n\tLeading the ensemble is Jessie Mei Li, known for Netflix’s “Shadow and Bone,” alongside Hong Kong cinema veteran Karena Lam, a three-time Golden Horse Award recipient. The supporting roster includes Chris Pang of “Interior Chinatown,” Justin Chien from “The Brothers Sun,” and Yvonne Chapman, who appeared in “Avatar: The Last Airbender.” Celina Jade and Toby Stephens round out the principal cast.\n\n\tAdditional players include Rising Star of Asia Award 2025 honoree Kōki, Lee Jae-yoon from the second season of “Physical 100,” and competition series winner Lyman Heung. Hong Kong pop idols Anson Lo of boy band Mirror and Marf Yau from girl group Collar make guest appearances.\n\t\n\n\t“We are thrilled to have ‘The Season’ stream on Hulu in the U.S. and to partner with Fremantle for international distribution, bringing this intriguing and riveting emotional ride to a global audience,” said Janice Lee, managing director of PCCW Media Group and CEO of Viu. “Developed in collaboration with our production partner SK Global, the series immerses viewers in Hong Kong’s pulsating energy through stunning visuals ensuring the show is both authentic and relatable to a global audience.”\n\n\tChloe Dan, executive VP and head of television at SK Global, added: “‘The Season’ is a story with truly universal appeal, and we are thrilled to collaborate with Hulu to bring it to U.S. audiences. As SK Global continues to expand its footprint across the world, this series represents the kind of distinctive, premium storytelling we’re proud to champion on a global stage.”\n\n\tBehind the camera, creator and executive producer Yalun Tu brings experience from Amazon Japan’s “My Undead Yokai Girlfriend,” which he co-created, along with writing credits on “NCIS: Hawaii” and “Wu Assassins.” Chilean filmmaker Marialy Rivas, whose recent work includes “The Jetty,” directs multiple episodes and executive produces.\n\n\tThe producing team includes Lee and Agatha Lo representing PCCW Media, while SK Global’s contingent consists of Dan, Matt Aragachi and Dylan Tarason.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter launching a home-invasion franchise with the simple premise of three masked figures terrorizing a couple on the rocks, “The Strangers” creator Bryan Bertino has maintained his sensibility as a writer-director, spinning other original horror chamber pieces unmoored by sympathy. Now, the horror helmer’s latest effort shows characteristic daring in its detachment. \n\n\tGenerically titled “Vicious,” the film offers a spare setup — a depressed young woman is wracked by hallucinations — with little definition of what is afflicting her or why. The writer-director doesn’t solicit sympathy for Polly (played by Dakota Fanning) or impose meaning on her suffering. It’s a very naked approach to horror, entirely propped up on formal execution. In other words, he risks leaving the audience with nothing. And that comes to pass in “Vicious,” which trickles down to Paramount’s streaming service after being slashed from the studio’s theatrical slate.\n\t\n\n\tBertino finds an ample engine in Fanning, at least. The opening introduces her character aglow in red light, complemented by a narrated monologue, vaguely written but delivered as pure, possibly suicidal despair. It’s clear that something is eating away at her, and that impression sticks in proceeding scenes, with the holiday season shut-in Polly half-heartedly preparing for a job interview and calming down her concerned mother over the phone.\n\n\n\tThese early, somber moments cast a mood, but the film is eager to hold Polly’s feet to some fire. “Vicious” has the devoted attention for its lead that Roman Polanski’s domestic horror classics “Repulsion” and “Rosemary’s Baby” did, but Bertino has a more gung-ho gameplan. Instead of gradually boiling into insanity, the film hits fever pitch hallucinations right away and quickly exhausts itself attempting to keep pace. \n\t\n\n\tThe rubber meets the road when Polly receives a mysterious box from a bewitching, raspy old woman (Kathryn Hunter, the current go-to for that type of thing — and deservedly so). It comes with a ticking hourglass and a series of vague challenges: Give the box “something you hate, something you need, something you love.” It’s an instruction brimming with technicalities, forcing Polly to excavate her most personal traumas. It also leads to some sliced body parts and grimy-looking strangers, who tap Polly on the shoulder for a scare before disappearing.\n\n\tThat’s all disappointing, familiar horror imagery, but “Vicious” gets by on atmosphere for a good while before that. A crackling fireplace casts a dull pall over Polly’s living room, but it’s the only warmth in her stupendously cavernous home. The house appears to exist at the end of the universe, so much so that it comes as a surprise when Polly briefly dashes to a neighbor’s place seeking a lifeline. But when that stranger ends up possessed within minutes, stabbing herself in the face and sending Polly back out into the cold, it seems like no other development would’ve made more sense. There are no helping hands when the entire movie may or may not be unfolding inside someone’s head.\n\n\tThat credo reasserts itself as Polly begins to be haunted by visions of her loved ones. Bertino strictly withholds from elaborating on her personal history — a self-imposed limit that ultimately keeps the film from getting under the skin, but does serve to further emphasize Polly’s isolation. One memorable moment comes early, when another call between Polly and her mother tilts into dread as the voice on the phone morphs into a more callous, sinister being. It’s a trick that “Vicious” is smart to return to, with its scant side characters offering Polly brief warmth before revealing themselves as vessels for the demon haunting her. Fanning’s tensed, squirrelly performance comes to life in these spots, with Polly’s waning trust and fear of betrayal cluing into a wounded self-loathing that becomes the film’s best lasting impression.\n\n\tBut “Vicious” is mostly a numbing slog. Fanning flatlines when left to be a solo show as Bertino whacks her around like a pinball, hitting big, loud scares that seem to keep resetting. As Polly excavates the darkest parts of herself, the film can’t string together a build to match the depths of her soul-searching. The movie devolves into something inexact and thoughtless, without anything distinct to recenter it. It’s hardly a sin for cruelty to be the point, especially in horror. But you have to at least land your punches.\n\t\n\n\t“Vicious” is now streaming on Paramount+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Australian TV sector is alert but not alarmed, with production falling from historic highs, exec-level shuffles slowing the content pipeline and overseas jitters finally reaching our shores. But Australian stories are still resonating with international audiences and many of the recent breakout hits have a mystery at their heart or offer a laugh with a bit of bite.\n\n\tWhen trade body Screen Australia asked industry reps to describe their feelings about the local biz, there was a range of concerns. Words like “worried,” “frustrated” and “disappointed” were floated but one word stood out from the rest: “hopeful.”\n\t\n\n\tOf the 1,000 TV professionals surveyed, 70% believe that the future of diverse storytelling on screen will either remain the same or improve; there were similarly high figures when producers were asked about collaboration and staying on top of industry trends. This positivity, however, was tested on questions like job security, with only 27% believing things will get better.\n\n\n\tThis reflects a local biz that has seen some turmoil recently. Screen Australia reported that in 2023-2024, there were just 15 Australian free-toair TV and broadcast video-on-demand dramas made for general audiences, generating 275 hours of content with budgets of $126 million. This figure is down from an average of 38 titles in the 2010s and an average of 29 titles in the 2000s. There has been an almost three-decade slow decline in the number of hours of local content in Australia.\n\n\t“It has undoubtedly been a quieter year, with the global slowdown and the challenges in international sales reaching our shores,” says Carly Heaton, head of scripted, Fremantle Australia. “At the same time, we’ve seen significant shifts in the commissioning teams at our local broadcasters, which has naturally created a period of uncertainty. That said, there’s a real sense that the dust is starting to settle. We’re seeing commissioning strategies taking shape, buyers re-engaging, and conversations beginning to focus on the next wave of content rather than the constraints of the last 12 months. This reset will ultimately create opportunities for bold, distinctive projects and a stronger year ahead.”\n\t\n\n\tKate Marks, Ausfilm CEO, acknowledges a slight decline in the number of inbound TV productions from the peak of a few years ago, but over the past year, the country has welcomed a healthy pipeline that she sees as a testament to the strength of Australia not only as a producer of quality local content, but also as a production partner internationally.\n\n\t“It’s been particularly gratifying to see Australian talent in key creative roles on projects like [Peacock series] ‘All Her Fault’ and [Apple TV+’s] ‘The Dispatcher,’” Marks says. “At the same time, the breadth of work across post, digital, animation and visual effects has been impressive, with titles such as ‘Alien: Earth,’ ‘The Last of Us,’ ‘Ted’ and the upcoming ‘Stranger Things: Tales from ’85’ showcasing the capability and diversity of our screen businesses.” Marks highlights co-productions, including “Mix Tape” with Ireland and the upcoming animated series “Flower and Flour” with Canada, as examples of how well Australia collaborates internationally across television storytelling.\n\n\tLouise Gough, director of narrative content at Screen Australia, agrees that the industry is set for a rebound and points to the well over 100 Australians that are walking the halls of Mipcom this year.\n\n\tBut not only is she confident about the future of Australian TV content, she is proud of the breakout successes of the past few years.\n\n\t“Over the past five years there have been some brilliant shows that have sold very well globally,” Gough says. “ ‘The Narrow Road to the Deep North’ is some brilliant Australian IP from an Australian author; ‘Newsreader,’ ‘The Twelve,’ ‘Black Snow,’ ‘100% Wolf: Legend of Moonstone’ — these are just a few of the titles that have been getting a lot of business globally.” Gough adds that Australian talent remains in demand with series like “Heartbreak High,” “Fisk,” “Colin From Accounts” and, of course, “Bluey,” the top dog when it comes to any conversation about Australian TV success.\n\n\t“What does well is content that is identifiably Australian but with global themes,” she says. “Globally, audiences are leaning into work that has great conversations and also diasporic resonances, and there is a lot coming through the pipeline — whether that is beautiful work like ‘Top End Bub,’ which has just come out and is performing wonderfully, ‘The Chaplain,’ or ‘High Country.’”\n\t\n\n\t“High Country,” a thriller set in the picturesque Victorian alpine region, was a breakout star for U.K.’s BBC; it’s a resilient genre.\n\n\t“It always makes me laugh because everyone says ‘Oh, we have so many detective shows,’ but then they all want one,” says Rosemary Blight of Goalpost Pictures, makers of the Travis Fimmel-starring whodunit “Black Snow.” “I do think audiences are still responding very well to premium detective dramas, especially if it takes them into a world that they don’t know. Something like ‘Black Snow’ works incredibly well, having someone of the caliber of Travis Fimmel in the middle of it who has such a big reach internationally.” Blight says conversations are being had around the third outing of the series.\n\n\tThe industry body continues to find that “crime is evergreen,” says Gough. “What is so brilliant about crime and the crime works that come out of Australia, is that it has what we call the 80-20 rule,” Gough says. “It’s 80% familiar because the genre is known, but there is 20% where it is being told in a distinct story world or a distinct tone or a distinct point of view, whether it is a comedic crime or a deep, dark crime.”\n\n\tComedic whodunit “Deadloch” is more of a parody of the genre, skewering the tropes of the police and forensics procedurals. The series, written by “The Kates,” comedians Kate McCartney and Kate McLennan, is in post on Season 2. Kevin Whyte of “Deadloch” producer Guesswork says shows sell better with a clear creative viewpoint.\n\n\t“We always do better in entertainment when we focus on empowering the creatives to tell the best stories and that math has never changed,” he says. “It sometimes gets obscured by the business, but underlying all those conversations about trends, formats and platforms, the same truth keeps coming through: If you get great creators, give them space to tell surprising stories, then give them the resources to execute it properly, you will get audiences.”\n\n\tGuesswork also has a new comedy in the works, “Bad Company,” starring comedians Anne Edmonds and Kitty Flanagan (“Fisk”). This “workplace setting” genre is another one that performs well for Aussie companies, with shows like “Newsreader,” “Fisk” or even Sam Neill-starrer “The Twelve,” a legal drama for Fox Showcase, performing well.\n\t\n\n\tAustralia’s other recent international click, “Colin From Accounts,” from Easy Tiger Prods., has breathed life back into the Oz comedy sector.\n\n\tRob Gibson, Easy Tiger CEO, says comedy is always a tough sell because people are worried about whether the laughs will land. “The conventional wisdom about comedy not travelling, we have blown that open with ‘Colin,’ and we are having a lot of conversation in the U.K. and the U.S. about comedy that could be made here in Australia.”\n\n\tFremantle’s Carly Heaton says this lighter fare is a big focus for them in the future. “There’s a real appetite right now for shows with heart — lighter, funnier, more escapist stories that give audiences a break from the real world,” Heaton says. “A lot of our commissioned projects, and those in commissioned development, share that DNA. We can’t name titles yet, but you’ll see a through-line of hope and humor across our slate which we feel is very strong and exciting.”\n\n\tBlight says Goalpost is also proud of its lighter fare with the recent success of the Amazon Prime original “Top End Bub,” a TV spinoff from the Aussie feature “Top End Wedding.” Launching at Mipcom, the laffer has had a great response from audiences Down Under. “‘Top End Bub’ is about a big hectic family, the responsibilities and unconditional love.\n\n\tIt’s set in the top end of Australia. That area is green and aqua blue and a world full of crocodiles, and it’s a world that a lot of Australians haven’t seen and certainly the world hasn’t seen,” says Blight. “Overseas audiences think of Australia as red dirt outback, but they don’t know that there is a beautiful tropical world up there. We shoot on Tiwi Islands, and having Amazon on that in Australia and New Zealand allowed us to make something to scale. We are feeling really good about that.”\n\n\tIn fact, Blight says one of the most important things in the current environment is the strength of a local partner — in addition to Amazon’s excellent partnership with “Top End Bub,” streamer Stan threw its weight behind “Black Snow.”\n\n\t“When your domestic partner really gets behind the show, that success domestically ripples around the world,” she says.\n\n\tMatt Deaner, Screen Producers Australia CEO, sees key encouragement coming from national broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “There has been a strong signal from the ABC and the new managing director, Hugh Marks,” Deaner says. “He has said that he is doubling down on regional intellectual property because the national broadcaster has the capacity to take risks, and that is great. They are being aggressive in a way we have not seen for a while; that is great news for our industry.”\n\t\n\n\tThe ABC stand at Mipcom reps “Fisk,” as well as comedy reboot “Mother and Son” and thriller “Pine Gap.”\n\n\tGuesswork’s Whyte adds that on-air successes are one thing, but what he has been hearing on the ground is that they are the tip of the iceberg, and that there are many more development conversations going on.\n\n\t“I certainly feel, and I think others, too, feel like after a couple of years where it felt like we were walking through wet cement, the cogs are turning again, maybe they are turning at a lower volume but it certainly feels like decisions are being made and development is moving forward,” he says.\n\n\tBlight adds: “We are hitting above our weight, we have to look at those successes and be really proud of them. We are at a time now where the world doesn’t really care what language you speak, they are being educated and watching content from all over the world and we fit in very nicely into that.”\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office reviewed Barrett's case and determined criminal charges of rape of a person incapable of giving consent will not be filed against him.

County Sheriff's Department claiming that after a night of drinking with Barrett, she woke up in bed to find him touching her and alleged he then had sex with her against her will.\n      \n\n          At the time, our law enforcement sources told us the woman told deputies she and Barrett had been friends for several months and that the evening began with drinks in Los Angeles before they went back to his place, where she alleged the incident occurred.\n      \n    \n          After filing her report, the woman underwent a sexual assault exam, and the LASD Special Victims Bureau took over the investigation.\n      \n    \n          Now, prosecutors say the evidence did not support criminal charges, and the case has been closed.\n      \n    \n          A rep for Barrett had no comment.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

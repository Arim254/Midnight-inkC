    "body": "\n\tAMC Theatres is offering a new perk to its loyalty program members: Customers who pay a monthly fee for A-List or Stubs Premiere will get priority access to the best seats in the house.\n\n\tThe program is expected to launch in 2026, the company’s chairman Adam Aron on Tuesday’s earnings call. This change comes three years after AMC tested (and then abandoned) Sightline at AMC, a ticket pricing initiative based on seat location within the auditorium. \n\t\n\n\t“Later this year, AMC will introduce preferred premier seating, where we will block and reserve the best seats in the house in our theaters to be accessed first only by our A-List and our Stubs Premiere members — that’s the two VIP tiers within our Stubs program — at no added charge at AMC,” Aron said during the call. “We will assure the best seats in our auditoriums are held, at first anyway, for our best customers.”\n\n\n\tOf course, seating preferences can be subjective — and AMC Theatres didn’t define which will be considered the “best” rows. But the pilot program for Sightline at AMC involved customers paying more money for prime middle seats with an unobstructed view and less to sit in the front row. It’s possible the new initiative will follow a similar pattern.\n\n\tIn 2025, AMC raised the price of Stubs A-List to $27.99 per month in New York and California and $19.99 to $25.99 per month elsewhere in the country, depending on the state. Under the highest membership tier, patrons can see up to four movies every week in any format. Premiere — a tier below A-list that offers waived online ticketing fees, popcorn upgrades and other perks but doesn’t include the benefit of four-movies-a-week — costs $17.99 a month.\n\t\n\n\t“We think it will be a considerable consumer benefit that our most frequent guests will notice and greatly appreciate, further cementing their brand loyalty to AMC,” Aron added.\n\n\tEarlier this week, AMC Theatres reported a 10% decline in attendance during the end of 2025 as the chain’s quarterly revenue dropped to $1.28 billion, down 1.4% from the year prior. AMC has been testing all kinds of initiatives to lure customers in greater numbers. Last summer, the company started offering 50% off movie tickets on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for AMC Stubs rewards program. \n\n\tAlthough 2026 has been off to a slow start, Hollywood studios and theater owners are bullish that upcoming blockbusters like Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey,” two Marvel’s adventures in “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” and “Avengers: Doomsday,” as well as Disney and Pixar’s “Toy Story 5,” will help to push domestic box office revenues toward pre-pandemic heights. Across the entire movie theater industry, exhibitors have struggled to recover from the pandemic and dual labor strikes, as well as the rise in popularity of streaming services.\n\n\t“AMC is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on a recovering box office,” Aron said. “And as I have said many times before, the not-so-secret formula to a full box‑office recovery is straight forward, we need more great movies from our studio partners.”\n\n\tMore to come….\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe U.S. men’s national hockey team made headlines over the weekend when it defeated Canada 2-1 in the gold medal final at the Winter Olympics, and now, Nike has dropped a new line of merch to commemorate the occasion.\n\n\tThe U.S. men’s win marked the first Olympic gold medal for an American hockey team since the now-legendary “Miracle on Ice” victory by the U.S. over their Soviet opponents in the 1980 Winter Olympics. That win of course, went on to inspire the 2004 film, “Miracle,” starring Kurt Russell.\n\n\n\tNow, Nike has dropped a limited-edition line of apparel to celebrate the new Olympic champs, including New Jersey Devils forward Jack Hughes, who scored the overtime-winning goal over the Canadians in Milan.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNEW RELEASE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUSA Hockey Nike 2026 Winter Olympics Gold Medal Roster Club Fleece Hoodie \t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe collection includes this officially-licensed hoodie features a “USA Gold” emblem on the front along with the USA Hockey shield and Nike logo.

The gold graphics on the front of the hoodie also include the “USA Gold” tagline only with the words “Women’s Olympic Champions” instead of “men’s.” You can get the same design in a white T-shirt here.\n\n\n\tNike says the pieces “honor the U.S. Hockey team’s historic win,” with new graphics “printed across the chest so you’ll never forget their triumphant efforts. Secure this celebratory piece today and relive the glory of the U.S. Hockey team’s golden moment for years to come.”\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALSO CONSIDER\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUSA Hockey Outerstuff 2026 Winter Olympics Heart of Gold T-Shirt\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tLooking for something a little different?

    "body": "\n\tHilary Duff appeared on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast amid her press tour for her new album, “Luck… or something,” and confirmed a long-standing rumor that she crashed the August 2003 premiere of “Freaky Friday” amid a rivalry with fellow Disney star Lindsay Lohan. The duo’s alleged love triangle with Aaron Carter in the early aughts made all three the targets of gossip rags and paparazzi.\n\n\t“I think absolutely yes,” Duff answered when asked about whether she crashed the “Freaky Friday” premiere. “I was a teenager!”\n\t\n\n\tOn the flip side, Duff said she was not surprised at all when months later Lohan showed up at the December 2023 premiere of Duff’s movie “Cheaper by the Dozen.” Duff added: “I mean, that was like my childhood feud… like my nemesis… it’s so many years later, like who cares?”\n\n\n\t“It does not matter,” Duff continued. “Also, Lindsay came up to me at a club once and was like, ‘Are we good?’ And I was like, ‘We’re good.’ She was like, ‘Let’s take a shot.’ I was like, ‘OK.'” \n\n\tWhile Duff knew she was stirring the pot by attending Lohan’s “Freaky Friday” premiere, she added: “I don’t want to start any more stuff, but like [Chad Michael Murray] was like, ‘You should come with me.’ And I was like, ‘Mhm, probably I should.’ I mean, what was I, like sixteen? No, I was younger than that…”\n\n\tAt the time of the “Freaky Friday” premiere, Duff was well into her run as a Disney Channel icon thanks to the success of “Lizzie McGuire.” She made the jump to movies with “The Lizzie McGuire Movie,” which opened in May 2023 before “Freaky Friday.” Lohan, meanwhile, was already a child star thanks to 1998’s “The Parent Trap” and her Disney television movies “Life Size” and “Get a Clue.” \n\t\n\n\tWatch Duff’s full interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tA petition in support of Tricia Tuttle, festival director of the Berlin Film Festival, has now grown to almost 700 film business insiders including directors, producers and actors.\n\n\tAmong the signatories are Oscar winning director Sean Baker, Oscar nominated filmmaker Todd Haynes, Oscar winning actress Tilda Swinton, Kleber Mendonça Filho, the director of Oscar nominated “The Secret Agent,” Oscar nominated director Oren Moverman, Ari Folman, director of Oscar nominated “Waltz With Bashir,” producer Nancy Spielberg, and Ilker Çatak, the director of Oscar nominated “The Teachers’ Lounge.”\n\t\n\n\tOther names include Caroline Link, director of Oscar winner “Nowhere in Africa,” Nadav Lapid, the director of Golden Bear winner “Synonyms,” actor-writer-director Maria Schrader, an Emmy winner with “Unorthodox,” director Ira Sachs, and Maren Ade, the director of Oscar nominated “Toni Erdmann.”\n\n\n\tThe petition comes ahead of an extraordinary meeting, called by Germany’s culture minister Wolfram Weimer, of the Berlin Film Festival’s governing body on Thursday morning to discuss the “future direction” of the Berlinale. It is believed the meeting has been convened in response to criticism of political statements made at the festival.\n\n\tThe petition says, “If an extraordinary meeting is convened to decide the future of the festival’s leadership, more is at stake than a single appointment. What is at issue is the relationship between artistic freedom and institutional independence.”\n\n\tHere is the full statement:\n\n\tOpen Letter on the Future of the BerlinaleAs filmmakers in Germany and beyond, we are following the current debates surrounding the Berlinale and the proposed dismissal of Tricia Tuttle with deep concern. We stand in defense of the Berlinale for what it fundamentally is: a place of exchange.\n\t\n\n\tThe Berlinale is more than a red carpet or a series of headlines. It is a space where perspectives intersect, narratives are questioned, and social tensions are brought into view. This is where discourse unfolds – at the very heart of cinema.\n\n\tRecent criticism has focused on statements made from the stage. None of these remarks were made by the festival leadership itself, but by invited filmmakers. An international film festival is not a diplomatic instrument; it is a democratic cultural space worthy of protection. Its strength lies in its ability to hold divergent perspectives and to give visibility to a plurality of voices.\n\n\tA photograph of the festival leadership with filmmakers, in which a Palestinian flag was visible, has likewise been subject to criticism. Being photographed with international guests is part of the practice of such a festival. The visibility of different identities is not an endorsement; it is an expression of an open and democratic public sphere.\n\n\tWhen personnel consequences are drawn from individual statements or symbolic interpretations, a troubling signal is sent: cultural institutions come under political pressure.\n\n\tIf an extraordinary meeting is convened to decide the future of the festival’s leadership, more is at stake than a single appointment. What is at issue is the relationship between artistic freedom and institutional independence.\n\n\tThe Berlinale has always been political — not party-political, but socially engaged. Film makes conflicts visible, opens up perspectives, and renders experiences of injustice and violence tangible. Cinema raises moral questions and asks us to endure ambiguity rather than resolve it prematurely. It illuminates power structures and gives visibility to experiences of oppression — not to deliver simple answers, but to enable meaningful public debate. That is precisely where its democratic value resides.\n\n\tEspecially in times of global crisis, we need spaces capable of sustaining disagreement. The independence of cultural institutions safeguards not only artistic freedom, but the vitality of democratic discourse itself.\n\n\tIf every controversy leads to institutional repercussions, discourse gives way to control.\n\n\tWe stand for a culture of exchange, not intimidation.\n\t\n\n\tWhere diversity remains visible, democracy remains alive.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump lashed out at Robert De Niro in a Truth Social rant amid their ongoing public feud. The president slammed the Oscar-winning actor as “a sick and demented person” after De Niro fought back tears in a recent interview on “The Best People With Nicole Wallace” podcast while urging Americans to resist Trump.\n\n\t“Trump Deranged Robert De Niro [is] another sick and demented person with, I believe, an extremely Low IQ, who has absolutely no idea what he is doing or saying — some of which is seriously CRIMINAL!” Trump posted. “When I watched him break down in tears last night, much like a child would do, I realized that he may be even sicker than Crazy Rosie O’Donnell, who is right now in Ireland trying to figure out how to come back into our beautiful United States.”\n\t\n\n\t“The only difference between De Niro and Rosie is that she is probably somewhat smarter than him, which isn’t saying much,” the president continued. “The good news is that America is now Bigger, Better, Richer, and Stronger than ever before, and it’s driving them absolutely crazy!”\n\n\tTrump’s latest rant encouraged De Niro to get on a boat and leave the country with Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), both of whom walked out of Trump’s State of the Union address before it was over and shouted at him in disapproval. \n\n\t“When you watch Low IQ Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, as they screamed uncontrollably last night at the very elegant State of the Union, such an important and beautiful event, they had the bulging, bloodshot eyes of crazy people, LUNATICS, mentally deranged and sick who, frankly, look like they should be institutionalized,” Trump posted. “When people can behave like that, and knowing that they are Crooked and Corrupt Politicians, so bad for our Country, we should send them back from where they came — as fast as possible. They can only damage the United States of America, they can do nothing to help it.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring his interview with Nicole Wallace, De Niro said Trump is “destroying” America, adding: “It’s sick, it’s fucked up. We have to save the country.”\n\n\t“People have to resist, resist, resist, resist, resist. That’s the only way,” De Niro said. “There’s no magic. There’s no nothing – people are not going to go away, even if Trump dies for some reason by having an illness or something. Parts of that movement are still there, and that’s the scary part. It has to be neutralized by the people.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tViewers of “Today” are going to see a little more of Hoda Kotb.\n\n\tKotb is expected to continue to fill in at the NBC morning franchise opposite Craig Melvin while regular co-anchor Savannah Guthrie continues to monitor the search for her mother, Nancy, in Arizona, according to a person familiar with the matter. Kotb has been co-anchoring “Today” for the past three weeks.\n\n\tKotb does not plan to rejoin the program full time, this person says, noting that Guthrie is expected to return to “Today” on her own timeline, even though her absence may continue for a significant period.\n\t\n\n\tGuthrie has been absent from the show since the start of the month. Her mother, Nancy, has been missing since January 31.\n\n\tKotb, who left the program in early 2025, has remained under contract to NBC since that time. She has taken part in a podcast as well as NBC’s annual telecast of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, while making occasional appearances on “Today” hours. Kotb was originally supposed to attend NBC’s Winter Olympics coverage in Italy along with Guthrie and other “Today” personnel, but those plans were scaled back after Nancy Guthrie disappeared.\n\n\tKotb’s decision to stay offers a viable solution for NBC and “Today” producers.  She’s already affiliated with the show, and adding someone new to the mix during such a difficult moment could be ill advised The introduction of someone new to fill in more regularly for Guthrie — even on an interim basis — could alienate viewers, who have a years-long relationship with her and don’t want to see her treated poorly, particularly under duress.\n\t\n\n\tWhen Kotb announced her decision to exit in 2024, she cited a desire to spend time with two young daughters. “I realized it was time for me to turn the page,” after a recent 60th birthday, she told colleagues on the program. She noted that she had children later in life and that “they deserve a bigger piece of my time pie that I have.”\n\n\tKotb had been at NBC News since 1998, when she joined as a correspondent for the “Dateline” newsmagazine. She arrived at NBC after logging years at CBS affiliates in Florida and Louisiana. But she gained a wider profile after joining a fourth hour of “Today” in 2007 that typically airs at 10 a.m. At first, Kotb was one of group of personnel assigned to the show, but within months was paired with Kathie Lee Gifford, a veteran of the syndicated ABC program “Live” who held her own for years opposite Regis Philbin.\n\n\tSuddenly, Kotb was talking about her dating adventures with Gifford. being satirized on “Saturday Night Live” and sharing more of her personal life than than a journalist might expect.  “It used to be you could host a morning show, even the 7, and not really reveal too much. And I think everything has changed now. I think now part of entering into this world, you have to reveal things. Because people expect so much more,” Kotb told Variety in 2014. “They don’t know whether to love you or not if you don’t share anything and sometimes you have to go beyond. I feel like I’ve gone beyond what I’m comfortable with.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance leaders steered clear of any discussion of the company’s latest bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery as it unveiled fourth-quarter 2025 earnings report on Wednesday that reflected declines in the company’s core linear TV business but momentum for Paramount+ and other streaming platforms. \n\n\tCEO David Ellison and Paramount president Jeff Shell fielded questions from Wall Street analysts about the company’s fourth quarter results, which marks the first full quarter that studio has been owned by Ellison. \n\t\n\n\tEllison said flatly that Paramount’s film slate “underperformed” in 2025. Ellison and Shell were pressed about the potential for the NFL to trigger its option to renegotiate its TV rights deals starting in 2029. And Ellison told analysts that he is bullish on streaming’s ad-supported FAST channel sector, and that Paramount eventually will invest “10x” in engineering talent as part of the revitalization plan for the studio.\n\n\n\tREAD MORE: Paramount Skydance Sees Q4 Loss Widen Amid TV Downturn\n\n\tDennis Cinelli, Paramount’s newly appointed chief financial officer, addressed the 2026 projection for Paramount Pictures’ film business as having a down year overall compared to 2025 despite having more theatrical releases on deck. Paramount said it expects to have 16 theatrical releases this year, compared to eight in 2025.\n\n\t“We do expect the actual revenue to decline. We’ve been very clear overall that we’re in a real rebuild phase of that business. As we execute that rebuild, we’ll see some of that come through in 2026, but mostly that will come through in future years. And so even with the actual revenue dropping down, we do expect better cost management as well as benefits from our licensing deals to drive studio profitability up,” Cinelli said.\n\t\n\n\tEllison’s Skydance Media took over Paramount Global last August. “We inherited a slate that has underperformed. We’re going to see significant improvement in the profitability of the film slate this year,” Ellison said.\n\n\tPressed for examples of how the new regime is executing its plan to use technological upgrades to drive operating improvements at the more than 100-year-old studio, Ellison pointed to changes already made but he indicated that there is much more to come.\n\n\t“When you look at the engineers that we have at the company currently, you can expect us to kind of 10x the size of the headcount that we are basically investing towards this,” Ellison said. “We really want to be in a position where we can be a leader in the industry in terms of how this transformation is shaped.”\n\n\tEllison and Shell were grilled about the growth and profit forecasts for the Paramount+ streamer. Ellison also made a point of endorsing the company’s Pluto TV platform that serves up dozens of free ad-supported streaming television channels (aka FAST) around the world.\n\n\t“I am a big believer in in the FAST space. When you really look globally, FAST is something that is only going to grow in importance. And when you look at the signs that are also really encouraging on Pluto is that we are seeing engagement grow,” Ellison said. “The headwind we’re facing is really monetization, and we’re doing several things to correct that. And while Pluto has always been a leader in the FAST space — it’s a profitable platform — but it was from our perspective under-invested in by the previous owners and managers, both in a content standpoint as well as from a product standpoint.”\n\n\tAs for the NFL, Shell projected confidence that Paramount’s CBS would remain a cornerstone of the league’s distribution strategy for games for many years to come. The NFL has the right to re-negotiate deals that were sealed in 2021 and stretch out through 2033. Shell pointed to the power of the regionalization that CBS allows for with NFL coverage on Sunday with its AFC package, much as Fox does with its NFC package for Sundays. If the NFL restarts the contract, the price is expected to be astronomical.\n\n\t“We feel pretty confident we’re going to be in business with the NFL for a long time, and we have properly accounted for what we expect to be whatever impact of that negotiation in our kind of internal forecast going forward,” Shell said. “One of the unique things about our relationship with the NFL, and I would actually say it’s probably somewhere to Fox’s relationship with the NFL is the anchor of their flywheel and the anchor of their reach is really the reach of both CBS and Fox on Sunday afternoons. That reach, which has really helped contribute for both of our benefit to the success of the NFL, is by our vast array of both owned and operated stations, of which we have 28, and affiliates. It’s important that those games get regionalized, and that we aggregate that viewership and maximize the viewership in each market for the best game, both for us and Fox, and that accrues to the benefit of the NFL and to us and really maximizes the reach on any given Sunday.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor nearly a century, the Academy has handed out the best director award without ever placing it in the hands of a Black filmmaker. This year that streak, long reduced to a footnote, may move from the margins of history to the center — and Ryan Coogler is the reason why.\n\n\t“Sinners” arrived not only as the “new film from the guy who brought you ‘Black Panther,’” but also as a cultural force, earning a record-breaking 16 Oscar nominations. Coogler’s directing nod makes the 39-year-old Oakland native the seventh Black filmmaker nominated in the category, after John Singleton (“Boyz n’ the Hood”), Lee Daniels (“Precious”), Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”), Barry Jenkins (“Moonlight”), Jordan Peele (“Get Out”) and Spike Lee (“BlacKkKlansman”). Of course, none of them won.\n\t\n\n\tCoogler is aware of all that. But he’s made a deliberate choice to keep it at arm’s length.\n\n\n\t“The biggest danger is, something like that can dampen your hope, make you disillusioned, or feel like what you do isn’t worth it,” Coogler tells Variety. “I try to protect my love for what I do. If I know statistics are going to make me feel sad, I don’t think about it.”\n\n\tIt’s a survival strategy rooted in lineage and in the values shaped by his influences. Coogler grew up watching Singleton’s and Lee’s movies. “I knew what John and Spike looked like before I knew what Spielberg looked like,” he says. When Coogler arrived at USC, the late Singleton befriended him and guided his path: “The whole reason I went there was because of him. He would mentor me and watch my short films.”\n\t\n\n\tThat special relationship informs how Coogler moves through the industry today. With Proximity Media — which he runs with his wife, Zinzi Evans, and Sev Ohanian — he’s built a company that keeps him engaged with the community.\n\n\tHowever, only 2% of all Oscar nominees and 2% of all winners from 1929 to 2025 were Black. That adds up to 274 nominations and 63 winners in 97 years, according to a USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative study.\n\n\tNow Coogler is standing at a potentially historic moment.\n\n\tVariety spoke with a Black AMPAS member to get a temperature check on what they’re watching and loving. A huge fan of “Sinners,” the member put it plainly: “The Academy is about to turn 100. I, like many of my cohorts, have all dreamed about being the first to stand on that stage. If we get to the 100th year and no Black person has stood there, what does that say? You’re telling me nobody was worthy during that time? Nobody? This is the opportunity to do it for a worthy artist who happens to be Black but is also unequivocally Black.”\n\n\tNaturally, we ask Coogler what a win could mean. After a thoughtful pause, he says, “My award is the opportunity to have this job. The opportunity to go write a script, get a crew together, hire union jobs, contribute to people’s health care, insurance and their families. The fact that I have this job and continue to have it is the greatest gift.”\n\n\tIt’s an attitude informed in part by “survivor’s remorse,” as he puts it, along with the peculiar weight of being a symbol for so many aspiring artists. He credits therapy, a grounded marriage — he and Zinzi have known each other since childhood — and the humbling experience of going home to family and friends who don’t care about what’s happening in Hollywood. To them, he’s just “Uncle Ryan” or “Coogz.”\n\n\tAfter major industry losses at DGA and BAFTA to Warner Bros. cohort Paul Thomas Anderson for “One Battle After Another,” the Oscar deck appears stacked against Coogler. Even so, and while the losses may sting, “Sinners” is proof of possibility.\n\n\tSays Coogler, “Every day I wake up, I get to contribute. That’s what I’m focused on.”\n\n\tRead excerpts from his interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(L to r) DELROY LINDO, MICHAEL B. JORDAN and director RYAN COOGLER\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEli Ade\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve always kept the focus on the work. Has this awards season changed how comfortable you are being the “face” of “Sinners?”\t\n\n\tIt’s definitely a new experience for me compared with the films I’ve made before. My first feature was based on the tragic murder of a young man by transit law enforcement — the real person and his family were at the forefront (“Fruitvale Station”). The next three films were based on characters that preexisted my birth — with “Creed,” it was tied to the “Rocky” franchise. With the “Black Panther” films, those are adaptations, too. With this one, there isn’t something to hide behind. We were aware of that going into it, but I was excited to do it. Each movie I’ve made had international distribution and a chance to be in the zeitgeist, so you get used to the rhythm: you make the thing, you get the word out, and then at a certain point it belongs to the audience. They decide how long they want to talk about it, and how many conversations you get to have. We were fortunate this one has had a long tail.\n\t\n\t\tThe film feels personal, but also mythic. What part of yourself did you confront while making it?\t\n\n\tI’ve always tried to use the craft to make as big an impact as I could each time. With this one, I’d say every element had a personal origin — sometimes conscious, sometimes subconscious, and I realized it later. The biggest thing was understanding the ritual of making this movie as a ritual of remembrance — and recognizing how much it always has been. Putting on a blues record, I’m remembering my uncle, thinking back to stories, thinking about older members of my family. Even deciding to listen to that music is an active method of remembrance. With this, I got my friends together, my family — people I’ve been making movies with for well over 20 years — and we went down to New Orleans and participated in active remembrance and affirmation. We love making movies, and it was rewarding every day, and rewarding putting it out.\n\t\n\t\t“Sinners” earned a record-breaking 16 Oscar nominations and tied the record for the most individual Black artists recognized from a single movie. How do you feel about such achievements?\t\n\n\tWhat I’m always trying to do is focus. Filmmaking is a team sport, so I go out and try to hire the best people I can find for each position. Once I have them, I try to be the best leader I can be — which usually means getting out of the way as much as possible. Every person I’ve worked with, regardless of their gender or how they identify, has always been the best person for the job I could find. If Zinzi was not a good producer, I would not be working with her. I’ve got too much respect for the job at hand. Each one of those women you’re mentioning — Ruth [E. Carter], Hannah [Beachler], Autumn [Durald Arkapaw] — they are remarkable. They are among the best to ever do what they do. I keep hiring them because they’re that great.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou’re only the seventh Black filmmaker ever nominated for best director. How do you engage with that statistic?\t\n\n\tSometimes statistics can make me intrigued. Sometimes they can bum me out. The biggest danger is that when you’re inundated in them, they can maybe dampen your hope, make you disillusioned, or make you feel like what you do isn’t worth it. I try to protect my love for what I do, as best I can. If I know a statistic is going to make me feel sad, I just don’t think about it. Because I want to wake up with a strong desire to make movies and continue to engage in this industry.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve talked about Spike Lee and John Singleton as influences. How do you think about mentorship and community-building now?\t\n\n\tYou mentioned Spike and John — their stories influenced each other. I got to know both of them, and their movies were among the first I ever saw in a theater as a kid. I watched how my parents reacted to their work — and I knew what Spike looked like and what John looked like, maybe before I knew what Spielberg looked like. When I talked to Spike and John, they were aware of their positions, but they were working artists and community members. Spike still teaches at NYU — so a lot of filmmakers have been taught by him. When I came to USC, I met John. A big reason I went there was because of him. He mentored me, watched my short films, talked to me about classes. They stayed engaged with their calling and their communities, and I try to follow in their footsteps. I can do a better job, but with our company, Proximity Media — with Zinzi and Sev — one of our executives started an internship program, and we pay young folks coming through. That’s a beautiful way to stay engaged. We’ve been able to work with incredible filmmakers — we produced Shaka [King’s] second feature, “Judas and the Black Messiah.” Spike and John were great at that kind of mentorship and community-building. I’m trying to stay engaged as an artist and as a member of the communities I’m involved with.\n\t\n\t\tOver 3,100 Oscar statuettes have been given out in history, and only 20 have gone to Black women. Your wife Zinzi, could be one of those. If you win best director, it would be history. No Black person has ever stood on that stage to accept that specific category in 98 years. Have you let yourself think about that?\t\n\n\tMan, that’s a good question. I can’t say I’ve given it a ton of thought. Hearing those numbers saddens me, but I cheer myself up thinking about how many brilliant Black women filmmakers I’ve worked with. I know the truth — that statistic is a lie about the reality. I know there have been Black directors who changed the arc of global cinema — they changed my life and got me into this business that gives me purpose. I’d rather celebrate what they did, against all odds, than lament what award they didn’t get. With all respect to the Academy — and I love so many people involved — my award is the opportunity to have this job: to write a script, get a crew together, hire union jobs, contribute to people’s health care and their families. The fact that I have this job, and can continue to have it, is the greatest gift. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhen people bring up awards stats and representation, how do you process that?\t\n\n\tWhat I’m always trying to do is focus. I pray for better focus every day. What I love about this job is it allows me to be organized and keep things in perspective, be clear in my motivation. Each time I make something, I’m trying to make the best thing I can. Because filmmaking is a team sport, I try to hire the best people I can for each position — and then be the best leader I can be, which usually means getting out of the way. Making sure folks have what they need: budget, a clear script, clear conversations, an open door when they need clarity. Everybody I’ve worked with has been the best person for the job I could find in the moment. And I love Zinzi to death — but if she wasn’t a good producer, I wouldn’t be working with her. I have too much respect for the job. Once we’re done, it’s for the audience, critics and voters to decide whether the work is exemplary. The women you mentioned are remarkable — among the best to ever do it — and I keep hiring them because they’re great. I don’t reflect on records much, because it’s not my job.\n\t\n\t\tOn this very podcast, Denzel Washington apologized to you for leaking the “Black Panther 3” news. Any update you can share to return the favor?\t\n\n\tI wish I could help, bro. All I can tell you is I’m excited about it.\n\t\n\t\tMy older sister is the biggest fan of “The X-Files” and she’s excited for your interpretation. Could tell me something I can tell her about the series?\t\n\n\tTell your big sister we’re working hard every day to blow her mind. The last thing we want to do is let her down. We’re working to make something special — that’s all I got.\n\t\n\t\tImposter syndrome is real. How do you deal with it?\t\n\n\tTherapy has been helpful — through WGA health insurance. Doing it once a week, or once every couple weeks, makes a difference, because that stuff never leaves you. Another thing that helps — and it’s kind of cheating, because you can’t control this — I’m married to somebody I’ve known since I was a kid. Zinzi and I are from the same place, know the same people. When crazy things happen, you can look over and say, ‘Is this really happening?’ And I’ve never left home. I’m from the East Bay, so it’s a quick flight from L.A. I get to go home — and people care a little, but they really don’t care about what’s happening in film and TV. It humbles you quick. Being able to do things that make you feel like yourself is the biggest thing. When this is at its best, it’s a job — a job you’re passionate about, a calling — but still a job. And you’ve got to be a dad, a husband, a friend, a cousin, an uncle, a little brother. If you keep it in perspective, I think that’s how you win.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou and Zinzi made history as the first Black married couple to be nominated together. What’s it like to work with someone you love?\t\n\n\tIt’s nice. She’s sharp with story and navigating artists — we’re a particular type of people. Her parents are artists, too. She’s been married to me forever, so she has a hack for keeping creative people together. And she’s a winner — she just is. She was an incredible athlete. More people knew her than me coming up because she kicked ass on the track. She’d beat you at a game she’s never played. Mini golf — she’s hitting trick shots. Cards — she gets the best hand. She just wins. I want her on my team. It’s the first movie she produced, and the results reflect that.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

'cause his current wife has filed -- and it's the fifth time between the two.\n      \n    \n          TMZ obtained the docs, showing Lesley Beador has officially pulled the plug on their marriage. She's asking for legal and physical custody of their 5-year-old daughter, Anna Love Beador ... but she does check the box for David to be granted visitation.\n      \n    \n          Lesley is also seeking spousal support ... and wants the court to block any spousal support award to David.\n      \n    \n          The couple apparently tied the knot in 2020, but their marriage has been a legal revolving door ever since. David first filed for divorce in September 2022 ... then again in May 2023. Lesley filed in September 2024 ... followed by David filing in June 2025. Every single time the cases were dismissed before the divorce could be finalized.\n      \n    \n          As for David’s history in the marriage department, this obviously isn’t his first headline-making split. He separated from Shannon in 2017 after 17 years of marriage, and their divorce was finalized two years later.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Shannon Beador\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

After pics were posted to social media, comments began popping up that a family member got unceremoniously bounced. Naturally, it was assumed to be a cold-hearted move ... and people wanted an explanation.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Danielle Raines, Shirley's daughter, tells TMZ … a family member was asked to leave the service ... but the reason is the person has mental health issues -- and they were not on the list for the private service. They showed up anyway, and a scene ensued.\n      \n\n          Danielle made clear to us ... there was nothing mean-spirited about it. The person's removal was matter-of-fact, and was best for the attendees.\n      \n    \n          The narrative spreading on social media needs this context, Danielle says ... because matters like this make it even harder for the family during a very difficult time.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we told you ... Shirley was found unresponsive in her Nevada home late last month during a wellness check. She was later pronounced dead.\n      \n    \n          A public memorial will be held Saturday via Beauty 2 The Streetz at the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Shirley Raines\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Death\n              \n                          \n                TV Stars\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                Culture\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tThe 11th edition of the Cairo Film Connection, integrated within the Cairo Industry Days, has selected 15 projects – five feature films in post-production, and 10 projects in development, for its competition, including an intensive program of pitching sessions, from Nov. 15-20. It runs as part of the Cairo Film Festival.\n\n\tThe 15 projects, which include co-productions, are from 10 countries: four from Egypt, three from Lebanon, two from Iraq, two from Palestine, and one project each from Tunisia, Jordan, Sudan, Algeria and Yemen.\n\t\n\n\tThe awards, including a main prize for post-production and another for development, will be judged by a jury comprised by Palestinian director Hany Abu-Asaad, Portuguese festival director Susana Santos Rodrigues, and Egyptian director Ayten Amin.\n\n\n\tRodrigo Brum, head of Cairo Film Connection, spoke to Variety about his priorities for this year’s edition.\n\n\tThis is your second year at the helm of the Cairo Film Connection. What were the key lessons from last year’s edition and how have you structured this year’s edition?When I took over the Cairo Film Connection last year, my immediate task was to ensure the event came together successfully within a very limited timeframe.\n\n\tThere was no time for major reforms, so that edition became an exercise in observation: understanding what worked and, more importantly, what needed to change.\n\n\tPeople wanted real conversations and genuine exchanges, not rehearsed moments and staged performances.\n\n\tThis year we have taken clear steps in that direction. For instance, we don’t impose rehearsed pitches or a fixed language. Teams can present in Arabic, French or English, and if they wish to rehearse, we offer technical support. It all depends on what each project needs.\n\t\n\n\tThe aim is to create space for authenticity and for the plurality of voices that define the region’s cinema, rather than forcing them into a single model of a co-production market.\n\n\tWhat synergies exist between the CFC and the host event, Cairo Industry Days and the wider festival?I see the Cairo Film Connection as the most vibrant section of Cairo Film Festival, and the place where the festival truly breathes. It is the beating heart of Cairo Industry Days, the space where new blood, new energy, and new ideas circulate most intensely. We hope this energy will only grow stronger as we continue to affirm that cinema is not shaped by institutional models, but through encounter, conversation, and risk.\n\n\tWhat are the main strengths of the CFC within the Arab film world, in terms of helping projects and fostering co-productions?Our main strength lies in building bridges, not just financial ones, but creative and curatorial ones. We hope the Cairo Film Connection continues to be one of the few spaces where projects from across the Arab world can meet within an international framework that remains firmly grounded in local realities. From last year’s edition, both projects that received our main prizes, one in post-production and one in development, have continued to receive major recognition and we hope they will soon move toward the festival circuit.\n\n\t“You Don’t Die Two Times” by Ager Ouslati, which won our main post-production award, later received the IDFA Bertha Fund and the top prize at Amman Industry Days. Eliane Raheb’s “The North Wind,” recipient of our main development award, won this year’s CineGouna Platform Award for post-production. Beyond the awards, we have also seen projects find key artistic collaborators through the CFC, which can be just as transformative as financial support.\n\n\tHow does the selection process work?This is perhaps the task that demands the greatest sense of responsibility. It is not only about choosing a sharp and diverse selection committee, but also about ensuring that our assessment is fair to the projects themselves. Too often, co-production platforms lean toward selecting projects from established filmmakers or producers, and I can only hope this comes from genuine belief in the work rather than a desire for visibility or safety.\n\t\n\n\tI was fortunate this year to collaborate with a committee I fully trust, one that engaged deeply with every submission, based on a balanced and nuanced discussion. Our goal was not to select familiar industry names, projects already validated by other platforms, or works tailored to European festival tastes.\n\n\tThe real questions were simple: Is the project necessary? How clear and coherent is its artistic concept? And, given the limited financial support offered by the Cairo Film Connection, does it express an urgent need to be supported now? This year, we received close to 200 applications, which is, I believe, a remarkable number given the overall quality of submissions.\n\n\tGiven that the projects span the entire Middle East and North Africa region, do you see transversal trends, or are there mainly more sub-regional trends?Although my academic background might suggest an inclination to identify patterns or define categories, I tend to approach the selection from the opposite perspective. What interests me most are the differences, the singularities, and the distinct artistic vocabularies emerging from, against, and beyond each context.\n\n\tOf course, there are both shared concerns and distinct sensibilities across the cinemas of North Africa, the Levant, and the Gulf, or whatever geopolitical nomenclature one chooses to adopt. But what truly stands out are the specific ways in which filmmakers translate these concerns into form.\n\n\tThe richness of the Cairo Film Connection lies precisely in this diversity: each project speaks its own cinematic language, shaped by its own approach to history or storytelling and its own conditions of production.\n\n\tIn view of recent turbulence in the region, in particular the conflict in Gaza, how is this reflected in the films selected, for example in the Lebanese film “The Day of Wrath,” the Palestinian project “Revolutionaries Never Die,” or others?Filmmakers very often further advance their projects between the moment of submission and their public pitch, so I would prefer not to talk about how a project reflects a specific reality in definitive terms. That said, there is a discernible engagement in both projects you mentioned with the reordering of archives, with the creation of a new context for collective history, and with an effort to reimagine politics of representation (in a way that I believe responds to what you describe as “turbulence” or “conflict” in the region, or in Gaza).\n\t\n\n\tWhat stands out is not a direct depiction of crisis, but rather a critical negotiation with memory, historical awareness, and its cinematic expression. Through their film language, both works challenge the colonial frameworks that have historically shaped how the region’s histories are seen and narrated, while simultaneously reclaiming and rethinking the order of their own histories and epistemologies.\n\n\tRegarding the specific situation in Gaza, “Ping-Pong” is a particularly compelling project in development that explores, primarily through sound, the uncanny rhythm of grief and its constant back-and-forth.\n\n\tIn addition to the social realism documentaries and fiction, are we seeing genre films (horror, sci-fi, crime, comedy etc.) within the selection of films?While genre is not a dominant mode among the selected projects this year, some filmmakers are reappropriating elements of genre, not as formulas, but as tools to experiment with new forms of storytelling.\n\n\tCan you tell me a bit more about the changes made since last year?Last year we began introducing live translation in the pitching sessions. Not for all projects, as we didn’t yet have the full infrastructure, but wherever it was requested. The response was overwhelmingly positive. Many filmmakers and producers are not confident pitching in English, which creates an imbalance that is deeply unfair within a competitive setting. So this year the live translation is fully available in all pitches.\n\n\tAs for mentors, I remain critical of that function, especially when they come from industries such as Hollywood or Europe and assume they know the “standards” to be reinforced. On one hand, they often have limited understanding of the region and the specificities of producing here; on the other, they tend to treat film language as a homogeneous space that ignores geopolitical and cultural particularities. We do not need that.\n\n\tWhat we need is to create conditions where participants can present their projects comfortably, in their own languages and through their own modes of expression, even with their uncertainties and imperfections. The goal is to make the experience less about performance and more about dialogue, about fostering genuine, long-term collaborations rather than transactional encounters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNewcomer Lauren Morais and Diane Morgan, best known on TV screens for her comedy creation Philomena Cunk, have joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as part of the upcoming Disney+ series “VisionQuest.”\n\n\tDescribed as the third part of a trilogy that includes “WandaVision” and “Agatha All Along,” the show sees Paul Bettany reprise his role as the super-powered android Vision alongside James Spader, Todd Stashwick, Ruaridh Mollica, T’Nia Miller, Emily Hampshire, Orla Brady, Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer and James D’Arcy.\n\t\n\n\tVariety understands that Morais is playing Lisa Molinari, a character closely connected to Mollica’s Thomas Shepherd, while Morgan is playing an associate of Stashwick’s character, Paladin.\n\n\n\t“VisionQuest” will mark the biggest role yet for young Welsh actress Morais, whose TV credits include “Mudtown,” “The Red King” and “The Crow Girl.” Morgan, meanwhile, alongside her long-standing character Cunk, is known for hit BBC comedy “Motherland” and Netflix’s darkly comic “After Life.” Ironically, she’s set to play an android herself in the upcoming BBC comedy series “Ann Droid,” which she co-created alongside Sarah Kendall. \n\n\tCreated by Terry Matalas, the eight-episode “VisionQuest” — part of the MCU’s Phase Six — shot in the U.K.’s Pinewood Studios earlier this year and is scheduled to debut on Disney+ in late 2026.\n\n\tIn a trailer revealed exclusively at the New York Comic Con last month, Bettany was shown as White Vision from the ending of “WandaVision,” plus a regular-looking human version. There was also human versions of Ultron, who was voiced by James Spader in the second “Avengers” movie, and the AI programs Jarvis, Friday and Edith. At the end of the trailer, there was a brief glimpse of an adult Tommy, Vision and Wanda’s son that appeared as a child in “WandaVision.”\n\t\n\n\tMorais is repped by Rachel Chambers at JAG. Morgan is repped by United Agents.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBangkok-based horror distribution and production studio FearFolks is launching operations in India, the company revealed at the American Film Market (AFM). \n\n\tThe third installment of Thailand’s hit horror franchise “Death Whisperer” will serve as the company’s inaugural release in the subcontinent’s burgeoning genre market.\n\n\tThe move represents a strategic expansion for FearFolks and its majority shareholder Benetone Film Group, capitalizing on India’s growing appetite for genre fare and the franchise’s proven track record across Southeast Asia.\n\t\n\n\t“FearFolks India is one of our many milestones in the next coming years as we expand across different markets,” said Hans Audric Estialbo, CEO of FearFolks. “India is the perfect extension for us, as the horror genre in the country is experiencing a significant renaissance and substantial growth, driven by evolving audience preferences, improved production quality, and the successful blending of horror with other genres like action and comedy.”\n\n\n\tThe “Death Whisperer” franchise has emerged as a commercial juggernaut in Thailand. The 2023 original earned $15.2 million locally, while last year’s sequel surged to $24.7 million, establishing it as one of the highest-grossing Thai films ever made and cementing the series as one of Southeast Asia’s most successful horror properties.\n\n\tThe latest entry, directed by Narit Yuvaboon, who produced the first two films, has generated some $13.6 million in Thailand to date. The film brings back Nadech Kugimiya in a lead role, with his character embarking on a mission to rescue his youngest sister from a mysterious cult operating in a cursed village.\n\t\n\n\tRachvin Narita, executive director at FearFolks, pointed to the evolution of Indian horror cinema as a key factor in the expansion strategy. “The variety of horror films in India has expanded significantly from earlier low-budget, formulaic productions to include diverse subgenres rooted in rich folklore and contemporary social themes,” he said.\n\n\tThe India launch aligns with broader ambitions at Benetone Film Group, which sees the distribution push as part of its evolution into a vertically integrated production and distribution entity with global reach.\n\n\t“Through FearFolks, Benetone Films’ expansion into sales and distribution, coupled with its established presence in India, affirms our role as a global, full-service production powerhouse, seamlessly bridging creative vision with international distribution capabilities,” said Kulthep Narula, COO of Benetone Films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmazon is the latest of the big ad-supported streamers to lay claim to what it portrays as a growing audience — even though the numbers aren’t vetted by standard measurement services.\n\n\tThe digital giant said Tuesday that its Prime Video streaming service now reaches more than 315 million people around the world, compared with a figure of 200 million it disclosed in April of 2024. Amazon said the count was based on its own internal data over a period of 12 months, from September of last year through August of this year.\n\t\n\n\tAmazon issues the number just days after Netflix made similar claims based on its own data, and not that of a widely accepted third-party measurement service. Netflix said it would switch to a count of “monthly active viewers,,” which it defines as “members who have watched at least one minute of ads on Netflix per month multiplied by the estimated average number of people within a household.”\n\n\n\tBoth Amazon and Netflix are striving to become more competitive with more traditional peers in the battle to win ad dollars from Madison Avenue. While there is no denying the companies’ power in terms of developing compelling content, both have considerably less experience than many traditional media conglomerates when it comes to ad sales.  Netflix has been racing to build line-ups of live specials and sports when the bulk of its offering comes from scripted drama, comedy and movies — the type of stuff that viewers tend to stream on their own, at moments of their own choosing, rather than together, which is still what many advertisers crave.\n\t\n\n\tAmazon said its figure represents “an unduplicated average monthly active ad-supported audience across  both its original and licensed content, live sports and events and FAST channels on Prime Video. “This expanded audience across 16 countries demonstrates our customer-obsessed approach to enhancing the viewing experience while delivering powerful opportunities for brands,” said Jeremy Helfand, vice president, Prime Video Advertising. “We’re just beginning to unlock what’s possible when premium entertainment, engaged viewers, and innovative ad-tech converge with relevant and performant advertising at this unprecedented scale.”\n\n\t The only people who need to accept Amazon’s tabulation, of course, are its advertisers and their media-buying proxies.\n\n\t.\n",

It’s set for a theatrical release in the spring and is actively campaigning for Best Documentary Feature, with a focus on this year’s Oscars and BAFTAs. \n\n\n\tThe distribution deal was negotiated by Hamza Ali, co-founder of Watermelon Pictures, and Mundy-Castle, who also serves as executive producer through his Doc Hearts\n\n\t“Shoot the People” is described as an “intimate and urgent” portrait of Harriman, whose has helped bring the global struggle for justice into powerful visual focus. From his breakthrough images during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests to capturing photos of the Palestinian liberation movement, Hariman is also known for his historic achievement as the first Black man to photograph a British Vogue cover. The film follows his travels across continents as he documents activists, artists, and everyday citizens standing up against inequality — while reflecting on the transformative power of art to inspire collective action.\n\t\n\n\t“We made this film to celebrate those who stand up and those who document truth in real time,” said Mundy-Castle. “Working with Watermelon Pictures—a company rooted in courage and community—feels like the perfect alignment.

    "body": "\n\tUpcoming VR game “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City” plans to focus on one part of the turtles’ lives that often gets overshadowed by the butt-kicking action in other “TMNT”-inspired games: time spent bonding with your brothers in your cozy lair in the sewers.\n\n\tIn a new gameplay teaser exclusive to Variety, which readers can view in the video above, “TMNT: Empire City” creative director Ace St Germain walks players through what the experience will be like in the lair when you strap on the VR headset and start playing as Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo or Michelangelo.\n\t\n\n\t“You put the headset on and you wake up with three fingers in each hand, two toes on each foot and a shell on your back,” St. Germain says in a voiceover. “As a turtle, you need to be able to feel the world, pick up all the objects around you, take in the familiar aesthetics and be surrounded by your family. In all iterations of the world of ‘TMNT,’ the lair probably stands out as the most iconic location. Our goal was to make it feel like home. A place you can come back to time and time again after a long day of fighting the criminal element topside. A place you an relax, play games and hang out with your friends and family. And we can’t wait to get you into the shell so you too can love being a turtle.”\n\n\tFrom Beyond Frames and Cortopia Studios, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City” is set to release in 2026 and is available for wishlisting on Meta Quest and Steam VR. \n\n\tThe game, which will mark the first “TMNT” VR game, was made in consultation with Tom Waltz, writer on the iconic “Turtles” work, “The Last Ronin.” “Empire City” is coning at a time of resurgence in turtle power, as multiple other “TMNT” projects are in the works based on Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s original work.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA24 has released a new trailer for “Marty Supreme,” Josh Safdie‘s sports dramedy starring Timothée Chalamet as table-tennis prodigy Marty Mauser. \n\n\tSet in the 1950s, “Marty Supreme” follows Marty Mauser as he chases his dream of becoming a table-tennis champion. The film is a fictionalized account of the real-life Marty Reisman, who won five world championship medals in table tennis. \n\n\n\tIn addition to Chalamet, the cast includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Fran Drescher, Tyler Okonma (known professionally as Tyler, the Creator), Penn Jillette, Odessa A’zion, “Shark Tank” personality Kevin O’Leary (aka Mr. Wonderful) and Abel Ferrara. \n\t\n\n\tJosh Safdie’s last feature film was 2019’s “Uncut Gems,” which he co-directed and co-wrote with his brother, Benny Safdie. “Marty Supreme” marks Josh Safdie’s first solo feature since his 2008 debut, “The Pleasure of Being Robbed.” He co-wrote “Marty Supreme” with Ronald Bronstein, and the film is produced by Safdie, Bronstein, Eli Bush, Anthony Katagas, Chalamet and A24.\n\n\n\tIn October, “Marty Supreme” received a standing ovation during a secret screening at the 63rd New York Film Festival, where Chalamet and Josh Safdie made a surprise appearance alongside Paltrow, Okonma, A’zion and co-writer Bronstein. \n\n\t“This movie — in many ways, beyond being about Marty Mauser — is a love letter to New York,” Chalamet said on stage, adding that he was “so thrilled” to debut his latest film in the city.\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” has since garnered Oscar buzz, with Variety‘s chief awards editor Clayton Davis writing in an analysis, “In a season where four films are tracking with 10 or more predicted nominations, A24’s ‘Marty Supreme’ has just landed — and it’s looking like the spoiler very few saw coming. Much like its protagonist, played by Timothée Chalamet — a young man with a dream no one respects, who goes to hell and back in pursuit of greatness — the film could be the dark horse the Oscar race didn’t realize it needed.”\n\t\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” opens in theaters on Dec. 25. Watch the new trailer below.’\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Buzzheart,” the latest feature from Dennis Iliadis, director of the Blumhouse-backed “Delirium” and Wes Craven remake “The Last House on the Left,” has closed North America (Dark Star Pictures) and Germany Austria, and Switzerland (Busch Media) before this year’s American Film Market. \n\n\tSecured by Paris-based B-Rated International, further deals take in Brazil (Belas Arte Group) and Spanish-speaking Latin America (Dexterity Entertainment). \n\t\n\n\tB-Rated International is also planning to handle the French rights on “Buzzheart” for a domestic release in early 2026. The U.K. and Ireland are currently under advanced negotiation, Arnaud Chevallier, B-Rated International CEO, told Variety.\n\n\n\t“Buzzheart” world premiered in main competition at last year’s Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival. It also played the MotelX Lisbon Intl. Horror Film Festival. \n\n\tIliadis has carved out a career trying to bring something new to genre, such as, working with Craven, more polished production values and scenes censored in the 1972 “The Last House on the Left.” \n\n\t“Buzzheart” equally delivers as a genre-bending psychological mystery-thriller. Set in Iliadis’ native Greece in the 1990s, Argyris, a timid 18-year-old, visits a massage parlour where he instantly smitten by the masseuse, Mary, way out of his league. In a surprise turn, she gives him a handjob and invites him as her boyfriend to meet her parents. \n\n\tArgyris can’t believe his luck. There, Mary’s mother – “the last true experimental behaviourist” says her husband, Yorgos – subjects him to increasingly bizarre and sinister challenges to prove Argyris’s love and that he is worthy of Mary. Things take a more sinister turn as Yorgos becomes increasingly violent. \n\t\n\n\tAs “Buzzheart” builds to a climax, however, Iliadis flips conventional genre. \n\n\t“I wanted to use all the elements I’ve learned in my American films which, in the end, were getting a bit too ‘standard horrorish’ and do something ideally more deep and human,” he told Eye for Film. “Usually you have people pretending they are normal and they turn out to be weird but here the people are weird and you discover their humanity at the very end.”\n\n\t“We are delighted to bring Dennis Iliadis’s new feature to such a wide range of territories and look forward to building a strong relationship with this talented filmmaker,” Chevallier told Variety. Further deals are expected to close before the end of the year, along with additional opportunities through the remake rights which B-Rated is handling in collaboration with Iliadis, he added.\n\n\t“Buzzheart” is produced by Greece’s Panoply Films and Amanda Livanou’s Neda Films, with U.S-based Twin7.\n\n\tIt forms part of a sales slate at B-Rated International, launched in late 2024 by former Mediawan international sales- acquisitions executive Chevallier. \n\n\tFurther titles include 2024 Tallinn Black Nights premiere “The Exalted,” from Latvia’s “Soviet Jeans” director Juris Kursietis;  Yannis Dimolitsas’ docu-drama “Maria Callas – Monica Bellucci: An Encounter,” with Bellucci exploring the life of Callas through letters and little-seen footage, and Ivana Mladenovic’s Locarno competition contender “Sorella di Clausura,” hailed by Variety as a “funny, bawdy sociosexual satire that’s as tasteful as the times we live in.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHit-of-the-week popcorn movies are all about escapism, but they’re almost never about play. That’s the appeal of the “Now You See Me” films. They’ve got elements of action and crime and snarky screwball teamwork, but they’re like the “Fast and Furious” films with the speedy car chases replaced by sleight-of-hand deception. They’re hybrid magic-trick genre movies that entertain you by making your eyes widen a bit, the way a good magician does. They indulge in the play of playing you. \n\t\n\n\tThe third and latest entry in the series, “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” fools us for a while into thinking it’s a heist movie, as our trusty team of flimflam conjurers, the Four Horsemen, are joined by three next-generation illusionists — wouldn’t you know it, they’re social-activist magicians! — to steal the largest diamond in the world, a fist-size chunk of ice known as the Heart Diamond. It belongs to Veronika van der Berg (Rosamund Pike), a rapacious South African magnate whose family built its diamond empire on the back of that giant stone.\n\n\n\tOne of the things that’s slightly cheesy about the “Now You See Me” movies, in a highly likable way, is that you can practically hear the pitch meeting they came out of in which someone said, “Let’s cross ‘The Prestige’ with the ‘Ocean’s’ films and a dash of ‘Magic: Impossible’!” But the pleasurable thing about the “NYSM” movies is that you can never totally pin down where they’re going. They always pull the ground out from under the rug out from under the audience. And while it may be true that a good magician never reveals his tricks, the “Now You See Me” movies always reveal their tricks, in a way that only makes them seem trickier.\n\t\n\n\t“Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” opens with the Four Horseman staging a 10-year reunion show in a warehouse in Bushwick, Brooklyn. As each of them appears on stage, only to get sucked like ghosts into the body of a volunteer, we’re like, “What is happening? Are they practicing real live magic now?” That’s the gullibility these movies tap into — our desire, underneath it all, to believe the impossible.\n\n\tIn this case, the Four Horsemen were never even there. They were conjured, via hologram, by their fannish Gen-Z inheritors: Bosco (Dominic Sessa), June (Ariana Greenblatt), and Charlie (Justice Smith), who want to use magic to make the world a better place; that’s why their show ends with the unmasking of a crypto hustler, and the spreading of his stolen wealth to the bank accounts of everyone there. As much as the younger three revere the older four, “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” uses its expanded team of con-artist illusionists to build on the puckishly aggro spirit of the series. They’re all working together, but the film can barely get two magicians in the same room without setting off abrasive sparks of rivalry, which now takes the form of generational razzing.\n\n\tIn “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” that quick-draw tension is incarnated by Jesse Eisenberg’s performance as J. Daniel Atlas, the leader of the Four Horseman. Yes, we’re used to seeing him take the piss out of Woody Harrelson’s Merritt McKinney, the snarky mentalist in a pork-pie hat. But I don’t recall Eisenberg giving a performance this domineering in “Now You See Me” (2013) or “Now You See Me 2” (2016). It’s been nine years since that last installment, and from the moment Daniel arrives, in the flattened hair that flatters him, Eisenberg is verbally locked and loaded, ramping up the one-upmanship, tossing the direct-gaze insults, keeping each encounter wired. (There’s a great bit where he tells Veronika that convincing the world it needed to buy diamonds was the ultimate magic trick.) It might be an overstatement to say that Eisenberg is at his most commanding when he plays a-holes, but his presence in “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” is gripping the way it was in “The Social Network.” He’s like Danny Ocean reborn as a terse megalomaniac of illusion.\n\n\tHe shows up in the hipster headquarters of the younger three, ready to recruit them for a mission masterminded by the Eye, the shadowy overseer who’s the “NYSM” equivalent of MI6 or S.H.I.E.L.D. or the High Table. The magicians are ordered to go to Antwerp, where Veronika is courting wealthy clients (her real business is using diamonds to launder dirty money), which means putting the Heart Diamond on display. Their plan for stealing it right out from under her involves everything from impersonating a Vanity Fair photographer to having Daniel crash the party with a big speech that’s a masterpiece of indirection.\n\t\n\n\tThey escape in a rooftop helicopter that turns into a flat piece of cardboard, only to land in a French chateau that’s a booby-trapped museum of magic, from the metal puzzle door that Dave Franco’s Jack and Greenblatt’s June vie to crack open to the hall of mirrors to the upside-down rooms. There are times you may think, “Script by David Koepp and M.C. Escher.” The director, Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland”), picking up where Louis Leterrier and Jon M. Chu left off, finds room for a Motocross race and Lady Gaga’s “Abracadabra.” And the action ranges from dueling card tricks to the kind of honest-to-God fights that merely serve to remind us that balletic action films really are magic tricks.\n\n\tMorgan Freeman’s Thaddeus shows up, still twinkling with duplicity. Dominic Sessa, in his first major movie since “The Holdovers,” confirms his sloe-eyed appeal, which by the end made me think that he might be the second coming of Daniel Stern. The story finds room for both Isla Fisher (returning from the first film) and her sequel replacement, Lizzy Caplan, so that there are now Five Horseman. Harrelson brandishes that anything-goes leer that never gets old. Rosamund Pike, playing the spirit of loving filthy lucre over life itself, elevates a standard villain through the high timing of her theatrical hauteur. And the climax, picking up on the metaphysical sleight-of-hand that powered “Now You See Me 2,” lifts the veil of deception off reality itself. And does it all in good fun. Which is all this movie is or needs to be.\n",

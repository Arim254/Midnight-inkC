    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery has been telling investors it wants to split the company in two — and just produced some evidence that such a deal is necessary.\n\n\tThe owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. studio said it swung to a loss in the third quarter, as a box-office boost spurred by films like the latest “Superman” were offset by declines in its traditional TV business, which suffered from comparisons to the year-earlier quarter when the company enjoyed rights to broadcast the 2024 Paris Olympics in Europe. The company has been pushing to separate its studios and streaming operations from its TV networks, and has said it will consider a sale or other transaction.\n\t\n\n\tWhile our separation into Warner Bros. (Streaming & Studios) and Discovery Global (Global Networks) remains on track to be completed by mid-2026, our Board of Directors announced on October 21st its decision to initiate a review of strategic alternatives. The Board is evaluating a broad range of strategic options, including proceeding with the planned separation, a potential transaction for the entire company, or separate transactions for the Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses. As part of the review, we will also consider an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger transaction involving Warner Bros., while Discovery Global would be spun off to our shareholders.” the company said in a letter to shareholders. “There is no deadline or definitive timetable regarding this strategic review process. We do not intend to make any further announcements unless and until the Board approves a specific transaction or otherwise determines further disclosure is appropriate or necessary. As such, we will not be answering any questions on this topic during our earnings call.”\n\t\n\n\tRevenue during the period came to $9.0 billion, a 6% decrease from the year-earlier quarter. Without including the performance of the Europe Olympics, revenue would have been flat, the company said.\n\n\tMore to come….\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrench star Camille Cottin (“Call My Agent“) has been tapped to host the 51st César Awards ceremony, France’s equivalent to the Oscars. \n\n\tThe ceremony will take place on Feb. 27 at the Olympia theater in Paris, and is being organized by the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma and Canal+, its main sponsor. \n\n\tCottin broke out internationally playing Andrea, a fearless and funny talent agent in Fanny Herrero’s “Call My Agent” and went on to star in the BBC series “Killing Eve.” Cottin has since established herself as one of the most versatile talents in French cinema. Her big-screen breakout came with “Connasse, princesse des cœurs,” the feature adaptation of her Canal+ series by the same name, which earned her a César nomination for most promising actress in 2016. She’s worked with a roster of top French filmmakers, including Cédric Klapisch (“Deux Moi”), Christophe Honoré (“Chambre 212”), Emmanuel Mouret (“Trois amies”), and Bruno Dumont (“L’Empire”). Cottin has also made her mark internationally, starring opposite Matt Damon in Tom McCarthy’s “Stillwater,” and starred in Ridley Scott’s “House of Gucci” alongside Lady Gaga and Adam Driver. She also joined Kenneth Branagh’s ensemble in “Murder on the Orient Express.”\n\t\n\n\tCottin’s recent credits include Pierre Schoeller’s “Rembrandt,” Nathan Ambrosioni’s “Les Enfants vont bien,” and Tamara Stepanyan’s “Le Pays d’Arto.” She’s also reprising her role as Andrea in Netflix’s “Call My Agent” movie, alongside the key cast of the series. \n\n\n\tCottin hosted the Cannes Film Festival’s opening and closing ceremonies in 2024. She’ll succeed Catherine Deneuve as the Cesar’s presenter.  As previously announced, Jim Carrey will receive the honorary Cesar Award.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tBased on Candice Millard’s 2011 novel “Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President,” Netflix’s newest limited series, “Death by Lightning,” follows President James Garfield, the oft-forgotten 20th president of the United States, and the man who assassinated him, Charles Guiteau. Created by Mike Makowsky (“Bad Education”) and executive produced by the “Game of Thrones” duo David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the four-part series serves as a historical remembrance and an ominous omen.\n\t\n\n\t“Death by Lightning” opens in 1969 at the Army Medical Museum. Workers are startled when a jar tumbles out of a dusty box and rolls onto the ground. Upon analyzing it, they realize it’s the brain of Charles J. Guiteau (Matthew Macfadyen), and had been tucked away on a shelf for nearly a century. From there, the series rolls back to 1880. The audience meets Charles, who is completing yet another stint in jail, this time for false pretenses and evading arrest. A couple of states away in Ohio, Civil War veteran and Congressman James Garfield (Michael Shannon) is summoned from his family farm to Chicago for the Republican National Convention. \n\n\n\tThough Garfield is attending the RNC reluctantly to give a speech in support of his friend, Congressman James Blaine (Bradley Whitford), for the presidency, his rousing oration inadvertently earns him the nomination. Garfield’s wife, Crete (Betty Gilpin), doesn’t even learn he’s on the ballot until eager supporters begin showing up on her front lawn. As Garfield hesitantly moves forward with his campaign, he is forced to align with Chester Arthur (Nick Offerman), who unexpectedly becomes his running mate, and with the domineering but highly influential Senator Roscoe Conkling (Shea Whigham).\n\t\n\n\tFollowing Garfield’s ascension, Charles becomes increasingly fixated on Garfield. Abandoning his plans to start a newspaper, he begins a desperate scheme to be a part of the Garfield campaign and later, his administration. “Death by Lightning” showcases the lives of two men, both determined to make their mark on the world, but for very different reasons. The series follows Garfield as he cuts through red tape and bureaucracy to create a path for the voiceless — namely, formally enslaved Black Americans and immigrants — and Charles, who deludes himself into believing he played a vital role in getting Garfield and Arthur in the White House. The men’s lives fatally collide at a train station just three months after Garfield is sworn into office.\n\n\tDuring a calmer political moment, “Death by Lightning” may have been received differently. However, amid the current turmoil in all three branches of our government, the show echoes a tone of hopelessness. Just 100 years after the country’s founding, the highest office of the land was rife with corruption and greed. The stain of slavery and the horrors of the Civil War remained palpable, and many citizens clung on to what once was — including their racism and xenophobia — instead of looking ahead toward a more progressive future. One hundred forty-five years later, watching privileged men scream and rant while hoarding power, opportunities and food over others feels like the United States has remained stagnant. These struggles remain at the core of our republic, and we, as Americans, appear doomed to continue in this helpless cycle. \n\n\tEven so, for those who enjoy history, the series is beautifully acted and detailed. Yet, four episodes feel excessive, especially since so much time is spent with Charles. Macfadyen is diligent in his portrayal of an obviously unwell man, traumatized by his difficult childhood and never having received the proper care. Unfortunately, forcing the audience to linger in his mania adds very little to the story overall. Though viewers get glimpses of his past, including his lengthy stint in a sex cult and his sister Franny’s (Paula Malcomson) whispers about their upbringing, seeing those elements play out would’ve been more effective. Instead, watching Charles attempt to insert himself into the Garfield Administration by forging papers and sneaking into buildings feels repetitive and a bit dull. \n\t\n\n\tStill, while “Death by Lightning” isn’t the most riveting political drama, it is refreshing to see a depiction of a forgotten man who could have put our country on an alternative course. By centering Garfield, Makowsky, and director Matt Ross showcase a man committed to civil rights and determined to clean up the grit and rot within the government. Had he lived, America today might look wildly different.\n\n\t“Death by Lightning” is now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Royal Shakespeare Company has unveiled the full cast for its acclaimed production of “Twelfth Night,” directed by “The Crown” star Prasanna Puwanarajah, which transfers to London’s Barbican. \n\n\tFollowing a sold-out, five-star run in Stratford-upon-Avon that earned Puwanarajah the U.K. Theatre Award for best director, the show continues its life in the capital with a mix of returning cast members and fresh faces. Gwyneth Keyworth (“Death Valley,” “Misfits”) reprises her role as Viola, alongside Daniel Monks (“Pulse,” “Teenage Dick”) as Orsino in his RSC debut.\n\t\n\n\tThey join Freema Agyeman (“Doctor Who,” “New Amsterdam”) as Olivia, Michael Grady-Hall (“Venice Preserved,” “Imperium”) as Feste, and Samuel West (“Slow Horses,” “All Creatures Great and Small”) as Malvolio.\n\n\n\t“The Stratford run was busy and buzzy and the Barbican is such an iconic place to play a Shakespeare play,” said Puwanarajah. “I’m looking forward to getting back in the rehearsal room with this incredible company of performers and creatives, including new family member Daniel Monks this time around. Christmas is a time of year to be together and laugh, and also to remember people. I’m so happy to say that this production really delivered this for audiences last year.”\n\n\tThe full ensemble includes Emily Benjamin (Priest), Norman Bowman (Antonio), George Fletcher (Second Officer/Orsino’s Attendant), Demetri Goritsas (Sir Andrew Aguecheek), Danielle Henry (Maria), Michael Lyle (First Officer/Orsino’s Attendant), Cat McKeever (Sea Captain), Daniel Millar (Fabian), Reece Miller (Orsino’s Attendant), Charlotte O’Leary (Olivia’s Woman), Thom Petty (Curio), Rhys Rusbatch (Sebastian), Joplin Sibtain (Sir Toby Belch), Tom Sowinski (Orsino’s Attendant) and David Whitworth (Valentine).\n\t\n\n\tThe creative team reunites under Puwanarajah’s direction, with lighting designers Bethany Gupwell and Zoe Spurr, composer Matt Maltese, sound designer George Dennis, movement director Polly Bennett, casting director Matthew Dewsbury CDG, and associate director Zoë Templeman-Young.\n\n\tTwelfth Night runs at the Barbican from Dec. 8, through Jan. 17, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe twin triumphs of Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident” at Cannes and Jim Jarmusch’s “Father Mother Sister Brother” at Venice made 2025 a banner year for international auteurs embracing the French film showbiz ecosystem — though that’s hardly surprising for a production partner fluent in every language of cinema.\n\n\t“You make electric cars with China, and films with France,” quips producer Charles Gillibert. “We have always had a universalist framework that supports not just French artists, but filmmakers from around the world, all of them benefiting from a self-sustaining system that uses investment obligations and festivals to sustain creativity.”\n\t\n\n\tAs president of Les Films du Losange and a producer of recent titles like Bi Gan’s “Resurrection” and Kristen Stewart’s “The Chronology of Water,” Gillibert has been instrumental in weaving global voices into what he calls his country’s “strong cinematic industrial fabric.”\n\n\n\tJarmusch provides a key example. In search of a European partner for a story spanning the Atlantic, he turned to Gillibert’s CG Cinema to refine the film’s creative, legal and administrative framework, to secure financing through France’s international tax credit, and to oversee a cross-border shoot. Following Gillibert’s advice, the production shifted its middle chapter from London to Dublin — a move that enriched the film’s themes and allowed a crew of Jarmusch regulars and French technicians to transition seamlessly between segments in Dublin and Paris.\n\n\t“That’s what it means to imagine a film together,” says Gillibert, noting Jarmusch’s desire to keep working in France. “It shows that our work mattered, that he’s following threads opened up by his previous film. That he wants to explore them further here is both fortunate and exciting.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd Jarmusch is far from alone. This year, a striking 27 submissions for the international feature film Oscar race from other countries are French co-productions — from Norway’s “Sentimental Value” to South Korea’s “No Other Choice” to Spain’s “Sirat.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Sentimental Value’ shot on location in Deauville \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Kasper Tuxen\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJoachim Trier’s Cannes Grand Prize winning “Sentimental Value” even turns this phenomenon into its subject, following a Norwegian auteur who rekindles his creative spark while attending a French film festival — with scenes shot on location at the Deauville Festival itself.\n\n\tMK2 Films managing director Fionnuala Jamison describes the process as a “virtuous cycle.” International auteurs leverage Cannes exposure to bolster French box office returns and forge relationships with local distributors and sales companies. Those connections, in turn, unlock CNC funds and broadcaster pre-buys aligned with the festival’s tastes, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem that nurtures global voices.\n\n\t“What premieres at Cannes, what resonates at the French box office, and what public funders back all go hand in hand,” says Jamison. “There are political and ethical dimensions, sure. But fundamentally, it comes down to the French audience and its long tradition of openness. Certain films just work here.”\n\n\tLast year, MK2 quietly joined a top-secret project from Panahi, teaming up with distributor Memento and Les Films Pelléas to finance a clandestinely shot thriller. In many ways, the dissident auteur already embodied the full promise of the French system: he burst onto the world stage with Cannes’ Camera d’Or and leveraged local partnerships — most notably with Paris-based Celluloid Dreams — to navigate government reprisals and build one of world cinema’s most celebrated careers.\n\n\t“Everything, from how Panahi’s films were sold abroad to how they reached major festivals, happened through French companies,” says Les Films Pelléas founder Philippe Martin. For him, embracing this year’s Palme d’Or winner as France’s Oscar submission — giving Panahi a platform that had long been out of reach — felt like a natural next step for an ecosystem that has consistently embraced global auteurs.\n\n\t“No other country supports so many other nations’ cinemas with such generosity and intelligence,” Martin adds.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe National Women’s Soccer League has assembled an Avengers-like group of star investors in NWSL teams into an advisory board designed to drive new business opportunities and expand the overall reach of the U.S. league.\n\n\tThe effort has been spearheaded by Jessica Berman, NWSL commissioner, who has been instrumental in expanding the organization’s footprint across the U.S. with 16 clubs stretching from San Diego to Boston. The panel members and their team affiliations include:\n\t\n\n\tChris Paul (Angel City FC)Julie Foudy (Angel City FC)Brandi Chastain (Bay FC)Sabrina Ionescu (Bay FC)Elizabeth Banks (Boston Legacy FC)Aly Raisman (Boston Legacy FC)Jordan Angeli (Denver Summit FC)Brittany Mahomes (Kansas City Current)Sue Bird (Gotham FC)Eli Manning (Gotham FC)Lauren Holiday (North Carolina Courage)Grant Hill (Orlando Pride)Tamia Hill (Orlando Pride)Joey Harrington (Portland Thorns FC)Bryce Young (Portland Thorns FC)Ken Griffey Jr. (Seattle Reign FC)Alex Morgan (San Diego Wave FC)Lindsey Vonn (Utah Royals FC)Dominique Dawes (Washington Spirit)Magic Johnson (Washington Spirit)\n\n\n\t“When we looked across our Clubs’ investor base, we realized how fortunate we are to have such an extraordinary group of cultural icons, athletes, and leaders who believe – and have invested – in the power and potential of this league,” said Berman. “Their experience and influence will be instrumental as we continue building not just a league, but a movement — one that redefines entertainment and what’s possible in sports.”\n\n\tThe league was founded in 2012 and kicked off its first season of games in 2013. Its season now runs March through November. Women’s soccer has been lifted by the wave of investment, attendance and TV viewership gains that women’s sports has enjoyed in recent years in the U.S. and other countries. Berman’s hope is that the combined firepower of key NWSL investors will spur business development for the league, among other benefits.\n\t\n\n\tThe plan is to convene twice a year with team owners, staff and players to share information and address common problems. The league said it would work with Boardroom, the media and events firm headed by the NBA’s Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman, to assemble the inaugural summit in the spring of next year. \n\n\tThe NWSL is banking on the star power and cultural clout of its board members to open doors and bulldoze barriers to women’s sports in general.\n\n\t“Women’s sports are rewriting the rules of what’s possible — and the NWSL is leading that charge,” said Banks, the multihyphenate who is an investor in Boston Legacy FC. “This league has incredible athletes, incredible stories, and an incredible fan base. I’m proud to help amplify that energy and make sure the next generation sees women’s sports not as the exception, but as the standard.”\n\n\tThe presence of prominent male athletes on the board sends a signal to corporate America and Madison Avenue.\n\n\t“The NWSL is one of the most exciting leagues in sports today, with growth that rivals anything we’ve seen before,” said Manning, the famed NFL quarterback and an investor in Gotham FC. “I’m honored to be part of this Advisory Board and to help continue building a league that inspires communities, empowers women, and sets the standard for excellence on and off the field.”\n\n\tMorgan is the Olympic gold medalist and two-time World Cup winner who retired last year after a 15-year professional career. She was a star player for the San Diego Wave FC who acquired a minority stake in the team last year.\n\n\t“As players, we’ve seen firsthand how much the NWSL has grown and how much potential still lies ahead,” Morgan said. “What makes this Advisory Board so special is that it brings together people who share our belief in what women’s soccer can be — not just as a sport, but as a movement. I’m proud to be part of helping shape the next chapter for the league, the players, and the fans who make it all possible.”\n\n\t(Pictured: Alex Morgan, Sabrina Ionescu and Magic Johnson)\n",

Amazon DSP also provides access to inventory in Amazon Music.\n\n\n\tAmazon Ads and iHeartMedia have already been working together for the past decade. The two companies have developed advertising solutions spanning smart devices, mobile apps and voice technology — and now they’re diving into programmatic audio advertising, which lets buyers target audiences based on demographics, shopping patterns or other attributes.\n\n\t“Our partnership with iHeart allows Amazon DSP customers to reach relevant audio audiences with simplified campaign management and unique measurement capabilities,” said Amazon Ads’ Meredith Goldman, director of Amazon DSP. “Integrations like this enable advertisers to build more comprehensive omnichannel strategies that connect brands with consumers throughout their journey across media.”\n\n\tLisa Coffey, chief business officer at iHeartMedia, commented, “Making iHeart’s premium audio inventory available through Amazon DSP unlocks scale with deep listener engagement and proven performance. And with accessibility to broadcast radio inventory soon to follow, this partnership is another step in making broadcast radio behave like digital media: addressable, measurable, and available programmatically, so marketers of all sizes can buy with greater ease and consistency.”\n\t\n\n\tAmazon DSP is powered by “trillions” of first-party data points and “advanced clean-room technology,” according to the ecommerce giant. On the video side, Amazon this year has been busy signing up DSP partners, inking recent pacts with Netflix, Disney and Roku for programmatic ad sales.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMolly Ratermann has unveiled her directorial feature debut “Making a Bridesmaid,” a feel-good comedy horror that has officially wrapped post-production and is now aiming for a 2026 festival run. \n\n\tTonally billed as “Bodies Bodies Bodies” meets “Bridesmaids,” the film — written and directed by Ratermann, who also produces and stars — satirizes the pressure women feel to compete when opportunities are scarce all set within a stylized sleepover-from-hell. Coming from 741 Films and Little Hand Productions, it was shot on location in Lake Tahoe, California\n\t\n\n\t“Making a Bridesmaid” follows two outcast sisters, played by Emily Kincaid (“Hard Miles,” “Succubus”) and Ratermann as they embark on a “basic bitch” bachelorette weekend. But the fun turns deadly as they find themselves in a real-life murder game, forced to compete for bridesmaid spots just to stay alive.\n\n\n\tThe ensemble cast includes Serra Naiman, Wilder Yari (“The Lincoln Lawyer,” “Quantum Leap”), Alex Sgambati (“The Walking Dead,” “Tracker,” “Love, Simon”), Gina Su (“Trüebadour”), Maya Butler (“The Offer”), April Kelley (“Plainclothes”), and Cynthia Aileen Strahan (“The Offer”).\n\n\tAmerican Cinema Editors (ACE) President Sabrina Plisco (“Doctor Strange,” “Strays,” “Ms. Marvel”) heads up Ratermann’s creative team as editor while also marking her debut as producer. She is joined by cinematographer David Newbert (“Willy’s Wonderland”). Executive producers are Finn Bruce (“Sumotherhood,” “Paul Dood’s Deadly Lunch Break”), Michael D. Whitfield, Sonny Marler, Keith Rosmarin and Darren Cogan.\n\t\n\n\t“’Making A Bridesmaid’ is a wild, fun ride that digs into fakeness, identity, and rivalry, even as women keep reaching for solidarity,” said Ratermann. “It’s a feel-good horror with pastel-neon textures, a synth-pop pulse, and a powerhouse ensemble driving the story. The film pushes these women to confront the roles they feel the need to perform, and the competition they’ve internalized. I hope it sparks curiosity in men about the layers of female socialization, while giving women a chance to laugh—and maybe squirm a little—in recognition of their own experiences.”\n\n\t“Making A Bridesmaid” is now picture-locked with premiere plans and sales representation to be announced.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector Susan Seidelman, behind beloved Madonna starrer “Desperately Seeking Susan,” says “music is where women really excel these days.” \n\n\t“It’s been interesting to watch this explosion of strong, powerful women in music in the last five years,” she says. \n\n\t“It’s not just Taylor Swift. There seem to be so many singer-songwriters who have the power and the confidence to tell very female, very personal stories through their music, showing their strengths and flaws. Lola Young’s ‘Messy’ [written by Young and Conor Dickinson] is a great example of that.” \n\t\n\n\tShe adds: “And you know what? They’re also making money. They are showing the bosses at the record companies there’s a big audience for their stories. One of the things I was really pleased about with ‘Desperately Seeking Susan’ was that it was not only a very feminist film, but it made money for the studio. I think they were surprised by that and I was thrilled to have proven them wrong.”\n\n\n\tAccording to Seidelman, at Poland’s Tauron American Film Festival to pick up the Indie Star Award for her career, the current indie scene isn’t quite as thriving when it comes to cinema. \n\n\t“I’m very glad I started my career in the early 80s, because that was such a wonderful time for independent cinema, especially in New York. Things are very different now – for all cinema. It has been happening for a while and I think COVID has really sped it up.”\n\n\tShe made her feature debut with “Smithereens” in 1982. Picked up by Cannes, it follows Wren, who leaves New Jersey convinced she’ll make it big.\n\t\n\n\t“In some ways, that’s my most autobiographical movie. I was this girl who came from a small town in Pennsylvania and didn’t have a clear goal. I didn’t know I would end up being a film director, but I knew there was a bigger world out there,” she recalls. \n\n\t“Wren seems directionless, but she just wants to be a part of something else. That was certainly true of New York at that time, when it was still very cheap. It attracted many outsiders who thought they’d meet other people like them in NYC, and they usually did.”\n\n\tSeidelman quickly became known for her heroines, feeling “not just a responsibility, but an urge” to tell female stories where women were in control. \n\n\t“For better or for worse. In ‘Smithereens,’ Wren’s not going down a positive path, but she’s an active protagonist. That was very important to me, because when I was growing up, all the fun roles always went to men, whether it was Robert Redford and Paul Newman or De Niro and Dustin Hoffman. The women were the wives, the girlfriends or the ‘bad girls’ who ended up dead or in prison.” \n\n\t“Desperately Seeking Susan,” which has turned 40 this year and established Seidelman as a director to watch, was all about “female empowerment, and that theme is universal and timeless,” she states. “It was relevant in 1985 and it’s still relevant today.” \n\n\tFilms that followed, including the sci-fi rom-com “Making Mr. Right” with John Malkovich and “She-Devil,” weren’t as warmly received, placing Seidelman in “movie jail.”\n\n\t“There are men who’ve been in movie jail too, but I do think it happens much more with women, certainly during my time. ‘Well, we gave her a shot. It didn’t work.’ It’s that kind of excuse,” she admits. \n\n\t“Hollywood has always been a boys’ club. Projects were greenlit based on who you saw at lunch or on the golf course. Women weren’t part of those clubs or maybe they didn’t want to be, so they didn’t have as much latitude.” \n\n\tBoth films have been described as “men-hating,” she says.\n\n\t“I was a female director and some critics said that in ‘Making Mr. Right’ I claimed men are terrible and that Frankie [played by Ann Magnuson] could only have a relationship with an android lover. But I was taking the Pygmalion myth and twisting it around! Men had been telling their version for a long time, whether it’s ‘Pretty Woman’ or ‘My Fair Lady,’ and I thought: ‘Why can’t I make some points about the power dynamic between men and women’?” \n\t\n\n\tNow, viewers are discovering it anew. “It’s a perfect example of a movie that works better today than it did in 1987. You know, there are many things I miss about the way people used to make movies. I miss 35mm film and big movie theaters. But the thing about streaming is that people get to discover a lot of things.”\n\n\tIn the 1990s, Seidelman was nominated for an Academy Award for the short “The Dutch Master” featuring Mira Sorvino. She also introduced the world to “Sex and the City,” directing its influential pilot. \n\n\t“Later, it changed and became a different story. But at the beginning, it was almost electric.”\n\n\t“In many of my films, I tried to turn NYC into a character. That was important in ‘Sex and the City’: It wasn’t just about the women. It was about these women in this particular city at this particular time,” she notes. \n\n\t“Back in the mid-90s, television looked terrible, so I approached it like a short film. It was important to capture some of that energy and grit. Thankfully, HBO allowed me to work with a really good DoP, Stuart Dryburgh, who also did Jane Campon’s ‘The Piano.’ We also got to be more experimental, with Carrie talking directly to the camera. After I left, they said: ‘Let’s get rid of all that,’” she laughs. \n\n\t“One of the things I liked about these early episodes is that the women were still kind of a raw and aspirational. They all had a bit if that downtown funk about them. Then they became very uptown,” she says. “I like messiness. When a character is totally put together, they’re not as interesting.”\n\n\tNow, she says, it’s “important to pass the baton” to others directors.  \n\n\t“I do like to give advice to the younger generation. I tell them the hardest thing about being a director is finding your point of view. What’s your vision? What makes you different from anyone else? When I was starting out, I wasn’t seeing stories about women, especially not in Hollywood. It became my mission.”\n\n\t“When I started teaching at NYU about 12 years ago, most of my class were men. By the time I finished, half of the class were women. They had the drive and were passionate about the stories they wanted to tell. They also had a desire to be good. They really wanted to be good.”\n",

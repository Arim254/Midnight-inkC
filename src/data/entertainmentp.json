    "body": "\n\t“One Battle After Another” led the winners at the Set Decorators Society of America awards.\n\n\tThe set decorator (Anthony Carlino SDSA) with production design by (Florencia Martin) behind the film took home two awards for Best Achievement In Décor/Design Of A Contemporary Feature Film and Best Picture for Paul Thomas Anderson.\n\n\tElsewhere, Best Achievement in Décor/Design of a Fantasy or Science Fiction Film  an International Organization went to the “Frankenstein” team (set decoration by Shane Vieau SDSA with production design by Tamara Deverell), and Best Achievement in Décor/Design of a Period Feature Film went to the team behind “Hamnet.” (Set Decoration by Alice Felton SDSA with Production Design by Fiona Crombie).\n\t\n\n\tBest Achievement in Décor / Design of a Comedy or Musical Feature Film went to the team behind “Wicked: For Good” (set decoration by Lee Sandales with production design by Nathan Crowley).\n\n\n\tIn the past few years, the SDSA winners have gone on to win the production design Oscar. The set decorators and production design teams for “Frankenstein,” “One Battle After Another” and “Hamnet” all landed Oscar nominations.\n\n\tGuillermo del Toro called on Deverell and Vieau to work on “Frankenstein,” and one thing was clear: there would be no green screen; everything would be handmade from scratch. “We had 20 sculptors at any given moment working,” Deverell says, as she worked with the film’s set decorator Shane Vieau to ensure the authenticity of the film’s look.\n\n\tCrombie and Felton worked together to bring Chloe Zhao’s “Hamnet” to life. Part of their challenge was creating London’s Globe Theatre in the late 1500s. It was a big moment for the duo as the set dominates the film’s third act. For Felton, the glove workshop was also a small but important detail in the Shakespeare household.\n\t\n\n\tFor “One Battle After Another,” Willa’s bedroom was built onto the small house, the cottage was dressed to show the accumulation of the years the father and daughter had lived there. Carlino and Martin had a lot of artwork from Anderson’s kids, while Chase Infiniti provided childhood photos for Carlino to decorate the house.\n",

U.S. viewers can watch the red carpet and award ceremony on E!, while U.K. viewers can watch the awards on BBC One and iPlayer. \n\n\tThe BAFTA Awards will be broadcast at 7 p.m. GMT, or 2 p.m. ET/11 a.m. PT. Dedicated to celebrating the best in British and global film, “The Traitors” star Alan Cumming will host the awards. \n\n\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” leads the 2026 nominees with 14 nods, including for best film, director, leading actress, leading actor and more. Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” trails just behind with 13 nominations, with nods for best film, original screenplay, director and more.

The fact is that these characters are all immigrants, but I think a lot of them would probably be Trump supporters, oddly enough. So how do they reconcile those things? When Italians came over – and people forget this, or they don’t want to see it – a lot of them were undocumented.”\n\t\n\n\tImperioli starred as Christopher Moltisanti in all 86 episodes of “The Sopranos,” which ran for six seasons from 1999 to 2007 on HBO. Widely considered to be one of the best television dramas of all time, the show earned 21 Emmy Awards during its run, including three best actor wins for the late James Gandolfini. Imperioli was nominated at the Emmys four times and won once for best supporting actor in a drama.\n\n\n\t“The Sopranos” creator David Chase told the New York Times in 2019 that he thought Gandolfini’s Tony Soprano would not be charmed by Trump.\n\n\t“He would think the guy was full of [expletive],” he said. “Whether he thought he was a good president or not — I don’t know that Tony thought much about that question at all, with anybody who was in office. But I know Tony would have thought Trump was penny-ante, in terms of his lying and presentation.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tFollowing an awkward transition into narrative filmmaking with 2024’s fact-inspired but melodrama-leaning “In Her Place,” “A Child of My Own” sees Chilean director Maite Alberdi returning to documentary cinema — albeit of the same fuzzily defined, playfully genre-infused variety that scored her an Oscar nomination for “The Mole Agent.” Based on the case of a Mexican nurse incarcerated for abducting another woman’s baby from the hospital where she worked, the film devotes much of its running time to a bright, stylized dramatization of events from the perpetrator’s perspective, casting her actions in a very different light from how they appear in cold black and white. Once documentary framing takes over in the film’s second half, so do manifold uncertainties and ambiguities.\n\t\n\n\tHumanizing a tale that was sordid tabloid fodder in Mexico for a short time, the film’s compassionate approach comes as no surprise from Alberdi — a delicate, feeling-forward documentarian who also scored a second Oscar nod for her lyrical Alzheimer’s study “The Eternal Memory.” But something in her candy-hued, semi-comic foregrounding of her protagonist’s account rankles in “A Child of My Own,” which presents the stark legal facts of the case as a kind of twist, with the audience given only limited access to modifying perspectives. As the film works toward a concluding note of uplift that brings as many questions as answers, one wonders if a straighter documentary telling would be more rewarding.\n\n\n\tAfter “In Her Place” was released worldwide by Netflix, “A Child of My Own” continues Alberdi’s relationship with the streamer — an association that seems almost like an ironic in-joke given how the film plays on a practically patented Netflix true-crime format, with carefully staggered talking heads giving way to slick reconstructions. Here, however, the dramatizations are so glossy — relentlessy color-coded in bubblegum hues by DP Sergio Armstrong and production designer Estefania Larran de la Cerda — as to tilt away from realism entirely, and into the possibly fantasist headspace of protagonist Alejandra, appearing as her middle-aged self in interviews and played as a young woman by the appealingly wide-eyed Ana Celeste.\n\t\n\n\tWhen she’s married at just 17 to the oafish but loving Arturo (Armando Espitia) — we see both grainy real-life video footage and a rose-tinted replica of their first dance to “Unchained Melody” — Alejandra is already beamingly pregnant, though she’s soon jolted by a miscarriage that turns out to be the first of three. The third time, she can no longer face the disappointment of her husband or the reproaches of her in-laws, who make no bones about their belief that a childless wife is an invalid one. By then working as a hospital nurse, she strikes up a chance connection in the waiting room with Mayra, a young, unhappily pregnant woman with no desire to keep her baby, and has a brainwave: She can secretly take Mayra’s child as her own once it is delivered, maintaining the illusion of her pregnancy until then. And so the women make a deal.\n\n\tOr do they? The plan is so riddled with flaws — played very nearly for farce in some scenes, as when Alejandra somehow fakes her way through an ultrasound scan — that viewers may wonder if it’s entirely fictional,. Yet the film’s documentary components prove that she did indeed convince everyone of her pregnancy until the day of Mayra’s delivery, where everything went woefully wrong. From this point, conflicting narratives cut harshly into the story as played thus far, though the real-life Alejandra insists to this day on the truth of her far-fetched testimony. She’s a sympathetic figure in either event, and the film’s heart sticks with her even as her perspective is undermined. Some of the strongest footage here shows her everyday life and sisterly relationships built in the prison where she was confined for 14 years after the whole unfortunate affair.\n\n\tStill, it’s hard not to feel that other, equally compelling points of view — not least that of Mayra’s real-life counterpart — are given shorter shrift in “A Child of My Own,” in part to maintain the film’s poignant mystery and its investment in Alejandra as a tragic naif. The film’s final passage, however, is affecting as the real-life Arturo admits his own sense of emotional culpability — if not legal complicity — in Alejandra’s crime, as he retracts his younger self’s cruel, heedless statement that he couldn’t love an adopted child. The wound at the heart of their relationship reaches a roundabout sort of closure in the film’s coda, though as with much in “A Child of My Own,” one senses untold narratives beneath the surface.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are no luxuries and only the most essential comforts on offer at the remote Alpine refuge where “Forest High” is set: Hot water runs just a couple of hours a day, the soup served for dinner is thin and blandly nourishing, and don’t ask where to charge your phone, because you’ll be met with a polite but firm refusal. It’s a place for passing hikers to rest, not to vacation — though for the women who run the place, across different seasons and weathers, it’s somewhere to stay and hit pause on life, and perhaps to finally hear yourself in the silence. Manon Coubia‘s gorgeous, whispering first feature is therefore not a film of major dramatic incidents and revelations, though its payoff is clear and cleansing as a mountain spring.\n\t\n\n\t“Forest High” is inspired by Coubia’s own ten years of experience as a warden at a mountain refuge: The Alpine landscape so ravishingly explored here has previously been integral to her short film work, notably the 2016 Locarno winner “The Fullness of Time.” Though a lightly scripted narrative is woven through proceedings here — particularly in its third and final section, an intimate two-hander — the film is chiefly attuned with documentary-like specificity to environmental details and textures. \n\n\n\tShot over four seasons of real-life activity at a working refuge, with Coubia’s actors interacting with actual hikers passing through the place, it’s a bracing and singular work: While its triptych structure and shifting focus on different shapes and stages of female identity most easily invite comparisons with Kelly Reichardt’s “Certain Women,” there’s nothing quite like it in the arthouse market. \n\t\n\n\tSpecialist distributors may be emboldened by the film’s special jury mention following its premiere in Berlin’s Perspectives competition for first features. (Rai Cinema International Distribution is handling sales.) Despite its modesty of scale, the deliberate, spell-casting rhythm and sensory density of “Forest High” demand theatrical exhibition, as do its ruggedly spectacular mountainscapes, shot on tactile 16mm film by DP Robin Fresson — it’s hard to imagine the film having quite the same strangely enveloping quality on streaming platforms.\n\n\tSet in the crisp first flush of spring, the film’s opening third is centered on Anna (Salomé Richard, star of Coubia’s 2023 short “Full Night”), a thirtysomething local who has done several stints at the refuge, and to whom this breathtaking region is merely home. With that familiarity has come a certain restlessness: She intends for this to be her last season doing the job, though a light dalliance with handsome traveling birdwatcher Antoine (Arthur Marbaix) keeps things interesting. He’s on the lookout for the capercaillie, a rare kind of grouse rapidly disappearing from the region, and a quasi-mythical motif running through the film — a symbol of a natural but increasingly threatened way of life.\n\n\tWith summer comes the older, more careworn Hélène (Aurélia Petit) to take over the job in brisk, practised fashion learned from decades of temporary menial work. But there’s pleasure in it too. This is the shelter’s busiest season, making for the film’s most vibrant, chattering section, and Hélène adapts well to the rhythm and volume of whatever company rolls in, while occasionally retreating to the woods for some respite. Coubia’s dramatic emphases are generally unexpected — the mystery of what happened to one booked-in family of hikers that never shows up amid a heavy rainstorm is left hanging — while lower-stakes scenes are followed through to rewarding, observational conclusions. One lovely sequence sees an outdoor lunch at the lodge turn into an impromptu dance party with a live musician singing some cheerfully inauthentic bossa nova.\n\n\tFinally, as the shelter empties out for winter, outsider Suzanne (Anne Cousens) arrives to mind it in the off-season. Like Hélène, she’s in her fifties, though her background is very different: Once a well-to-do wife and mother, now single and empty-nested, she’s living life on her own terms for the first time. The alone-but-not-loneliness afforded by the small, snow-licked hut is thus exactly what she’s after: As she contentedly tends the fireplace, reads her book and snuggles into bed with her puffer coat on, “Forest High” emerges as a kind of anti-“Shining,” a testament to the healing benefits of female solitude. It can’t last, of course, as a single male guest turns up at the shelter — a young army deserter, in his own way calmly adrift in life — but a gentle, reserved connection sparks between them.\n\t\n\n\tAll the while, “Forest High” feels happily haunted by the souls of those who have passed through its humble timber location, which remains unchanging and indifferent to modern developments and pressures in the lives escaped down below. Assisted by the serene control of Fresson’s camera, the patience and invisible economy of Théophile Gay-Mazas’s editing and the glassy, wind-brushed echoes of François Chamaraux’s score, the assured light touch of Coubia’s filmmaking maintains an atmosphere of tranquil but unromanticized remove from the world — as if there’s just an extra hour or two in the day, and no great need to fill the time.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKid Rock wasn’t kidding around when sang a song about finding Jesus to conclude the recent Turning Point USA alternative halftime show. He got religious again on social media Friday, although this time the musician was speaking about divine judgment — which he suggested God may enact on journalists who reported on the price of his premium concert tickets.\n\n\tThe singer-rapper said that he will pray for members of the media who made headlines out of the $5,000 top cost for “first class tickets” to his Freedom 250 Tour. But, he added, the Almighty will have the last word on their fate.\n\t\n\n\t“I WILL pray for them, but I know that sooner or later God will cut ‘em down,” Rock said, referring to members of the media who reported on his ticket prices.\n\n\n\t“The fake liberal media says I’m charging $5,000 for front-row tickets,” he wrote in his message — before going on to confirm that $5K is indeed what he is charging for the top face-value tickets to his upcoming shows. \n\n\tThe issue, he said, was context. “They know damn well that’s not the full story.” \n\n\t“Instead of reporting facts or that lawn seats are only 50 bucks or how we are cutting out the scalpers, they twist it for headlines/clicks and to attack me — nothing new here.”\n\n\tHe explained how many he has set aside 20 “first class” tickets for each show, in the $1000-5000 range: “Those are extremely limited First Class seats like I explained  — FOUR tickets per row, first five rows only (5k per seat row 1, 4k row 2, 3k row 3, 2k row 4, 1k row 5) — Again ONLY 4 seats in rows 1 through 5 (20 ‘first class’ seats in venues that hold 15k to 25k people).”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough there are only 20 seats per show in that premium class, if he sells them all, it will add a significant amount to his nightly tally. Other seats in the first nine or 10 rows at Rock’s upcoming tour are priced at $500. So if he sells those 20 seats for the advertised $1000-5000 prices, that will provide a bump of $50,000 per night above and beyond what he would have brought in pricing them at $500 like other nearby seats. \n\n\tNo additional VIP perks are being offered for the “first class” seats, beyond their centrality and proximity to the stage.\n\nHere we go again. The fake liberal media says I’m charging $5,000 for front-row tickets.They know damn well that’s not the full story.Those are extremely limited First Class seats like I explained  — FOUR tickets per row, first five rows only (5k per seat row 1, 4k row 2,… pic.twitter.com/Dgc9wp8sWq— KidRock (@KidRock) February 20, 2026\n\n\n\tThe $50 lawn seats for the tour do offer an affordable alternative to the fixed seats, which (the first class offering aside) are priced at $500, $200 and, for the last rows, a bottom rate of $100.\n\n\tIs anybody biting… or are fans content to settle for second- or third-class status?\n\n\tEarly results indicate mixed response to the gambit. On the tour’s opening night in Dallas, set for May 1, none of the $5,000 tickets had sold, as of this writing. But it did appear he has sold two of the $4,000 seats, three of the $3,000 tickets, two of the $2,000 ducats and three of the $1,000 seats in Dallas.\n\n\tFurther down the road, May 8 in Raleigh, NC, none of the $5,000, $4,000 or $3,000 seats in the first three rows has yet sold. But two of the four $2,000 first class seats in the fourth row have been snapped up, and all four $1,000 tickets in the fifth row have been claimed. At the non-premium level, in Raleigh, large blue swaths of $500 remain available. But $200 seems to be the price that is right for many fans, as a good number of rows in the front section at that price point have completely sold through.\n\n\tKid Rock’s irritation with members of the media comes despite him already having worked off some steam recently. The MAGA rocker appeared in a shirtless workout video this week with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., giving a middle finger to the camera during a stationary cycling segment before joining Kennedy in the sauna, all in the promotion of the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy” campaign.\n\n\tIn other Kid Rock news, and speaking of God (again), it was announced Friday that the artist has topped Billboard’s Hot Christian Songs chart for the first time. He achieved it with his studio recording of “‘Til You Can’t,” the Cody Johnson country hit he sang on the TPUSA show. Rock gets a co-writing credit on the tune now after contributing a new last verse telling listeners they “can give your life to Jesus / And he’ll give you a second chance / ‘Til you can’t.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnother Bruce Springsteen tour on-sale; another bout of elation among those who procured tickets. Along with, of course, another round of debate over how easy it was or wasn’t to get those tickets… and another spate of hysteria about top ticket prices. So how much did they cost when they went on sale Saturday? \n\n\tThere was a bit of sticker shock for some when they logged into Ticketmaster over the weekend and were put into queues that sometimes backed up to over 100,000 wanna-be ticket buyers at a time, with a message to study on the app while they waited: “Tickets for this event have been priced in advance by the tour from $84.55 – $3,007.20, including service fees.” \n\t\n\n\tThat is some welcome transparency, and it gets out of the way early the horror some fans might feel if they went directly to the front rows after making their way through the line and saw that $3,007.20 pop-up window. The $84.55 bottom also sets up an impression for fans that at least some of the tickets will be set at working man’s prices. (The “priced by the tour” clause also counts as Ticketmaster signaling that it wishes to wash its hands a bit of where prices finally land.)\n\n\n\tOf course, in the end, a very tiny percentage of tickets were set at either those top or bottom price points, which makes it a challenge to wade through enough sections to get even a clue about what an average price might be. But over the course of a couple of hours of looking through the ticket offerings for Springsteen’s two L.A. Forum shows, and a side glance at some other cities, Variety was able to form some impressions.\n\t\n\n\tSpringsteen tours have tended to attract more attention for their cost than most in recent years, partly because some fans believe that he has a “man of the people” image that should mandate keeping costs for fans low, while others think it’s just fine if he charges something closer to a going rate, given how scalpers will make the lion’s share off outrageous prices if he leaves money on the table for the sake of optics. And, of course, many in Springsteen’s core demographic rarely buy tickets anymore and still complain about anything above 1985 prices… although no one can be blamed for having their eyes widen upon first exposure to the higher tiers here. (It’s not just boomers who balk, anyway; the onsale for Harry Styles’ upcoming residencies had some millennials at least as much in shock as any Bruce fan.)\n\n\tGenerally speaking, if you wanted a “good” seat — which we’ll define as on the floor or in the loge sections facing the stage — you should have expected to shell out in the $400-$1200 per-ticket range, at initial face value. \n\n\tHowever, there were some seats in the upper levels that many fans would consider perfectly acceptable for a high-demand show that went for around $130 (disappearing very quickly at that level) or $180. This was the sweet spot for fans on a budget who wanted to get in the building, be facing the stage and rely to a large extent on the big screens.\n\n\tOne thing to note: “dynamic” pricing did not seem to be in effect for the on-sale, contrary to what many fans were contending, at least in the initial hours. Prices for different rows seemed to be the same time when we visited them over time. Most of the best seats were identified as “platinum” tickets, which in the past has sometimes been identified as seats whose prices are subject to change, based on demand. But we didn’t see any immediate sign of prices going up or down, whether it was for platinum or “standard” seats. (That doesn’t count resale tickets, which of course began fluctuating immediately.) \n\n\tThe very first tickets to sell out were those in the GA section right in front of the stage, which takes up a relatively small part of the overall floor. Ticketmaster even warned those waiting in the queue that those were gone. Although Variety never got a chance to even look at those prices, fans reported the standing-room tickets were about $500, on par with what Springsteen has charged for that privileged area for years.\n\t\n\n\tThe only $87.55 tickets we spotted were in the last few rows of the area behind the stage… an awfully good price point if you have binoculars and want the same view the cover photographer for “Born in the USA” had (give or take a processional lap to a ramp at the rear of the stage that is likely to happen in any Springsteen show). Anything closer-up in the rear than those last few rows was more likely to run you anywhere from $130.35 to $306.60, the latter being the cost for a front-row seat in a rear-view section.\n\n\tThe sections that sold out most quickly — apart from the instant-sellout GA spots — were the front-facing loge sections, just off the floor. In the Kia Forum’s section 105, which is somewhat toward the rear of the arena but still offering a good, relatively head-on view, a ticket in row 1 cost $961.30 (labeled as a platinum ticket), while a seat in row 9 ran $423.96 (labeled a standard seat).\n\n\tOn the floor, a ticket in the very front rows cost $3007.20, as advertised. If you went back to the sixth row, they dropped to $2707.20. A seat in the front row of Section F, the second seated section back from GA, went for $1,147.20. Move back to row 5 of that section and it was $961.20. Go back on row 10, in the area of the mixing board, and seats dropped to $721.30. Seats in the very last rows of the floor, meanwhile, went for $423.95.\n\n\tIn the upper level, a.k.a. the 200s at the Forum, a typical seat was going for $308.80, including the row the very furthest distance from the stage (section 236, row 10). However, the back rows over in section 205 could be had for $187.95.\n\n\tSome seats in the front-facing 200s, a.k.a. the “nosebleeds,” did go for $128 — a bargain, by most modern standards. Those were all sold out by the time we got through the queue for the Forum shows, though. We were able to go look at other cities — Cleveland, for example (where SeatGeek was handling all the sales, including initial purchase, not Ticketmaster) — and see some $128 seats still on sale there as of Saturday afternoon.\n\n\tAre these fair prices? Springsteen fans will continue to debate that, as they have with other recent tours of his. One answer is that any of these prices will seem reasonable compared to what resellers will be asking for them, probably even at the uppermost level. Some industry observers have made the point that tickets for top-tier acts are underpriced, by the standard of actual supply and demand, if resellers can get more and that money doesn’t go into the pocket of the artist. But others argue that optics matter, which is why most superstar acts have recently been setting their top tickets closer to the $1200 level than $3000. Taylor Swift actually capped non-VIP-package tickets for the Eras Tour at $499, leaving rates above that to the scalpers — though you could argue she made it up in volume, in a way that a short tour like Springsteen’s never could. (And also that she has a lot more years ahead of her to make beaucoup concert bucks than the E Street Band, who are revving their engines to retirement age and beyond.)\n\t\n\n\tClearly, many fans look at high ticket prices and walk away. At one point in the Forum on-sale, the wait to get through the queue showed more than 100,000 potential buyers ahead in the line, but by the time we got past that massive line, there were still hundreds of tickets to be had, indicating most looked at what were available and walked away. (Or many were bots… take your pick.) \n\n\tBut in the end, Springsteen has one thing in his favor that the Eras Tour also did, even after scalpers tripled and quadrupled prices: Virtually no one who has attended one of his shows in recent years ever went online to complain after the fact that it wasn’t worth it, whatever “it” turned out to be. Especially, in the case of either of these three-hour-plus experiences, if you’re calculating value by the minute as well as sublimity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Saturday to demand that Netflix “immediately” fire former UN ambassador and board member Susan Rice or “pay the consequences.” His comments come as the streaming giant is in the midst of trying to seal a deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studios and streaming businesses for $83 billion.\n\n\t“Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences,” Trump wrote. “She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\n\tTrump’s outrage stems from Rice’s comments on Preet Bharara’s “Stay Tuned with Preet” podcast. During her interview, Rice said that if Democrats win the midterm elections, she predicts an “accountability agenda” for corporations that skirted regulations under the Trump administration.\n\n\tRice said, “If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming.”\n\n\tIn his Truth Social post, Trump linked to an X post from far-right activst Larua Loomer, who wrote that Rice is “threatening half of the country with weaponized government political retribution.” She also forecast that if Netflix is allowed to acquire Warner Bros., “positive messaging of the Democrats’ upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama and his anti-White racist wife Michelle would likely be blasted across all streaming services.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would result in a streaming monopoly, which the Obamas will have a significant stake in,” she added. “President Trump must kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.”\n\n\tIn early February, Trump told NBC that he thought he “shouldn’t be involved” with the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal, but he seems to have reversed that position.\n\n\t“I must say, I guess I’m considered to be a very strong president. I’ve been called by both sides. It’s the two sides, but I’ve decided I shouldn’t be involved. The Justice Department will handle it,” Trump said at the time, per an NBC News transcript.\n\n\tNetflix has an agreement to acquire Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max in a transaction worth $83 billion. On Feb. 17, WBD opened a seven-day negotiation period during which Paramount Skydance, which has been waging a hostile-takeover effort, can make a final push to pull together a stronger offer. On March 20, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Netflix acquisition.\n",

Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio has become the youngest star to reach a record-equalling seven leading actor nominations, having done so at the age of 51.\n\n\tAside from the awards, the BAFTA ceremony will also include a performance of the chart-topping “Golden” from Netflix’s smash-hit animation “Kpop Demon Hunters,” sung by Jae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami.\n\n\tSee the 2026 BAFTA Film Award winners below, as they’re announced.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Film\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Hamnet” — Liza Marshall, Pippa Harris, Nicolas Gonda, Steven Spielberg, Sam Mendes \n\n\t“Marty Supreme” — Timothée Chalamet, Anthony Katagas, Eli Bush, Ronald Bronstein, Josh Safdie \n\n\t“One Battle After Another” — Adam Somner, Sara Murphy, Paul Thomas Anderson \n\n\t“Sentimental Value” — Maria Ekerhovd, Andrea Berentsen Ottmar \n\n\t“Sinners” — Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian, Ryan Coogler \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Director\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tYorgos Lanthimos, “Bugonia”\n\n\tChloé Zhao, “Hamnet”\n\n\tJosh Safdie, “Marty Supreme”\n\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson, “One Battle After Another”\n\n\tJoachim Trier, “Sentimental Value”\n\n\tRyan Coogler, “Sinners”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLeading Actress\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJessie Buckley, “Hamnet” \n\n\tRose Byrne, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” \n\n\tKate Hudson, “Song Sung Blue” \n\n\tChase Infiniti, “One Battle After Another” \n\n\tRenate Reinsve, “Sentimental Value” \n\n\tEmma Stone, “Bugonia” \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLeading Actor\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tRobert Aramayo, “I Swear” \n\n\tTimothée Chalamet, “Marty Supreme” \n\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio, “One Battle After Another” \n\n\tEthan Hawke, “Blue Moon” \n\n\tMichael B.

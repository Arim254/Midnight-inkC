    "body": "\n\tThe Marrakech Intl. Film Festival has revealed the lineup for its 22nd edition, which runs Nov. 28 to Dec. 6. A total of 82 films from 31 countries have been selected for the festival.\n\n\tNine of these films unspool as world or international premieres, nine have received the support of the Atlas Workshops, the festival’s industry and talent development platform, and 14 represent their countries in the race for the Academy Awards.\n\n\n\tThe Official Competition showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature films that compete for the Étoile d’Or, awarded by a jury headed by filmmaker Bong Joon-ho.\n\t\n\n\tMoroccan filmmaker Meryem Benm’Barek, whose “Sofia” won the screenplay prize in 2018 in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section, delivers the world premiere of “Behind the Palm Trees,” a tense psychological thriller that examines the class relations and social domination inherited from the colonial past.\n\n\tAustralian photographer James J. Robinson presents the international premiere of “First Light,” a moral drama in which a Filipino nun questions her faith in the face of corruption. He won best Australian director at Melbourne Film Festival when the film had its world premiere.\n\n\tSeveral filmmakers revisit decisive political moments in their countries through semi-autobiographical narrative: Shih-Han Tsao’s “Before the Bright Day” evokes the anxiety of a generation faced with the threat of war in Taiwan in 1996; Akinola Davies Jr.’s “My Father’s Shadow” follows a father and his sons in Nigeria during the 1993 electoral crisis; and Zamo Mkhwanazi’s “Laundry” recounts the dreams of a young South African man during Apartheid.\n\t\n\n\tTwo debut feature films — Siyou Tan’s “Amoeba” and Imran Perretta’s “Ish” — explore teenage friendship as it faces the challenge of political awakening, respectively in Singapore and suburban London. Three films portray women who demonstrate resistance and reinvent their destinies: Erige Sehiri’s “Promised Sky,” a tale of female solidarity in the face of racism in Tunisia; Ondřej Provazník’s “Broken Voices,” a chilling drama about the abuse of authority; and Morad Mostafa’s “Aisha Can’t Fly Away,” a fantasy thriller that follow a Sudanese woman’s quest for freedom in Cairo.\n\n\tIn the deeply moving documentaries “Memory” and “My Father and Qaddafi,” directors Vladlena Sandu and Jihane K., respectively, revisit their childhoods in Chechnya and Libya, weaving powerful narratives of families at the crossroads of personal memory and collective history.\n\n\tFinally, “Straight Circle,” a satire about the absurdity of conflict, reveals director Oscar Hudson’s visual inventiveness, while “Forastera,” a summer tale of mourning by Lucía Aleñar Iglesias, testifies to the “vitality of new voices in contemporary cinema as it combines formal audacity with universal emotion,” the festival said.\n\n\tThe Gala Screenings showcase, which include some of the world’s most anticipated films, opens with “Dead Man’s Wire,” Gus Van Sant’s satire on the media and capitalism. It also includes Maryam Touzani’s “Calle Málaga,” a tender portrait of a woman from the Spanish community in Tangier, starring Carmen Maura.\n\n\tAs part of the Tributes program, Guillermo del Toro unveils his gothic and romantic vision of “Frankenstein” with Jacob Elordi, while Jodie Foster presents “A Private Life,” Rebecca Zlotowski’s crime comedy.\n\n\tTwo world premieres bring together the biggest stars of Egyptian and Tunisian cinema: “El Sett,” Marwan Hamed’s biopic about the diva Oum Kalthoum, played by Mona Zaki; and “Sophia,” a chilling thriller directed by and starring Dhafer L’Abidine.\n\n\tA gala evening will celebrate “Hamnet” by Chloé Zhao, a moving tale of family love, in which the loss of a child inspires the play “Hamlet.” Filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan comes to Marrakech with “Homebound,” a touching melodrama about the friendship and dreams of two young Indians played by rising Bollywood stars Ishaan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa.\n\t\n\n\tThe festival closes with Annemarie Jacir’s “Palestine 36,” which brings together some of the greatest actors in the Arab world in a historical drama that recounts a decisive moment for the Palestinian people.\n\n\tThe Horizons section presents 19 contemporary films that “paint a panorama of world cinema,” the festival said. It welcomes new work from major filmmakers Claire Denis, Valérie Donzelli, Ildikó Enyedi, Jim Jarmusch, Richard Linklater, Jafar Panahi, Park Chan-wook and Kelly Reichardt, and also highlights a new generation of auteurs: Ali Asgari (“Divine Comedy”), Simón Mesa Soto (“A Poet”), Teona Strugar Mitevska (“Mother”) and Mélisa Godet (“A Place for Her”).\n\n\tThe Horizons selection also celebrates the vitality of Arab cinema, with several films that have made their mark at major festivals: Cherien Dabis’s “What’s Left of Us” won acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival; both Hasan Hadi’s “The President’s Cake” and Arab and Tarzan Nasser’s “Once Upon a Time in Gaza” won awards at Cannes; and Cyril Aris’s “A Sad and Beautiful World” and Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” saw success at Venice. Two documentaries complete the selection: Raoul Peck’s “Orwell: 2+2=5” and Hélène Harder’s “Fatna, a Woman Named Rachid,” presented as a world premiere.\n\n\tThe 11th Continent program consists of six fiction and nine documentary films. The section presents new films by critically acclaimed filmmakers, including Massoud Bakhshi, Oliver Laxe, Lucrecia Martel and Hlynur Pálmason, while celebrating daring auteurs like Kamal Aljafari, Lana Daher, Damien Hauser, Dima El-Hor, Gianluca Matarrese, Namir Abdel Messeeh, Lemohang Mosese and Tamara Stepanyan. The program also includes restored versions of three classics of Arab cinema, including “The Mirage” by Ahmed Bouanani (1980), which has been restored especially for this occasion.\n\n\tThe Moroccan Panorama delivers seven fiction and documentary films by Moroccan filmmakers, of which two are world and international premieres: “Five Eyes” by Karim Debbagh and “Porte Bagage” by Abdelkarim El-Fassi. Moroccan cinema is further highlighted this year with a total of 15 films presented across the various sections of the festival.\n\t\n\n\tThe Young Audiences and Families section offers a program aimed at children and youth aged 4 to 18, as well as families, with 13 screenings that “celebrate curiosity and an awakening to the art of cinema.”\n\n\tRounding up this year’s films are a selection of films by and featuring Jodie Foster, Guillermo del Toro, Raouya and Hussein Fahmi, personalities to whom the festival offers Tributes this year, are presented at the Palais des Congrès, the Cinéma le Colisée, and the Musée Yves Saint-Laurent.\n\n\tOFFICIAL COMPETITIONAISHA CAN’T FLY AWAY by Morad MostafaEgypt, France, Germany, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Sudanwith Buliana Simon, Ziad Zaza, Mamdouh Saleh, Emad Ghoniem, Maya Mohamed, Mohamed Abd ElhadySupported by the Atlas Workshops\n\n\tAMOEBA by Siyou TanSingapore, Netherlands, France, Spain, South Koreawith Ranice Tay, Nicole Lee, Lim Shi-An, Genevieve Tan, Jack Kao, Ng Mun Poh\n\n\tBEFORE THE BRIGHT DAY (NAN FANG SHI GUANG) by Shih-Han TsaoTaiwanwith Hsuan-Li Chen, Kang-Ren Wu, Shu-Mei Sun, R.D.

    "body": "\n\tSikhya Entertainment has set its first collaboration with acclaimed director Karthik Subbaraj, with the feature launching production Monday in Madurai, southern India.\n\n\tThe Tamil-language film unites the banner led by Oscar winner Guneet Monga Kapoor and Achin Jain with the filmmaker behind “Pizza,” “Jigarthanda,” “Petta,” “Iraivi,” “Mercury,” “Jagame Thanthiram,” “Mahaan,” “Jigarthanda DoubleX” and “Retro.” Filming kicked off with a ceremonial blessing.\n\t\n\n\tSikhya’s credits include India’s Academy Award-winning documentary short “The Elephant Whisperers,” along with “The Lunchbox,” “Masaan,” “Pagglait” and the Indian National Film Award recipient “Kathal.” The company has built its profile on narratives that combine locally grounded storytelling with cross-cultural resonance.\n\n\n\tThe new film marks Subbaraj’s 10th directorial effort. His work over the past 10 years has positioned him as a distinctive creative force within the Tamil film industry.\n\n\t“At Sikhya, we’ve always believed in nurturing original voices and telling homegrown bold stories that travel across cultures,” said Monga Kapoor. “Partnering with Karthik feels like a natural extension of that mission. Karthik’s cinema is rooted, inventive and wildly original, yet universal in emotion. He bridges mass appeal and auteur vision with such ease, and I’m excited to be on this journey with Karthik.”\n\n\tSubbaraj said: “I’ve always admired the kind of cinema Sikhya stands for, it truly aligns with the artistic vision I crave to always execute. Collaborating with Guneet and Achin, who have built a legacy of meaningful and award-winning films, is truly special and I’m excited that we are going in this together. This story we’re creating is something very close to my heart, and I’m glad to have found the right producers for the same. Looking forward to this new and exciting collaboration.”\n\t\n\n\tJain added: “Karthik brings a rare balance of craft and instinct, he’s cult and commercial at the same time. His films are unpredictable yet deeply emotional. We’re excited to collaborate with a filmmaker who understands both the pulse of the audience and the heart of storytelling. This partnership reflects Sikhya’s mission to take powerful rooted stories and express them through a truly global cinematic language.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSerbian filmmaker Stefan Djordjević is prepping his sophomore feature, “The Leaves Hang Trembling,” a hybrid docufiction that explores the impact of a teacher’s life and work on the people around her. The project took home the top prize last week at the Crossroads Co-Production Forum in the Thessaloniki Film Festival’s industry section, Agora.\n\n\tAs with Djordjević’s feature debut, “Wind, Talk to Me,” which premiered at the Rotterdam Film Festival this year before winning the top prize at Sarajevo, “The Leaves Hang Trembling” is a cinematic ode to the director’s late mother, who he describes as “the most important person in my life.”\n\t\n\n\tDjordjević’s first film — a deeply personal attempt to reckon with his mother’s death — earned a rapturous review from Variety’s Guy Lodge, who praised the “marvelous” docufiction for how it worked through grief “with wit, grace and imagination…weav[ing] fact, fiction and memory into a heart-bursting tribute to [the director’s] late mother.”\n\n\n\t“The Leaves Hang Trembling” is a companion piece to that film, broadening its scope beyond the four walls of the Djordjević family home. “‘Wind, Talk to Me’ was about how [my mother] inspired my family,” the director told Variety. “But with ‘The Leaves Hang Trembling,’ we can also see how she touched others as well.”\n\n\tThe film documents the life of Djordjević’s mother, Negrica Neca Đorđević, who in 2002 was hired by a local elementary school, where she worked for more than a decade as a beloved teacher, community leader and president of the teachers’ union. Fourteen years later, she was summarily dismissed without cause, “leaving her devastated emotionally,” and with the sense that “her faith in community and loyalty [had been] betrayed,” according to the director.\n\t\n\n\tIn her darkest moment, however, Neca’s students rallied behind her and rose up in her defense, rekindling her hope and her faith in her community. Using direct quotes from her diaries and letters, as well as contemporaneous audio recordings of the events as they unfolded, “The Leaves Hang Trembling” will tell the story of an inspirational woman “who gave so much of her energy, and also dedication and caring and love” to her family, her students and her community. \n\n\tDjordjević said the film “explores what it means to care beyond rules, to connect with others in ways that endure,” while also urging audiences “to feel the courage and compassion of the teacher, to witness the quiet strength of everyday care, and to leave believing in the transformative power of human connection.”\n\n\t“The Leaves Hang Trembling” is being produced against the backdrop of a broad, student-led protest movement that for the past year has galvanized the Serbian public against President Aleksandar Vučić. It began last November, after the collapse of a railway station canopy in the city of Novi Sad that killed 16 people, sparking outrage over the endemic corruption and the culture of impunity that many Serbians blamed for the disaster.\n\n\tAt this week’s industry award ceremony in Thessaloniki, where “The Leaves Hang Trembling” won the top prize in the Crossroads Co-Production Forum, producer Dragana Jovović, of Belgrade-based Non-Aligned Films, who’s producing the film in co-production with Vanja Jambrović of Restart, dedicated the win to Dijana Hrka, the mother of a 27-year-old man, Stefan, who was killed in the Novi Sad tragedy. Earlier this month, Hrka launched a hunger strike in front of Serbia’s National Assembly, demanding a “real investigation” into the events at Novi Sad and calling for “the liberation of all arrested students during the protest,” according to Jovović.\n\n\tWhile Djordjević said he wants to make a “universal film,” he also recognizes that the events of “The Leaves Hang Trembling” and the current political crisis in Serbia are connected. Since last year, many Serbian teachers and university professors have been summarily dismissed for supporting the student protests; in many cases, noted Djordjević, the students have rallied in their teachers’ defense.\n\t\n\n\tThat’s why the director sees “The Leaves Hang Trembling” as not only a testament to his late mother and the lives she touched, but as a part of his country’s “collective memory” — a history that continues to be written in real time.\n\n\tThe events depicted in the film “didn’t just happen nine years ago,” Djordjević said. “It’s still happening, and on a bigger level.”\n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJitendra Kumar is set to headline a new film alongside Pooja Bhatt that delves into India’s traditional pigeon-flying practice.\n\n\tThe project marks a reunion for Kumar and co-producer Hitesh Kewalya, who previously collaborated on “Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan.” Kumar, known for his work in streaming series “Panchayat” (Prime Video) and “Kota Factory” (Netflix) as well as films including “Jaadugar” (Netflix) and the recent “Bhagwat: Chapter One – Raakshas” (ZEE5) will portray a devoted pigeon-keeper in the socially rooted narrative.\n\t\n\n\tIndian National Film Award winner Bhatt will play Kumar’s on-screen mother in what represents a return to dramatic territory the actor has previously explored in films including the award-winning “Zakhm,” along with “Tamanna” and “Daddy.”\n\n\n\tThe as-yet-untitled feature is produced by Khyati Madaan through her Not Out Entertainment banner, with Kewalya serving as co-producer. Kewalya previously wrote “Shubh Mangal Saavdhan” and wrote and directed “Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan.”\n\n\tFirst-time feature director Bilal Hasan helms the project from his own script. Hasan previously earned a Filmfare award nomination for his award-winning short “Chupchaap.”\n\n\tThe story unfolds against the backdrop of a traditional practice involving training homing pigeons and flying them from rooftops. The custom continues in some Indian neighborhoods and among pigeon-racing communities globally. Principal photography is scheduled to begin next year.\n\n\tNot Out Entertainment is developing a slate of culturally specific projects. The banner is currently producing “Abhootpurva,” described as a romantic-horror-comedy set in 1990s Agra starring Ritwik Bhowmik alongside an ensemble cast. The company also has a horror film in development featuring Ahan Shetty, based on a real national tragedy.\n",

And just the entire experience of filming ‘Grinch’ and getting to know him so well, even in all the makeup, was just wonderful.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “As a young person watching an artist at work and taking their craft so seriously, that left a really powerful, lasting impact on me as an adult now.

    "body": "\n\tIn 2012, award-winning documentarian Lauren Greenfield’s film, “The Queen of Versailles,” became a Sundance darling. The documentary followed Jackie and David Siegel, billionaires and owners of Westgate Resorts, as they began building a replica of Versailles in Orlando, Florida. The property was touted as the largest private home in the United States. However, amid their massive build, the 2008 stock market crash drastically altered the couple’s financial status. Now, with a script written by Olivier Award nominee Lindsey Ferrentino, songs by Academy Award–winning songwriter Stephen Schwartz and directed by Tony Award winner Michael Arden, Kristin Chenoweth is stepping into Jackie Siegel’s sparkling pink stilettos and bringing her story to Broadway. Unfortunately, Greenfield’s dazzling assessment of greed, consumption and the American dream doesn’t translate on the stage. \n\t\n\n\t“The Queen of Versailles” opens in France in 1661, with 23-year-old King Louis XIV (Pablo David Lauccerica) deciding to build what would become Versailles. Zipping forward in time to 2007, the audience then meets Jackie (Chenoweth), who, while sitting in the middle of a construction site in front of a camera crew, talks about building her own palace, her seven children and why it’s always essential to supersize things (including McDonald’s) when the option is given. \n\n\n\tShortly thereafter, we are introduced to David (F. Murray Abraham), Jackie’s much-older husband, who seems content to indulge (and fund) his wife’s shenanigans, especially since there are plans to have a Benihana on the meg-mansion’s grounds. From there, across two acts, the socialite welcomes audiences into her world. We learn more about her upbringing and how she worked several jobs to support herself while attending engineering school. The show also touches on her violent first marriage to her eldest daughter’s biological father, as well as her meet-cute and courtship with David. Meanwhile, endless construction, the Siegels’ lavish (but tacky) lifestyle and their chaotic family life buzz in the background.  \n\t\n\n\t“The Queen of Versailles” certainly has more than a few stunning elements. The scenic and video design by Dane Laffery is flawless, transporting audiences between 17th-century France and early 2000s Florida. Additionally, costumes spearheaded by Christian Cowan showcase who Jackie is before she even opens her mouth.  From a bedazzled Hermes’ tote covered in red, blue and white to match the French flag to her over-the-top beaded gowns and penchant for gold and glitter, her presence immediately screams new money.\n\n\tThe performances, including a megatallented ensemble, are also excellent. As expected, Chenoweth is a force, and though Jackie isn’t really a “likable” figure, the Emmy Award winner draws out aspects of her personality that offer glimmers of sympathy for this toxicly positive billionaire woman. Abraham doesn’t really sing. Still, he delivers a perfect David, a crochety old man, only pleased if his pockets are fat. Moreover, Nina White and Tatum Grace Hopkins, who portrayed Jackie’s daughter Victoria and niece Jonquil, respectively, stand alongside Chenoweth with their own powerhouse vocals.\n\n\tYet the play’s positive components do not make up for its faults. Broadway is the wrong medium for this story. Musicalizing the story does little to ground the audience in Jackie’s world and instead pulls and stretches the tale, when the themes alone could speak for themselves. The narrative would actually soar if it were given feature-film treatment. Additionally, adding the musical element further bastardizes this tale. Except for “Caviar Dreams,” the third song in Act One, none of the other selections are particularly memorable. Though the opening act is fairly intriguing, by the second act, the nearly three-hour-long performance began to drag, especially as the show’s tone shifted drastically. \n\n\tTaking a documentary and translating it on the Broadway stage was always going to be an ambitious endeavor, and when creatives attempt such feats, they should be celebrated. However, this entry into the Siegels’ world fails to land. Removing several of the music numbers and condensing “The Queen of Versailles” to cut specific sequences, such as Jackie’s upbringing and even scenes involving the French Revolution (though delightful), would make for a much more tonally focused and engaging production. In the end, some stories are best left for the silver screen.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 1, Episode 3 of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tWhen Chris Chalk first appeared in Episode 2 of HBO’s “It: Welcome to Derry,” devoted horror fans likely recognized that his character, Dick Hallorann, shares a name with the Overlook Hotel’s telekinetic chef from “The Shining.” Episode 3 confirms that this is no mere nod to another Stephen King classic, when the young Black soldier showcases his unique powers in a thrilling and terrifying sequence. Chalk’s Hallorann is a far cry from Scatman Crothers’ ill-fated incarnation of the character in Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film, though. “Everything I do is going to have some dignity,” Chalk tells Variety, and he brings that dignity to Hallorann with a strong purpose and intensity throughout the show.\n\t\n\n\tDick Hallorann was first introduced in 1977 as a magical character who shares Danny Torrance’s eponymous psychic abilities in Stephen King’s third novel, “The Shining.” He plays a prominent role in the book and reappears in its 2013 sequel, “Doctor Sleep.” In between the two, he is briefly featured in the 1986 “It” novel, albeit in a short flashback. Even Chalk admits, “I didn’t remember any of that stuff in the book. I mean, the book has 3000 stories. It’s OK to forget some of it.”\n\n\n\tHowever, those intermittent flashbacks in “It” provide much of the source material for “Welcome to Derry,” so Hallorann’s canonical presence in the town is naturally expanded upon in the prequel series. Accordingly, Chalk restudied the source material and, with guidance from writer, director and executive producer Andy Muschietti, the ephemeral character came into full view.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tChalk’s Hallorann departs from past iterations of the character, though. Contemporary criticisms of “The Shining” will often point to Hallorann as a stereotypical, token Black character. “He’s literally a Magical Negro,” says Chalk. “But the trouble with a Magical Negro is that they’re the only motherfuckin’ Black person in the movie.” That’s certainly the case in “The Shining,” where Crothers’ Hallorann is among an otherwise all-white cast.\n\n\t“Welcome to Derry,” however, steers clear of this outdated trope. Alongside Chalk as Hallorann, Jovan Adepo plays Leroy Hanlon, a Black Army Major with a wife and son, who have their own arcs and are respectively played by Taylour Paige and Blake Cameron James. There’s also Hank (Stephen Rider) and Veronica Grogan (Amanda Christine), a single Black father and his daughter, who work at the town’s movie theater and become scapegoats in the disappearance of some of the town’s kids. Other Black soldiers populate the Army base and town as well as Native American and Latino characters.\n\n\t“To already have this huge selection of Black humans in the narrative, not just as props, but as essential to the narrative, I know we’re going to avoid these tropes, because the trope doesn’t exist if everybody there serves a purpose,” Chalk says, “I do happen to be a magical Black man, but in a world full of Black people, it doesn’t come off as gross.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Welcome to Derry” wears its racial commentary on its sleeve. Set in 1964, it expands upon the setting’s history of racial violence and segregation, which are peripherally mentioned in the 2017 and 2019 “It” films, but unavoidable in the novel. Even Hallorann’s blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearance in the book describes his role as the founder of “The Black Spot,” a nightclub for Black soldiers stationed in Derry, which was burned down by a Klu Klux Klan-like group.\n\n\tWhen we first meet Hallorann in the show, he and some other Black troops are kicked out of a local bar at the police chief’s insistence. They then return to the Army base, where they are similarly targeted until Hallorann’s name evokes some authority, the first sign that there is something special about him.\n\n\tIt’s soon revealed that the Army base is digging for some ancient weapon or power beneath Derry and that Hallorann’s abilities can help them pinpoint its location. Those abilities come into full effect in Episode 3, when Hallorann is tasked with guiding a helicopter over Derry in pursuit of the targeted spot. Using his abilities from the back of the chopper, Hallorann enters a trance, becoming increasingly distressed until his reality is fractured and the sequence cuts between the helicopter in the sky and a dark realm that Hallorann navigates within his own psyche.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“He’s just in the back of the plane, but he’s half in and half out of that reality, because he’s digging into another one,” Chalk says. To play that version of Hallorann, who is physically there but psychologically absent, Chalk focused on making his breathing appear intentional and trembles involuntary. Rather than study previous performances of characters “shining,” he turned to examples of real-world people pushing psychic barriers through herbalism and witchcraft across various cultures. “I won’t watch another movie because what’s the point? It’s just another person guessing,” Chalk says. He prefers to base his performance off of real people’s attempts at mysticism.\n\n\tMeanwhile, playing Hallorann in his psychic realm is a calmer experience. “He thinks he controls it,” Chalk says. “There’s a calm, because he knows it’s in the psychic realm and nothing can hurt him.” Everything in the psychic realm is constructed of Hallorann’s own memories, and he knows how to navigate it. As those memories get hijacked by something dark and unknown, however, he adds, “the world starts caving in on him and collapsing on him.”\n\n\tAudiences witness this when Hallorann sees the tower of Pennywise’s floating victims in his psyche. Visions of war and violence from his childhood flash before he snaps back to reality, where he has one foot out of the helicopter’s back door, saved only when Hanlon pulls him back.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile the actors were safely on the ground in a soundstage throughout the sequence, Chalk recalls, “Both Jovan and I got hurt. It was early on in the shoot, and when he saves me from opening the back, he popped my rib. That dude is strong. I studied Jiu Jitsu, so I was like, ‘It shouldn’t be that bad.’ But then I hit him against the wall and I threw his back out. So the struggle you see is actually two actors who got a little carried away and are really hurt in the scene.”\n\n\tLuckily, the two actors healed, and the resulting scene is a thrilling mix of real-world action and paranormal mystery. By the end of the episode, Hallorann is having dinner at Hanlon’s house. After the meal, the two soldiers talk about what happened in the sky. Hallorann explains his powers to the best of his abilities. He also says that when entering Hanlon’s mind, he’s unable to locate any fear— a condition linked to amygdala damage Hanlon endured during the war. Given what we know about Pennywise and his appetite for fear, it seems that Hallorann and Hanlon may prove the first lines of defense against the town’s terrifying clown curse.\n\t\n\n\tFor real world bravery, though, Chalk commends Andy Muschietti alongside showrunners Jason Fuchs and Brad Caleb Kane for making a bold show. “I think it has some degree of courage,” he says, “They could have very well told one of the other stories from ‘It’ and it would be honorable, but I love that Andy and Jason and Brad said, ‘No, we’re going to do this version of racism that’s still very clear, and it’s still very visceral, but we’re going to do it in genre. We’re going to do it our way and add that other layer of horror.’ In my opinion, if we can ground an honest reality and tell this honest story, and then you add terror on top, people are going to respond.”\n",

The ensemble cast includes Kang Ha-neul, Cha Eun-woo, Kim Young-kwang, Kang Young-suk and Han Seon-hwa.\n\t\n\n\tJapanese anime “Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc” ranked third with $825,000, bringing its total to $21.6 million. The film adapts the “Reze” arc of Tatsuki Fujimoto’s hit manga. Directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara with a screenplay by Hiroshi Seko, the movie follows Denji as his encounter with café worker Reze leads to a clash between intimate connection and bloody chaos. Voice cast includes Reina Ueda, Fairouz Ai, Tomori Kusunoki, and Maaya Uchida. Sony/Crunchyroll are handling distribution in the market.\n\n\n\tAnother Japanese import, “The Exit 8,” took $313,000 for a $2.6 million cume. Directed by Kawamura Genki, the film stars Ninomiya Kazunari as a man trapped in a seemingly endless subway corridor where he must detect minute anomalies to escape.\n\n\tNew entry “Bugonia” opened in fifth with $154,000 from 528 screens.\n\t\n\n\tTim Burton-produced stop-motion classic “Coraline” continued its reissue run in sixth with $129,000 (cume $2.1 million). \n\n\t“Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” took seventh with $125,000 (cume $41.5 million).\n\n\tSouth Korean animated feature “Toritori and the Secret of the Baby Dino” opened in eighth with $116,000 from 240 screens. Universal’s “Wicked” ranked ninth with $83,000 (cume $15.3 million), and Pingyao winner “The World of Love” rounded out the top ten with $88,000 (cume $594,000).\n\n\tThe top 10 films collectively grossed $3.8 million for the weekend, down sharply from the previous frame’s $4.5 million, continuing South Korea’s box office doldrums. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 40th annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony lasted for about five nonstop hours Saturday, at least for those watching live at L.A.’s Peacock Theatre or as a stream on Disney+. The show will be less than half that length by the time viewers get their crack at seeing it, or a condensed version of it, on New Year’s Day as an ABC special. But when it’s worthy artists like Cyndi Lauper, the White Stripes, Outkast, Soundgarden, Salt-N-Pepa, Warren Zevon, Bad Company and Joe Cocker being celebrated — probably the closest thing to a universally agreeable crop in years — the word “excess” just naturally seems like it should be preceded by the word “blessed.” \n\t\n\n\tHere, in photographs and words, are some of the memorable looks and quotes associated with this year’s performances, speeches and backstage chats.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Momsen and Brandi Carlile perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSOUNDGARDEN\n\n\tThere seems to be a pattern here. When the surviving members of Nirvana get back together for a semi-reunion (as they did at FireAid earlier in 2025), they only employ female singers as fill-ins for the late Kurt Cobain. Soundgarden: same thing. It makes some sense, getting away from someone who might invite comparisons too close to Chris Cornell and settling on the female voice instead. Taylor Momsen brought growly grit to “Rusty Cage,” followed by the band’s fellow Seattle native Brandi Carlile breaking through to the heavens with “Black Hole Sun” (with Momsen returning to the stage to sing the rock anthem’s famous closing backing vocals). As dessert, Cornell’s 21-year-old daughter Toni Cornell sang “Fell on Black Days,” accompanied by a cellist and Heart’s Nancy Wilson on acoustic guitar.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHiro Yamamoto, Matt Cameron, Kim Thayil, Jim Carrey, Taylor Momsen and Ben Shepherd at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJim Carrey handled the induction duties. “You may ask why oh why Soundgarden, the heaviest of rock and roll royalty. (has) Jim Carrey to induct them into the Hall of Fame. Is there some deep cosmic connection between them, or was the Spoonman not available? Well, the truth is, I grew up with the awe-inspiring bands of the hard rock era. Every day I spent hours in the corner of a basement playing power chords on a goalie stick.” When he finally got to see and meet Soundgarden, “I stood right in front of them, letting the waves of electricity wash over me, like an audio baptism. They pushed me under and when I came up, I was free. After the show, they handed me what is to this day one of my most prized possessions, a Defender Telecaster Chris played on the show, signed by the whole band.” He described Cornell, whom he met on a few occasions, as “always really sincere, very down to earth, thoughtful, funny,” saying that “for all time, his voice will continue to light up the ether like a Tesla coil.”\n\n\t(Soundgarden members were not the only old cohorts Carey was meeting up with; he was reuniting for the first time in 25 years with his “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” costar, Momsen, under extremely different creative circumstances.)\n\n\tThe night was light on political talk, but founding bassist Hiro Yamamoto did take the occasion to say what was on his mind about current events. He said that hearing “my parents’ stories of American citizens who were rounded up and placed in prison camps just for being Japanese during World War II, that affected my life greatly, and it really echoes strongly today. … C’mon, we can do a lot better than this. Let’s not add another story like this to our history.” But he urged communication, not enmity: “Let’s keep the dialogue alive because dialogue’s what we need.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tToni Cornell at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSaid 21-year-old Toni Cornell backstage after singing “Fell on Black Days,” “It’s so surreal and I’m so honored I get to be here and do this for my dad. At the end of the day i just wish he could have been here to see this honor for himself. He’s he reason I do what I do. … I was really little and I remember going to my dad’s Songbook tour, which I think was his first acoustic tour… I was always really touched by just him and his voice and his guitar, and then eventually he did it with a cellist. And I just really love that arrangement. Everyone can relate to that song on so many levels. I fell on black days. We’ve all been there. So I personally related to that and I really wanted to channel how my dad would’ve performed that song on his own.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSandra Denton, DJ Spinderella and Cheryl James of Salt-N-Pepa at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSALT-N-PEPA\n\n\t“Let me put my glasses on here,” said Cheryl “Salt” James — not the first time those words have been spoken at a Hall of Fame ceremony. But once she was properly sighted, she got into why she thinks the hip-hop act has been slighted, getting into their legal battle with Universal Music and reiterating that their music is unable to be streamed right now because of the dispute.\n\n\t“This is for every woman who picked up a mic and they told her she couldn’t, every sister who had to fight twice is hard to be heard. But every artist has had to learn that ownership is the real freedom. When we came up, the industry was different. We didn’t have streaming, we didn’t have social media. We had cassette tapes, turntables and dreams. But even back then, we had to fight to be heard and to prove our word. We’re in a fight right now (over music) that rightfully belongs to us after 40 years as we celebrate this moment. Fans can’t even stream our music. It’s been taken down from all streaming platforms because the industry still doesn’t want to play fair. Salt-N-Pepa has never been afraid of a fight. This is the influence award. We have to keep using our influence until the industry honors creativity, the way the audience does with love, respect, and fairness. And that includes streaming platforms too.”\n\n\tJames took a lighter approach in saying “thank you to the fans, the DJs, the women who rhymed in their mirrors, and the mighty good men who supported us. I want to apologize to the countless fans who got in trouble for cutting their hair like us and singing our lyrics. To all the guys who had a crush on us and had our posters on the wall: You’re welcome.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInductees Sandra Denton aka Pepa and Cheryl James aka Salt of Salt N Pepa perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSandra “Pepa” Denton also got some words in, as did their longtime DJ Spinderella, aka Deidra Roper, who said, “I will be celebrating 40 years as a DJ next year. How crazy is that? When I started it was weird thing to see a woman on a turntable. It was literally a boy’ club… Tonight, being the first female DJ inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame, for every woman who touched a turntable and said ‘I could do that too,’ this is for you.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBryan Adams and inductee Simon Kirke of Bad Company perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBAD COMPANY\n\n\tAnd then there was one… who was able to make it to the ceremony. Guitarist Mick Ralphs died earlier this year, and while singer Paul Rodgers was expected to come and perform, he bowed out last week due to health concerns, leaving drummer Simon Kirke as the sole representative. Kirke was happy to get a drummer-to-drummer handoff from Mick Fleetwood near the beginning of the show, and then perform with a band that had the Black Crowes’ Chris Robinson handling lead vocals on “Feel Like Makin’ Love” and Bryan Adams singing “Can’t Get Enough,” with Joe Perry and Nancy Wilson joining in on guitars.\n\n\t“I’ve never played ‘Can’t Get Enough’ in a tuxedo before, you’ll have to forgive me,” Kirke quipped at the beginning of his speech.\n\n\tKirke talked about how far this stage seemed from his childhood prospects. “I was 14 years old sitting in my classroom overlooking Middlesboro, my hometown, and I could see beyond the town, to the steel works, the chemical factory with the shipyard. My teacher, Mr. Garrity, said, ‘OK, class, take a good look out there. That’s where you’ll be going when you graduate.’ That night I went to a dance and I heard a record by Little Richard, and a box of fireworks went off in my head, rockets and all. I thought to myself, ‘I’m gonna follow that music and find out all about it.’ That’s what I did. Now I found myself being inducted into the brotherhood and sisterhood of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSimon Kirke performs onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Mazur/Getty Images for RRH\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBackstage, Kirke talked about the notable absences from the original Bad Co. lineup, saying there were “mixed emotions. You know, when death takes a friend, it never really dies,  it never really fades away. And I’m just glad that Mick was able to hear that we were inducted before he passed away. I believe (Ralphs’ passing) was two weeks after he got the news… Paul called him and said, ‘Hey mate, we got in. We got in.’ Mick said, ‘Does that mean we get free hot dogs?’ I guess it was the morphine talking. But he went out with a smile. I miss him very much. And it was hard holding it together out there.”\n\t\n\n\tWith Rodgers, “What happened was, as you all know, he’s had health problems for quite a while, and it’s not so much the singing or the rehearsals. It was the traveling and the flying. I don’t want to speak out of turn, but flying was a big problem for him, just to be on the safe side. So he called me last week and said, ‘Hey man, so sorry…’ But he called Bryan Adams, who was great tonight, an absolute marvel, and the Hall of Fame contacted Chris Robinson, so we got two great substitutes. I do wish he had been here, but I totally understand, and in fact,” he noted, looking for a silver lining, “we’ve got more publicity from him not coming.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBig Boi and André 3000 of Outkast speak onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOUTKAST\n\n\tAs legendary duos go, the Hall had better luck with getting full attendance with Outkast than with the White Stripes. Even then, of the two, only Big Boi chose to perform, while André 3000 looked on — but few fans could realistically claim there was a great disruption of chemistry in that, since the two had spent most of the time they were together acting almost as conjoined solo acts. (Still, it seemed like a missed opportunity for a flute solo to be added to “The Way You Move.”)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJanelle Monae at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Outkast performance salute packed in more songs per square homage than that for any other act of the night. Big Boi was joined by JID on “ATLiens,” Doja Cat on “Ms. Jackson,” Tyler, the Creator on “B.O.B.,” Janelle Monae seeming to be playing a spunky — if not downright bratty — teenager on Andre’s rocking”Hey Ya,” Sleepy Brown on “The Way You Move” and Killer Mike on “The Whole World.” If this Hall of Fame ceremony sometimes seemed like it was more suited to be a limited series than a special, Outkast’s segment could practically have been stretched out to two all-star episodes all by itself.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJack White speaks onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWHITE STRIPES\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking to his former drummer’s absence, White said: “I spoke with Meg White the other day, and she said that she’s very sorry she couldn’t make it here tonight, but she wanted me to tell you that she’s very grateful. And to all of the folks who supported her in all the years, it really means a lot to her. She also helped me write all this… I sent these things to her. She checked it for me for a lot of punctuation and corrections. She’s pretty good at that.”\n\n\tHe continued by sharing a random thought of Meg’s: “She said, ‘Do you remember, Jack? We used to walk around and animals, for some reason, would stare at us. They would stop and stare at us for some reason. Even at the Detroit Zoo, an elephant did the exact same thing one time.’ She just wanted me to tell you that,” he explained, to crowd laughter.\n\n\tWhite read off a litany of musicians he wanted to thank as influences, including such varied names as Loretta Lynn, Fugazi, the Misfits, Jethro Tull, the Troggs, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Arthur Lee and Love, the Flat Duo Jets, Dick Dale, Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow, the Sonics, Pavement, Black Flag, Sleater-Kinney, the Breeders, the Cramps, Merle Haggard, the Hives, Them, the Damned, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Minor Threat and Captain Beefheart.\n\n\tIn the video tribute that the Rock Hall put together for the duo, Olivia Rodrigo offered a younger generation’s appreciation of the pair — and the highest possible veneration for “Seven Nation Army” in particular: “Do you hear those seven notes? There’s no question what it is. ‘Seven Nation Army’ is the most iconic song of all time — it’s just so ingrained into who we are as humans.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFeist and Olivia Rodrigo pose in the press room during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd then she and Feist sang a lovely duet of one of the White Stripes’ gentlest songs, “We Are Going to Be Friends,” followed by Twenty One Pilots doing the more ferociously classic “Seven Nation Army.” There was some controversy among WS fans about Pilots getting the pick, although it was easy to see where the Hall drew the connection, in choosing one of the few famous two-person outfits in rock. Tyler Joseph played White’s bass-sounding riff on an actual bass, then switched to keyboards briefly, taking the mask off his face and looking plaintively into an overhead camera as he took the song into a nearly balladic version for one verse.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Dun and Tyler Joseph of Twenty One Pilots at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCYNDI LAUPER\n\t\n\n\t“Cyndi embodies every quality of an artist that I admire,” Chappell Roan said in her much-anticipated induction speech bringing Lauper into the Hall. “She’s a born performer and a revolutionary songwriter, a forever fashion icon, and a fierce advocate and ally. And from the very beginning, she owned every ounce of who she was — the manic, panicked hair, all of those rad Fingerless gloves and those unbelievably layered, dynamic and one-of-a-kind vocals… Can I hear a little commotion for the vocals?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan and Cyndi Lauper arrive at the GBK Brand Bar & Meals On Me Backstage Lounge At The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for GBK Brand Bar L\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRoan looked back to Lauper’s impact at the very start of her nascent career: “One of Cyndi’s most inspiring songs to me personally is ‘True Colors.’ When I was 14 years old, I performed ‘True Colors’ at a talent show in my hometown in Missouri. That was my first time ever winning a competition for singing, and that has been so important to me ever since. ‘True Colors’ has gone on to be an anthem synonymous with love and acceptance in the LGBTQ+ community and beyond — a message that still stands the test of time.”\n\n\tLauper was as truly colorful as ever in that particular regard when she sang “True Colors” as part of a multi-artist performance segment in her honor, pausing the song as a vertical rainbow/pride flag unfurled from the top of the stage behind her, in a striking and pointed camera angle.\n\n\tIn her acceptance speech, Lauper thanked “my badass female band I always dreamed of having” — which, for this occasion, included guest drummer Gina Schock of the Go-Go’s — and then positioned herself as part of a middle generation in the history of women in rock.\n\n\t“So now to make a long story short…” she quipped. “Oops, too late for that. But I just want to say that I know that I stand on the shoulders of the women in the industry that came before me, and my shoulders are broad enough to have the women that come after me stand on mine. And the other thing that I thought was really important, which is why I really came here tonight, is to tell you that the little kid in me still believes that rock ‘n’ roll can save the world.”\n\n\tShe noted that, when she uses the R&R term for herself, she is thinking in terms of the same big tent that the Hall itself has used for years in bringing in acts from different genres under that attitudinal umbrella.\n\t\n\n\t“Rock ‘n’ roll is a big, wonderful quilt of a lot of different styles of music. Thank goodness,” she said. “And all of that music has influenced me and my work, and without it, I don’t know what kind of music I’d be making. So I just want to say, now of all times, let’s come together again and do good in the world because it needs us…\n\n\t“You know, I always was part of the rock ‘n’ roll community anyway. You just didn’t wanna talk to me because, you know, they thought I was a little crazy. I don’t know why. Anyway, all kidding aside, I love you. Thank you very much to the Rock Hall of Fame. I’m so happy you’re bringing women back in. There are a lot of us. And long live rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRaye and inductee Cyndi Lauper perform onstage at the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFilmMagic\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter singing a solo rendition of “True Colors” that climaxed with the vertical unrolling of a rainbow pride banner, Lauper was matched powerfully with one of today’s most promising rising stars, Raye, on “Time After Time,” then joined by Avril Lavigne (and eventually Salt-N-Pepa) for “Girls Just Want to Have Fun.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDavid Letterman speaks onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Mazur/Getty Images for RRH\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWARREN ZEVON\n\n\tHandling the induction speech, David Letterman told the story of having Zevon on his program shortly after the rocker was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and given only months to live. It was there that Zevon issued his famous “Enjoy every sandwich” advice, and Letterman spoke of following the singer-songwriter to his dressing room. Then, he said, Zevon handed him the electric guitar he had used in his many appearances on the show, saying, “Take care of this for me.” “I know what’s supposed to happen now,” Letterman said, “and sure as hell, it did happen. I started to sob uncontrollably.”\n\n\tLetterman stood beside the guitar in question and said, “For 22 years, I have taken care of the guitar. … By God, tonight it’s going back to work.” To Dave Keuning, lead guitarist of the Killers, he said, “It’s all yours, sir.” And at that point, it was left to the Killers — with special guest Waddy Wachtel, who played guitar on most of Zevon’s most famous records — to close the tribute out with their version of one of the honoree’s signature songs, “Lawyers, Guns and Money.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDave Keuning, Brandon Flowers, Ronnie Vannucci and Mark Stoermer of the Killers at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt was only a one-song tribute, and his most famous song, “Werewolves of London,” did not factor into it — save for a couple of “Ah-oooh!” phrasings that Brandon Flowers worked in near the end of “Lawyers” as a semi-subtle interpolation.\n\n\tLetterman referred back to the catchphrase that Zevon introduced in his final appearance on his show. ““The thing about ‘Enjoy every sandwich’ — you know that that’s easy, but it’s deeply meaningful. And there’s not a person in this room who hasn’t considered that, but nobody can hang on to that on a daily basis. But by God, isn’t that true of life around the planet? Enjoy every sandwich.”\n\n\tOTHER HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\tChubby Checker chose to do a show rather than attend the Hall ceremony, but he did appear in video from the stage of his concert, holding the trophy that had been sent out to him for the occasion and saying “how happy I am and that I’m around to enjoy it.” He then broke out into a too-quickly-cut-away Twist, the revolutionary solo dance he popularized.\n\n\tLike Checker and Meg White, bass-playing studio-sessions legend Carol Kaye took a pass on attending the ceremony. Unlike them, she had repeatedly said that she did not want to be inducted at all, offering a variety of reasons on her social media — most recently declaring that she was a jazz musician, not a rocker, and citing the cost of tickets for guests. In any event, anyone watching the show wouldn’t have known she was getting what others would consider the honor of a lifetime under extreme protest, as producers put together a nice video package to educate viewers about her contributions, using vintage clips.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFlea and Beck perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTwo segments during the show paid tribute to recently departed Hall of Fames. The show began with a raucous Sly & the Family Stone tribute that had Stevie Wonder joined by Maxwell, Jennifer Hudson, new Grammy nominee Leon Thomas, Flea and Beck on “Dance to the Music,” “Everyday People,” “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)” and “Higher.” Sly Stone died June 9.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Hudson and Maxwell perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 08, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tElton John appeared toward the end of the night, singing the haunting “God Only Knows” in tribute to Brian Wilson, who passed away June 11.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNathaniel Rateliff, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Tedeschi Trucks Band provided plenty of cover for the late Joe Cocker at the climax, joined by Nathaniel Rateliff on “The Letter,” Teddy Swims on “Feelin’ Alright?” and a veritable cast of thousands on “With a Little Help From My Friends” — Lauper, Rateliff, Robinson, Swims and Thomas. As the song asks: Do we need anybody?

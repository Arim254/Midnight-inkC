    "body": "\n\tAt Variety, we talk a lot about the soft power of the red carpet. We live in an age where “image architect” is a vaunted job title, thanks to the serious economic and cultural impact the right look can offer stars and brands. \n\n\tWe can largely thank Valentino Garavani, who died at 93 on Monday, for creating this mutually beneficial relationship. In the late ’70s, European fashion houses became global enterprises. As the designer of deeply glamorous and dreamlike gowns, Mr. Valentino (as he was known) saw the writing on the wall. Celebrities and artists — particularly actresses — would come to reinvent how fashion captivated culture and commerce. His muses are renowned, from Jackie Kennedy to Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts to Cate Blanchett.\n\t\n\n\tCelebrated documentary filmmaker Matt Tyrnauer (above, far right) chronicled the designer’s opulent lifestyle and pioneering spirit in the 2008 movie “Valentino: The Last Emperor.” The project premiered at the Venice Film Festival that year, and would spark a subgenre of fashion docs that gave glimpses into the pain, mess and belief it takes to inspire the masses and sell big.\n\n\n\tWe caught up with Tyrnauer just hours after the Valentino news hit, drawing tributes from the likes of Paltrow and Colman Domingo, to discuss the designer’s legacy in show business and his notoriously mercurial personality. \n\t\n\t\tYour movie, now almost 20 years old, shows how prescient Valentino was in bringing celebrities into the fashion world. What will his legacy be in our town? \t\n\n\tValentino was at the forefront of Hollywood’s love affair with fashion in the late 20th century and the early 21st. He was one of the first high fashion designers to embrace movie stars hardcore. Before that, fashion was really focused on socialites and aristocrats. It was Valentino and his partner, Giancarlo Giammetti, who really pushed hard to have actresses wear his clothes. Being a global movie star at that time was an extraordinarily potent type of fame. Fashion began to be redefined by movie stars wearing your clothes, not only out in public or on the red carpet, but sometimes in the films themselves. Valentino was essential for that movement from high society to Hollywood being an important part of the fashion universe.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWho were some of his biggest muses? \t\n\n\tElizabeth Taylor and, in Italy, Monica Vitti were two of the first. Through the years, we saw Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Hathaway, the “Kates” (meaning Cate Blanchett and Kate Winslet), Claire Danes, Julia Roberts. It was Jackie Kennedy, though not a movie star, who was the glamorous woman who made him a household name. She was the first First Lady to bring a movie-star-level candlepower to that position.\n\t\n\t\tYou had unprecedented access to Valentino for your film. What’s the thing that will stay with you?\t\n\n\tI never saw anyone live a lifestyle like Valentino. It was so over the top, beyond description. There were villas and chateaus and chalets and Fifth Avenue apartments. Not one pug, not two pugs, but five pugs. And multiple servants in white gloves to tend to the pugs. Gianni Agnelli famously said, ”I live like a king, but Valentino lives better than me. And I don’t know how he does it.” \n\t\n\t\tYou were very open about having big creative disagreements with Valentino during filming. How do you reflect on it now?\t\n\n\tWhat really defined the whole production was the warm embrace of Valentino, and then the really unspeakable tantrum. It was a seesawing motion throughout, and I put some of that in the film. He had no editorial control over the film. He hated the film. When he first saw it, it premiered at the Venice Film Festival. He got a 10-minute standing ovation after, and he quickly turned into a big fan. He was extraordinary at doing the press attendant to the film, which was a surprise hit. I have nothing but affection and fondness and respect for Valentino and Giancarlo Giamatti. They were absolutely extraordinary people to spend that much time with, and they really did let me into their world. It was extremely brave. At the end of the day, we went into the success of the film arm-in-arm. It was an unforgettable moment. And it really did go around the world. It was a very happy ending.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDon’t doubt the hustle of Marty Mauser.\n\n\tA24‘s “Marty Supreme,” a sports dramedy starring Timothée Chalamet as a fictional table tennis champ, has surpassed $100 million globally. It’s the fourth A24 release to ever cross this box office milestone after 2022’s Oscar best picture winner “Everything Everywhere All at Once” ($142 million), 2024’s dystopian thriller “Civil War” ($127 million) and last year’s romantic drama “Materialists” ($107 million). This benchmark is especially impressive because it’s been a challenging time for arthouse releases; “Marty Supreme” and “Materialists” were 2025’s only independent films to generate above $100 million.\n\t\n\n\tThanks to Chalamet’s unconventional marketing efforts and glowing word-of-mouth from critics and audiences, “Marty Supreme” has earned $102.3 million worldwide, including $80.8 million in the United States and $21.5 million overseas. Top international markets include the United Kingdom with $16 million, Canada with $5.7 million and Mexico with $944,000. (Canada is traditionally a part of North American grosses, but A24 only distributes its films in the U.S. and partners with companies such as Entertainment Film Distributors, Elevation and Sun Distribution Group for other territories.)\n\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” recently became A24’s highest-grossing movie in the U.S. after overtaking the benchmark held by “Everything Everywhere All at Once” with $77 million. Where “Marty” will end up on A24’s worldwide charts remains to be seen. However, the film is likely to remain a draw in the States through awards season, and it’s yet to be released in several overseas markets. “Marty Supreme” debuts next weekend in 12 territories, including Australia, Brazil and Italy.\n\t\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” cost $70 million, which makes it A24’s most expensive film to date and means it hasn’t climbed out of the red. (Remember: Theater owners keep about half of ticket sales.) However, “Marty Supreme” has been valuable to A24 on the awards circuit (Chalamet won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice for best actor) and is expected to be a major contender when Oscar nominations are announced on Thursday. Josh Safdie directed the frenetic, R-rated adventure, which follows Marty Mauser as he goes through hell and back to pursue his dream of becoming the world’s best ping pong player.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothy Busfield will be edited out of the upcoming Amazon MGM film “You Deserve Each Other” after he was accused of groping a 7-year-old boy on the set of “The Cleaning Lady,” Variety had learned.\n\n\tThis is the second project involving Busfield to be affected in the wake of his sexual abuse allegations. On Jan. 12, NBC pulled an episode of “Law & Order: SVU” that guest-starred Busfield from its schedule. The episode was set to debut on Jan. 22.\n\t\n\n\tOn Jan. 9, an arrest warrant was issued against Busfield on two counts of sexual abuse involving a minor. The investigation stems from twin boys who appeared on the TV series “The Cleaning Lady” in 2022. Busfield was the director at the time.\n\n\n\tOn Jan. 13, Busfield turned himself in at the Metro Detention Center in Albuquerque. He will remain there until his court hearing on Tuesday. He faces three charges — two counts of criminal sexual contact with a child, which carry a maximum sentence of six years each, and one count of child abuse, which carries a maximum of three years.\n\n\tBusfield was top billed in “You Deserve Each Other” on IMDb, which could suggest a significant contribution to the picture. Other cast members include Penn Badgley, Meghann Fahy, Justin Long, Kyle MacLachlan, Natalie Morales, Ana Gasteyer, Hope Davis, Delaney Rowe and Lisa Gilroy.\n\n\tThe film is directed by Marc Silverstein and Abby Kohn and is based on Sarah Hogle’s novel of the same name. According to the official logline, the film follows “Naomi (Fahy) and Nick (Badgley) who are about to get married and live happily ever after –– the only problem being they’ve fallen completely out of love. With the wedding rapidly approaching and its pressure mounting, they both resolve to secretly push the other into calling off the wedding, only to fall back in love along the way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Beckham family feud has boiled over from tabloid fascination to a burning Hollywood scandal.\n\n\tBrooklyn Beckham released a lengthy statement to his Instagram Stories on Monday morning, accusing his parents, David and Victoria, of trying to “control the narratives” around his life and “trying endlessly to ruin” his relationship with wife Nicola Peltz. The eldest Beckham has been estranged from his family for roughly three years, a painful saga with Instagram unfollows and endless press leaks that have overshadowed the public profiles and work of all involved since it began. \n\t\n\n\t“I had been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,” Beckham wrote. “Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed. I do not want to reconcile with my family. I’m not being controlled, I’m standing up for myself for the first time in my life.”\n\n\n\tA  rep for David Beckham had no comment. Representatives for Victoria Beckham did not immediately respond to a request from Variety. The family dynamic that Brooklyn Beckham alleged in his confessional social media post paints a deeply unflattering portrait of his father and siblings. Victoria Beckham gets the worst of it, accused of momzilla behavior that instantly prompts the question, “Ryan Murphy adaptation, when?” in Hollywood these days. \n\n\tBeckham accused his parents of putting “countless lies” in the media about him and his family. He described his relationship with his parents and siblings as “inauthentic,” buoyed by “performative social media posts” and family events.\n\t\n\n\tBeckham also claimed his parents tried everything they could to curb his relationship with Peltz. He said his mom “cancelled making Nicola’s dress in the eleventh hour” and “attempted to bribe” him into signing away the rights to his name before he got married.\n\n\tOn his wedding day, Beckham said his mother hijacked his first dance with Peltz and “danced very inappropriately” on him.\n\n\tHe recalled, “Marc Anthony called me to the stage, where in the schedule was a planned to be my roamntic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead. She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I’ve never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.”\n\n\tHe ended his statement by saying the narrative that his wife controls his life is “completely backwards,” and instead, it’s his parents who have been manipulating him. These are the kind of pearl-clutching specifics that can derail press tours for ventures like Victoria’s eponymous fashion brand, as well as tarnish a complicated Beckham legacy that seemingly settled with the family enshrined in a bubble of adoration and protection. \n\n\t“My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press or manipulation,” he concluded. “All we want is peace, privacy and happiness for us and our future family.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthew McConaughey recently joined Woody Harrelson and Ted Danson on their “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast. During the episode, Harrelson recalled there were “so many times” he wanted to “punch” McConaughey while filming the first season of “True Detective” because he was method acting.\n\n\t“He’s method,” Harrelson said. “When we were shooting, he was Rust Cohle. There [were] so many times I wanted to punch this motherfucker in the face. I’m so pissed at him cause he’s in his character.”\n\t\n\n\tMcConaughey explained that he needed to be “stoic” between takes to stay in his character’s headspace.\n\n\n\t“We’re sitting there. We’re about to start shooting, and we were rehearsing,” McConaughey recalled. “I’m just kind of being stoic Rust Cohle. Woody goes, like, ‘Hey man, I need to talk to you about something.’ He goes, ‘The way you and I work, McConaughey, I hit you the ball, you hit back, I hit it back to you. We volley, we play. … Man, that’s us. It’s dramatic, but it’s also comedy.'”\n\n\tIn HBO’s “True Detective,” Harrelson and McConaughey played a pair of Southern investigators hunting a serial killer in the esoteric back country of Louisiana. Harrelson, at one point, thought the show was too dark and suggested to McConaughey during production that they should add in some jokes.\n\n\tHe recalled, “I remember saying to [McConaughey] before we started filming, I’m like, ‘Dude, people are gonna expect to laugh with us. We gotta throw some jokes in here.’ He’s just like, ‘Mhm.’ I’m waiting for him to say, ‘Yeah, you’re totally, no, none of that.’ He just, ‘Mhm, yeah.’”\n\t\n\n\t“True Detective” Season 1 earned 5 Emmy Awards and is still widely considered one of the best shows in HBO’s catalog. Despite the enduring popularity, Harrelson recently told “Today” that there is “no chance” of him and McConaughey returning to “True Detective.”\n\n\t“In fairness, never. No chance,” Harrelson said. “Because it turned out great. I love that it turned out the way it did, and if anything, doing another season would, I think, tarnish that.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGenre distribution label Chroma has acquired North American rights to a trio of international features including “Mash Ville,” described as a whiskey-soaked kimchi western that earned its director best director honors at the Fantasia International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe South Korean title will be Chroma’s first release from the package, dropping digitally on Jan. 23, followed by Poland’s “Dead by Dawn” and Estonia’s “The Black Hole.”\n\n\n\tDirector Wook Hwang’s “Mash Ville” is a kimchi western following nine individuals and one corpse whose conflicting objectives lead to escalating chaos in what Chroma describes as “Coen Brothers meets Tarantino.” The film earned Hwang the best director award at the Fantasia International Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tWriter-director Dawid Torrone’s “Dead by Dawn” represents a rare giallo entry from Poland, delivering theatrical horror through stylized visuals. After its world premiere at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, the feature played Morbido Fest, Screamfest and Grimmfest, earning a special mention for best cinematography at the latter.\n\n\tMoonike Siimets’ “The Black Hole” presents an absurdist, arthouse approach to sci-fi through its triptych structure following a small Estonian community dealing with extraterrestrials, a giant spider and an Austrian in breeches after a black hole materializes inside a lilac bush. Following its Fantastic Fest 2024 premiere, the film collected awards at Les Utopiales in France, the Sognielettrici Electricdreams International Film Festival in Milan, the Warsaw International Film Festival, goEast in Germany, the UnderGround Film Festival in Calgary and the European Film Festival Palić in Serbia.\n\t\n\n\tChroma negotiated the deals with The Coven for “Dead by Dawn,” EST Media for “Mash Ville” and The Reel Suspects for “The Black Hole.”\n\n\t“Part of what fuels Chroma’s passion for genre cinema is how powerfully it transcends language. These three international films grabbed us immediately – they’re gripping, entertaining, and wildly inventive in ways that will resonate instantly with genre fans, proving that the best, wildest ideas cross boundaries and cultures,” said Ahbra Perry, VP of Chroma. “A blood-curdling scream sounds the same in any language, and ‘Dead By Dawn,’ ‘The Black Hole,’ and ‘Mash Ville’ push that universality to thrilling extremes. Adding these titles to the Chroma slate reflects exactly the kind of exciting, high-impact global storytelling we’re committed to releasing in 2026.”\n\n\tLaunched in 2025, Chroma operates as a U.S.-based distribution label focused on science fiction and horror content. The company functions under Narrative Distribution, part of the Narrative portfolio of companies, delivering titles across streaming platforms, transactional storefronts, broadcast channels, DVD retailers and airlines.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKarine Jean-Pierre is ready to take the stage.\n\n\tThe former White House press secretary for President Joe Biden is stepping into a new kind of spotlight as the host of this year’s 17th annual African American Film Critics Awards, revealed exclusively to Variety.\n\n\tJean-Pierre, 51, joins an impressive roster of earlier AAFCA emcees, following last year’s Amber Ruffin, the comedian who led the film ceremony, and “American Idol” Season 6 winner Jordin Sparks, who hosted the organization’s 2025 television honors. The ceremony, celebrating achievements in filmmaking, will take place Feb. 8 in Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tHonorees this year include Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson and director Ryan Coogler, alongside animated feature breakout “KPop Demon Hunters.” Winners are selected by more than 100 members of the African American Film Critics Association.\n\n\n\tJean-Pierre is no stranger to making history. She served as the 35th White House press secretary from 2022 to 2025, becoming the first Black person and the first openly LGBTQ individual to hold the role. Hosting the awards marks a notable shift in trajectory for the veteran political adviser, and one she does not take lightly.\n\n\t“I don’t want it to be about me,” Jean-Pierre tells Variety. “I’m playing a tiny part here. My job is to honor, celebrate and lift the brilliant artists who are being recognized.”\n\n\tJean-Pierre has long admired AAFCA’s mission and leadership, making it “an easy yes” to accept the hosting gig. “The AAFCA Awards have spent 17 years celebrating extraordinary contributions in film, and I am just so in awe of Gil Robertson and the team,” she says. “The mission is to honor storytellers who explore the many faces of humanity through diverse perspectives. Why not help lift that up?”\n\t\n\n\tDespite being one of the most recognizable communicators in American politics, Jean-Pierre is adamant that the evening will remain focused on the artists. “One of the things I learned in the press comms world is don’t make yourself the news,” she says. “I want it to be light, enjoyable, smooth and let the stars shine.”\n\n\tWith politics touching nearly every facet of daily life, Jean-Pierre’s post-White House career has differed from her predecessors. One would have expected her to pivot into cable news or become a political pundit, a common next step for former press secretaries. When asked about whether that absence was a conscious choice, Jean-Pierre is direct, describing her career as one that has never been about following a prescribed route.\n\n\t“I’ve always seen myself as someone who does things differently,” she says. “I don’t follow a set path or look at the people before me and copy their trajectory — that’s just never been who I am. I like to do things my own way and ask myself, ‘How can I make an impact? How can I be different?’”\n\n\tAmong those she’s excited to meet are several of the night’s honorees, particularly the cast and filmmakers behind “Sinners,” which she calls “one of the most brilliant pieces of work I’ve seen in a long time.”\n\n\t“I’ve never met Michael B. Jordan,” she says with excitement. “And Ryan Coogler — just touching him would be amazing. He’s so incredibly brilliant.”\n\n\tJean-Pierre, who recently published her memoir “Independent,” says hosting aligns with a broader desire to tell stories beyond the political arena. While she plans to remain engaged in civic discourse after two decades in politics, she views this next chapter as an opportunity to expand her impact through storytelling and mentorship.\n\n\tAfter spending 20 years in politics, Jean-Pierre says her focus is now on lifting up communities she cares about. Most recently, she acquired the rights to the stories of Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne, the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps, and wants Hollywood to tell their stories.  “The women asked presidents questions and were often ignored by the boys’ club, and yet so few people know their names,” Jean-Pierre says with passion. “I recently acquired their books, and I want to help bring their stories to life.”\n\t\n\n\tIn November 2023, while still serving as press secretary, she honored their legacy by dedicating the White House lectern in their names.\n\n\tHer next career chapter, she says, will focus on telling stories that matter — potentially as a producer and writer — while continuing to mentor young people and develop new writing projects.\n\n\t“My career has always been a zigzag,” she says. “I move toward what excites me and what feels meaningful, and that’s how I want to continue doing things: my way.”\n\n\tStill, Jean-Pierre acknowledges that hosting an awards ceremony during a moment of political and cultural turbulence carries added weight.\n\n\t“We need this right now,” she asserts. “We need an opportunity and a space to celebrate ourselves — to be seen in this way, and for little boys and girls in our community to see us in this way.”\n\n\tAs conversations around diversity and inclusion remain fraught, Jean-Pierre views events like the AAFCA Awards as essential.\n\n\t“We cannot let our stories die. We must continue to be bold and tell those stories. There is real value in telling our journeys so that generations to come can see how brilliant we are.”\n\n\tGil Robertson, AAFCA president and co-founder, said he is “elated” to welcome Jean-Pierre into the organization’s family.\n\n\t“She’s current, credible and brilliant,” Robertson says. “She has a background in journalism and has occupied positions at the very center of popular events. We love her energy and her vibe, and it’s what people expect from us — smart hosts who are part of the conversation.”\n\n\tAs Jean-Pierre prepares to take the stage, her approach stays rooted in service, just as it was behind the White House podium.\n\n\t“My message is to continue to hold each other,” she says. “Telling our stories is more important now than it has ever been before.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmanda Seyfried recently told The New Yorker that winning an Oscar is not important to her. She said that she’s “gotten this far” without an Academy Award, so “why would I need one now?”\n\n\t“Do you remember who won in the past ten years? It’s not the win that’s important. It’s the nomination,” Seyfried said. “It does thrust you forward. That’s a fact. Now, do I need one in a week or two or whenever? No, of course, I don’t. Would it be great? Of course it would, for every reason. But it isn’t necessary. Longevity in an actor’s career is designed. Longevity is about deliberate choices to make art among the big commercial things that are fun and pay.”\n\t\n\n\tSeyfried has never won an Oscar, but she scored a best supporting actress nomination in 2021 for her work in “Mank.” Her performance in December’s “The Testament of Ann Lee” earned her a best actress nomination at the Golden Globes and Critics’ Choice, possibly foreshadowing a nomination from the Academy.\n\n\n\tEven if she misses out on an Oscar nod this year, Seyfried said she has “already proven” herself and feels she is making strides toward “getting people to trust me to do hard things.”\n\n\t“We all have ebbs and flows in our careers, and how we’re perceived can change from day to day, but I’m consistent in my choices and I’m consistent in my values and my needs,” she added. “I’m also sitting pretty right now, because ‘The Housemaid’ made money. That’s not always the case. Sometimes you’re in ‘Mamma Mia!’ Sometimes, you do something like ‘Ted 2,’ or ‘A Million Ways to Die in the West,’ which were both supposed to do big box-office, and underperformed.”\n",

According to their mother, in September 2025, one of the boys told his counselor Busfield had touched his penis and bottom.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Busfield also addresses the third accuser -- a then-17-year-old actress he was directing in a stage production -- by saying they have a witness, Matthew Moore, who was also acting at that theater back in 2001.\n      \n    \n          According to the docs, Matthew had a conversation with the accuser's father, who was excited to get his pilot for a TV series into the right hands. Matthew claims the father said, \"They are going to love it because Tim Busfield is going to present it to them, which I'm certain he will do because he will need to if he thinks he's going to f*** my daughter.\"\n      \n    \n          Matthew says he asked the dad why he thought Tim was interested, and he allegedly replied, \"Because she's a total babe.\" In the docs, he says it was clear to him the father was willing to leverage his daughter's looks to advance his own career.\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          Busfield's submitting this to the court ahead of his Tuesday hearing to determine if he will be released on bail pending trial.\n      \n      ",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tFeb 13, 2026 4:30pm PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t‘Goat’ Cast Guide: All the Celebrities and NBA Stars Voicing Animals in the Basketball Movie\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEverett Collection / Getty\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSony Pictures Animation’s “Goat,” opening in theaters Feb. 13, is an original action-comedy set in an all-animal world and centered on the high-stakes sport of roarball — a version of basketball that’s co-ed, full-contact and dominated by the biggest, fastest and fiercest animals on the planet. At the center of the story is Will Harris (voiced by “Stranger Things” star Caleb McLaughlin), a small goat with oversized ambition, whose unlikely rise challenges the long-held belief that smalls don’t ball.\n\n\tThe film’s voice cast brings together voice actors from across film, television, comedy and the basketball world to ground the fantastical universe with personality, humor and emotional stakes. From NBA and WNBA legends to MVP rivals, embattled teammates and larger-than-life mentors, each character brings a distinct presence to the roarball court — and to Will’s underdog journey. \n\n\tMcLaughlin has a “Stranger Things” reunion with David Harbour, who voices a rhinoceros roarball player named Archie. Their fellow cast members include Gabrielle Union, Aaron Pierre, Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll and more. On the sports side, Golden State Warriors champion Stephen Curry and his wife Ayesha Curry join the cast, alongside Union’s husband and Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade, WNBA star Angel Reese, A’ja Wilson and more.\n\n\tHere is a look at the key characters and the voices behind them:\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWill Harris (Caleb McLaughlin)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCaleb McLaughlin voices Will Harris, a teenage Boer goat with dreams of becoming a professional roarball player. Best known for playing Lucas Sinclair on Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” McLaughlin has earned an NAACP Image Award and a SAG Award as part of the show’s ensemble. His recent work includes Peacock’s “Shooting Stars,” Netflix’s “Concrete Cowboy” opposite Idris Elba and the Audible horror series “Sacrilege: Curse of the Mbirwi,” marking a standout turn in voice-driven storytelling.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJett Filmore (Gabrielle Union)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGabrielle Union lends her voice to Jett Filmore, a superstar black panther roarball player known as the “Face of the Thorns” and Will’s idol. Union is an actress, producer and best-selling author whose recent credits include Netflix’s “The Perfect Find,” A24’s “The Inspection” and the Amazon MGM hit “The Idea of You,” which she executive produced. Her filmography also includes “Bring It On,” “Bad Boys II,” “Love & Basketball” and the BET drama series “Being Mary Jane.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLenny Williamson (Stephen Curry)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNBA all-star Stephen Curry voices Lenny Williamson, a giraffe roarball player and member of the Thorns.

Off the court, he runs Unanimous Media, which has produced projects including “Underrated” and “Good Times,” and is the author of the New York Times bestseller “Shot Ready.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tArchie Everhardt (David Harbour)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDavid Harbour voices Archie Everhardt, an imposing rhinoceros enforcer for the Thorns and a devoted single father. Harbour is widely recognized for his Emmy-nominated role as Jim Hopper on Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” His recent work includes Marvel’s “Thunderbolts,” “Gran Turismo,” “Violent Night” and voice roles in DC’s animated series “Creature Commandos,” along with film turns in “Black Widow,” “No Sudden Move” and “Revolutionary Road.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMane Attraction (Aaron Pierre)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAaron Pierre voices Mane Attraction, a dominant Andalusian horse and the league’s reigning MVP — and Will’s chief rival. Pierre recently voiced Mufasa in Disney’s “Mufasa: The Lion King” and earned critical acclaim for Netflix’s “Rebel Ridge,” which won the Emmy for outstanding television movie. His credits also include “The Underground Railroad,” “The Morning Show,” National Geographic’s “Genius: MLK/X” and the upcoming HBO DC series “Lanterns,” in which he stars as John Stewart.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Burke (Nicola Coughlan)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNicola Coughlan voices Olivia Burke, an ostrich roarball player and member of the Thorns.

Kroll is the co-creator and star of Netflix’s “Big Mouth,” as well as the creator of “Kroll Show” and a veteran of FX’s “The League.” He also executive produces FX’s “Adults.” His film credits include “Don’t Worry Darling,” “Get Him to the Greek” and “I Love You, Man,” along with voice roles in “Sing,” “The Addams Family” and “Sausage Party.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCarol (Ayesha Curry) \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAyesha Curry voices the warmhearted llama Carol, who owns Whisker’s diner in Vineland. Carol is one of Will’s biggest supporters on his roarball journey; Will’s mom worked at Whisker’s, and it’s where he worked as a delivery driver. Most recently, Curry has appeared in the films “Irish Wish” and “Joy to the World.” She’s also married to NBA star Stephen Curry. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRosette (Dwyane Wade)  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThree-time NBA champion Dwyane Wade lends his voice to Rosette, a bull roarball player for the Swampland Shadows.

A five-time All-Star and a two-time member of the All-NBA Second Team, Love currently plays for the Utah Jazz. He won an NBA championship in 2016 with the Cleveland Cavaliers. While “GOAT” is Love’s voice acting debut, he’s appeared on screen as himself in “Entourage,” “The Suite Life on Deck” and “The Trainer.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPropp (Angel Reese) \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tChicago Sky star Angel Reese adds an acting credit to her resume in “GOAT,” lending her voice to roarball player Propp, a polar bear on the Shivers and one of the Thorn’s rivals in the league. A two-time WNBA all-star, Reese will also use her acting chops on the forthcoming second season of Netflix’s “The Hunting Wives.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKouyate (A’ja Wilson) \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA’ja Wilson voices Kouyate, an American alligator who plays roarball for the Swampland Shadows. Considered one of the greatest of all time in the WNBA, Wilson is a star player on the Las Vegas Aces, where she’s played since being drafted first overall in 2018. With the team, she’s won MVP four times and helped lead the team to three championship titles. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIggy (Andre Iguodala) \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tZebra roarball referee Iggy is voiced by 19-year NBA veteran Andre Iguodala, who played for the Philadelphia 76ers, the Denver Nuggets, the Golden State Warriors and the Miami Heat over the course of his almost two-decade career. An NBA All-Star and four-time champion with the Warriors, Iguodala also served as a consultant on “GOAT,” helping to create actual plays for the roarball teams. He previously onscreen appearances include a one-episode cameo on “Abbott Elementary” and a guest role as himself on “Silicon Valley.”    \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGrizz (Jelly Roll)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRapper and country singer Jason Bradley DeFord, better known by his stage name Jelly Roll, will voice Grizz, a brutish grizzly bear roarball player.

Hudson’s film debut in “Dreamgirls” won her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, making her the youngest African-American recipient of the award. Hudson also acted in Broadway’s “The Color Purple,” coached on U.K. and U.S. versions of “The Voice,” and launched her own talk show in 2022.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChuck (Andrew Santino) \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAndrew Santino voices roarball commentator Chuck, a musk ox.

    "body": "\n\tA new trio of crime fighters might utter the trademark greeting “Good morning, Charlie” on the big screen once again. Sony Pictures is in early development on a new feature version of “Charlie’s Angels,” the female-fronted 1970s TV crime drama turned big-screen action movie franchise.\n\n\tScreenwriter Pete Chiarelli has been tapped to pen a screenplay for the new project, which is in early development at the studio. Chiarelli is best known for his work on “Crazy Rich Asians,” “Now You See Me 2,” “The Proposal” and Sony Pictures Animation’s latest movie “Goat,” which debuted in theaters on Friday. He is repped by UTA, Mosaic and Yorn Levine.\n\t\n\n\t“Charlie’s Angels,” a crime drama about a trio of women working at the Townsend private detective agency, debuted in 1976 and quickly dominated the pop culture conversation. The series originally cast Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith in the leading roles — and catapulted them into TV history. Cheryl Ladd joined the show in season 2 and starred through the rest of its 115-episode run. John Forsythe voiced their unseen boss, Charlie Townsend, who directed the operation over the telephone.\n\n\n\tAt the turn of the century, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu assumed the iconic roles of the crime-fighting angels and launched the franchise into blockbuster territory. The reboot, 2000’s “Charlie’s Angels,” directed by McG, was a major box office success, grossing $264 million worldwide and spawning the 2003 sequel “Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle.” Barrymore produced the movies under her Flower Films banner.\n\n\tHowever, more recent attempts to relaunch the franchise have been less successful. The 2011 TV reboot — starring Annie Ilonzeh, Minka Kelly, Rachael Taylor as the angels, with Ramon Rodriguez as Bosley and Victor Garber as the voice of Charlie — was canceled after eight of its 13-episode ordered aired on ABC. In 2019, Elizabeth Banks directed a new installment of the movie franchise, starring Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska as the fighting trio. The film tied in elements of both the original TV series and the 2000s movies — including featuring Banks as one in a network of Bosleys — but the project ultimately underperformed at the box office, earning just $73 million globally.\n\t\n\n\tBut as the 50th anniversary of the landmark series approaches, it’s no surprise that Sony is reevaluating its big screen potential. After all, the IP’s cult status remains ubiquitous, and there’s no shortage of brilliant, beautiful actors who’d relish the chance to work for Charlie and kick some ass.\n\n\tThe Hollywood Reporter first reported news of the developing project. Sony had no comment. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\t“WWE SmackDown” is getting a temporary new home on Friday nights thanks to the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\n\t“SmackDown” normally airs on the USA Network, but the channel has switched over to 24/7 Olympic programming until Feb. 22. Most scripted shows on USA Network are on pause during the Olympics, but since “WWE SmackDown” is a weekly live event — held in front of live arena audiences — it has had to find a new temporary broadcast home.\n\t\n\n\tWant to watch “Friday Night SmackDown?” You can now find the show on the Syfy channel for the Feb. 13 and Feb. 20 broadcasts. You can watch “SmackDown” on TV with any cable package that includes the specialty channel in its offerings. The start time for the show remains the same, with an 8 p.m. ET air time.\n\n\t\n\t\tHow to Watch “WWE SmackDown” Live Online on Syfy\t\n\n\tDon’t have cable or want to stream “SmackDown” on Syfy online? You can watch the wrestling show online through DirecTV, which offers 90+ live television channels that you can stream without cable. DirecTV’s channel lineup includes a live Syfy feed, so you can use the streamer to watch “SmackDown” live online. Test drive the service with a five-day free trial here and use it to watch “SmackDown” on Syfy online free.\n\n\tDirecTV lets you watch Syfy and other live TV channels through your computer, tablet, smartphone or smart TV.\n\n\tAnother way to stream “SmackDown” on Syfy is by signing up for Sling. The live streamer’s Sling Blue package costs just $54.99/month for 40+ channels, including Syfy. Use Sling to livestream “WWE SmackDown” online without cable. Sling Blue lets you stream on up to three devices at a time and includes DVR so you can record the broadcast to watch a replay back on-demand later.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow to Watch “WWE SmackDown” on Peacock\t\n\n\tAnother way to watch “WWE SmackDown” online? Every episode of “Friday Night SmackDown” is available to watch on-demand through Peacock, the day after it airs on TV. That means both of the Syfy episodes will be on the NBCUniversal streaming service for you to stream online. \n\n\tIn addition to streaming the Olympics and the recent Super Bowl, Peacock is the official streaming partner for the WWE, and it’s also where you’ll be able to watch live wrestling events like “SummerSlam,” “Wrestlemania,” “Royal Rumble” and others.\n\n\tThe move from USA Network to Syfy won’t affect “SmackDown’s” air dates or schedule. The show still airs at 8 p.m. weekly on Fridays and will remain a three-hour broadcast.\n\n\t“SmackDown” returns to USA as usual beginning with the Feb. 27 episode, which will air one night before the Elimination Chamber Premium Live Event, taking place in Chicago.\n",

    "body": "\n\tStephen Amell has landed a lead role in Fox‘s upcoming “Baywatch” reboot, Variety has learned. \n\n\tThis is the first confirmed casting for the series, which was picked up for the 2026-2027 broadcast season by Fox back in September 2025 with a 12-episode order. Fox is set to host an open casting call for the show on Feb. 18, with production set to begin this spring in Los Angeles. \n\n\tAmell will star as Hobie Buchannon, described as the “wild child we all loved from the original series” who “is now a Baywatch Captain, following in the footsteps of his legendary father, Mitch,” per the official character description. “Hobie’s world is turned upside down when Charlie, the daughter he never knew, shows up on his doorstep, eager to carry on the Buchannon family legacy and become a Baywatch lifeguard alongside her dad.” \n\t\n\n\tThe role keeps Amell in the broadcast world, as he recently led the short-lived “Suits” spinoff “Suits LA” at NBC. He is best known for playing the lead role in the hit CW series “Arrow,” which aired for eight seasons. He also played the role of Oliver Queen, a.k.a Green Arrow, across multiple CW DC superhero shows in that time. His other recent credits include the Starz pro wrestling drama “Heels” and the films “Code 8 Parts 1 & 2.” \n\n\tHe is repped by UTA, Leverage Management, and Sloane Offer. \n\n\t“From the first conversation, Stephen Amell brought exactly what this new chapter of ‘Baywatch’ demands: heart, intensity, and that undeniable hero energy,” said series showrunner Matt Nix. “He’s the kind of lead who can sprint into danger, carry the emotional weight, and still make it feel fun. We’re so excited to get started.” \n\t\n\n\tHobie Buchannon appeared in the original “Baywatch” across multiple seasons, where he was played first by Brandon Call and later by Jeremy Jackson. The series originally debuted in 1989 on NBC. It aired for one season on that network before moving into syndication for the remainder of its 11-season run, during which it aired nearly 250 episodes. It was renamed “Baywatch: Hawaii” for its final two seasons as production moved to the island state from California. A reunion TV movie aired on Fox in 2003.\n\n\tAt its peak, “Baywatch” was the most-watched show in the world, airing in over 200 countries. The ensemble cast included David Hasselhoff as head lifeguard Mitch Buchannon and helped launch the acting careers of stars like Pamela Anderson, Jason Momoa, Yasmine Bleeth, and Carmen Electra. The show also spawned the short-lived spinoff, “Baywatch Nights,” and was rebooted as a feature film starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Zac Efron in 2017.\n\n\tNix is an executive producer on the reboot along with McG, Michael Berk, Greg Bonann, Doug Schwartz, Dante Di Loreto and Mike Horowitz. McG will also direct the series premiere episode. The series is co-produced by Fox Entertainment and Fremantle. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMattel, Inc, in agreement with its joint venture partner NetEase, has announced it will acquire full ownership of the Mattel163 mobile games studio. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of Q1. \n\n\tFounded in 2018, Mattel163, a global game studio, has developed games based on iconic Mattel brands including Uno!, Uno Wonder, Phase 10 and Skip Bo. The game developer has over 550 million downloads worldwide and approximately 20 million monthly active users. \n\t\n\n\tThe transaction values Mattel163 at $318 million, with a purchase price of $159 million for NetEase’s 50% interest. More than half of the purchase cost is expected to be funded from Mattel’s share of the JV’s cash, which is not consolidated on Mattel’s balance sheet. \n\n\n\t“Our vision is to extend physical play to the virtual world by creating digital experiences and games based on Mattel IP that drive sustained engagement for fans of all ages. Acquiring full control of Mattel163 does exactly that,” Mattel chairman and CEO Ynon Krei said. “It will play an important role in our digital strategy and significantly enhance our capabilities in self-publishing. The Mattel163 team has done remarkably well building this business from the ground up and we look forward to welcoming them on board. Our portfolio of iconic brands lends itself perfectly to the digital world and the acquisition will strengthen our position and accelerate our presence in a large, high-growth market.”\n\n\tThe acquisition comes as Mattel focuses on capturing the full value of its IP across entertainment verticals. Mattel163’s capabilities will allow Mattel to increase its mobile games output, enhancing alignment with the broader Mattel product roadmap.\n\t\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\tPARTNERSHIPS\t\n\n\tSEGA is expanding its real-world footprint with a new strategic partnership that places the iconic gaming publisher at the center of L.A. LIVE, downtown Los Angeles’ massive sports and entertainment district.\n\n\tUnder the agreement, SEGA becomes an official partner of L.A. LIVE, securing a campus-wide presence across the 4-million-square-foot complex that hosts everything from NBA games and esports-adjacent events to major awards shows, concerts and film premieres. The deal goes beyond traditional sponsorship, positioning SEGA within the flow of high-profile live events that draw global audiences year-round.\n\n\tThe partnership includes prominent placement across L.A. LIVE’s district-wide digital out-of-home network, featuring 11 large-format LED displays spread across high-traffic areas such as Peacock Place, key pedestrian corridors and major entry points near Crypto.com Arena, the Los Angeles Convention Center and the JW Marriott. SEGA will also extend its visibility through freeway-facing digital signage surrounding the campus.\n\n\tIn addition to media placement, the agreement opens the door for immersive, on-site activations, including experiential installations at Peacock Place, the district’s 40,000-square-foot open-air plaza. SEGA will also be integrated into L.A. LIVE’s website and social media channels, tying the brand directly to ongoing event promotion throughout the year.\n\n\tSEGA of America EVP of Publishing Ryan Okum said the partnership reflects the growing overlap between gaming, sports and live entertainment, allowing SEGA’s franchises to appear in spaces where large, highly engaged audiences already gather.\n\n\tThe deal was brokered by AEG Global Partnerships and aligns with SEGA’s broader push into experiential marketing and transmedia expansion, as the publisher continues to grow its presence beyond traditional game launches through film, television and live experiences tied to franchises such as “Sonic the Hedgehog,” “Like a Dragon,” “Persona” and “Total War.”\n\n\tFor gaming fans in Los Angeles — and visitors passing through one of the country’s busiest entertainment hubs — SEGA is about to become much harder to miss.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEVENTS\t\n\n\tPlayStation’s State of Play event brought with it a number of major announcements Thursday, including reveals of a “John Wick” video game, a new “God of War” game and a “Legacy of Kain” reboot.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for Emerald Fennell‘s “Wuthering Heights,” in theaters now.\n\n\tEmerald Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” has just been released in theaters, but there have already been weeks of discourse surrounding her adaptation (or “reinterpretation”) of Emily Brontë’s groundbreaking novel.\n\n\tActually, make that years — social media has been buzzing ever since the film’s stars, Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, were revealed in September 2024.\n\t\n\n\tFennell — no stranger to provocation, having directed “Saltburn” and “Promising Young Woman” — has made it clear from the start that this would not be a by-the-book adaptation of Brontë’s 1847 original. “Everyone who loves this book has such a personal connection to it, and so you can only kind of ever make the movie that you sort of imagined yourself when you read it,” Fennell said at the L.A. premiere of “Wuthering Heights.”\n\n\n\t“It’s such a gargantuan masterpiece, I couldn’t possibly attempt even to touch its coattails,” she told Variety. “What I could do, though, was look at how it made me feel, and hope that that would connect with some people. That’s all you can ever do — because Emily Brontë’s the best — so, I hope to make somebody’s favorite movie.”\n\n\tThough the premise of Fennell’s film is the same as the book — following the tortured romance between Cathy, a childish and impulsive girl who marries into the wealthy Linton family, and Heathcliff, the brooding boy her father took in off the street and she grew up with at Wuthering Heights — the director takes many liberties throughout, starting with the casting itself and through to the movie’s ending. This has sparked many a debate among literature lovers and scholars alike, including on the topic of Heathcliff’s race (which has been discussed for nearly 200 years to little consensus) and just how horny Fennell’s R-rated adaptation is (the same can’t really be said of the book). The movie has also divided critics, with some miffed by its stark departures from the original text, while others — like Variety‘s Peter Debruge — praise Fennell’s “bold and engaging” take.\n\t\n\n\tTo settle the score, we read Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights” so you don’t have to — though I really would recommend it — and came up with five of the biggest differences in Fennell’s screen adaptation. Read on below.\n\t\n\t\tCasting contrasts\t\n\n\tThe casting of Elordi has been questioned from the start, as a long-debated aspect of the book is Heathcliff’s race. The character of Heathcliff is first described as a “dark-skinned gypsy” with black hair and eyes, but is also referred to at other times as a “lascar” (a sailor of Indian or Southeast Asian descent) or perhaps an American or Spanish castaway. Some scholars suspect that his race was deliberately kept vague and note that, at the time, even those from other European countries like Italy or Spain would have been discriminated against by Brits. It should also be noted that the descriptions given in the book are from different characters who may have their own prejudices, leaving the reader without hard facts. Either way, Heathcliff is immediately othered for the way he looks. Therefore, many felt that Elordi — who is of Australian and Basque descent — did not fit the bill. Indeed, in Fennell’s movie, Heathcliff’s race is not explicitly stated, and his otherness seems to center more around class, with emphasis placed on the fact that he was found on the streets of Liverpool and isn’t able to read or write.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJacob Elordi as Heathcliff in “Wuthering Heights.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBook purists also shared concern about casting the 35-year-old Robbie as Cathy, since in the book, the character is only 15 when she accepts Edgar Linton’s marriage proposal and 18 when she dies. In the film, Fennell introduces younger versions of Cathy and Heathcliff (played by Charlotte Mellington and Owen Cooper), then ages the characters up. According to Robbie, Cathy is intended to be in her early to mid-20s once she appears on camera, and the plot spans approximately six years from there. Cathy’s relative agedness is hinted at throughout the film, with her maid Nelly (Hong Chau) mentioning at one point that she is “well past spinsterhood” and should therefore marry Edgar, underscoring the societal pressures of the era. However, Robbie’s performance keeps Cathy’s childish nature intact with many obsessive outbursts.\n\n\tThere were also several changes made to the Linton family. Edgar, Cathy’s betrothed, is described in the book as having “light hair and fair skin,” but in the film he’s played by Shazad Latif, who is of Pakistani, English and Scottish descent. And Isabella Linton — who in Brontë’s text is Edgar’s sister — is instead introduced in the film (played by Alison Oliver) as his “ward,” which in the Victorian era denoted an orphaned minor who has been placed under the protection of a guardian.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMargot Robbie as Cathy in “Wuthering Heights.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSeveral original characters are missing\t\n\n\tIn the book, Cathy’s father, Mr. Earnshaw — who brought Heathcliff into their home and always had a soft spot for him — dies, leaving Wuthering Heights to be managed by his eldest son, Hindley, who hates Heathcliff. However, in Fennell’s film, Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes) is alive and Hindley is nonexistent, though Mr. Earnshaw takes on some of Hindley’s qualities — mainly his dislike for Heathcliff and penchant for alcohol. Midway through the film, Mr. Earnshaw dies, which is one of the catalysts for Cathy and Heathcliff’s affair. Cathy’s mother is also dead in the film, whereas in the book she is briefly present; and the same for both of Edgar’s parents.\n\n\tFennell’s film also does away with the book’s first narrator, Mr. Lockwood, and though Nelly serves a key role, she does not tell the story of Heathcliff and Cathy as she does in the book. Instead, the film is presented without a primary perspective, though Cathy seems to be at the heart of the plot.\n\t\n\t\tThe film focuses on the first half of the book\t\n\n\tFennell’s movie centers solely on the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff, meaning that only the first half of the around 300-page book — through Chapter 16 — is included. The second part, as readers know, tells of Heathcliff’s behavior after Cathy’s death and how he continues to torture her daughter and his son (whom Isabella Linton births shortly after fleeing Wuthering Heights), who eventually marry. Since Heathcliff seems to lose all redeeming qualities after Cathy’s death, turning into a truly miserable and vengeful man, book devotees likely have a far less romantic vision of him than what is presented in the film.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMargot Robbie and Jacob Elordi in “Wuthering Heights.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe movie is much steamier\t\n\n\tAs with “Saltburn,” Fennell delivers another sexually provocative film with her adaptation of “Wuthering Heights.” Even in the trailer, scenes of slapping dough, Robbie and Elordi kissing in the rain and Elordi licking a wall were telltale signs that this would be a heightened version of the actual romance depicted in the book. In fact, there is no explicit mention of sex in Brontë’s novel, which isn’t too surprising, as to write about such things would have been incredibly taboo at the time. The book’s eroticism mostly comes from the words exchanged between Cathy and Heathcliff, many of which do make it into Fennell’s film.\n\t\n\n\tOne of the more charged moments of the book comes when Heathcliff visits Cathy just before her death, and the two share a passionate embrace, though Nelly is in the room the entire time. As Brontë’s text reads: “She put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly — ‘You teach me now how cruel you’ve been — cruel and false. Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself … I have not broken your heart — you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine.” This is about as saucy as the book gets, whereas in Fennell’s film, there are plenty of sex scenes, secret meetings to hook up and feverish kisses in the rain.\n\t\n\t\tThe ending\t\n\n\tSince Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” only takes us halfway through the novel, the ending is entirely different. In the book, Cathy dies shortly after giving birth to her and Edgar’s daughter — also named Cathy — though she had been ill for months following her fallout with Heathcliff. The story then continues with Cathy’s daughter at the forefront. In Fennell’s film, Cathy still gets pregnant and dies of her illness, but the baby does not survive. In one of the final shots of the movie, Cathy’s death — and that of her child — is apparent when a pool of blood begins to gather below her waist, dripping down onto the floor in a quite disturbing fashion.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the first three episodes of “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette,” now streaming on FX and Hulu. \n\n\tBorn in Sun Valley, Idaho, Dree Hemingway spent most of the ’90s living between her home state and her mother’s film sets. Her memories of the decade consist of piles of Old Navy clothing, long, unbrushed hair, sitting outside in the backyard with her family and listening to the Beatles.\n\t\n\n\t“That time period, the ‘90s, everything about it is so iconic to me,” says Hemingway in an interview earlier this week. Now 38, she’s made her first major television appearance, co-starring in Ryan Murphy’s “Love Story” anthology series, set in the decade that Hemingway considers to be “kind of perfect.”\n\n\n\tChronicling the romance of John F. Kennedy Jr. (Paul Anthony Kelly) and Carolyn Bessette (Sarah Pidgeon), “Love Story” spotlights the couple’s whirlwind courtship and ultimate tragic demise. While the focus remains on the central couple, both characters have relationship side-plots of their own, Bessette with a doorman turned Calvin Klein model (Noah Fearnley) and Kennedy with movie star Daryl Hannah, played by Hemingway.\n\n\tKennedy and Hannah had a highly publicized, on-again, off-again relationship for more than five years, until they split for good in 1994, shortly before he began dating Bessette, his future wife. Hemingway makes it clear that “Love Story” is not supposed to be a biography, but rather an imaginative interpretation of what happened behind closed doors in the lives of what was, at the time, America’s most famous family. And her version of Daryl is a tribute to an actress she considers an “icon.”\n\t\n\n\tHemingway is no stranger to show business. Her mother, Mariel Hemingway, began acting at 14, receiving a Golden Globe nomination for her breakout role in “Lipstick,” (1976), and then an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen’s 1979 film, “Manhattan.” (While Mariel Hemingway and Hannah never acted together, the two are connected through the “First Daughter” TV movie franchise, in which Hannah replaced Hemingway in the 2000 sequel, “First Target,” due to scheduling conflicts.) There’s also the most famous Hemingway — Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winning writer, Ernest — whose life is the subject of Dree Hemingway’s upcoming project, “The Hemingway Files,” where she is set to executive produce her great-grandfather’s story.\n\n\tBefore entering the entertainment industry, Hemingway spent several years working as a model, walking in runway shows for prominent fashion houses such as Gucci, Valentino and Chanel, among others. She made her film debut in 2011 with Sean Baker’s “Starlet,” going on to appear predominantly in independent films, including “While We’re Young” and “It Happened in L.A.”\n\n\tHer “Love Story” character is a somewhat meta role for Hemingway, playing a beautiful, blonde actress who sees those close to her heavily monitored and criticized in the media. Here, Hemingway speaks with Variety about John and Daryl’s relationship, how she transformed into the beloved actress —and paying respect to their real lives.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul Anthony Kelly as John F. Kennedy Jr. and Dree Hemingway as Daryl Hannah.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Eric Liebowitz/FX.\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you first hear about the show? What drew you to it?\t\n\n\tI read that Ryan Murphy was signing on to do a Carolyn Bessette and JFK Jr. project. And I was like, “That is something I want in on.” That time period, the ’90s, everything about it is so iconic to me. What was the process of auditioning for the role of Daryl like?Once I got the audition for Daryl, the process was, “How do I transform into being her in a matter of four days before having to turn this audition in?” I have an incredible dialect coach who I share with Alessandro Nivola [Calvin Klein], who is a genius and very helpful. Her voice is a lot lower, she’s a little bit more whisper-y, and she comes from Chicago. I was watching interviews, studying her mannerisms and how she held herself and how she spoke. Then they said, “You got it,” and I was like, “Hey, now we’re gonna really deep dive into this.”\n\n\tDaryl Hannah was a huge movie star in the ’80s and ’90s. Did you watch any of her movies growing up?I have so many memories of Daryl Hannah. It’s also funny, because growing up, people would stop my mother in the airport and say, “Daryl!” So there’s that intertwining. “Splash” is so iconic, and “Steel Magnolias” and “Wall Street” to name a few. “Summer Lovers!” She’s an icon.\n\n\tWas there any hesitation or intimidation on your part to step into the role of someone so well-known? I wouldn’t say I was intimidated — I just really know how sensitive is to play somebody who is so famous and still alive. It was more so wanting to show what made me love her the most, which is how much heart she has, and how kind she is as a person.Have you heard anything from the real Daryl? Have you reached out to her?I sent a note [saying] how much I loved her, and what an honor it was to play her, but I haven’t heard from her, which is totally, totally fine and I have no expectations from that. I just hope that if at some point she wants to watch, she’s happy. This whole project was made with so much love, and it is a love story that isn’t supposed to be factual. [That’s] just a very hard point that we all want to come across, is that this is based on real people, and it’s dramatized because we don’t know exactly what happened behind closed doors. There’s an air of anticipation building up to Daryl’s first appearance at the end of Episode 1. Jackie Kennedy is making it very obvious that she doesn’t approve of Daryl, and John has multiple conversations about her throughout the episode. How do you think viewers are going to react to her re-appearance in John’s life and her overall character?You have the whole moment of, “Oh, John and Carolyn have fallen for each other,” and then it’s like, “Oh shit.” Daryl has shown up, and it’s an interjection of [John and Carolyn’s] love story, in a sense. But I guess you have to end a relationship to get into the other relationship.\n\t\n\n\tJohn and Daryl have a pretty tumultuous romance in the show. Did you consult anyone about their dynamic or draw from any real-life examples? Even though I’m playing Daryl, I’m playing a character. A lot of it is imagination, so for me, it was really important to show how much I think they did really love each other, but I just think [she] wasn’t the one. I can only draw from heartbreak in my own life and having relationships that didn’t work out or really loving somebody, and that feeling of wanting to connect.\n\n\tIn the second episode, arguably Daryl’s most prominent episode, there’s a lot of tension between her and John. There’s some friction at his PBS shoot, and later, there’s this big fight at home. How do you think she reads John’s behavior through all of this?I think there’s a [sense of] wanting more. As women, we’re not dumb, I think that we know when there’s a disconnect. [She] wants to feel out what’s going on, without actually saying “What exactly is going on?” — until she finally does. At the end of a relationship, there’s a lot of turmoil, there’s push and pull, and you have so much history together that there’s resentments that are built up in a relationship.\n\n\tAt one point during the argument, Daryl tells John his “mind has been someplace else.” Do you think she was able to sense his attachment to Carolyn?  I don’t know if she sensed that there was something else going on; I think she just felt like he was disconnecting from her. I wanted to play Daryl’s character that way, where it was is like, “Where have you gone? What’s going on?” There was such a divide with his family not liking her, and maybe that was the reason that he was pulling away from her? Maybe John was thinking, “Oh, I’ve met this person. Oh, fuck, I’ve met the person.” And then my character is more like, “Why doesn’t your family like me?” and thinking that’s the reason he is pulling away from her and not settling down.\n\n\tThere’s this incredibly awkward family dinner that takes place in that episode, and Daryl is convinced that John’s family doesn’t like her. It was very much wanting to go in like, “How do I please everybody here? If I’m just quiet and I’m wearing the right clothes, will you accept me? The devastation when Jackie doesn’t show up is just not feeling good enough. [That reference to Marilyn Monroe] was written in terms of I’m another “blonde threat” kind of thing. She’s really trying to figure out why they don’t like her, and why can’t she be accepted.\n\n\tDid you wish that you got to have more happy scenes for Daryl and John, opposed to just scenes of them fighting or not getting along? I would love to have happy scenes! But with [the fighting] you can see the turmoil that John has with wanting to be the good guy with Daryl, his mom, his family, and Carolyn. Would I like to have had these scenes? Sure, but I think it’s perfect as is. Ultimately, this is [John and Carolyn’s] story and and we know that this is gonna happen.\n\n\tShe leaves and goes back to California, and then her dog Hank dies running onto the streets of New York! Was that the nail in the coffin for their relationship? I think she loved Hank. One of the things I really love about the real Daryl Hannah is her love of animals, and I think Hank was her first child. For the character, it was more so “How could this happen?” If you loved me, you wouldn’t let this happen.\n\n\tDaryl’s last appearance on the show is in Episode 3, at Jackie’s wake. She joins John when he addresses the public from the balcony and tries to take his hand. Was that her looking to to get back together? I think it was one last try. Are you gonna let me in? Can I be here for you?\n\n\tWe know what happened to the real Daryl Hannah after her breakup with JFK Jr. But for your character, what do you hope for her off-screen life?I only hope that she finds somebody who just loves her as much as she loves them. I’m not taking away from John loving her, but I just want her to find her love story.\n\n\tYou also come from a pretty well-known family. Did you relate to the story at all in the aspects of being in the public eye a lot?The only way I can relate is that people make up their own versions of things. We’re all really normal at the end of the day, we all have our own insecurities. We all have our own things that aren’t the smiling glamor shots and we’re all human. It’s such a sensitive thing, because Daryl is very much a character, but [also] I’m playing a real person. It’s very fine line, how do I play this person and this character with heart?\n\n\tYou’ve emphasized a couple of times that it’s a fictional retelling, based off real events. How do you feel about criticism of the show being based on real people? We don’t know what happened behind closed doors. We don’t know — besides everything that everybody else has seen in pictures and books. Their lives have been very highly researched, and there’s the delicate balance of being very respectful to these real people.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivalry” star Hudson Williams got an early start on his birthday festivities Thursday night, celebrating at Gold House’s inaugural Lunar New Year party in New York City. \n\n\tWilliams, a co-host of the lavish event at Chinese Tuxedo, hit the dance floor with “The Summer I Turned Pretty” star Lola Tung, the pair twirling each other around before jumping and belting out ABBA’s “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight).” The once-fairly tame space instantly transformed into a full-fledged dance club as a crowd gathered the moment Williams and Tung stepped into the center.\n\t\n\n\tWilliams kept the energy high on the dance floor, moving to a catchy mix of upbeat tracks, including Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own” and t.A.T.u.’s “All the Things She Said.” Throughout the evening, guests flocked to Williams — who brought his mother as his plus-one — as he moved around the venue, waiting to take selfies and chat with the actor.\n\n\n\tAt the stroke of midnight, Williams welcomed his 25th birthday by blowing out a single candle atop a platter of cream puffs. \n\n\n\tBeyond the dance floor, guests played games of mahjong, sang karaoke and feasted on spring rolls, roast duck and other delicacies while sipping Hennessy cocktails inspired by the Year of the Fire Horse.\n\n\tTung and Williams’ dance moves weren’t the only “Heated Rivalry”–“The Summer I Turned Pretty” crossover of the night. Later on, Tung headed downstairs to the karaoke space to sing “Complicated” by Avril Lavigne with Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova, who plays Svetlana on the hit hockey romance series, and “Mean Girls” actor Avantika. \n\t\n\n\tTung also reunited with her “The Summer I Turned Pretty” co-stars Sean Kaufman and Minnie Mills at the Lunar New Year party. While a movie was announced in September of last year, Kaufman remained mum about any details related to the upcoming project, including when they’ll be filming.\n\n\t“No comment. I don’t even know, actually,” Kaufman told Variety with a laugh. “So I can lie and give you a date right now — but it’d be a lie.” \n\n\tOther notable attendees included co-hosts Bowen Yang, Yerin Ha, Prabal Gurung, Eva Chen, Daniel Martin, Liam Oh, Melissa King, Bach Mai and Kim Shui, as well as Anna Cathcart, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Padma Lakshmi, Isa Briones, Alexander Wang, Phillip Lim, Suni Lee, Supriya Ganesh, Jade Bender, Zsine Tseng and Gold House founder Bing Chen. \n\n\tWhen asked what she’s most looking forward to regarding where Asian representation is headed in Hollywood, Ha — the leading lady of “Bridgerton” Season 4 — said, “I’m just excited to hopefully get to a point where we don’t have to say that it’s ‘representation,’ and that it just is. We exist in the world, we don’t have to explain ourselves, and it would just be nice to be part of films because they want us rather than feeling like we’re representing something.” \n\n\tSee photos from Gold House’s Lunar New Year party below. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBing Chen, JJ Jimenez, Gloria Zhu, Bach Mai, Melissa King, Prabal Gurung, Liam Oh, Hudson Williams, Yerin Ha, Kim Shui, Bowen Yang, Eva Chen and Daniel Martin attend Gold House’s Lunar New Year Gold Celebration at Chinese Tuxedo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Gold House\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBowen Yang and Hudson Williams attend Gold House’s Lunar New Year Gold Celebration at Chinese Tuxedo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Gold House\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha, Hudson Williams, Prabal Gurung and Bing Chen at Gold House’s Lunar New Year Gold Celebration in New York City.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Gold House\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHudson Williams poses for a photo at Gold House’s Lunar New Year Gold Celebration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Gold House\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLola Tung and Hudson Williams dance together at Gold House’s Lunar New Year Celebration at Chinese Tuxedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Hennessy\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLola Tung and Hudson Williams on the dance floor at Gold House’s Lunar New Year Celebration at Chinese Tuxedo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Hennessy\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSean Kaufman and Lola Tung attend Gold House’s Lunar New Year Gold Celebration at Chinese Tuxedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Gold House\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKsenia Daniela Kharlamova plays mahjong at Gold House’s Lunar New Year Gold Celebration at Chinese Tuxedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Gold House\n\t\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe lore of why Emerald Fennell decided to adapt “Wuthering Heights” for the big screen is almost as well-worn as the copy of Emily Brontë’s 1847 no",
    "body": "\n\tThe lore of why Emerald Fennell decided to adapt “Wuthering Heights” for the big screen is almost as well-worn as the copy of Emily Brontë’s 1847 novel that the Oscar-winning filmmaker has read a hundred times. Fennell discovered the classic tome when she was a teenager — 14 years old to be exact — and became engrossed with its lead characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, and their toxic love story.\n\n\t“Like anyone who’s obsessed with ‘Wuthering Heights,’ I’m a fanatic. I just adore it,” Fennell told Variety at the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles. “The moment I read it, it just broke me open.”\n\t\n\n\tDecades later, as she started to think about her next film following a pair of provocative pictures, 2023’s “Saltburn” and 2020’s “Promising Young Woman,” an idea sparked. “I wanted to make something that made people feel, that made people physically respond,” Fennell explained. “I just went back to that book, and I was like, ‘This is it.’”\n\n\n\tAs Fennell began drafting her version, one visual immediately sprang to mind — one quite similar to the first shot she envisioned for “Saltburn,” where she imagined someone slurping the leftover bathwater of the object of their romantic desire.\n\n\t“I probably can’t spoil it, but something happens on a rock,” Fennell teased. “I think people will know.”\n\n\tBut, with the film now playing in theaters, it’s safe to say the steamy scene she’s referring to depicts Cathy’s (Margot Robbie) sexual awakening, as she masturbates under her skirts after she and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi) accidentally witness someone else’s steamy coupling. There are more overtly sexy moments in Fennell’s movie — the physical intimacy is ratcheted up significantly from the book — but this scene underlines the Brontë’s themes of desire and repression — and the friction between them — that imprinted on the filmmaker as a teen. \n\t\n\n\tThat said, the prospect of adapting Brontë’s classic was still intimidating. After all, the story is so endlessly compelling that people are still discussing and dissecting it 200 years later.\n\n\t“It’s such a gargantuan masterpiece, I couldn’t possibly attempt even to touch its coattails,” Fennell said. “What I could do, though, was look at how it made me feel, and hope that that would connect with some people. That’s all you can ever do, because Emily Brontë’s the best. So, I hope to make somebody’s favorite movie.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDirector Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren film a scene from “Wuthering Heights” with Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTo translate the stormy romance into a bodice-ripping piece of cinema, you need actors whose chemistry crackles, and Fennell didn’t have to look any further than her past collaborators, Robbie and Elordi, to heat up the famously chilly Yorkshire Moors.\n\n\tFennell wrote “Wuthering Heights” (stylized in quotation marks) with Elordi in mind. She’d been inspired by the sideburns he’d sported for “Saltburn,” which reminded her of the Heathcliff pictured on her old copy of Brontë’s book.\n\n\t“Emerald loves this work with her soul. This book pumps through her,” Elordi said about working with Fennell. His only reservations about stepping into the iconic role, previously portrayed by the likes of Laurence Olivier, Ralph Fiennes and Tom Hardy, were, “Can I do it justice? And can I bring something of my own biography into it?”\n\n\tSigning on for the part also helped Elordi cross an item off his bucket list: to work with Robbie, his fellow Aussie. “She’s always been on my list of the greats, so I expected her to be excellent. And she was,” Elordi said. “As a human being and as an artist, she’s the true package.”\n\n\tRobbie and Fennell had been circling one another for years — Robbie’s Luckychap production company backed both “Promising Young Woman” and “Saltburn,” plus Fennell played a small role in “Barbie” — but they hadn’t yet collaborated as actor and director. Luckychap was producing “Wuthering Heights” too, so after reading Fennell’s screenplay, Robbie pitched herself to play Cathy.\n\n\t“I would follow her anywhere,” Robbie said of Fennell. “I think working with directors who you would follow anywhere is the best thing that you can do. Find those people that you really believe in, and then just follow them.”\n\t\n\n\tJosey McNamara, Robbie’s partner at Luckychap, concurred: “With anything that Emerald does, it’s always the emotional roller coaster of how you experience the movie. Hopefully, we’ll have people who laugh, who cry, who are turned on. You run the gamut of emotions.”\n\n\tIndeed, Fennell intended to tap into something sensual and melodramatic with her take on “Wuthering Heights.” And with a fourth season of “Bridgerton” underway and the hot hockey romance “Heated Rivalry” dominating the streaming charts, it’s evident that yearning is so back. What is it about this particular brand of romance that keeps audiences coming back for more?\n\n\t“It’s all the stuff that we’re still contending with today,” Alison Oliver said about the trend toward longing. (Oliver plays Isabella, a young maiden who finds herself embroiled in Cathy and Heathcliff’s destructive relationship.) “I just love Emerald’s vision and the things that she’s interested in investigating. And the way that Emily Brontë explores that is just extraordinary; it really touches on something. There’s a reason why people keep going back to the classics like it again and again. There’s something in it that helps us understand ourselves better.”\n\n\t“Wuthering Heights,” which also stars Hong Chau, Shazad Latif, Martin Clues, Charlotte Mellington and Owen Cooper, with music by Charli xcx, is now playing in theaters. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmerald Fennell directs Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi on the set of “Wuthering Heights.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the high-concept world of Sony Picture Animation’s, “Goat,” what happens off the court is just as important as the game played on it. \n\n\tIn this case, that game is roarball, a co-ed, enormously intense version of basketball that Will Harris (Caleb McLaughlin), a Boer goat with big dreams, is desperate to play professionally — despite his small stature. And much like the fictional sport’s real-world counterpart, in this all-animal cinematic universe, roarball is the ultimate culture-definer. \n\t\n\n\tAcross the world’s six biomes, Roar league players are bona fide icons, selling out arenas and ducking the paparazzi. Will comes of age idolizing Vineland Thorns’ star Jett Fillmore (Gabrielle Union), a black panther; Whisker’s Diner, where he works, is ornamented from top to bottom with Jett memorabilia, as is Will’s room, where a poster of the roarball legend is taped to the ceiling. Like their real-life NBA counterparts, off-the-clock the four-legged players don upscale athleisure with glitzy stacks of chains and have their own exclusive sneaker models. \n\n\n\tAs basketball sits at the intersection of music, art, technology and fashion, “Goat,” produced by four-time NBA champ Stephen Curry, pulls from an abundance of source material to create an animated world that mirrors the very real ways the sport has come to occupy an unshakable spot in pop culture today. And while “Space Jam” or “Zootopia” might be easy initial comparisons to make, no animated film has immersed viewers into the world of basketball more fully than “Goat” does.   \n\t\n\n\t“We wanted to create this multidimensional film that touches culture on many points,” said Tyree Dillihay, who directed “Goat” alongside Adam Rosette. “Yes, we get the on-court action. But it’s good to understand what the real lifestyle is off the court.” \n\n\tInspired by Chris Tougas’ illustrated children’s book “Funky Dunks,” “Goat” follows Will’s journey from a roarball super-fan to a professional player when owner Flo Everson (Jenifer Lewis), a warthog with perfectly manicured hooves, signs him to the underperforming Thorns. But before that, Will works as a delivery goat to pay rent, using whatever spare time he has to shoot hoops at the local streetball court. \n\n\tIt’s a classic underdog story, and one that reflects the experience of trying to make it big as an athlete. Basketball specifically proved to be the perfect sport to illustrate this journey, because unlike football, it’s a “global game,” said Union, and one with few initial barriers to entry. “As long as you have a ball and a hoop, or a ball and a bucket, you can play,” she explained.\n\n\tHow’d Flo hear about Will? Thanks to a mega-viral video of Will taking on Mane Attraction (Aaron Pierre), an Andalusian horse and a rival roarball player on the Lava Court Magmas, in impromptu pick-up game. \n\n\tIt’s one of many nods the film makes to the evolving role social media plays in the sport. At one point, the Thorns’ Coach Dennis (Patton Oswalt), a proboscis monkey, jokes to Will that they have to limit ostrich Olivia Burke’s (Nicola Coughlan) screentime, who often finds herself scrolling to see what the critics are saying about her. In another moment, long-time rivals Jett and Mane exchange jabs against one another over a livestream as thousands of roarball fans tune in and cheer them on in the comments. \n\n\tEstablished as the bad boy of roarball, Mane also drops the diss track “Goat Tears,” aimed at none other than Will, in which he raps bars like “I’m the Godfather, call me Pony Soprano.” While the track isn’t confirmed to have been inspired by any real-life clash in particular, basketball fans will be quick to recall several iconic hip-hop head-to-heads that cemented the diss track as a storied tradition between rivals.\n\t\n\n\t“Who didn’t hear Damian Lillard go off? If he wasn’t a basketball player, he’d be a rap star,” said Union. “I remember when Shaq had a rap album.” \n\n\n\tThe only thing more captivating than Mane’s humorous lyrics is his streetwear look. Donning a mesh tank to show off his muscles, Rick Owens-inspired shorts and red bottom sneakers, along with a hefty amount of bling, plus a gold tooth, his ensemble, along with the rest of the character’s looks, is one directly influenced by the off-duty outfits of real NBA stars.  \n\n\tA longtime fan of the game, costume designer Dominique Dawson used her arsenal of fashion knowledge and streetwear culture to inform the story. When she first signed on to dress the animated cast, she dove especially deep into the streetball subculture.\n\n\t“The athletes that just love to show up and they’re not getting paid,” Dawson explained. “What does that fashion look like? Because they have so much more freedom to wear whatever they want and express themselves.” \n\n\tBefore Will goes pro, his oversized grey hoodie, layered t-shirt and baggy basketball shorts are reminiscent of the silhouettes of real-life ball players who need their clothes to transition seamlessly from on the court to off. “When he was at work, he could go right after work to practice and hit the court,” said Dawson. “His focus is basketball.” \n\n\tOf course, the film also shines a light on the more high-fashion elements of the game, specifically spotlighting the now notoriously high-profile tunnel walk. This pregame tradition has transformed into a showcase for NBA players’ fabulously luxurious, often designer, looks. Jett, who is typically outfitted in a catsuit — no pun intended — swaps her sporty look for a glistening gold halter top and a pair of empire waist trousers while arriving at a particularly important game. “[It] was so fun to be able to get all these people dressed to the nines,” said Dawson. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tArchie (David Harbour), Olivia (Nicola Coughlan), Jett (Gabrielle Union, Lenny (Stephen Curry), Will (Caleb McLaughlin) and Modo (Nick Kroll) in “Goat.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sony Pictures Animation\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“My husband [Dwyane Wade, three-time NBA champion] was early into the fashion. He took a lot of hits, especially for that unfortunate jumpsuit,” added Union, referencing a plunging look Wade wore for an Esquire photoshoot. “But he was leading in that way. And now you see the tunnel walk, and it’s a runway. That’s what this game does, and it’s always mirroring what’s happening in culture.”  \n\t\n\n\tAnd it wouldn’t be a basketball movie without sneakers, which were a “natural” fit for the world of roarball, said Dillihay. “I’ve been a part of the sneaker community for a long time,” he continued. “Sneakers are an extension of basketball culture. You’ve got on-court sneakers, you’ve got off-court sneakers. It’s just a part of the lifestyle.” \n\n\tIndeed, sneakers play a central role in “Goat”. \n\n\tBefore making the big leagues and desperate for cash, Will resells his vibrant Fillmore 4’s (Jett’s signature shoe), while an original pair of the shoes are on display in the Vineland diner. Throughout, players exclusively sport the style in a variety of neon colors, brought to life by production designer Jang Lee, who adapted existing UnderArmour models in the design. (Sneaker heads might recognize the sneaker store owner — pun intended this time — Sneaky; Joe La Puma, the host of Complex’s “Sneaker Shopping,” voices the vulture.) \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWill Harris (Caleb McLaughlin) and Jett (Gabrielle Union) in “Goat.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPart of what makes the world of “Goat” so immersive is its attention to detail. To create authentic plays, the film’s team consulted with real basketball players, including 19-year NBA veteran Andre Iguodala, who also voices a zebra working as a referee.\n\n\t“One of my favorite pieces is just how real the actual basketball motions and the animation are,” said Curry, who also voices Thorns player Lenny Williamson, a giraffe. “You just see how fluid the motion is.” \n\n\tCurry isn’t the only player who lent his voice to a character. Wade joins as a bull who plays roarball for the Shadows, as does Kevin Love as a gorilla and A’ja Wilson as an alligator. Angel Reese voices a polar bear who plays for the Shivers. \n\n\t“They submitted to the process and what they brought was just a level of authenticity that you’re going to get from NBA professional athletes and WNBA professional athletes,” said Dillihay. “We asked them for trash talk in the moment — a lot of those are ad-libs from their own lips. They came with their own energy, their own intensity.” \n\n\tAnd while Union herself might not be a pro, Jett being one of the most iconic in the league and a woman is another nod to basketball’s shifting culture. “I go to [WNBA team] Chicago Sky games and there’s a line of kids and it’s boys and girls. They want to be Angel Reese,” said Union. “So that line in the movie, ‘I want to be like her,’ that Will says when he’s a kid, that just resonates so much.”  \n\t\n\n\tAs she puts it: “Ball is life, as they say!” \n\n\tJazz Tangcay and Angelique Jackson contributed to this story.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBad Bunny has released a video trailer for his forthcoming appearance at Super Bowl LX, and the message is so clear it’s stated at the end: “The world” — all different ages, races and styles — “will dance” to his performance.\n\n\tThe message is one of unity, but it’s clear that the world is coming to him. In the clip, we see Bad Bunny walking through a tropical forest — probably his home, Puerto Rico — and he cues up a song on his iPhone (via Super Bowl Halftime sponsor Apple Music), “Baille Inovidable” (“unforgettable dance”), from his most recent album, the multiple-Grammy-nominated “Debí tirar más fotos.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tHe is immediately joined by a series of dancers of all different ages and cultures — old, young, male, female, Latino, Black, Asian, white, and in a seemingly pointed message, a young man in a football jersey and backward baseball cap, and later another white man in jeans, a white tee and a Stetson doing a full-on cowboy dance — toward the end of the clip, Bad Bunny even dips that man.\n\n\n\tThe point is clear: Despite the conservative backlash to him headlining such a symbolic arena for white America, despite the Trump Administration’s threat to have ICE in force at the Super Bowl (as if their usual targets will be there), everyone is welcome at the party.\n\n\tIt is also apparently the only concert he will play on U.S. soil this year. Bad Bunny explicitly avoided the United States on his 2026 tour amid concerns about ICE’s treatment of Latinos.\n\n\t“There was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert],” he said. “And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”\n\t\n\n\tHis message could not be more obvious: You’re all welcome, but I’m not changing a thing.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJenna Bush Hager and Sheinelle Jones must fill an hour of live TV every weekday, so it’s a good thing they have a lot to talk about.\n\n\tIn the opening week of the duo’s debut in the fourth hour of NBC’s “Today,” Jones and Hager have discussed everything from family tragedy to keeping weight off, all with Oprah Winfrey, Sarah Jessica Parker, Marcello Hernandez and even their predecessors on the show, Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb, stopping by to visit.\n\t\n\n\t“We want people to leave a little more joyful than they came,” says Bush Hager, during an interview less than an hour after the duo’s first official telecast together. She has been with “Today” since 2009 and with the 10 a.m. hour as a dedicated host since 2019. For the past year, she worked with a series of guest anchors as NBC News worked to determine who might succeed Kotb on screen.\n\n\n\tFinding on-screen chemistry is never guaranteed, but Jones and Bush Hager aren’t strangers to one another. The two forged stronger ties during a past Olympics, when most of the morning-show crew went to cover the event and they stayed behind —  “just in case anything went down” back at home, says Bush Hager. During that time, the pair spent three hours each day “just hanging out for two weeks.”\n\n\tNBC is betting that Jones’ warmth and Bush Hager’s spirit will make for a formidable combination in TV’s never-ending battle for daytime audience.  The 10 a.m. hour represents NBC’s bid to compete for live viewership in the late mornings, and to carve out some of the ground also tilled by ABC’s syndicated “Live,” with spouses Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, or CBS’ “Drew Barrymore.” The network has long called upon the hosts of “Today” at 10 a.m. to be looser than their colleagues in the show’s earlier hours. And they may need to be. In this era of digital media, there’s a wider field of rivals to consider, with everything from Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” podcast to any number of TikTok personalities dispensing advice and inspiration.\n\t\n\n\tThis first week has served as a way for the hour’s audience to get to know Jones better. She often does a rapid-fire hand tap on the desk to signal excitement, and viewers learned her story of graduating from Northwestern University, interning at KWCH in Wichita, Kansas and working at Philadelphia’s WTXF. Producers invited one of the host’s early inspirations, Kassandra Fleming, spurring much surprise and a few tears.\n\n\t“I was trying to keep my composure,” Jones acknowledged. “I was blown away.”\n\n\tThere may be other times to get emotional — and that, the co-hosts said, is OK. Jones says she is still grappling with the recent death of her husband, Uche Ojeh, who passed in 2025 after months spent battling glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.\n\n\t“In some ways, I’m living it in real time as viewers watch it,” says Jones. “I’m not on the other side of it, if you will. I don’t know if you’re ever on the other side. I’m processing it and I’m still pretty close to it.” But she hopes the audience will follow along as he makes her way. “My hope is they see that I can hold one thing that’s pretty painful but still wake up every day and look for new challenges.”\n\n\tWorking with Bush Hager will give Jones the chance to let the audience see a different side of her. The fourth hour of “Today,” says Bush Hager, “is slightly different than a straight news program. There’s a lot of space for personality and a lot of space for drama and hope.” No doubt, viewers will see more as the two work their way through more shows.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s time to go back to zombie-infested Britain with “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” the sequel to last summer’s post-apocalyptic hit.\n\n\t“The Bone Temple” has made $2.1 million in previews at the box office. It’s projected to make $20 million to $22 million in the extra-long Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. In comparison, the first “28 Years Later,” which reinvigorated the Sony horror series, made $5.8 million in previews over the traditional three-day weekend last June. That film debuted to $30 million and ended its run with a solid $70 million in North America and $150 million globally against a $60 million budget. The “Bone Temple” sequel has a slightly higher price tag of $63 million.\n\t\n\n\tDirector Nia DaCosta takes the reins from Danny Boyle, who helmed last year’s film and the original 2003 horror “28 Days Later.” She directs the series’ first direct sequel from writer and creator Alex Garland’s script, which takes place after the events of “28 Years Later” and follows Ralph Fiennes’ deranged doctor Ian Kelson and Jack O’Connell’s cult leader Jimmy Crystal. Alfie Williams, the young breakout of the first films also returns, and the sequel introduces Erin Kellyman, Emma Laird and original star Cillian Murphy back into the zombie outbreak.\n\n\n\tThe “28 Years Later” zombies will battle the Na’vi of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” for first place at the box office, as James Cameron’s epic threequel aims to take in $18 million to $19 million in its fifth weekend. Cameron’s previous entries, the original 2009 “Avatar” and its 2022 sequel “The Way of Water,” both held strong at No. 1 for seven weeks and soared to more than $2 billion each at the box office.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Pitt” is tackling erectile dysfunction.\n\n\tIn Season 2’s second episode of the hit HBO Max medical drama series, a patient (played by Christopher T. Wood) is admitted to the ER for a case of priapism, or a prolonged erection lasting more than four hours, after he has injected himself with double the recommended dosage of a liquid ED medication. (Injectables are prescribed when oral meds, like Viagra or Cialis, are ineffective.)\n\t\n\n\tHe tells Dr. Langdon (Patrick Ball) that he did it because he wanted to be prepared to celebrate his 20th wedding anniversary. Dr. King (Taylor Dearden) and Dr. Santos (Isa Briones) are seen administrating a paracentesis, a procedure to drain blood from the penis, on a very realistic prosthetic.\n\n\n\t“I’m in that scene,” said Sepideh Moafi, whose character attending physician Dr. Al-Hashimi observes the procedure, at the Season 2 premiere earlier this month in Los Angeles. “I remember that scene very well. I have nightmares about that scene. I saw [the prosthetic] in the hair and makeup trailer and I was like, ‘Who’s having fun between shots?’ I was like, ‘What is happening?’ And then I quickly realized what is it was.”\n\n\tProducers filmed the scene on a closed set. “Every day I thank my lucky stars I was not in that,” said Supriya Ganesh, who plays Dr. Samira Mohan. “I don’t think I could have kept a straight face.”\n\n\t“The Pitt” Season 2 is 15 episodes and takes place over July 4 weekend. “There are some more terrible stories eventually we’ll get to,” said “The Pitt” creator and showrunner R. Scott Gemmill. “Some of them are pretty nasty.”\n\t\n\n\tThe show picked up two Golden Globes on Sunday for best television series – drama and best male actor in a TV drama for Noah Wyle.\n\n\t“The Pitt” has been renewed for Season 3. Wyle doesn’t think it will feature a holiday.\n\n\t“Probably not,” he said. “Although we might not push it so far into the future this time — 10 months was a long jump. I don’t think we need to make that long of a jump next time.”\n\n\tIt was also announced Thursday that “The Pitt” that the Season 2 premiere attracted 5.4 million viewers over the its first days of release, marking a 200% increase from the series premiere in 2025.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the new film “Sirāt,” opening Feb. 6, a father is on a quest. Luis’ daughter has gone missing at a rave in Morocco; Luis (Sergi López), accompanied by his young son, Esteban (Bruno Núñez Arjona), has traveled from afar to find her. Anyone familiar with the origin of the film’s title — an Arabic word referring to the vanishingly thin path between heaven and hell — can predict that not everything goes according to plan.\n\n\tMuch has been written about the on-screen mothers of the past year in cinema: From “Die My Love” to “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” to “Hamnet,” several movies have made great actresses suffer violently to convey big and carefully thought-through ideas about the challenges of intimately loving a being you carried to term. Luis represents another perspective on parenthood: As his search continues and he encounters horrifying obstacles, Luis feels increasingly lost in every sense. The characters played by Jennifer Lawrence, Rose Byrne and Jessie Buckley in the above films feel violently close to their children. Motherhood is central to their identities. By contrast, Luis, as time passes, becomes alienated from his sense of himself as a father.\n\t\n\n\tThis places him within an interesting circle of fellow dads. The fathers of 2025 movies tended toward the uncertain, the flailing and the lost. In “One Battle After Another,” Leonardo DiCaprio’s character is continually hit with waves of shame at his ineptitude after he fails to keep his daughter safe. (He didn’t, he weeps, even know how to comb her hair — what kind of father was he?) In “No Other Choice,” Lee Byung-hun plays a man who goes to increasingly lethal and desperate measures to provide for his kids; he sees no other way, as it were, to keep them housed and fed. “Sentimental Value” casts Stellan Skarsgård as a writer-director father who attempts to use his art, late in life, to forge a connection with his children that his words and deeds cannot. And in “Marty Supreme,” Timothée Chalamet plays a young New Yorker who, aware on the fringes of his consciousness that he’s about to become a father, races around the city and the world to keep himself focused on anything else. To face up to his responsibilities seems unbearably daunting.\n\t\n\n\tMotherhood and fatherhood both come with fairly heady cultural expectations. And while this year’s bad moms break out of what’s proscribed for them with shattering, ferocious brio, the bad dads — such as they are — suffer in a more muted way. Just about the only element of “Sirāt,” which was widely mentioned across the Oscar-nominations shortlists, that’s gone under-discussed is López’s performance. What makes the movie work is Luis, in still moments, turning over in his mind all the failures that brought him to this point. López allows us to see this painful process of recrimination.\n\n\tCrucially, we don’t know what, exactly, his mistakes were, just as we don’t see the time Bob Ferguson spent raising his daughter in “One Battle After Another” and we only allusively learn of Gustav Borg’s crummy parenting in “Sentimental Value.” We know that Luis has a daughter who left home and went missing, and we see that his need to find her isn’t just about the urgent desire to make sure she’s safe; it’s a chance for his own redemption. He believes himself to be unfit. Locating his daughter might disprove that.\n\n\tThere’s one more key difference between the motherhood and fatherhood movies of the past year. All three big movies about moms in crisis have the home at their center, and venture beyond it only briefly (and, in the case of “Hamnet”’s final scene, powerfully). The dads of 2025, whether they’re navigating the contemporary job market, the film industry or the aftermath of a rave, are all out there in the wider world. All of them, too, seem to take from their experiences the lesson that it is next to impossible to keep your children safe — but in the attempt, you might discover you’re capable of more than you believed possible.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJioStar, the Indian media giant formed from the merger of Disney’s Star India and Reliance’s Viacom18, posted quarterly revenues of INR8,010 crore ($883 million) with healthy EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) of INR1,303 crore ($144 million) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2025, as streaming platform JioHotstar achieved its highest-ever engagement for entertainment content.\n\n\tThe standout performance came from India’s historic ICC Women’s World Cup Cricket victory, which drew 99 million digital viewers for the final match — matching the scale of an Indian Premier League game and signaling a watershed moment for women’s sports viewership in the country. The platform averaged 450 million monthly active users during the quarter, on par with the IPL-heavy first quarter.\n\t\n\n\t“JioStar properties delivered unmatched monetization and consumption across digital and linear TV, cementing our position as the definitive home of live sports in India,” the company stated in its earnings release.\n\n\n\tThe platform’s television network reached over 830 million viewers during the quarter, delivering more than 60 billion hours of watch time. JioStar’s TV entertainment viewership share climbed to 34.6%, up 100 basis points year-over-year, approaching the combined share of the next three biggest networks.\n\n\tJioHotstar’s entertainment slate delivered breakthrough engagement, led by “Bigg Boss” across multiple languages, along with hit movies including “Lokah” and “Mirai.” The platform also launched “Mahabharat: Ek Dharmayudh,” its first AI-led series, which saw “exceptionally strong traction and robust multi-language adoption.”\n\t\n\n\tDigital sports consumption scaled new heights, especially for cricket, with average watch time per Men’s ODI and T20 match increasing 55% year-over-year. India’s cricket tour of Australia reached 122 million viewers on linear TV and 142 million on JioHotstar, while South Africa’s tour of India became 2025’s biggest bilateral series with 166 million linear viewers and 187 million digital viewers.\n\n\tThe platform introduced new product innovations including multi-view functionality and interactive features like “Meme the Moment,” aimed at deepening user engagement during live sports.\n\n\tJioHotstar continued to earn strong industry recognition, with “Special Ops Season 2” and “Criminal Justice: A Family Matter” featuring among IMDb’s Top 10 Indian series of 2025. The platform gained multiple wins at Screenxx Awards 2025 and Promax Asia 2025, along with international nominations at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards.\n\n\tIn Hindi-speaking markets, the Colors network dominated the non-fiction genre with the top three shows: “Laughter Chefs 3,” “Bigg Boss S19,” and “Pati Patni Aur Panga.” Regional general entertainment channels maintained leadership positions across their respective markets.\n\n\tSubscriptions grew during the quarter, driven by higher acquisitions and stable retention rates, supported by the platform’s “stacked content calendar across sports and entertainment properties.”\n\n\tOn the theatrical front, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” distributed by Jio Star Studios, emerged as India’s biggest Hollywood release of 2025, with the country ranking as the seventh-highest-grossing market globally for the film.\n\n\tFor the nine-month period, JioStar reported revenues of $2.9 billion with EBITDA of $447 million, as the company continued to consolidate its position as India’s leading media and entertainment platform.\n",

Exclusive footage from the film is set to be showcased to buyers at this year’s European Film Market in Berlin.\n\n\tWritten by emerging screenwriter Thomas Bilotta, “Legacy” — described as a “visceral, character-driven horror” — stars Lucy Hale (“Fantasy Island,” “Truth or Dare”), Oscar-winner Anjelica Huston (“The Witches,” “The Addams Family”), and Jack Whitehall (“Jungle Cruise,” “Fresh Meat”).\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Chris Abernathy and Eric B. Fleischman through The Wonder Company, the film wrapped production in the U.K. in November. Executive producers include Hale, Amanda Massetti, Jo Henriquez, Jan McAdoo, Stephen Braun, Ross Putman, James Harris, Mark Lane, and Bishal Dutta, with Jess Varley and Bri Hennessey serving as co-executive producers. UTA Independent Film Group represents domestic rights, with HanWay handling international sales.\n\n\n\t“Legacy” follows Americans Leah (Hale) and Nate (Whitehall), estranged siblings reunited after the death of their long-absent father, who bequeaths them his English country estate. Determined to leave their troubled past behind, they agree to sell the property. But when a mysterious woman named Ruth (Huston) arrives, their plans unravel over the next terrifying twenty-four hours as they are besieged by an ominous cult — and hunted by someone, or something, lurking beneath.\n\n\t“It’s great to see David Slade back in the saddle to deliver another strong horror film with a great cast,” said Gabrielle Stewart, CEO of HanWay Films.\n\t\n\n\tOther upcoming films in post-production include: visual artist and photographer Alex Prager’s debut feature “Dreamquil” starring John C Reilly and Elizabeth Banks; “Billion Dollar Spy,” produced by Walden Media and directed by Amma Assante, starring Russell Crowe and Harry Lawtey; Werner Herzog’s new feature “Bucking Fastard,” starring Kate and Rooney Mara, Orlando Bloom and Domhnall Gleeson; and David Michael’s feature debut horror “The Third Parent” starring Rob Lowe and Crispin Glover.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEskil Vogt, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of “The Worst Person in the World” and current awards season darling “Sentimental Value,” has signed with CAA. \n\n\tVogt — also an award-winning director himself — has been a longtime collaborator of fellow Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier since meeting as camera assistants on local TV. \n\n\tOver the last two decades, Vogt has co-written all six of Trier’s films, including “Reprise,” “Oslo, August 31st,” which screen in the Un Certain Regard competition in Cannes in 2011, “Louder Than Bombs,” which competed for the Palme d’Or in 2015, and “Thelma,” Norway’s official submission to the Oscars in 2017. \n\t\n\n\t“The Worst Person in the World,” which premiered in competition in Cannes in 2021, became a critical smash hit, earning Oscar nominations for best original screenplay and best international feature, winning the best international film at the BIFAs and landing Vogt a European Film Award nomination for best screenwriter. \n\n\n\tVogt’s latest film with Trier, “Sentimental Value,” already looks set to exceed this. After winning the Grand Prix in Cannes last year, the film — about the fractured relationship between a famed director and his estranged daughters and starring Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Elle Fanning — has become a major awards contender. It received eight Golden Globes nominations — including best motion picture – drama and best screenplay — and seven Critics Choice Awards nominations, including best picture and best original screenplay. It currently leads the 2026 European Film Awards with eight nominations and earned eight slots on the BAFTA longlists (and last year in the U.K. won best international film at the BIFAs). Many Oscar pundits are predicting that  “Sentimental Value” will have significant involvement when Academy unveils its nominations on Jan. 22. \n\t\n\n\tAs a director, Vogt’s second feature, “The Innocents” premiered in the Un Certain Regard competition at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, won best direction at Fantastic Fest in Austin, and received four Norwegian Amanda Awards, including best director. His debut feature “Blind” premiered at Sundance, where he won the world cinema screenwriting award, and later received the Europa Cinemas label at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\tVogt continues to be represented in the U.K. by Elinor Burns at Casarotto Ramsay & Associates Limited.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTed Sarandos keeps insisting that Netflix has come to make money from Warner Bros.’ theatrical movie business — not to bury it.\n\n\tSarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, reiterated in an interview with the New York Times published Friday the company’s stance that should it close the megadeal with Warner Bros. Discovery to buy WB’s studios and streaming businesses, it will continue to release the studio’s films theatrically. And, specifically, he said that Netflix would keep a 45-day window for theatrical runs of Warner Bros. movies.\n\t\n\n\t“When this deal closes, we will own a theatrical distribution engine that is phenomenal and produces billions of dollars of theatrical revenue that we don’t want to put at risk. We will run that business largely like it is today, with 45-day windows,” Sarandos said. “I’m giving you a hard number. If we’re going to be in the theatrical business, and we are, we’re competitive people — we want to win. I want to win opening weekend. I want to win box office.”\n\n\n\tSarandos said “a lot of assumptions” that Netflix execs had about Warner Bros.’ business turned out to be false, including that “The general economics of the theatrical business were more positive than we had seen and we had modeled for ourselves. It’s a healthy, profitable business for them.”\n\n\tNetflix’s proposed $83 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. TV and film studios, along with HBO Max, has generated a fierce industry backlash, given Netflix’s general antipathy toward releasing its movies in theaters. Theater trade group Cinema United, for one, warned Congress last week that the sale of Warner Bros. will result in fewer movies, job losses and theater closures.\n\t\n\n\tAbout the backlash, Sarandos said he wasn’t surprised. “I think it was a lot of loud voices, but not necessarily a lot of them,” he said. “I think a lot of it was folks who questioned, rightfully so, our intent with theatrical because we hadn’t said anything about it. A lot of it was the emotions around that more than anything else.”\n\n\tNetflix’s deal with WBD isn’t officially done: David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is waging a hostile takeover bid and has said it will initiate a proxy war to install directors on WBD’s board amenable to its offer. Speaking about Hollywood’s negative reaction to the proposed Netflix acquisition, Sarandos said, “What people would like to see is no deal. But that’s not possible. There are two outcomes of this deal, and we have a signed deal done.”\n\n\tAs he has said previously, Sarandos maintained that Netflix isn’t anti-theater per se. “We weren’t in that business not because we hated it. We weren’t in that business because our [streaming] business was doing so well,” he said.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Netflix has seen upside from special event releases of its originals in movie theaters, with Sarandos calling out the New Year’s Eve run of the “Stranger Things 5” finale and its limited runs of “KPop Demon Hunters.”\n\n\t“You give people a reason to leave the house, they will gladly leave the house,” he told the Times.\n\n\tBut the perception that Netflix doesn’t think theatrical is a great business was reinforced by Sarandos’ comments last year that moviegoing was “outmoded.” At the Time100 Summit in April 2025, Sarandos called the communal moviegoing experience “an outmoded idea,” noting, “If you’re fortunate to live enough in Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.”\n\n\tIn the Times interview, Sarandos tried to clarify what he meant. “You have to listen to that quote again. I said ‘outmoded for some.’ I mean, like the town that ‘Sinners’ is supposed to be set in does not have a movie theater there. For those folks, it’s certainly outmoded. You’re not going to get in the car and go to the next town to go see a movie. But my daughter lives in Manhattan. She could walk to six multiplexes, and she’s in the theaters twice a week. Not outmoded for her at all.”\n\t\n\n\tAs part of Netflix’s plan to maintain Warner Bros.’ studio operations independently, the company has previously said it will continue to release Warner Bros. movies in theaters. However, Sarandos didn’t quell concerns about the deal when he told analysts that eventually release windows will shrink to be “much more consumer-friendly.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, on Thursday, Netflix announced a renewed multiyear movie output deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment — which is now worldwide (after previously covering the U.S. and some other countries). The new pact is worth more than $7 billion over a multiyear span, sources told Variety.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChinese auteur Jia Zhangke has joined as executive producer on “Filipinana,” the Sundance-bound debut feature from Filipino filmmaker Rafael Manuel, ahead of its world premiere at the festival.\n\n\tMagnify, the global sales arm of Magnolia Pictures, is handling international sales. The veteran Chinese helmer’s company, Unknown Pleasures Pictures, has also acquired distribution rights for mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.\n\n\n\tManuel’s feature marks an expansion of his 2020 Berlinale Silver Bear-winning short of the same name. The film follows Isabel, a new tee-girl at an elite Manila golf course and country club, as she navigates the hierarchies of her position while assisting club owner Dr. Palanca. As she uncovers darker truths beneath the club’s polished facade, Isabel discovers her attraction to Dr. Palanca stems from a disturbing shared past.\n\t\n\n\t“I had the pleasure to know Rafael due to the Rolex Mentor & Protégé Arts Initiative. During the two years’ program, we spent time together in Beijing, exchanging ideas and discussing film. Our conversation always revolved around ‘Filipinana,'” Jia said. “I have witnessed Rafael’s passion and creativity for this film from the beginning, and in Manila, I also experienced its preparation and filming. We will soon see this film in cinemas, and we are going to hear a new voice of Asian cinema from the Philippines.”\n\n\tThe production features a cast of newcomers including Jorrybell Agoto, Carmen Castellanos, Teroy Guzman, Carlitos Siguion-Reyna, Isabel Sicat and Nour Houshmand. Xenia Patricia (“100 Nights of Hero”) serves as cinematographer.\n\t\n\n\t“This film has taken some time to make as we’ve been quite patient and intentioned with seeking the right collaborators,” Manuel said. “It’s truly humbling to be able to count director Jia, a filmmaker who I respect deeply as an artist and as a person, as one of them.”\n\n\tFilm4 developed and co-financed the project. Producers are Jeremy Chua and Sam Chua Weishi of Potocol (“Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell”), Bradley Liew and Bianca Balbuena of Epicmedia Productions (“Viet and Nam”), BAFTA-winning producer Alex Polunin of Ossian International (“Lady”), Nadia Turincev and Omar El Kadi of Easy Riders, and Manuel through his banner Idle Eye.\n\n\tIn addition to director Jia Zhangke, other executive producers include Farhana Bhula of Film4, Jossette C. Atayde and Maria Sophia Atayde-Marudo of Nathan Studios, Anthony C. Isais and Grace Mariel M. Isais of Happy Infinite Productions, Sebastian Raeuber and Francine Raeuber.\n\n\tManuel, who splits his time between London, Amsterdam and Manila, has earned recognition on the festival circuit. His short “Filipinana” took the Silver Bear Jury Prize at the 70th Berlinale and earned a nomination for best British short at the 2020 British Independent Film Awards.\n\n\tAustin Kennedy negotiated the deal on behalf of Magnify, with Casper Liang Jiayan representing Unknown Pleasures Pictures. Kennedy, director of global sales, and Phoebe Liebling, manager of global sales, will launch international sales for “Filipinana” at Sundance.\n\n\tUnknown Pleasures Pictures has released Paola Cortellesi’s Italian film “There’s Still Tomorrow” and Charlie Chaplin’s classic “Gold Rush” in China. The upcoming slate includes Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” Kleber Mendonca Filho “The Secret Agent,” Fukada Koji’s “Love on Trial,” Miyake Sho’s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” and Andrea Segre’s “The Great Ambition.”\n\n\tMagnify represents a catalog of more than 100 titles. The company rebranded from Magnolia Pictures International in 2023 to focus on earlier-stage investments in bold filmmaking. Recent titles include “Erupcja,” “Barrio Triste,” “OBEX,” “The Delinquents,” “Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point” and “Happyend.”\n\n\tMagnify’s upcoming slate includes Ulrike Ottinger’s “The Blood Countess,” starring Isabelle Huppert, which will world premiere at next month’s Berlin Film Festival.\n",

It was very ... it just took a lot out of me in terms of, you know, my ability to continue to play.\"\n      \n    \n          Brady added, \"I had 23 years of [football], so I didn’t feel like I was missing anything, retiring. I felt like, okay, this time I always had a goal -- 45. I was 45 years old, I wanted to spend time with my kids, I felt like, okay, now it’s time for me to be at all my kids' games. They’ve been to enough of their dad’s games.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Brady and Bündchen were married for 13 years and had two children together before the Brazilian supermodel filed for divorce in Florida in 2022.\n      \n    \n          At the time, Gisele indicated the marriage was \"irretrievably broken.\"\n      \n    \n          Both have moved on since ...

    "body": "\n\tA funny thing happened on the way to Turin, as the constellation of international guests gathered by the Torino Film Festival to represent world cinema arrived united in its reverence for the local industry above all. \n\n\t“For me, it all began with Italian cinema,” said Daniel Brühl as he accepted the festival’s Stella della Mole career achievement award at the Torino opening ceremony. “My father was a director, and when I got my first VHS player at 15, he gave me a list of a hundred films I had to watch — around 70% of them Italian. Those classics by Lizzani, Fellini, Pasolini and De Sica were the spark. That’s what made me want to become a film actor.”\n\t\n\n\tFellow honoree Claude Lelouch echoed the sentiment. “I owe a great deal to Italian cinema,” said the “A Man and a Woman” director, who won his Palme d’Or from a jury chaired by Sophia Loren. “And when I was very young, after seeing ‘The Bicycle Thief,’ I said to myself, ‘That’s what I want to do for a living.’ So in a way, it all started here.” \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Bruhl and Giulio Base\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIndeed, over the course of a glitzy opening gala, guests like Dolph Lundgren, Jacqueline Bisset, Alexander Sokurov and Hanna Schygulla all paid tribute to Italy’s formidable filmmaking legacy — while the evening’s sole Italian honoree turned to the industry’s more contemporary challenges.\n\n\t“Italian cinema is in serious crisis,” said actor and filmmaker Sergio Castellitto, who recently turned heads in “Conclave.” “Beyond the controversies we all know about, even among those not directly involved, my invitation is simple: we have to move past divisions and conflicts. The issue isn’t funding this filmmaker or that — it’s about saving the industry itself.”\n\t\n\n\tThe filmmaker offered a quick diagnosis: “There’s a widespread lack of skills, experience, professionalism, and talent, which in some cases threatens the entire system. The real effort must be to preserve the industry. Quality and merit remain essential, of course — but first, we have to make sure we survive.” \n\n\tTorino artistic director Giulio Base shared Castellitto’s concerns, calling Italy’s film heritage “a source of honor, and a little frustration, because it’s difficult to stand up at the same level.” \n\n\t“But we’re especially proud that directors worldwide — not just those here tonight — turn to Italian cinema for inspiration,” he added. “Knowing our films continue to teach and influence fills us with pride.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Revolutionaries Never Die” was the winner of the top award at this year’s Cairo Film Connection, the industry program of the Cairo Film Festival. Variety interviewed the Palestinian director Mohanad Yaqubi, who won the best project in post-production prize.\n\n\t“Revolutionaries Never Die,” which is produced by Yaqubi’s company Idioms Film, is his third archive-based film. It explores the work of Lebanese filmmaker Jocelyne Saab during her first decade of filmmaking, from 1973 to 1983.\n\t\n\n\tYakubi grew up in Kuwait, Amman, Egypt, Libya, Gaza and the West Bank, and then studied a master’s degree in film at London’s Goldsmiths College, before returning to the West Bank, and eight years ago he settled in Ghent, Belgium, where he is a resident researcher at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KASK).\n\n\n\tFor this project he is working with researcher Mathilde Rouxel, who was Saab’s assistant during the last decade of her life.\n\n\tHow did this project come about?I obtained access to 115 reels directed by Jocelyne Saab between 1973 and 1983. The decisive turning point was when my family’s house was bombed in Gaza – in April 2024. There is a scene in Jocelyne Saab’s 1982 film “Beirut My City,” where she is standing in front of her bombed house and talking about the circumstances and her feelings and the meaning of that house for her. I completely identified with her, even though I never had the chance to be in front of my own destroyed house. That’s the moment where everything she made between 1973 and 1983 suddenly made sense for me – like, this is the price you pay as a politically engaged filmmaker trying to support the Palestinian struggle. It becomes magical once you place Jocelyne’s images on the timeline and her voice starts to lead us. It’s as if she’s making the film and I’m the instrument making this happen.\n\t\n\n\tDo you think films can change political realities?I’ve actually stopped believing in the power of the image and filmmaking, as I have watched the genocide unfold, seeing the entire destruction – live, 24 hours a day. It’s not about the amount of images or telling people what’s going on. It’s ultimately a question of geopolitical power.\n\n\tDid you ever meet Jocelyne Saab?No. We had an exchange by email. She sent me one email that I didn’t reply to, and she passed away five weeks later, in 2019.\n\n\tWhy do you think her films from this period are interesting?She’s not only looking at the Palestinian question. Her films offer the hope for change. They are about the Arab left. She made films in Western Sahara, Egypt, Iran and also in Lebanon. In 1973 her films were about romantically politicized revolutionaries. But her outlook began to change because of the civil war in Lebanon and her sense of disbelief, as she saw how the country she believed in and loved was destroyed.\n\n\tAre there any parallels with what she filmed in this period and today’s situation?One big characteristic of the Arab mentality is that things are repeated all the time. What I’m trying to do is to step back and show that the aggression never stops and try to identify some of the underlying problems. This is really why I’m fascinated by archives because if we look at other films made in Gaza in the 1970s, it looks like nothing has changed. But in the 1960s and 1970s there were political ideas, related to left-wing parties, and trying to make a coherent understanding of the situation. Now it’s just blunt violence.\n\n\tWho is your film for?I’m interested, above all, in speaking with Palestinians. People who don’t have sovereignty, don’t have archives and don’t have production of a knowledge system. There is no organized education system. Films become a way to create this kind of dialogue. Right now, the main priority isn’t about creating images. It’s about creating a genuine dialogue.\n\n\tWhy has it been important to show your project in the Cairo Film Connection?I think it’s the first market where I am showing this film. I wanted to have an Arab base for this and Cairo was the best option. I’ve been visiting Cairo over the last two years because my parents are living there, since they left Gaza. There are still people to discuss the project with and present the film in a wider perspective, for an Arab audience.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian entertainment platform PTC Punjabi has partnered with Australian production company Temple to co-present three Punjabi-language feature films under the Australia-India Audiovisual Co-Production Treaty, marking one of the largest regional-language collaborations to utilize the bilateral agreement.\n\n\tThe alliance positions Australia as a strategic launch platform for Punjabi cinema’s global expansion, with the films set to roll out across India, Australia and New Zealand over the next 18 months.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the treaty framework, the productions will access Australian federal and state film incentives, including grants and rebates, while utilizing local crews, talent, locations and post-production facilities. Temple will handle Australian co-production requirements, including treaty compliance and studio partnerships, while PTC Punjabi manages Indian creative development, production and distribution.\n\n\n\tThe partnership brings together three independent producers from PTC Punjabi’s roster, each investing in and overseeing creative development alongside Temple. Australian theatrical distributor Forum will handle ANZ territory releases.\n\n\tThe collaboration comes as Indian-language films, including Punjabi titles, have surpassed Australian productions at the local box office, according to recent industry data. The shift has drawn increased attention from Indian producers viewing Australia as both a production base and international distribution gateway.\n\n\t“Punjabi cinema is ready for its global leap, and Australia gives us the perfect runway. With Temple this partnership is not just about making films – it’s about making history. Punjabi stories deserve the world, and together with Australia, we’re going to take them there with confidence, scale and pride,” said Rajiee M. Shinde, CEO of PTC Entertainment Channels.\n\t\n\n\tAnupam Sharma, founder of Temple, added: “The Australia–India Co-Production Treaty is a game-changer. Australia will be the engine that takes Punjabi cinema global – with world-class crews, studios, incentives and distribution access. PTC Punjabi has been the guardian of Punjabi culture for decades, and together we will now take Punjabi stories to the world.”\n\n\tThe partnership represents a significant investment into Australia’s screen sector, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, from India. PTC Network operates PTC Punjabi as a leading Punjabi-language entertainment platform globally.\n\n\tThe pact was unveiled at the WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKendrick Lamar and “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone aren’t ready to unveil their mysterious live-action comedy just yet. Paramount has removed the trio’s untitled feature from its March 20 release date, delaying the theatrical release indefinitely as the project continues to be tinkered.\n\n\t“It’s true – we’re moving (again). We’re working hard at finishing the movie,” reads a joint statement attributed to Stone and Parker’s production banner Park County and Lamar’s company PGLang.\n\t\n\n\tThe long-gestating film had already been bumped down Paramount’s release calendar before. When unveiled in 2024, the film had been set for a July 4, 2025 release — conspicuously timed to the Independence Day holiday. Three months out, the studio punted to March 20, 2026. Now, four months out, the film has been delayed again, this time with no new date set.\n\n\n\tAs its lack of an official title would indicate, details about Lamar, Parker and Stone’s live-action collaboration have been closely guarded. No cast members or logline have been revealed. What is known  is that the film is written by comedian Vernon Chatman. Lamar, Parker and Stone are producers, along with Dave Free for PGLang.\n\n\tLamar is hot off scoring nine nominations for the 2026 Grammys, leading the field of nominees for this year’s edition with kudos for his smash hip-hop album “GNX” and single “Luther.” His single “Not Like Us” won two of the Grammys’ top three categories last year. Meanwhile, Parker and Stone are continuing production on the Trump-skewering “South Park” Season 28, premiering new episodes to Comedy Central every other Wednesday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIvan Drago could return, Dolph Lundgren tells Variety, ahead of the screening of Andrew Holmes’ documentary about the action star, “Dolph: Unbreakable,” on Saturday at the Torino Film Festival, which Lundgren is attending.\n\n\t“I could still show another side of this guy. Another human side, although I showed a little bit of that in ‘Creed II,’” Lundgren, who first played Drago in “Rocky IV,” adds. “He’s interesting because he’s so hard on the surface. Drago was my first big movie character and he was very well suited to me: I was a big guy, a fighter. The less I did, the more powerful I seemed. I think I could do it again, if there was a project with a good script.” \n\t\n\n\tLundgren, born in Sweden, became known also thanks to “Universal Soldier” and “Masters of the Universe” back when action was real. \n\n\n\t“In the 1980s and 90s, when if you wanted to be a star, you had to look the part. You had to have real muscles, because they couldn’t create them in a computer. You had to work out, do your own stunts and look believable running, jumping and beating everybody up,” he says. \n\n\t“There were only a few guys who could do that and still be decent actors, but everything changed when Tim Burton put Michael Keaton in a muscle suit. He took a dramatic actor, hired a few doubles and stunt guys to do all the fights, and that changed the action genre forever.”\n\n\tBefore, it used to be a “painful career,” with the old guard still counting their scars. But there’s a camaraderie that comes with it, he insists when discussing “Dolph: Unbreakable,” where some of them are featured. \n\t\n\n\t“If you’re a pro football player or if you go to war, it’s going to be painful – also if you’re trying to be an action star. No one said it was going to be easy, but it was harder than I thought. Then again, so is everything in life that’s worth anything,” he says. \n\n\t“Sly and Arnold used to be rivals, but people mellow with age. We’ve all been grateful that we’re still around. People will be watching these movies 20, 30 years from now and looking back at that era in a bit of an awe, because I don’t think actors want to go through that kind of discipline anymore. It’s not easy to build a physique like that; it’s a lot of work. I mean, you can’t beat Arnold as Conan [the Barbarian]. You can never beat that.”\n\n\tLundgren’s best characters were a laconic mystery, but these days he’s all about transparency – also about his health struggles.\n\n\t“If you are being honest, people relate to you more. They have the same problems. If I talk about cancer, maybe they’ll get a second opinion or get some help.” When he got sick in 2020, he insisted on keeping on filming. \n\n\t“For a while, everything looked good. I had surgery and they removed some tumors from my left kidney. Then I went to London to shoot ‘Aquaman’ and the treatment wasn’t working. It was serious.”\n\n\t“I had a man-to-man with the doctor when my wife wasn’t there. We were engaged at that time. He said: ‘You have three years left.’ I drew up my will, started to plan my own funeral and realized I may not be around when this documentary is released. I wanted to leave something my kids and my fans could watch.”\n\n\tAnother specialist and another diagnosis later, Lundgren is doing well. His work ethic hasn’t really changed, either. “I like to work. It keeps me young and it keeps me alive,” he says. \n\n\tHolmes says: “He wasn’t going to stop. There’s a tremendous amount of respect for the process when he’s saying: ‘I started this film. I want to make sure it gets finished.’”\n\n\t“Dolph’s cancer wasn’t public when we interviewed Van Damme. We told him in confidence and it completely sideswiped him. They weren’t super close, but that’s how much these guys mean to each other. They lived in an era that’s completely gone and put their bodies through hell. You’re getting paid all this money, but if you don’t have a body to use in your last quarter of life, was it worth it?”\n\t\n\n\tAfter years and years of actioners, Lundgren might be ready for different acting challenges.\n\n\t“I would like to be a little more internal, more normal. I’m drawn to those scripts. I would love to do stuff like that and maybe I eventually will, because this whole cancer journey has made me a different person. It has made me quieter,” he says.\n\n\t“I’ve always felt a bit insecure about my status in Hollywood as an actor – that I wasn’t good enough and didn’t act in award-winning pictures. But I think my main mission has been to entertain people and make them feel good.”\n\n\tHe adds: “A lot of movies I’ve made are obviously for the masses: for regular people, valet parkers and blue-collar workers. It’s a different type of recognition. Part of the payoff is when they say they love my movies or used to watch them with their dad who’s not around anymore. It’s quite emotional for me to hear that, you know.” \n\n\tWhen he first arrived to Hollywood, his looks were what he had, so he kept doing what he did best.\n\n\t“Hollywood is a business. You can’t make a movie just for the hell of it or to express yourself. Maybe in Sweden, if you’re Bergman. If a guy shows up, he’s good-looking, has muscles and can do action, you’re going to hire him for that. You don’t need him to be a good actor. That happened to me for a long time,” he recalls.\n\n\t“It made me sad. I wanted to express myself, but I didn’t know how to do it. Maybe this doc is a part of that, you know? Maybe it’s a first step towards that.” \n\n\tHolmes chimes in: “People who are in the spotlight never assume they’re wrong. Dolph was very, very quick to admit when he’d made mistakes in his life. My producer Adam Scorgie would say: ‘Wow, he’s being really open. When is it gonna change?’ And it never really did, honestly.” \n\n\tLundgren is “even more interesting outside of acting,” he states. “He’s played some iconic roles, but do people know he had a master’s in chemical engineering? That he was Sweden’s national karate champion, that he dated Grace Jones and dropped out of MIT to live like a celebrity at Studio 54?” He didn’t want to repeat familiar stories in the doc. \n\n\t“We don’t talk about the time when Dolph stopped Sly’s heart when he punched him in the chest [on ‘Rocky IV’], because that story has been told so many times. But we talk about how Sly saw himself in this young man: someone he could go to war with and rehearse for six months every single day. No one’s rehearsing for six months for a fight scene anymore.” \n\t\n\n\t“Dolph: Unbreakable,” now running at only 78 minutes, could expand in the future according to buyers’ wishes. “A lot of these docs get made when there’s no more career left. But Dolph’s got a lot of work left in him, especially as a director,” says Holmes.  \n\n\t“When he was younger, his career was about taking steps other people told him to take. Now, Dolph is fully in control of what he wants to do.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCamaraderie stole the spotlight at the Torino Film Festival as Spike Lee and Antonio Banderas each dropped to one knee, presenting the other with a lifetime achievement award at Friday’s opening ceremony. \n\n\tThe American auteur and Spanish icon were among 12 film luminaries honored with the festival’s Stella della Mole trophy, modeled on the 12-point star that crowns Turin’s iconic National Cinema Museum. Filmmakers Claude Lelouch and Alexander Sokurov, and actors Jacqueline Bisset, Daniel Brühl, and Hanna Schygulla were also celebrated, before the festival kicked off with a screening of David Freyne’s “Eternity.”\n\t\n\n\t“Acting has made me who I am,” Banderas said in Italian, addressing the stylish crowd at Turin’s Teatro Regio opera house. “This story began in the theater, and now I’m finding my way back. I continue to make films, of course, but theater remains a marvelous club — my home. Today, we live surrounded by artificial intelligence, yet theater reminds us of natural intelligence.” \n\n\n\tLee, by contrast, seemed less eager to tread the boards or step before the camera anew, joking that he only starred in his feature debut “She’s Gotta Have It” out of economic necessity. “I was only in that film because we had no budget, so I couldn’t pay anyone,” he deadpanned. “Now, I have a budget.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTorino Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom Saturday onwards, the city’s cinemas will host world and regional premieres alongside retrospectives, with attendees swapping evening wear for more casual attire and presenting landmark films to audiences across town. \n\t\n\n\t“We’re looking to foster conversations between generations,” festival artistic director Giulio Base told Variety. “I want Torino to be a place to discover new voices, revisit the masters, and fall in love with cinema all over again — with no distractions, just the shared light of the screen.”\n\n\tTrue to that mission, the festival’s 43rd edition opened with a musical tribute to Paul Newman, the subject of a 24-film career retrospective this year. More than 70 members of a local youth choir performed the “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” anthem “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head” against a big-screen slideshow celebrating Newman’s most iconic roles. The whimsical homage culminated with a video address from Clea Newman, who has long stewarded her father’s legacy and was delighted to share it with the Italian audience. \n\n\tRunning Nov. 21–29, this year’s festival will showcase 104 features and 16 shorts, including 23 world premieres and 11 international debuts. The lineup of special guests also includes Jason Biggs, Dominique Sanda, James Franco, Dolph Lundgren, Vanessa Redgrave, Terry Gilliam, Mascha Schilinski, Juliette Binoche and Alejandro Amenábar.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTorino Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tSustainability in filmmaking isn’t advancing fast enough, and real progress will require structural reform, cultural change, and mandatory standards",
    "body": "\n\tSustainability in filmmaking isn’t advancing fast enough, and real progress will require structural reform, cultural change, and mandatory standards — that was the blunt consensus from filmmakers across Japan, Spain, Australia and India at the International Film Festival of India’s “Reel Green” panel.\n\n\tCurated by Gouri Nair, head programming – masterclass and domestic film festivals and moderated by Naman Ramachandran of Variety, the panel featured producers Mina Moteki (Japan) and Anna Saura (Spain) and directors Garth Davis (Australia) and Nila Madhab Panda (India). Across their distinct contexts, the filmmakers agreed that meaningful environmental progress in film industries must come not only from practical reforms and willingness from the top, but also through deep cultural change.\n\t\n\n\tThe IFFI panel explored how national industries, each shaped by their own traditions, pressures, and protocols, are either shifting toward greener, more responsible filmmaking, or still struggling to introduce mandated sustainable practices.\n\n\n\tGarth Davis, director of the Oscar-nominated “Lion,” tied the sustainability challenge to a broader moral and relational crisis. “The state of the planet is a reflection of the state of us and our relationships,” he said. His filmmaking aims to “remind people of respect and kindness,” embedding environmental consciousness into the stories themselves. Davis described earlier commercial work where teams voluntarily added a carbon tax to budgets to fund offsets – small steps that laid groundwork for larger systemic ideas. He also warned of the fast-rising energy demands of AI, urging investors to take a long-term view so that data centres are powered by green energy.\n\t\n\n\tProducer Mina Moteki of Kowatanda Films, Japan, described how sustainable practices collide with entrenched production traditions in Japan – such as printed scripts and long working hours. She stressed that before Japan can transition meaningfully to greener production, the industry must first address workplace health. “Before considering an eco-friendly environment, we have to have a workplace for crew and cast that is much healthier.”\n\n\tMoteki also noted Japan’s contrasting environmental footprints in anime, now a $25 billion industry, and live-action production. While their impacts differ, she emphasised that cultural and labour reforms must come first. In practice, she and other independents rely on digital documents, local crews, public transport, and minimal set construction to reduce waste. She acknowledged the need for Japan to learn from global counterparts and expressed a personal duty “to spread the knowledge so that we can move forward.”\n\n\tSpanish film and documentary producer Anna Saura offered an example of what structural change looks like when embedded into national policy. Spain requires productions receiving public funds to follow sustainability protocols and obtain certification. “If you don’t get this certificate, you cannot get the money,” she stated. She also stressed the importance of training film students so sustainability becomes as fundamental as lighting or directing.\n\n\tWhen asked whether sustainable practices improve filmmaking craft, Saura said, “I’m not sure that it’s improving the industry… but it can help the world.” She acknowledged that green equipment and certification can be costly, particularly for low-budget productions, but insisted that sustainability must become a standard requirement, a basic expectation rather than an add-on. “I think we’re at the very beginning of this new era of sustainability in the film industry. That’s why it’s very important,” she said.\n\n\tIndian filmmaker Nila Madhab Panda, known for climate-focused films, reinforced the argument for accountability, describing the industry’s waste output as “insane.” He added, “This is a business of creativity. We may not compromise on that. But we could get conscious from day one, and say, onboard a creative sustainability director, who looks into green practices from the budgeting and pre-production stages,” He suggested the introduction of a sustainable carbon incentive from governments. “We should start putting carbon information as a label from the beginning of the film,” adding that sustainable practices often boost morale by creating “guilt-free” work environments.\n\t\n\n\tDavis agreed, adding that sustainable habits create “a general lift in energy and optimism,” and that crew members now frequently approach producers with proposals to reduce their footprint, from cycling to set to adopting solar-powered rigs. “There’s a real willingness,” he said.\n\n\tThe panel also explored strategies for repurposing sets, props, and food. Davis described discussions in Australia about preventing the destruction of sets kept for copyright or reshoots. Moteki outlined indie practices such as using natural locations, donating costumes, and giving away leftover bento boxes to avoid food waste. Saura noted that renting rather than building is standard in Spain, and end-of-shoot markets allow crew to buy or take wardrobe and props.\n\n\tAcross regions, the panellists agreed that sustainability requires cultural shifts, stronger labour structures, mandatory guidelines, and daily habits. The message was clear: the industry is still “at the very beginning of this new era,” as Saura said, but with shared knowledge and structural reform, sustainable filmmaking can set a benchmark for environmental responsibility.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTALLINN, Estonia — Has Estonia’s Tallinn Film Festival ever had it so good? Since Festival Director Tiina Lokk launched the event in 1997, it has emerged as one of the fastest-growing film events in Northern Europe, recognized by its receipt of an A-list general category status, shared with the likes of Cannes, Berlin and Venice, from 2014. \n\n\tThe festival held strong in 2025, buoyed by an powerful Catalan Focus, new talent discoveries and a vibrant industry arm. One question now is if there are headwinds ahead for the enterprising local Baltic national film industries. Following 6 takeaways from this year’s fest edition:\n\t\n\n\tHollywood Glamour at Discovery CampusA proof of Tallinn’s ace reputation as a training ground for the next gen of film professionals from around the world, its star educational program Discovery Campus attracted this year world class mentors – from Hollywood costume designer Debra McGuire (“Friends,” “The Morning Show”) to hairstylist Nina Paskowitz (“Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,” “Mob City”), Emmy-winning composer Miriam Cutler (“Love, Gilda,” “RBG”) and renowned Austrian helmer Jessica Hausner. Over 40 rising talents split into the Script Pool, Black Night Stars, Music Meets Film, Black Room and Frame within a Frame workshops, got a chance to be inspired and trained over four days.  “All we want [as costume designers] is to be in actors, directors’ heads, see what they see, therefore communication is key; if we get a bible early on [from producers], we’ll know what to do, where to go, and if there are issues, you’ll need to find solutions together,” were some of McGuire’s tips. Meanwhile Hausner and her husband composer Markus Binder shared their creative collaboration, from concept to final mix, using “Club Zero” as case study. “We want our rising talents to learn from the mistakes our mentors make, so that they don’t make them themselves,” said head of Discovery Campus Trinn Tramberg.\n\t\n\n\tEstonia Braces for New Studios, More Coin for Foreign ShootsThe tech-oriented country where Skype was born is turning its dream to lure other “Tenet” tentpoles into reality. The state-of-the-art Ida Viru studios in North-Eastern Estonia, plugged as the largest studio complex in Northern Europe, will open its doors in July 2026. At the panel Step into the Wild Wild East-Where Creativity Meets Courage, Teet Kuusmik, head of the studios and the Ida-Viru Investment Agency, said the €16 million ($18.6 million) complex is “a unique concept” as a new film eco-system, combining studio infrastructure, local production expertise, a multimedia accelerator and next gen film tech solutions for producers who can tap into the country’s regional (40%) and national (30%) cash rebates. One of the most recent international pics backed by Estonia’s attractive cash rebates, the Finnish-U.S. actioner “Sisu-Road to Revenge”(opening Nov. 21 in the U.S. via Sony Picture Releasing) was almost fully shot in Estonia. At another panel, First AD Hanna Hedengren, Estonian line producer Johanna Trass (Allfilm), and film commissioner Nele Paves explained how the production used 105 local crew over 44 intense shooting days, on top of complex SFX.\n\n\tOther good news for foreign shoots: next year Film Estonia’s annual budget of €6 million ($6.9 million) will be upped to €10 million ($11.5 million).\n\n\tCatalonia: Punching Far Above Its Weight\n\n\tCatalonia won four awards at Friday night’s prize ceremony, including the biggest one on offer the Tallinn Black Nights Festival’s Grand Prix for Júlia de Pax Solvas’ main competition entry “The Good Daughter.”  A film which announces another potentially major voice on the Catalan film scene – who already co-wrote drama series “Querer” which won this year the top prize at Series Mania, Europe’s biggest TV fest –  “The Good Daughter” (“La Buena Hija”) sums up much of what the world has found so exciting about much Catalan film in the last decade: a near new female writer-director and a film grounded in place and a social and psychological realism which talks, however, of universal issues. \n\n\tLead Kiara Arancibia’s empathy-inducing performance won her best actress. The film also took Tallinn’s coveted Audience Award. Lead produced by a budding Barcelona production house, Astra Pictures, and receiving support down the whole of chain of value from the Catalan government, “The Good Daughter” is also made with Avalon in Madrid and Krater Films in Belgium as Catalonia emerges as a pan-regional and international co-production force in Europe and Latin America. Another Catalan title, Carlos Solano’s “Leo & Lou,” scored Tallinn’s Children’s Jury Best Film Award: There is a wider range of talent in Catalonia. \n\t\n\n\tSurvival Tips for ProducersAs underscored by Tallinn Industry Head Marge Liikse, one of the overarching themes of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event (I@T&BE) was how to finance stories amid rising costs and shrinking public funds. “We’ve looked at how to mitigate this by cutting corners, notably through the clever use of AI, cash rebates, post-production through an ApostLab presentation, new tech solutions offered by the IDA Hub Film and Multimedia Innovation Centre, as well as private investment,” she said.At the panel Private Financing in Film: Between Promise and Illusion, venture capital funders Jesús Martínez (Moby Dick, Spain), Alexandra Lebret (Together Fund, France), Patrick Fischer (Creativity Capital, U.K.) and Rain Rannu (Tallifornia Film Fund, Estonia) shared some tip with producers:*Attract U.S. creative partners and convert A-list-driven content into Euro-U.S. co-pros to tap into the plethora of local tax incentives, soft financing, talented and cheaper workforce.“It’s a good time to bring U.S. films into Europe,” said Lebret, whose €50 million ($57.5 million) fund invests in indie producers: “They are the talent,” she said. “We’ve converted two U.S. movies with big stars into Spanish co-productions,” noted Martínez, specialized in A-list talent-driven commercial fare.\n\n\t*Protect your asset – which is your IPs; this is what we bet on,” said both Martinez whose VC fund invests directly in IP, as well as Fischer.*Share the rights and build strong alliances with co-production partners, offered Lebret.*Consider setting up a vertical structure and be innovative in business models, advised Fischer.\n\n\t*Stand on multiple content legs, whatever the genre or format, including vertical narratives, to diversify revenue streams, said Lebret, while Fischer advised to also look into the creator economy.\n\n\tBaltic Film Boom Threatened by Cuts in CultureAt PÖFF, Estonia confirmed its strength particularly in documentary filmmaking (“Edge of the Night,” “My Family and Other Clowns”) and daring new voices such as Eeva Mägi with her Mo movement, Estonian answer to Dogma 95. Lithuanian dominated the awards list, with new wins for “The Visitor,” “Renovation,” “China Sea” and “Holy Destructors” after their successful world premieres in Karlovy Vary (for the two first films), San Sebastián, and IDFA respectively. Meanwhile Latvia continues to shine in animation with “Dog of God,” a double contender for a European Film Awards, and second Latvian Oscar contender after last year’s phenomenal winner “Flow,” although in a totally different genre.\n\t\n\n\t However, war in Ukraine affecting budgets for culture across Europe, is having potentially dramatic effects on the small Baltic nations. While the Lithuanian Film Institute is still waiting for its 2026 budget to go through parliament, the Estonian Film Institute’s 4% cuts in its core running costs will “directly affects our capacity to make Estonian film visible around the world,” warned the EFI’s CEO Edith Sepp. The institute honcho also lamented the freeze to local films , staying at €7 million ($8.1 million) to $8 million ($9.2 million), while cash rebates for foreign shoots will increase from €6 million ($6.9 million) to €10 million ($11.5 million) . “This is a historic change,” she said. “Estonia has always taken pride in keeping national authors in the priority position, but not anymore. This is truly sad because it places foreign productions above our own cultural survival. We have reached a point where the economy is allowed to come before our culture, and that is a truly dangerous choice to make for any small nation,” she stated.\n\n\tPÖFF DealsSales and pick-ups on festival films as reported by Variety:*Lithuania’s “The Activist” by Romas Zabarauskas, sold by Alief to nearly 20 territories including TLA Releasing for North America, the Baltics via WBD International Content LLC for HBO Max and French-speaking territories to Optimale.*French-Nepalese doc “18 Hopes to Paradise” by João Nuno Pinto snapped up by Alpha Violet*Norway’s “No Comment” by Petter Næss boarded by TrustNordisk*Spain’s “Under Your Feet” by Cristian Bernard picked up by FilmSharks*Denmark’s “Pretty Young Love” sold by LevelK to Germany (Splendid Film), Encripta (Latin America), South Korea (Husky Films)*Lithuania’s “Hunger Breakfast Strike” by Karolis Kaupinis boarded by Alief.*Commenting on Tallinn, Tine Klint, head of LevelK who hadn’t attended PÖFF in a while said “in the future, I will prioritise this event because of the packed industry program and networking possibilities across areas. We always submit films because it is a festival that can help with additional visibility and it’s a great festival where the filmmaker can experience a premiere with a fantastic audience.”Nikolai Korsgaard of TrustNordisk who repped “No Comment” and “My First Love” in the Official and First Films competitions respectively, said both titles were already benefitting from their festival buzz. But due to the tough market, he came home empty handed. “2025 has been a challenging year like no other, so we are more cautious with selecting the exact right projects that we can sell and believe in,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tJohn Hopewell contributed to this article.\n",

    "description": "\n\tTwo weeks after a triumphal opening to the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival with “They Will be Dust,” Catalan cinema, honored by a Focus at Tallin",
    "body": "\n\tTwo weeks after a triumphal opening to the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival with “They Will be Dust,” Catalan cinema, honored by a Focus at Tallinn this year, closed out the major film event with a bang, scooping three awards, including the heavyweight top Grand Prix, for Julia de Paz Solvas’ family drama “The Good Daughter.” \n\n\tThe non-professional Kiara Arancibia won best actress for her “mesmerizing performance,” said the jury, while the audiences voted the “The Good Daughter” its top festival choice – manna from heaven for sales agent Beta Cinema.\n\t\n\n\t“This film is a strong and emotional drama about a teenage girl dealing with family conflict. It handles difficult themes with care, making the story feel real. The lead performance is honest and sensitive, helping the audience understand her feelings. The simple cinematography and editing support the story without taking attention away from it. Overall, the film shows family struggles in a realistic and meaningful way,” said the jury, consisting of director Teona Strugar Mitevska, costume designer of “Friends” fame Debra Mcguire, producers Nomuunzul Turmunkh, Ingo Fliess, and cinematographer Roberto Schaefer.\n\n\n\tThrowing herself into the arms of Arancibia and thanking the jury, De Paz Solvas, co-writer of the Series Mania winning show “Querer,” said to the packed house: “I want to thank my co-author ‘mi amor’ [Núria Dunjó.] We started this film with the desire to reclaim such fundamental rights as children’s rights, living in a relationship of violence.”\n\n\tIn its literal and figurative meaning, in reference to the family of filmmakers, producers and craft creators, family was very much the theme of the 29th Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival –also known as PÖFF – which for the first time combined the festival and Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event awards, in a joyful, smooth and well-orchestrated ceremony.\n\t\n\n\tFamily was also the theme of all main competition winners, including the Turkish “LikeLike,” which scooped direction (Ali Vatansever) and original score (Erdem Helvacıoğlu), and Germany’s “The Frog and the Water” in which actors Aladdin Detlefsen and Kanji Tsuda shared an acting award for their roles as unlikely brothers by choice.\n\n\tBeyond family, the need for togetherness, humanity, healing and resilience against aggression were at the core of many award-winning titles, with war in Ukraine all too present in everybody’s mind and hearts.  \n\n\t“In times like these, comedy is part of our mental survival toolkit,” noted Norway’s Ståle Stein Berg at Friday night’s prize ceremony, where he won best screenwriter in main competition for Petter Næss’ political satire “No Comment.” “When the world is on fire, we need to carry on doing what we love, together with the people we love. You’re all beacons of love, folks,” told the audience.\n\n\tReceiving both of the Fipresci Award and Best Film in the First Film Competition for “Hercule Falling” dealing with PTSD, Danish filmmaker Christian Bonke said in his thank-you speech: “The film deals with the trauma of war; it shows that it doesn’t stop with war. The film started before Ukraine, and today we’re in a situation where all countries put more money into this military conflict. It even looks like we’ll send more people to war and our world leaders have completely abandoned diplomacy and peace talks. I would therefore dedicate this film to the victims of war,” he said, closing his emotional speech with “Glory to Ukraine.”\n\n\t“Glory to Ukraine” was indeed a rallying cry Friday evening at Tallinn’s Alexela Concert Hall, which sank painfully in the hearts of many Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians, sharing not too distant memories of Russian occupation. “My film deals with war in Ukraine, affecting us all and our democracies. We have to resist and make art that connects people,” argued Lithuania’s Gabrielė Urbonaitė when collecting the director award for “Renovation” from the Baltic Film competition.\n\n\tLithuania RulesLithuania attended PÖFF with a record 17 titles and went home with the most wins – 9 – across all festival and industry awards, confirming the vitality of its new generation of talents, backed by strong producers, such as veteran Uljana Kim, behind “Renovation,” “Holy Destructors”and the two-time work in progress winner “Dice-Ching-O-Mat and Marija Razgutė at M-Films, who produced the Baltic Film Competition winners “The Visitor” and “Becoming.” \n\t\n\n\tFinland also put in a strong performance on Friday night with Best Film at the Doc@PÖFF International Competition for “Days of Wonder,” Best Short from Rebels with a Cause section for “Pay Day, and “The Well” by newcomer Siiro Halto scooping the weighty €20,0000 ($23,000) Eurimages Co-Production Development Award. Finland’s “Lex-Julia” scored the Baltic Work in Progress Public Award.\n\n\tLast night was also a celebration of animation with an emotional Lifetime Achievement to Estonian master Janno Põldma, co-creator of the iconic ‘Lotte’ character and children and youth films via the sub-festival Just Film. “Film literacy at school is essential and films for kids and youth should not be ghettoized, although they are still disregarded in the film industry,” said Marge Liiske, head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event.\n\n\tFilm education and training were also highlighted via a raft of awards at Tallinn’s Discovery Campus. One of the program’s star mentors, two-time Palme d’Or contender Jessica Hausner, was handed the festival’s first Honorary Award by Tallinn Black Nights Festival Director Tiina Lokk. Citing French helmer Julia Ducournau who herself quoted Martin Scorsese, the Austrian director said: “Art is about asking the questions, not giving all the answers.”\n\n\tBetween Nov. 7-23, Tallinn Black Nights, one of the world’s “A-list” film festivals alongside Cannes, Berlin and Venice, showcased 252 feature films and 275 shorts from an impressive 79 countries, including 111 world and 31 international premieres.\n\n\tOn the industry front, nearly 860 accredited guests from around 50 countries signed up for the must-attend annual event for content from the Baltics, Nordics, CEE and beyond.\n\n\t“Film as an artform is our focus, not glamor,” Lokk insisted on stage Friday night. “I can see that producers, filmmakers and distributors finally understand our DNA and send us their film gems for us to showcase to our engaged film audience. Next year will be a big anniversary, our 30th. I can’t wait to celebrate this with my team and the audience,” she said.\n\n\t29th Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÖFF) Winners \n\n\tOfficial Selection CompetitionGrand Prix\n\n\t “The Good Daughter,” Júlia de Paz Solvas (Spain)\n\t\n\n\tBest Director \n\n\tAli Vatansever, “Lifelike” (Turkey)\n\n\tBest Actress \n\n\tKiara Arancibia,” “The Good Daughter” (Spain)\n\n\tBest Actor \n\n\tAladdin Detlefsen, Kanji Tsuda (The Frog and the Water, Germany)\n\n\tBest Script \n\n\tStåle Stein Berg, “No Comment” (Norway)\n\n\tBest Production Design \n\n\tChris Richmond, David Hand, “Think of England” (U.K.)\n\n\tBest Original Score\n\n\tErdem Helvacıoğlu, “Lifelike, (Turkey)\n\n\tBest Cinematographer \n\n\tYutaka Yamazaki, “The Imaginary Dog and the Lying Cat,” (Japan)First Feature CompetitionBest Film\n\n\t“Hercules Falling,” Christian Bonke (Denmark) \n\n\tBest Director\n\n\tSamuel Abrahams, “Lady”(U.K)\n\n\tSpecial Jury Prize, Best Editing, \n\n\tJan Van Der Weken, “Sunday Ninth,” (Belgium) \n\n\tSpecial Jury Prize\n\n\t“Easy Girl,” Hille Norden (Germany)\n\n\tCritics’ Picks Competition\n\n\tBest Film\n\n\tChina Sea”, Jurgis Matulevičius (Lithuania, Taiwan, Poland, Czechia)\n\n\tBest Director\n\n\tMatías Szulanski, “A Summer Tale”(Argentina)\n\n\tSpecial Mention\n\n\t“Oh, What Happy Days,”Homayoun Ghanizadeh (Iran)\n\n\tSpecial Mention\n\n\t“Mo Papa,”Eeva Mägi (Estonia)\n\n\tRebels with a Cause CompetitionBest Film, “The Baronesses,” \n\n\tNabil Ben Yadir, Mokhtaria Badaoui (Belgium, Luxembourg, France) \n\n\tBest Director\n\n\tRógan Graham, “Blindsight” (Romania,Turkey)\n\n\tBest Rebel with a Cause Short Film\n\n\t“Pay Day,” Päivi Hirsiaho (Finland)\n\n\tDoc@PÖFF Baltic CompetitionBest Film\n\n\t“Holy Destructors,”Aistė Žegulytė (Lithuania, France, Latvia)\n\n\tSpecial Jury Prize\n\n\t“My Family and Other Clowns,” Heilika Pikkov, Liina Särkinen (Estonia)\n\n\tDoc@PÖFF International CompetitionBest Film\n\n\t“Days of Wonder,” Karin Pennanen (Finland, Denmark, Norway)Special Jury Prize\n\n\tRaisa Răzmeriță and her team, “Electing Ms Santa,” Raisa Răzmeriță (Moldova, Romania)\n\n\tBest Cinematographer\n\n\tMax Golomidov, “Edge Of The Night,” Vladimir Loginov (Estonia)\n\n\tBaltic Film CompetitionBest Film\n\n\t“The Visitor,” Vytautas Katkus (Lithuania, Norway, Sweden)\n\n\tBest Director\n\n\tGabriele Urbonaite, “Renovation”(Lithuania, Latvia, Belgium)\n\t\n\n\tBest Baltic Producer for Co-production \n\n\tZhannat Alshanova, “Becoming,” Hannat Alshanova (France, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Lithuania, Sweden)\n\n\tNETPAC (Network for the Promotion of Asia Cinema) Jury Prize\n\n\t“The Muralist,” Sengedorj Janchivdorj (Mongolia)\n\n\tInternational Federation of Film Critics (Fiprecsci) Award\n\n\t“Hercules Falling,” Christian Bonke (Denmark)\n\n\tPÖFF Audience Award \n\n\t“The Good Daughter,” Júlia de Paz Solvas (Spain)\n\n\tJust Film Youth and Children’s Film Festival Grand Prix\n\n\t“They Call Me Danka,” Dovile Gasiunaite (Lithuania)\n\n\tJuniors’ Jury Best Film Award \n\n\t“The Songbirds’ Secret,” Antoine Lanciaux (France)\n\n\tChildren’s Jury Best Film Award\n\n\t“Leo & Lou,” Carlos Solano (Spain)\n\n\tYouth Jury Best Film Award\n\n\t“Wheelie,” Isis Mihrimah Cabolet (Netherlands) \n\n\tECFA Award\n\n\t“Mira,” Marie Limkilde (Denmark)#youngfilmmaker Award Sunflower,”Ketlin Kõiv \n\n\tIndustry Awards, a Selection:Baltic Event Co-Production MarketBest Project\n\n\t“The Well” by Siiri Halko, produced by Silmu Films, FinlandEurimages Special Co-Production Development Award \n\n\t“Alice Wants to Live” by Denys Sobolev (prize given to a project from Ukraine)\n\n\t-Producers Network Prize for Promising Young Producers\n\n\t“No Salvation Coming” (Czechia) and “Vesna” (Ukraine, France, Lithuania)\n\n\tBaltic Event Co-Production Market Public Favorite\n\n\t“The Queen of England Stole My Parents” by Ernestas Jankauskas (Lithuania, Poland)\n\n\tScript Pool Award\n\n\tWhite Ship by Teresa Väli (Estonia)\n\n\tScript Pool Public Favourite Award: “Apoteos” by Christofer Nilsson (Sweden)\n\n\tEuropean Genre Forum Award \n\n\t“Little Bird” by Faye Jackson (U.K.)\n\n\tWorks in ProgressSpecial Award by TRT\n\n\t“Dice -Ching-O-Mat” by Kristijonas Vildžiūnas (Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia)\n\n\tBest International Project\n\n\t“Prince” by Federico Borgia (Argentina, Uruguay)\n\n\tInternational Works in Progress Public Favourite\n\n\t“The Convulsions” by David Gutiérrez Camp (France, Spain)\n\n\tBest Baltic Project\n\n\t“Dice-Ching-O-Mat” by Kristijonas Vildziunas (Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia)\n\n\tBaltic Event Works in Progress Public Favourite\n\t\n\n\t“Lex Julia” by Laura Hyppönen (Finland, Estonia, Sweden, Poland)\n\n\tBest Just Film Project\n\n\t“Suiza” by Maria Fernanda Gonzales (Peru, Argentina)\n\n\tJust Film Works in Progress Public Favorite: “Suiza” (Argentina, Peru)\n",

He said Diggs then approached him and tried to kiss him, but he turned him down.

Griffith claims they then accused him of stealing items from the home, stripped him, and physically assaulted him.\n      \n    \n          He said one week later, he was attacked outside his Los Angeles apartment and suffered serious injuries. The alleged assault was caught on video, and Griffith says Darez was one of the attackers.\n      \n    \n          Griffith also claims Diggs made several false and defamatory statements about him on a burner Instagram account.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Griffith is seeking unspecified compensatory damages and punitive damages.\n      \n      ",

Marshawn was found with a fatal, self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n      \n    \n          The report also says officials from Frisco PD and TX DPS met with representatives from the Dallas Cowboys at the scene.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Kneeland was drafted in the 2nd round out of Western Michigan in 2024, and was in the middle of his second season in Big D.\n      \n    \n          As you'd expect, news of Marshawn's death has rocked the Cowboys ... who dedicated Monday night's win to his honor.\n      \n    \n          R.I.P.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

She replied by accusing others on the program of bullying her.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Zerboni points out she was pregnant on the show and going through a lot already ... and, she didn't get any grace from her costars like she might've hoped. Plus, she adds, reality television twists and distorts everything -- in this case, making her seem like the bad guy.\n      \n\n          As for why Ashtyn was made the villain this season, she says it's because she came in with \"hard truths\" ... instigating trouble instead of mediating peace like she says she does in her day-to-day life.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          We also asked her about the rumor that she met her husband Jeff on Seeking -- an app that used to facilitate \"sugar dating\" but rebranded in 2022 and no longer condones such activities.\n      \n    \n          Zerboni has denied meeting him on Seeking multiple times ... and, she does so during this chat, too -- telling us the two met on Luxy, a dating app for the super rich. Luxy also has a \"no sugar daddies/sugar babies\" rule printed clearly on its website. Unfortunately for the many ladies we learned just signed up for Seeking after the Netflix shoutout, they can't count Ashtyn and Jeff as a success story from that site.\n      \n    \n          Anyhoo ... only time will tell if Ashtyn wants to go back for Season 5 -- because it sounds like Season 4 wasn't a positive experience.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Selling Sunset\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

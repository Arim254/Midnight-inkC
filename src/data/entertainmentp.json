    "body": "\n\tBen Affleck recently told Fox 32 Chicago that he had food poisoning while shooting his emotional goodbye scene with Bruce Willis in the 1998 disaster blockbuster “Armageddon.”\n\n\t“When we shot that scene, I had food poisoning,” Affleck said. “I wasn’t an experienced enough actor at that point to know that you can just pick up the phone and be like, ‘I’m too sick to work today.’ I’m like, ‘I better come in.’ So I went and I was literally, it’s the only time it’s ever happened in my life, vomiting between takes.”\n\t\n\n\tAffleck added with a laugh that his distressed state “probably made the scene better.”\n\n\n\tThe scene in question saw oil man A.J. Frost, played by Affleck, say goodbye to “deep core” oil driller Harry Stamper, played by Willis, as he sacrifices himself to manually detonate a bomb to destroy an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.\n\n\tDirected by Michael Bay, other cast members included Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan.\n\n\tAffleck recalled seeing Buscemi at the premiere of his new Netflix film “The Rip,” which he said flooded his mind with memories of the film.\n\n\tHe said, “I actually saw Steve Buscemi last night at the premiere for ‘The Rip,’ and we were reminiscing about that movie and thinking about how that was the weirdest, kind of wonderful, strange, otherworldly movie experience.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe second season of “Landman” has come to an end, and while the dramatic focus of the series shifted from oil business to family matters, Billy Bob",
    "body": "\n\tThe second season of “Landman” has come to an end, and while the dramatic focus of the series shifted from oil business to family matters, Billy Bob Thornton‘s character Tommy always remained the central focus. Brash, brilliant and funny, Tommy is always able to keep cool under pressure and speak what’s on his mind, which is very reminiscent of Thornton’s real-life energy. The veteran actor spoke with Variety about his biggest challenges this season, how the show speaks to so many different fans, and why writer and co-creator Taylor Sheridan‘s shows are sometimes snubbed in awards conversations.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat would you consider your most challenging scene to shoot this season?\t\n\n\tMaybe not every actor is this way, but I can’t help it because I’m so codependent. Some of the hardest stuff I had to do was when I had to be abrupt to, or even mean with, Sam Elliott. Sam and I are old, old friends. He’s been like a pop to me since I’ve known him in the ’80s. He’s been a mentor, a friend and everything. Sometimes, knowing the other human, it’s not as easy to just go for it, but you have to. You have to go 100%. When I did “Bad Santa,” it’s not like I could be really sweet with the kids. I actually explained that to the kids on that set and to the parents. But I would say that was the most challenging thing. \n\n\n\tThis cast has such great chemistry, and it was instant chemistry, which is awesome. But Sam, Andy Garcia and Demi [Moore] and I all go way back. Ali [Larter] and Michelle [Randolph] and Jacob [Lofland] and Kayla Wallace and James Jordan, none of us knew each other. But somehow we had a chemistry that was there from day one. It’s also a tribute to Taylor, because he knows who to cast and for what part. He really does. Some writers write with their own voice for every character, but each person on this show is their own thing. I love that. So when you have chemistry like that, but not everyone’s talking the same … One of the most brilliant things Taylor’s done with his shows is he has very strong individual characters with their own voices.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned Andy Garcia. The scenes this season where your characters are feuding are really electric. How do you find that spark together and find the rhythm of those big arguments?\t\n\n\tAndy and I are both sort of known for that. I grew up as an actor doing that, and so did he. Andy probably improvised more than I did in the scenes that we did. We stuck to what Taylor had written, but there are things we would throw in there at each other now and then. There’s one where Andy is putting in his office while we’re having our talk. That was Andy’s deal. It’s real easy to do this with Andy, he and I both have played a couple of bad guys, too. When you get into a confrontation, I think the adrenaline of the moment just takes over and can help you forget that you’re talking to your buddy. Whereas with me and Sam, they’re more sedated moments, more personal moments. So with Andy, that was a lot easier, knowing that this is my nemesis and he knows I’m his.\n\t\n\t\tWhy do you think “Landman” speaks to such a broad group of fans?\t\n\n\tIt’s interesting because we were very surprised it became an international hit. We thought it was going to appeal to Middle America, maybe not even the coasts. Now we have fans from Africa, South America, Canada, Australia, England, wherever it is. I think a lot of it is because the characters are unabashedly who they are. I think people like it that we just say and do whatever we do. There’s no walking on eggshells because we’re worried of what someone’s going to think. I think sometimes people like to see that freedom if they don’t have it in their own lives. Also, you’re taking a peek behind the curtain of a business that’s not normally portrayed.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve spoken candidly in the past about award shows in Hollywood. Compared to its success, it seems that “Landman” and other Taylor Sheridan shows are sometimes underrepresented in award conversations. Why do you think that is?\t\n\n\tI think a lot of it’s political. I really do. I think some people assume Taylor is some sort of right-wing guy or something, and he’s really not. Even with this show being about the oil business, he just shows you what it’s like. He’s not saying “Rah, rah, rah for oil.” It’s just the people who work in this business or who are affected by this business, the people on the periphery and within the families in the business; this is what happens. These are the kinds of problems and joys and triumphs and whatever happens in this world. It’s a world of gambling, and you never know what’s going to happen. But I think people got the wrong idea about that. \n\t\n\n\tActing is not a sport. If you run the 100-meter dash in the Olympics and you break the tape first, you win. There’s no question about it. Everybody saw it. How do you say in the artistic world who won? It’s an intangible thing. Then people say, “Well, any one of the nominees besides me could have won this. They’re all wonderful actors.” Not only them, some other actors in the audience who weren’t nominated, some other ones who aren’t even at the show, some other ones who aren’t even known by people have done an amazing job. If you put your heart and soul into something you love, and you’re satisfied with your work, and it works in the thing, there’s the award. I look at it that way. I’m too damn old now to worry about stuff like that. I got enough awards. I’m good. I’m sure the people that I work for or work with me don’t like to hear that. But I guess when I said I’m too damn old, I guess I’m too damn old to not tell the truth.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCBS News is getting ready to put a delayed and much-scrutinized “60 Minutes” segment out into public view, but it remains unclear that doing so will tamp down the controversy that has erupted around it.\n\n\tThe previously-impeded segment is called “Inside CECOT” and is a piece by “60 Minutes” correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi built around on-screen accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. to a harsh prison in El Salvador. It had been shelved even though CBS News had already promoted it as part of the lineup of the newsmagazine’s December 21 telecast. As disclosed by an email sent to colleagues at the time by Alfonsi, the decision was made by top CBS News executive Bari Weiss, who had at the time insisted that Trump officials appear in the report to comment on camera, even though Alfonsi’s team had made good-faith efforts to secure response ahead of filing the report for legal review. “The public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” Alfonsi said in her memo.\n\t\n\n\t“CBS News leadership has always been committed to airing the ’60 Minutes’ CECOT piece as soon as it was ready,” the news division said in a statement Sunday. “Tonight, viewers get to see it, along with other important stories, all of which speak to CBS News’ independence and the power of our storytelling.”\n\n\n\tWhen the report airs, it will not contain any direct interviews or exchanges on screen with Trump officials, according to three people familiar with the matter. Alfonsi had been dispatched to Washington, D.C. last week to try and secure an on-screen interview, two of these people said, but an interview that Weiss had hoped for did not take place. The story will, however, contain statements from several different parts of the U.S. government, something Weiss felt was lacking in the original piece and an element she wants in much of CBS’ political reportage, according to an executive familiar with the matter.\n\t\n\n\tAnd the piece will have three minutes of new reporting, this executive said, as well some minor changes from what had been expected to run in December. A statistic about the number of people who are deported from the U.S. because they are criminal has been added, and the story will note that one of the interviewees has two tattoos that are known marks of gangs or Nazis — elements the administration uses to identify migrants for potential deportation.\n\n\tAlfonsi is not expected to address any of the controversies around the piece in her introduction to the segment Sunday night.\n\n\tCareful viewers will be able to compare the new version with the original that was ready to air in December. After Weiss ordered the story held, a copy of it that had already been distributed to a Canadian media partner leaked and were made available via YouTube and other social outlets.\n\n\tAiring of the segment may not mend any frayed relationships between management and staff. Alfonsi’s current contract with CBS News is slated to lapse sometime this summer, according to a person familiar with the matter. If her deal is not renewed, some journalists could interpret it as the result of retaliation for her willingness to speak up. \n\n\tAlfonsi, who worked at ABC News before joining “60 Minutes,” has earned a reputation as a dependable reporter who typically avoids the controversies that can engulf TV-news personnel. At “60 Minutes,” Alfonsi told Variety in 2020, “you are dropped by a helicopter on top of a mountain and you have to kind of find your way down. There are some paths and moguls and jumps. You are sort of kicking your way out. I’ve been pushed out of the helicopter. I’m on the mountain. I feel like I’m just taking speed.”\n\n\tWeiss has defended her decision to hold the piece. But she acknowledges her timing was inopportune, according to a person familiar with her thinking, and she recognizes that she inserted herself into “60 Minutes'” editing and vetting process at a late stage. \n\n\t“Right now, the majority of Americans say they do not trust the press. It isn’t because they’re crazy,” Weiss said in a memo issued around Christmas. “To win back their trust, we have to work hard. Sometimes that means doing more legwork. Sometimes it means telling unexpected stories. Sometimes it means training our attention on topics that have been overlooked or misconstrued. And sometimes it means holding a piece about an important subject to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.” \n\t\n\n\tWeiss has attracted more attention to CBS News since her arrival last year than perhaps any other personality except Katie Couric, who jumped from NBC to anchor of “CBS Evening News” in 2006.  Weiss, a conservative opinion provocateur who founded the right-leaning site The Free Press, joined Paramount Skydance last year after the company purchased her outlet for $150 million. Since that time, she has overhauled “CBS Evening News” and sought to launch a new series of town halls and debates. But her  lack of experience with managing a large TV asset has been on regular display, giving staffers and critics plenty of reason for skepticism.\n\n\t“60 Minutes,” which features profiles and features along with investigative pieces, has seen its credibility undermined over the past two years as corporate managers failed to defend it from what was largely considered to be a nuisance suit from President Trump over the editing of a 2024 interview with then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Paramount, eager to clear a path to a sale of the company from the Redstone family, former controlling shareholders, to the Ellisons, who now operate Paramount Skydance, agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to Trump.\n\n\tAs a result, two senior CBS News executives  — Bill Owens, the executive producer of “60 Minutes” and Wendy McMahon, the former CEO of CBS News, local stations and syndication — suggested in remarks that they could no longer push back against corporate mandates they felt would weaken the newsroom. Three people familiar with the show say there have been calls for “60 Minutes” to cut back on the number of hard-news or investigative segments it runs, and pay more attention to features and celebrity profiles, which corporate managers believe will generate more attention online. On Sunday, however, the telecast will contain two segments tied to politics: one is the CECOT report, and the other is a look at what has happened in Minneapolis as ICE authorities crack down on the populace.\n\n\tThe newsmagazine has long worked apart from the rest of CBS News, and in recent years there have been some efforts to bring the show to heel. Whether the correspondents who work there will continue to bristle at similar maneuvers remains to be seen, but there is a hope internally that the show can get back to producing its journalism instead of being forced to defend it under circumstances Mike Wallace and Morley Safer might have considered surreal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrancois Ozon‘s “The Stranger,” an adaptation of Albert Camus’ literary masterpiece which world premiered at Venice, topped the 31st Lumières Awards, taking best Film, best Actor for Benjamin Voisin, and best cinematography for Manu Dacosse at a ceremony held Sunday at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris.\n\n\tIt marks Ozon’s first time winning best film at the Lumière Awards, after prior nominations in 2020 for “By the Grace of God,” and in 2021 for “Summer 85.” Voisin, who stars in “The Stranger” opposite Rebecca Marder, previously won best revelation for his role in “Summer 85.” \n\t\n\n\tAmerican filmmaker Richard Linklater, meanwhile, picked up best director for “Nouvelle Vague,” a black-and-white love letter to the French cinematic movement known as the New Wave. The film, which  opened in competition at Cannes, also earned best male revelation for Guillaume Marbeck. Considered France’s equivalent to the Golden Globes, the Lumières Awards are voted on by international journalists from 36 countries and are handed out during a ceremony that takes place roughly a month before the Cesar Awards and kicks off France’s awards season.French star Léa Drucker won best actress for Dominik Moll’s Yellow Jacket drama “Case 137,” which also opened at Cannes. It was Druker’s first Lumière victory following nominations in 2019 for Xavier Legrand’s “Custody,” and 2024 with Catherine Breillat’s “Last Summer.” \n\n\n\tNadia Melliti, who won best actress at Cannes for her role in Hafsia Herzi’s “The Little Sister” won best female revelation; and another Cannes prizewinner, “The Secret Agent,” by Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho, picked up best international co-production. The movie just nabbed a pair of Golden Globes — Wagner Moura for best actor and best international film. Screenwriter-director Stéphane Demoustier won best screenplay for “L’Inconnu de la Grande Arche,” his second Lumière after a 2021 win for “La Fille au bracelet.”The awards spread further across the slate with Pauline Loquès’ “Nino,” starring Théodore Pellerin, winning best first film; Ugo Bienvenu’s “Arco” named best animated feature; and Sepideh Farsi’s “Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk” taking best documentary. Best original music went to Warren Ellis, Dom La Nena and Rosemary Standley for “Le Chant des forêts,” directed by Vincent Munier.\n\n\tNext up in France’s race will be the Cesar Awards which are scheduled to take place on Feb. 27 at the Olympia in Paris with Jim Carrey set as this year’s honorary Cesar recipient. \n",

I was so delighted to meet him — that was all I was thinking about.”\n\n\tShe added, “I turned to the house, which in most theaters, you can see by looking a little above your own eyesight. In the Dolby Theatre, you have to raise your chin like you’re about to scale Mount Everest. Every single actor, director and producer you recognize, is staring you in the face. I then cursed, and I’m still sorry I cursed.”\n\n\tLeo famously said the f-word during her acceptance speech. She said that Kate Winslet made it look “so fucking easy” when she won best actress for “The Reader” in 2009.\n\n\tShe said of the slip-up, “I fucking curse all the time, but you cannot curse on network television.

    "body": "\n\tRoger Allers, a longtime Disney writer and the co-director of the 1994 animated classic “The Lion King,” has died. He was 76.\n\n\tAllers’ death was confirmed by veteran visual effects supervisor Dave Bossert, who honored his friend and collaborator on Facebook.\n\n\t“I am deeply saddened by the news that our friend Roger Allers has passed on to his next journey,” he wrote. “We were just trading emails this past week while he was traveling in Egypt, which makes this loss feel all the more unreal. Roger was an extraordinarily gifted artist and filmmaker, a true pillar of the Disney Animation renaissance.”\n\t\n\n\tAllers helmed “The Lion King” alongside Rob Minkoff. Starring Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones, the film is widely considered among the best in Disney’s animated catalog. Released in 1994, “The Lion King” grossed $771 million globally in its original theatrical run. The 2019 remake is one of the highest-grossing films of all time at $1.6 billion worldwide.\n\n\tBob Iger, the CEO of Disney, paid tribute to Allers on Instagram. He wrote in a statement, “Roger Allers was a creative visionary whose many contributions to Disney will live on for generations to come. He understood the power of great storytelling – how unforgettable characters, emotion and music can come together to create something timeless. His work helped define an era of animation that continues to inspire audiences around the world, and we are deeply grateful for everything he gave to Disney. Our hearts are with his family, friends and collaborators.”\n\n\tHis other animation directing credits include the 2006 outdoor adventure “Open Season” and the Oscar-nominated short “The Little Matchgirl.”\n\t\n\n\tAllers also worked as a writer and story developer for Disney films like “Aladdin,” “The Emperor’s New Groove” and “Brother Bear.” He also contributed to the straight-to-DVD film “The Lion King 1 1/2.”\n\n\t“I worked very closely with him on ‘The Little Matchgirl,’ and it was nothing short of a joy—he carried a sense of wonder, generosity, and enthusiasm that lifted everyone around him,” Bossert added. “Roger had a joyful, luminous spirit, and the world is dimmer without him. Rest in peace, my friend. Until we meet again on the other side.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe “blind box” trend popularized by the seemingly omnipresent Labubu dolls last year has now hit one of the most popular films of 2025 too, with a new KPop Demon Hunters Mystery Box.\n\n\tAvailable now on Amazon and at Hot Topic online, each Mystery Box contains one random “KPop Demon Hunters” pin, inspired by one of the characters in the hit Netflix animated film. There are six character pins to collect in total: Rumi, Zoey, Mira, Jinu, Derpy and Sussie, and a glow-in-the-dark “chase” variant that features Jinu with demon patterns.\n\n\n\tThis is an officially-licensed release from Netflix, accessories brand Loungefly and collectibles brand Funko (the so-called “Chance of Chase” variants are a super limited variation of a Funko Pop! design, which makes them highly-coveted among collectors). The unboxing of these mystery boxes, meantime, has become a huge trend on social media, with fans eagerly tearing open the packaging to reveal the character inside.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIMITED-EDITION RELEASE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFunko Pop! By Loungefly KPop Demon Hunters Mystery Box Pin\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tEach collectible pin in the “KPop Demon Hunters” Mystery Box is made from gunmetal and enamel, and measures approximately 1.5 inches tall.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to the HUNTR/X-heavy mystery box pins, Hot Topic also has a “blind bag” set of enamel pins that feature the Saja Boys. There are six pins to collect in total including the Saja Boys in their “Soda Pop” outfits, plus a chase demon Jinu with glitter detail.\n\n\tBoth the “KPop Demon Hunters” Mystery Box and the Saja Boys “Blind Bags” are selling quickly online, and are expected to be snatched up by fans of the film, so we recommend adding to cart while they’re still available.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALSO AVAILABLE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKPop Demon Hunters Saja Boys Blind Bag Enamel Pin\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tEach pin measures approximately 1.75 inches tall, with one random pin per blind bag.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThese blind boxes are the latest “KPop Demon Hunters” merch release from Netflix, who recently signed a deal with Mattel and Hasbro to unveil dolls, plush toys and board games, inspired by the film.\n\n\n\tThe mini collector pins are also inspired by the original “KPop Demon Hunter” Funko Pop designs, which feature the fan-favorite idols in collectible, 3.75-inch vinyl figurine form.\n",

Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) has to deal with being fired by Cami (Demi Moore), Cooper (Jacob Lofland) has to beat a murder charge and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) has to learn a lesson — all of which wrap up in a satisfying way. Join us for one last trip to Texas this season with the recap below.\n\t\n\n\nI’m not trying to be indelicate, but Tommy and his family have to move out of this company house now that he’s fired, right?\n“For trying to run the company like a business, instead of a memento or a dream or whatever the hell motivates her” — Tommy is really breaking it down, much like the fans who have been yelling at their TV.\nDale (James Jordan) is a real one for his loyalty. Respect!\nTommy, just let T.L. (Sam Elliott) enjoy his (very!) young companion (Francesca Xuereb).\n“She ain’t gonna fire you. She could do that over the phone.” Ouch, Tommy!\nDamn, Gallino (Andy Garcia) has a nice house. I guess that happens when you’re a drug kingpin!\nCan’t they clean up Ariana (Paulina Chávez) and her wounds better?\nAww, cute baby!\nOh, Paigyn (Bobbi Salvör Menuez) is back!\nAinsley (Michelle Randolph) never had to work out in high school?\nOh, huh … Paigyn is actually smart and nice …\n“He was no longer a threat.” Um, Johnny (Mike Harkins) seemed very threatening! Cooper neutralized the situation and detained the rapist. End of discussion.\nJohnny died? Hooray!\nCalling Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) is smart! She must know some sharks.\nOh, damn, Rebecca is already on it.\nHell yeah, Ariana — let these cops have the business!\n“Who the fuck did he murder?” Tommy, understandably confused.\nOK, I do like the friendship between Angela (Ali Larter) and Bella (Stefania Spampinato).\nEek, Angela is going to murder Tommy.\nOh, OK — crisis quickly averted.\nWow, how did Tommy completely avoid that car crash?!? Very “Final Destination”!\n“Everyone with a law degree in the room raise their hand. Oh, it’s just me?” Give Rebecca a spinoff!\nJesus, Rebecca is amazing. I’m terrified! And … in love?\nOK, Ainsley, good on you for standing up for what is right.\nAww, Ainsley is becoming friends with Paigyn. I like this sweet turnaround!\nWow! I’ve often made fun of Nate (Colm Feore) for being the fun police, but I didn’t realize his swag as he flew to Cami’s office just to quit. What a good chess move.\nTommy’s letting his pride get to him — is he going to have a heart attack, too?\nGallino vs. Tommy: It’s a big business showdown!\nTommy, with his tail between his legs, is an odd look. But he got the money, so great — even though it’s from his frenemy.\n“It’s like I’m looking in the mirror.” Oof, Gallino hit Tommy hard.\nDamn, so much has happened in one day. The sun is still out!\nJohnny actually died of a heart attack?!? What the hell?\nBilly Bob is eating up this scene … nom nom nom …\nUh oh, this aspirin seems like foreshadowing …\nGlad we’re not leaving this murder charge as a cliffhanger until next season.\nWhy does Tommy have so many strippers in his phone?\nAww, cute. I love this new oil company.\nLong live CTT Oil Exportation (and Cattle)!\nOof, dour end to the season, Tommy.\nOK, good last negotiation with God.\n\n\n\n\tUntil next season, “Landman” nation! In the meantime, share in the comments below if you think CTT will be a win or a disaster.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOne More Saturday Night: Bobby Weir Remembered at San Francisco ‘Homecoming’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGene Hackman’s 53-Acre New Mexico Estate Just Listed for $6.3 Million\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTrinidad Chambliss Sues NCAA in Test of Medical Waiver System\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tJust hours after landing from Los Angeles, where he attended the Golden Globes that saw two Croisette alumni – “Sentimental Value” and “The Secret Agent” — take home major awards, Cannes Film Festival chief Thierry Frémaux made it straight to landmark 18th century restaurant Lapérouse for Variety’s Paris dinner where he was celebrated as guest of honor.\n\n\tThe intimate dinner, which was co-organized by Variety and Laperouse owners Benjamin and Emilie Patou, in partnership with Elsa Huisman’s Cabinet 111, brought together Cannes royalty and French A-listers, including Vincent Lindon (“Titane”); Isabelle Huppert (“The Richest Woman in the World”) who will next be seen in Asghar Farhadi’s “Parallel Tales;” as well as Lea Seydoux (“Dune: Part 2”) who stars in Arthur Harari’s (“Anatomy of a Fall”) next film “The Unknown;” and Gilles Lellouche (“Beating Hearts”) who plays French resistant Jean Moulin in Laszlo Nemes’ upcoming film. \n\t\n\n\tThe starry night heated up a few more notches when filmmaker Josh Safdie joined the French cinema dinner straight from an AMPAS screening for “Marty Suprême,” the awards-season breakout that just scored a Golden Globe win for Timothée Chalamet.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t(Photo courtesy of Sebastien Cauchon)\n\n\tSafdie arrived in high spirits alongside “Marty Supreme” costume designer Miyako Bellizzi (who also worked on “Uncut Gems” and “Good Time”), as well as French distributor Victor Hadida, publicist Katherine Rowe and A24 Films’ Millen Lemma. He immediately dived into the room’s French mix, and got into long and passionate conversations with Frémaux and Huppert, before branching out to chat about the making of “Marty Supreme” and Chalamet’s hardcore commitment to the part of table tennis champ Marty Reisman with Anna Marsh, CEO of Studiocanal, and Élisabeth d’Arvieu, whose Mediawan Pictures recently celebrated a four-Golden Globe haul for Plan B’s “Adolescence.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety’s third dinner at Laperouse, the event paid tribute to Cannes’ role in showcasing international gems and shaping global awards narrative, as many Cannes films, including “Sentimental Value,” “The Secret Agent,” “Sirat,” “It Was Just an Accident” and “Arco,” are garnering solid buzz in the Oscar race. The presence of Safdie, meanwhile, highlighted the deepening bond between European cinema and U.S. prestige filmmaking.\n\n\tThe dinner also gathered rising French talent such as Anamaria Vartolomei (“Mickey 17”) who stars in Pathé’s upcoming “De Gaulle” saga; Rebecca Marder whose latest film “The Stranger” won the Lumiere Award for best film; filmmaker and actor Hafsia Herzi whose directorial outing “The Little Sister” won best actress at Cannes (for Nadia Melliti); filmmaker Cedric Kahn (“Le procès Goldman”); Thierry Klifa, whose movie “The Richest Woman in the World” marks its leading actress Huppert’s biggest hit in decades, having sold nearly sold 1 million admissions; producers Hugo Selignac (“Beating Hearts”), who recently wrapped Quentin Dupieux’s “Full Phil” starring Woody Harrelson and Kristen Stewart; Dimitri Rassam (“The Count of Monte Cristo”) and Laila Tahar, who are preparing the shoot of Ladj Ly’s “Black Devil; Olivier Delbosc, whose film “The Wizard of the Kremlin” starring Jude Law and Paul Dano competed at Venice; and Haut et Court’s co-founders Caroline Benjo and Carole Scotta, who distributed “The Richest Woman in the World” in France.\n\n\tAlso in attendance were Cecile Felsenberg, co-founder of leading talent agency UBBA; Carrousel Pictures’ head Cecile Gaget; producers Anne-Dominique Toussaint (“Capernaum”); Benjamin Elalouf (“Le procès Goldman”) and filmmaker-screenwriter Noé Debré (“Le dernier des juifs”); Julie Billy (“The Little Sister”); Johanna Nahon (“Les filles desir”); investment banker Gregoire Chertok; author and screenwriter Anne Berest (“A Private Life”); awards strategist Sebastien Cauchon; Cannes’ head of protocol Laurence Churlaud; and “Anatomy of a Fall” producer Marie-Ange Luciani.\n\n\tAlong with a choice of cocktails, wines and champagne, guests were treated with a fresh and sophisticated meal that included a marinated sea bass carpaccio with basil oil, tagliatelle pasta with artichokes and truffle shavings and for desert, a vacherin with pear and yuzu. \n\t\n\n\tOwned by Patou and Antoine Arnault, Laperouse first opened its doors in 1766 and became a favorite refuge for the Parisian intelligentsia, including philosophers, novelists, artists and eventually filmmakers who would flock the numerous salons lushly decorated with red velvet, filled with paintings, ornate moldings and crystal chandeliers. Tastefully revamped a few years ago by Dior Maison head Cordelia de Castellane, Laperouse was mentioned by Marcel Proust in his iconic novel “In Search of Lost Time,” and served as a backdrop in Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris.”\n\n\t(Photos by Joseph de Vismes) \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCedric Kahn, Hugo Selignac, Gilles Lellouche\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPathe’s Ardavan Safaee, Cabinet 111’s Elsa huisman and Lea Seydoux \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnamaria Vartolomei\n\t\n\n\n",

Despite the pain, he stayed in the game and fired a pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that fell incomplete but drew a crucial pass interference flag.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          On the second-to-last play, Nix's right ankle twisted awkwardly while kneeling to stop the clock. Cameras caught him wincing, slowly standing up, and walking gingerly to the sideline with his hands on his hips.\n      \n    \n          Not long after, Adam Schefter confirmed Nix fractured a bone in the ankle and is scheduled for surgery Tuesday in Alabama.\n      \n    \n          Broncos head coach Sean Payton didn’t hold back in praising his QB, saying ... Nix is a tough cookie.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Denver Broncos\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tOscar-winner Tom Hanks is set to portray President Abraham Lincoln in the upcoming film adaptation of “Lincoln in the Bardo” from Starburns Industries.\n\n\tIn addition to starring as the 16th U.S. President, Hanks will also produce the project, based on George Saunders’ bestselling novel, via his Playtone label with partner Gary Goetzman. Saunders is adapting the novel with Oscar-nominated filmmaker Duke Johnson (“Anomalisa”) set to direct and produce. \n\t\n\n\tThis is far from Hanks’ first time portraying a real-life figure, with his filmography ranging from astronaut Jim Lovel (“Apollo 13”) to hero pilot Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger (“Sully”), as well as Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee (“The Post”), Fred Rodgers (“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”) and Walt Disney (“Saving Mr. Banks”), but it is the actor’s first time portraying a U.S. President. [Note: Hanks narrated and hosted the 2013 docudrama,”Killing Lincoln,” and the two are distant relatives on Lincoln’s maternal side.]\n\n\n\tWhile President Lincoln’s life — leading the country through the Civil War and abolishing slavery, as in Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln,” for which Daniel Day Lewis won the best actor Oscar — and his 1865 assassination are more often explored in cinema and other forms of media, “Lincoln in the Bardo” centers on Lincoln’s relationship with his recently deceased 11-year-old son. To capture one of the most intimate aspects of the politican’s life, the production will blend stop-motion animation and live-action to explore “themes of love, empathy and human capacity in the face of unimaginable grief” via an ensemble of characters, “both living and dead, historical and invented.” \n\t\n\n\tJohnson, Paul Young and Devon Young Rabinowitz are producing for Starburns Industries, with the project as the first to go into production since the studio announced its film fund. Steven Shareshian, Aaron Mitchell and Saunders will serve as executive producers. Production will take place in London. \n\n\tHanks is repped by CAA and Greenberg Glusker. Deadline first reported his involvement in the project.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe iconic orc statue that lives at the center of Blizzard Entertainment’s Irvine campus is standing a little taller these days as the brand behind “World of Warcraft,” “Diablo,” “Hearthstone” and “Overwatch” builds to its 35th anniversary. \n\n\tSitting in her office above the Microsoft-owned brand’s campus on Jan. 20, Blizzard Entertainment president Johanna Faries told Variety that the slew of announcements that would be revealed the following week in Blizzard’s big “Showcase” presentations were “the amalgamation of so much hard work and collaboration across everyone at Blizzard.” “And to me, that, in and of itself, is such a point of pride,” Faries said.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a moment of hard-fought-for pride for Blizzard, a video game publisher that’s managed to maintain its beloved status with exuberant fans despite multiple controversial changes in leadership, a $35 million settlement over misconduct accusations, and a reputation for a “frat boy” workplace culture.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Blizzard Entertainment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Blizzard Entertainment\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The way that the game teams have come together to ladder up into something bigger that reflects the power of Blizzard — it’s easy to say, it’s incredibly hard to do,” said Faries, who joined Blizzard as president in 2024, following two years as general manager of the “Call of Duty” franchise at sister company Activision and more than 10 years in business and marketing exec roles at the NFL. “And the way that the simple symphony orchestra that is Blizzard has come together, it’s a showcase of an immense amount of work, an immense amount of creative collaboration. And it just makes me so excited to come to work every day, to be able to do this together in that way.”\n\t\n\n\tBut the major news revealed out of Blizzard’s showcase presentations — including the rebranding of “Overwatch 2” to “Overwatch” as it debuts a year-long narrative arc, “World of Warcraft’s” deep expansion into in-game housing, “Diablo’s” 30th-anniversary expansion plans — is not the peak of the anniversary celebration, but the start of the climb. What Faries and her team are really building toward is the triumphant return for BlizzCon this September, which will mark the first version of the event under Microsoft ownership after more than two years off.\n\n\t“I’ve heard this from many of the teams that what we’re going to announce across ‘WoW,’ ‘Diablo,’ ‘Overwatch,’ even ‘Hearthstone’ and many others, just in this moment in time for Showcase, much of that would have been what we would have put on the main stage as an announcement at BlizzCon, at something of that caliber,” Faries said. “So I’m hopeful that not only do we drum up an enormous amount of excitement in the here and now, but that also signals how confident we are in the belief that 2026 represents a huge, banner year for Blizzard — because Blizzcon only has more behind the curtain that we’re excited to share. So hopefully players really see that and recognize, wow, if Blizzard’s coming this big in this moment of time, imagine what they might be also staging for us in September.”\n\n\tWhile Faries hypes up just how much she’s not overhyping BlizzCon 2026, she’s also focused on what comes after that big in-person experience and what the next 35 years are supposed to look like. A big part of that is decided on the ground in Irvine, where Blizzard is cultivating its existing, homegrown talent. It’s a mission Faries is charged with just as longtime Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer exits and CoreAI exec Asha Sharma takes over and concerns about consistency arise.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Diablo IV”/Blizzard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlizzard\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“If you go into my office and look at the art on the walls, you’ll see how much it helps that we have real icons and leaders in the artist community,” Faries said. “We have, I would argue, the greatest artists in all of gaming and entertainment. And so their network gives us the leg up. They’re constantly thinking about, how do we recruit? How do we train up upcoming talent to continue to maintain the high-standard bar that we’re known for? Our players know there’s a Blizzard polish. There’s a Blizzard caliber for our artistry that stands out among all the rest, and we’re going to continue to make sure that that’s something we prioritize.”\n\t\n\n\tWith the artist legacy a firm part of its past, Faries wants to make expanding the mediums that art is showcased in part of Blizzard’s future. \n\n\t“We talk a lot about this. We’re not Blizzard Games, we’re Blizzard Entertainment. We want to be able to show up on every screen imaginable,” Faries said. “We want to be able to create new fans who may not have been with us for the past 35 years. How we continue to engage Hollywood or film and TV in bigger ways is going to be, in the near term, probably a big part of that recipe. We also play in music. We also play in non-traditional spaces, beyond gaming, certainly.”\n\n\tFaries added: “I would confidently say that every one of our IPs could be some of the greatest linear media experiences that the world could experience. So more to come on the specifics. What I will say is that there are highly generative, proactive, near-term discussions across almost every one of our worlds right now, with respect to what can we do, what format works, who’s the right team to take that to new audiences in a high caliber way.”\n\n\tAmong the announcements made during Blizzard’s series of “Showcase” presentations was a revamp for the nearly 10-year-old “Overwatch” franchise with a big narrative expansion. That move came just as Wildlight Entertainment was set to debut its “Overwatch 2” competitor, “Highguard.” In the weeks since, “Highguard” has struggled significantly, while “Overwatch 2” fans have had widely positive reactions to the ambitious roadmap for “Overwatch,” despite a few jokes poked at the rebranding.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Overwatch”/Blizzard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlizzard\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s coming to fruition after a couple of years of a strong conversation about, what is a real pivot going to look like?” Faries said. “And how are we going to make sure that it feels genuine, it feels deep, it feels rich, in all the ways that our players are going to want to experience these new characters? I will also say, and I hope that the team would say it as well, competition is a good thing. It keeps us on our toes. It keeps us adapting. It forces us sometimes to adapt and go quicker in spaces.”\n\n\t“Overwatch’s” new update kicked off with an intense cinematic trailer that the team already knows has once again stirred up conversations about that IP in particular being adapted for TV or film.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s something that we see signaled to us very consistently,” “Overwatch” general manager Walter Kong told Variety. “So whenever we put out any type of lore, including a cinematic thesis, there is a very common expression of, I wish we could have more of this, I wish that we could enjoy these stories. So when I took on the role of franchise GM, these future opportunities and possibilities were something that pushed me to say yes, yes, yes, because I think we have delivered on the game, but there’s still so much on the broader franchise experience that I wanted to bring to players and fans.”\n\n\tAmong “Diablo’s” big teases, including the release of the first update for “Diablo II” in 25 years, “Diablo IV” executive producer and vice president Gavian Whishaw was particularly proud of how in the weeds his team is getting with the features in their upcoming “Lord of Hatred” update. \n\n\t“The paladin that we’re going to release with the expansion has an expanded skill tree,” Whishaw told Variety. “And this is one of the things that players have been asking us for for a while. It’s an extremely complex system. The joke is that we have a ‘skill twig,’ and they would like a tree, so we’re giving them a tree in the expansion and players have way more choices in the paladin skills. The thing that we’ve also done is we’ve gone back and we’ve done every other class as well. So we’re hoping we can be like — OK, you wanted the tree, here’s the tree for everybody.”\n\n\tAnd if deep updates to its current game are what “Diablo” had to share recently, is news on a new title coming at BlizzCon?\n\n\t“It’s kind of complicated when you’re talking about titles that have been around for 20 years and people are still dedicated to and still playing and still going to get excited about new content,” Whishaw said. “I’ll say at a high level, I think over 30 years of ‘Diablo,’ we’ve done five titles. So I would hope that over the next 30 years we do a few more than that, maybe we get some out faster.”\n\n\tThe “World of Warcraft” team, led by executive producer and vice president Holly Longdale, prioritized the game’s long-awaited housing update in its Showcase, and the priority of making the game as accessible to the staple “WoW” player as to larger casual community.\n\n\t“There are many of us on the team that are fans of other games, and ‘The Sims’ being one of them, where we look at it and go, here’s some things the community finds frustrating, and if we can find a way to allow it and support it, then we will continually lower barriers for anybody who wants to do it and do it the way they want to do it,” Longdale said. \n\t\n\n\t“There’s two sides to this. One of the most fun ones was when, through a bug, players discovered that they could make their house float above the landscape. We had a fix in place, and we were about to patch it, and the team just went, like, why are we fixing this? They’re making awesome stuff, and isn’t that the purpose? And then there’s some things that we’re like, oh, no, you should not be able to. That is one of the beautiful things about user-generated content is that once it’s out there, just like ‘World of Warcraft’ in general, they own it, and then it’s our job to support it and put some guardrails where they’re needed.”\n\n\tLongdale says the journey to housing has been “iterative and involved a lot of deeper discussions from the beginning.” “And it got slowly over time less restrictive, less restrictive, less restrictive,” she said. “And then looking at problems like, well, why do we want raiders to care about housing? It’s like, yeah, we want them to care — but they’re not required to care. So making sure that every game loop and audience has some representation, but anyone can do it and participate.”\n\n\tBlizzard Entertainment as a whole is now trying to strike that balance between giving its 35-year-old brand the room to grow and introduce new things to draw in new audiences and keep the business thriving, while not pushing away its stalwarts.\n\n\t“We believe we have the best IP in entertainment,” Faries said. “We believe we have some of the greatest gaming talent the world’s ever known. We are going to be as good as our ability to collaborate across these functions and putting together the playbook internally to brainstorm as one, have strong strategic conversations and planning cycles as one, and to align against a big vision that we have for the whole company, in addition to our individual universes and games.”\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 22: Ryan Coogler attends the EE BAFTA Film Awards 2026 at The Royal Festival Hall on February 22, 2026 in London, England. (Photo by Gareth Cattermole/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTA)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGareth Cattermole/BAFTA/Getty Im\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tOscars Commentary (Updated: Feb. 23, 2026): The 79th BAFTA Awards didn’t tidy up the Oscar race so much as crack it open, and with Academy voting beginning Thursday, Feb. 26, the timing couldn’t be more pronounced.\n\n\tOn paper, Paul Thomas Anderson’s political epic “One Battle After Another” looks like the kind of haul that ends arguments, taking best film, director, adapted screenplay, supporting actor for Sean Penn, cinematography and editing. In practice, those potential craft statues matter as much as the top prizes because they signal broad, branch-to-branch strength. Still, if you’re in a position to listen to some of the industry chatter, you know a night like this doesn’t automatically “lock it up.”\n\n\tSince the Oscars expanded the best picture field in 2009, BAFTA’s best film winner has matched the Academy’s top prize seven times in 16 years: “The Hurt Locker” (2009), “The King’s Speech” (2010), “The Artist” (2011), “Argo” (2012), “12 Years a Slave” (2013), “Nomadland” (2020) and “Oppenheimer” (2023). BAFTA is determined by a plurality voting system, while the Oscars use a preferential ballot for best picture. The closest precursor comp is the Producers Guild of America, which the same Oscars system and announces its winners Saturday, Feb. 28, one day before the Actor Awards (formerly the SAG Awards).\n\n\tBAFTA also handed oxygen to the challenger that needed it most. Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” won original screenplay, supporting actress for Wunmi Mosaku and original score. In Oscar terms, that’s momentum in categories that can help a best picture contender feel less like a critics’ favorite and more like a broad coalition — if it can convert the buzz into more above-the-line support.\n\n\tAnd then came the curveball that rewrites the narrative voters carry into their ballots: Timothée Chalamet lost leading actor to Robert Aramayo for “I Swear.” The catch is that “I Swear” won’t be Oscar-eligible until next year, making the result feel less like a clean precursor. Either way, it makes the season’s aura of presumed “inevitability” — feel less, inevitable.\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting will take place from Feb. 26 to Mar. 5. Updated Oscar projections are below. The penultimate updates will drop on Thursday when voting opens. The final picks will be revealed Thursday, March 12. Until then, may your predictions be ever in your favor.\n\n\tThe 98th Oscars will be held March 15 and will air on ABC, hosted by Conan O’Brien.\n\n\tProjected winner leaders (films): “Sinners” (6), “One Battle After Another” (4); “Frankenstein” (3); “KPop Demon Hunters” (2)\n\n\tProjected winner leaders (studios): Warner Bros. (11), Netflix (7)\n\n\t*** = PREDICTED WINNER(All predicted nominees listed below are in alphabetical order)\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Picture\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Bugonia” (Focus Features)Ed Guiney & Andrew Lowe, Yorgos Lanthimos, Emma Stone and Lars Knudsen“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)Chad Oman, Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Joseph Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer“Frankenstein” (Netflix)Guillermo del Toro, J.

The official logline for the pilot states, “Two highly decorated but vastly different FBI agents form an unlikely bond when they are assigned to a long-shuttered division devoted to cases involving unexplained phenomena.” \n\t\n\n\tCoogler will write, direct, and executive produce the pilot under his Proximity Media banner. Jennifer Yale (“The Copenhagen Test,” “Your Friends & Neighbors) will serve as showrunner and executive producer. Sev Ohanian and Zinzi Coogler of Proximity will also executive produce along with original “X-Files” creator Chris Carter. Simone Harris of Proximity will co-executive produce. The pilot hails from Onyx Collective and 20th Television. Coogler and Proximity are currently under a TV overall deal with Disney.\n\n\n\tNews of Coogler’s take on the beloved sci-fi procedural first emerged in 2023, when Carter revealed that Coogler had contacted him about rebooting the series with a diverse cast. There has been no official news on the project since, though Coogler has teased work on the series in interviews since. \n\n\t“Like my relationship with ‘Rocky’ with my dad, ‘The X-Files’ is one of those things with my mom,” Coogler told Variety in October 2025. “My mom means the world to me…so this is a big one for me. I want to do right by her and the fans. My mom has read some of the stuff I wrote for it. She’s fired up.”\n\t\n\n\tThis will be the first ever reboot of “The X-Files” but not the first time that the show has returned since it originally went off the air in 2001 after nine seasons. Fox revived the series for two more seasons in 2016 and 2018 with Carter and original series stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny returning in their roles as Dr. Dana Scully and Fox Mulder. There have also been two “X-Files” movies — 1998’s “The X-Files,” followed by “The X-Files: I Want to Believe” in 2008. \n\n\tAt this time, neither Anderson nor Duchovny are attached to Coogler’s pilot. \n\n\tDeadwyler is best known for her roles in films like “The Harder They Fall,” “Till,” and “Carry-On.” She has also played memorable parts in shows like “Atlanta,” “The Bear,” and “Station Eleven,” with appearances in other series like “P-Valley,” “From Scratch,” and “Greenleaf.” \n\n\tCoogler has established himself as one of the most in-demand and celebrated filmmakers of his time. He is currently making the awards show rounds with “Sinners,” which he wrote, directed, and produced. The film recently set a new Oscars record with 16 nominations, the most for any single film in one year. Coogler is up for best director and best original screenplay, while the film itself is up for best picture. Coogler most recently made history by becoming the first Black person to win a BAFTA Award for best original screenplay. \n\n\tCoogler’s other film credits the two “Black Panther” films for Marvel, the “Creed” franchise, and “Fruitvale Station.” Coogler was also a producer on the Oscar-winning film “Judas and the Black Messiah.” \n\n\tCoogler is repped by WME, M88, The Lede Company, and Cohen & Gardner. Deadwyler is repped by Paradigm Talent Agency, Play Management, and Ziffren Brittenham. Carter is repped by CAA and Gang Tyre. Yale is repped by CAA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners, and Hansen Jacobson. \n",

    "body": "\n\tBroadway will remain closed on Monday amid the major winter storm that brought heavy snowfall to New York City.\n\n\tIt’s the second consecutive evening of closures after venues on the Great White Way (a particularly apt nickname for the theater district during a blizzard) dimmed their lights early on Sunday in an effort to curb travel ahead of the dangerous weather conditions. Sunday afternoon matinees — with curtain times of 3 p.m. or earlier — proceeded as scheduled.\n\t\n\n\tMonday is traditionally a dark day for Broadway, providing a period of respite for performers after packed weekend schedules. Only five productions — “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” which currently has Tom Felton reprising his role as Draco Malfoy; Chicago,” featuring “Secret Life of Mormon Wives” and “Dancing With the Stars” breakout Whitney Leavitt as Roxie Hart; “Every Brilliant Thing” starring Daniel Radcliffe; a flashy “The Great Gatsby” adaptation; and upbeat historical drama “Six” — will be affected by Monday evening’s cancelations.\n\n\n\t“Due to the continuing impacts from the blizzard and local travel restrictions still in place, Broadway theatre owners and producers have come to the consensus that performances tonight (Monday, February 23) will be canceled,” the Broadway League, which represents theater owners and producers, said in a statement.\n\n\tClosures on Broadway are rare given the enormous costs associated with missing a performance. However, the New York City area has received over a foot of snow and remains under a state of emergency due to intense snowfall and powerful winds. Blizzard conditions are expected to continue through Monday night.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPer its title, the NBC sitcom “The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins” is a comeback story, but it’s also a reunion. Comedian Tracy Morgan has produced a wide-ranging body of work since his breakout on “Saturday Night Live” at the turn of the millennium — and, more dramatically, since sustaining severe injuries in a New Jersey traffic collision in 2014. But his most iconic role remains, if not himself, then a part directly adjacent to his own persona: Tracy Jordan, the chaotic yet lovable co-lead of Tina Fey’s meta entertainment satire “30 Rock.” For seven seasons, Morgan balanced deep-cut cultural references and cracks about corporate mergers with a needed dose of anarchy, while Fey and her writers formed a knack for channeling Morgan’s ebullient energy into absurd, instantly iconic bits like “Werewolf Bar Mitzvah” or the concept of an EGOT.\n\t\n\n\t“Reggie Dinkins” is co-created by Robert Carlock and Sam Means, two longtime staples of the broader universe one could call Feyworld. (Fey herself serves as an executive producer, as does Morgan.) Carlock has worked with Fey since their time at “SNL,” where they also overlapped with Morgan; Means did stints on “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Great News” in addition to “30 Rock”; more familiar names, like “Girls5Eva” creator Meredith Scardino, pop up in the credits as the 10-episode first season moves briskly along. Although Fey’s TV adaptation of Alan Alda’s “The Four Seasons” broke from these shows’ otherwise consistent MO with decidedly mixed results, “Reggie Dinkins” is a return to form, both in style and quality. That’s great news for viewers, but also for Morgan, who finally gets a character equal to Tracy Jordan in channeling his particular charisma. And this time, his name — or rather, Reggie’s — is on the door.\n\t\n\n\tLike many single-camera network comedies, “Reggie Dinkins” is a mockumentary. But unlike many shows that use the framing device as a given in a post-“The Office” world without an in-text explanation of the project in progress, á la “Modern Family” or “Abbott Elementary,” “Reggie Dinkins” makes filmmaking part of the plot. (As well as the TV trend: one character says he’s been practicing his Jim Halpert face for mugging to the camera.) Morgan’s Reggie Dinkins is a former NFL star who ended his career — and lost the New York Jets the Super Bowl — by betting on his own games, an act he likens to working for tips. Thanks to Reggie’s ex-wife and current business manager Monica (Erika Alexander, a seasoned pro playing a seasoned pro), Reggie is just fine financially. But he wants his legacy to be more than his mistakes, so he hires Oscar-winning documentarian Arthur Tobin (Daniel Radcliffe, who seems to have taken a liking to TV comedy after “Miracle Workers”) to make a movie about his quest to join the league’s Hall of Fame.\n\n\tArthur himself has fallen on hard times, taking a day job at the University of Maryland Center for Documentary, MMA and Pornography after a public meltdown on a commercial set and making Reggie’s story something he can relate to. In its premiere, “Reggie Dinkins” lightly pokes fun at the kind of feather-light, celebrity-commissioned films Arthur feels he’s demeaning himself to direct, with Reggie spouting platitudes like “a son is just a homie you make” while refusing to open up about his actual feelings. And to the extent that “Reggie Dinkins” is conceptually flawed, it’s that the show falls into this trap a bit itself. Emphasizing Reggie’s financial security, good relationship with his teenage son Carmelo (Jalyn Hall) and the mutual respect between Monica and Reggie’s young influencer fiancée Brina (Precious Way, hilarious) makes the setup gentle to a fault, sanding down potential edges and giving away opportunities to dig into topical issues like CTE, athletes’ post-retirement security and the new ubiquity of sports gambling. Based on “Reggie Dinkins,” you’d never know that Reggie’s life-altering scandal is now dangerously close to the new norm. \n\n\tBut there are also benefits to this trade-off, chief among them a cast with chemistry in spades and a proudly goofy, punchline-a-minute pace that’s like a balm to those of us who love the Fey-Carlock oeuvre, even deep cuts like the Peacock revival of “Saved by the Bell.” With his dweeby air, pretensions and position at the helm of an active production, Arthur is the Liz Lemon of this setup, but with the emphases reversed. “Reggie Dinkins” takes evident pleasure in tossing Radcliffe curveballs like belting out the Beatles, dressing in full camouflage so Arthur can embed himself and being insulted as an “Elijah Wood lookin’ ass bitch,” all of which the actor — now 15 years into building his post-Potter image as a game, adventurous performer — handles capably. As Arthur’s muse, Morgan naturally gives Reggie a sweetness and naiveté that makes his redemption easy to root for, even with questionable logic like “Fools run errands all the time; that’s why Wawa sells sushi!” He’s good enough to make you wish “Reggie Dinkins” would test its hero’s likability a bit more, if only because Morgan is clearly up to the challenge.\n\t\n\n\tDespite the long shadows of Tracy, Liz and even Michael Sheen’s stuffy Brit Wesley Snipes, “Reggie Dinkins” is not merely a collection of reheated tropes from its creative teams’ back catalog. (Though to call Brina, who happily plugs a Takis-Tampax collab and threatens to go on a trashy reality show called “Engagement Peninsula” when Reggie drags his feet on wedding planning, the show’s Jenna Maroney is to pay her the highest of compliments.) Alexander’s warmth and evident savvy make her a welcome addition to the repertory company, while Bobby Moynihan plays Reggie’s best friend, roommate and former teammate Rusty with full-body commitment to the gloriously stupid bit. Literally: the oafish Rusty gets himself stuck in a washing machine, a predicament in which the rigorously ethical Arthur refuses to intervene.\n\n\tWatching “Reggie Dinkins” cohere into an ensemble, you can feel the show swap out the trenchant questions about celebrity and storytelling raised by its pilot for the comforting consistency of a ragtag gang scrambling to stay afloat, but never at true risk of sinking. Should the show become a long-running concern, such points of emphasis will justify themselves. More seasons would also provide an opportunity to fill in the gaps. Once he’s risen from the ashes, maybe Reggie Dinkins can finally have it all. \n\n\tThe first two episodes of “The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins” will air on NBC on Feb. 23 at 8 p.m. ET, with remaining episodes airing weekly on Mondays at 8:30pm ET and streaming the next day on Peacock.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe final numbers are in for fall, and CBS’ “Tracker” continues its winning streak — leading the Eye’s dominance among broadcast networks when both linear and 35 days of streaming viewership of non-sports series fare is tallied.\n\n\tOf course, add the streamers to the mix, and the final season of “Stranger Things” was no match for the competition: The Netflix series dominated the fall, with an average of 32.86 million viewers. That was followed by Netflix’s blockbuster docuseries “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” (20.64 million) and Paramount+’s surging “Landman” (19.64 million). “Tracker” was next, with 16.65 million — making it tops among broadcast series — followed closely by ABC’s “High Potential” (16.07 million).\n\t\n\n\tCBS, which returns its schedule with new originals this week (now that the Olympics competition has wrapped on NBC), led the fall top ten among broadcast with eight shows (“Tracker,” “Matlock,” “Sheriff Country,” “Ghosts,” “60 Minutes,” “Boston Blue,” “NCIS,” “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage”) — with “Sheriff Country” and “Boston Blue” as the fall’s top two most-watched new series in broadcast. The Eye net also boasted nine of the top 20 series among both linear and streaming.\n\n\n\tStreaming is continuing to help expand eyeballs for broadcast fare: “Tracker,” for example, averaged 11.4 million viewers on linear, then another 5.2 million in streaming. “High Potential” was nearly a 50/50 split: 8.3 million viewers on linear, and 7.8 million on streaming. “Abbott Elementary” actually attracts more viewers in streaming on Hulu (4.4 million) than on ABC linear (3.8 million).\n\t\n\n\tThese lists don’t include sports, of course, which would add even more broadcast heft to the rankers. But even without sports, the broadcast networks did quite well in the fall. Now, on to midseason — where several additional high performers, like ABC’s “Will Trent” and “The Rookie,” will be added to the mix too. \n\n\tHere are the fall 2025 rankers:\n\t\n\t\tFall 2025 Multiplatform 35-Day Ranker: Broadcast+Streaming Originals\t\nRankTitle (Network/SVOD)Total 35-Day Viewing1.Stranger Things (Netflix)32.86 million2.Sean Combs: The Reckoning (Netflix)20.64 million3.Landman (Paramount+)19.64 million4.Tracker (CBS)16.65 million5.High Potential (ABC)16.07 million6.Fallout (Prime Video)14.85 million7.Monster: The Ed Gein Story (Netflix)13.36 million8.The Beast in Me (Netflix)12.74 million9.Matlock (CBS)12.21 million10.Sheriff Country (CBS)11.09 million11.Ghosts (CBS)10.59 million12.60 Minutes (CBS)10.27 million13.Boston Blue (CBS)10.26 million14.NCIS (CBS)10.12 million15.Chicago Fire (NBC)10.07 million16.Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage (CBS)9.89 million17.Dancing With the Stars (ABC)9.81 million18.Wayward (Netflix)9.74 million19.Elsbeth (CBS)9.50 million20.Nobody Wants This (Netflix)9.40 million\n\n\tSource: Source: Nielsen Panel+ Big Data P2+ Prime AA, L+35, 9/14/2025-1/04/2026 + Nielsen SCR, 35-Day Total Flight for streaming.

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift fans kept “hope-alite” alive that “Opalite” would become her 14th No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, even though it faced some competitive headwinds in reaching the summit. The infectious bop came through, reaching the top in this, its 20th week on the chart, and moving Swift just a little bit closer to an all-time record.\n\n\tThirteen has traditionally been Swift’s lucky number, but so is 14. (And so will be 15, and so on.) With 14 career No. 1s, she now ties Rihanna for the most Hot 100 leaders in the history of the chart. Who’s ahead of her? Only the Beatles, with 20 No. 1s, and Mariah Carey, with 19 — neither of those presenting anything like an insurmountable mark for someone as prolific as Swift.\n\t\n\n\t“Opalite” follows “The Fate of Ophelia” as her second No. 1 from the album “The Life of a Showgirl.” “Ophelia” spent 10 weeks at No. 1. “Opalite” previously debuted at No. 2, during the week of the album’s release, and was always destined to register as the album’s second-most-popular track. Since then, it had spent several weeks in the top 10 and was a mainstay of the top 20, based primarily on streaming demand. But it was not officially released as a single until the music video dropped on Feb. 6. \n\n\n\tLast week would have seemed like a prime time for “Opalite” to top the chart, based on all those immediate video streams. But it was kept out of a top position by the huge resurgence of Bad Bunny’s catalog following his Super Bowl halftime appearance, among other factors. Perhaps seeing the Bad Bunny tsunami coming during that time frame, the biggest push for singles sales was held back a week and came during this latest chart period.\n\t\n\n\tUbiquitous for four months now among fans, the song had already peaked some time ago on Billboard’s streaming chart; it falls to No. 17 on that register this week. So making it to No. 1 on the Hot 100 this week was much more reliant on increased radio play as well as singles sales.\n\n\tThe radio airplay impressions for “Opalite” were up 17% this week, to 58.9 million, after already taking a leap last week. The most substantial gain, though, was in sales. The single sold 168,00 copies this week, up 2,290%. Of those 168,000, Billboard and Luminate report, 144,000 were physical copies, representing a mix of one vinyl and six CD variants. Some of those editions had gone on sale in January but did not count toward her tally till they shipped during this mid-February time frame.\n\n\tThe sales tally for the single was impressive enough that Billboard reported it was the highly weekly sales for any song since Jason Aldean’s “Try That in a Small Town” went viral and sold 175,000 downloads in a single week in August 2023.\n\n\tThe number of streams for “Opalite” in this time frame was 11.4 million, down 20% from the week before.\n\n\tSwift probably would have had an easier path to hitting No. 1 a week earlier if Billboard had not recently instituted a rule change. The publication altered its playbook so that free YouTube streams no longer count in the calculation of a hit. That was presumably one reason why Swift gave Apple Music and Spotify Premium a two-day exclusive on the “Opalite” video, to redirect fans to paid services whose totals still count toward the charts. Regardless, it all worked out for her, even if there was a week of delayed gratification for Swifties to enjoy their heroine getting her latest chart triumph.\n\n\tNashville has a very strong presence at the top of the Hot 100 this week, if you count Swift, and you should, as a longtime mainstay and still a part-time resident. Following the former country queen at No. 1 is current country star Ella Langley at No. 2, as her smash “Choosin’ Texas” — which recently peaked at the top of the chart, then took a dip — rose two spots from its No. 4 position last week.\n\n\tFollowing those two songs are Olivia Dean’s “Man I Need” at No. 3, and Bad Bunny’s “DtMF” (last week’s leader) dipping a few spots to No. 4. Bad Bunny also has two other songs remaining in the top 10 for a total of three, after landing four there last week. “Tití Me Preguntó” is at No. 7  and “Baile Inolvidable” is at No. 10. \n\t\n\n\tThe No. 5 song is Alex Warren’s “Ordinary,” followed by “Golden” at No. 7 and Swift’s “Ophelia” still affording her a second spot in the top 10 at No. 8.\n\n\tOver on the Billboard 200 album chart, Bad Bunny was a holdover at No. 1 with “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS,” the second consecutive and fifth nonconsecutive time that album reached the top. \n\n\tThere were two new entries in the top 10, both from artists debuting more modestly with their current projects than they did with their previous albums.\n\n\tBrent Faiyaz debuted at No. 6 with “Icon,” collecting 58,000 equivalent album units. His previous album, 2022’s “Wasteland,” bowed at No. 2 with 88,000 as its first-week tally.\n\n\tCharli xcx‘s soundtrack album for “Wuthering Heights” entered at No. 8, with 51,000 units. Even with an association with a hit movie, this more eclectic project was not exepected to match debut numbers for her last album, the culturally phenomenal “Brat,” which bowed at No. 3 in 2024 with 77,000 units.\n",

    "description": "\n\tEmpire Publishing, the publishing division of the independent powerhouse music company of the same name, has entered a new agreement with Grammy-win",
    "body": "\n\tEmpire Publishing, the publishing division of the independent powerhouse music company of the same name, has entered a new agreement with Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shaboozey, who is also on the Empire label. His track record of course includes the RIAA-Diamond certified hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” and the gold album “Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going.”\n\n\tThe Empire publishing team is led by newly appointed president Vinny Kumar, who helped secure the deal alongside SVP of A&R Eric Hurt, who signed Shaboozey to Empire’s label in 2021.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to expand our partnership with Shaboozey in this publishing deal,” says Hurt. “As great of an artist as Shaboozey is, he’s equally as talented as a songwriter; constantly striving to write the most compelling, story-driven songs that reach a broad and diverse audience.”\n\n\n\tKumar added, “The creative foundation of Shaboozey’s success is his writing, which sits at the center of one of the most significant chart achievements in recent memory. We’re proud to partner with him on the publishing side as he continues to make history.”\n\n\tJared Cotter, Shaboozey’s co-manager and Range Media Partners managing partner, added: “We couldn’t be happier to double down on the mutual commitment between Shaboozey and Empire. They have been integral partners in Shaboozey’s success on the record side and I have no doubt we will say the same in the publishing business as well.”\n\n\t+ Generative-AI company Suno has named former Merlin CEO Jeremy Sirota as its chief commercial officer, it announced Monday morning. In the role, Sirota will lead Suno’s commercial strategy, music industry relationships, platform partnerships, and enterprise solutions and will report directly to CEO Mikey Shulman.\n\t\n\n\tDuring his six years as CEO of Merlin, the digital music licensing partner for independent music labels and distributors, Sirota scaled annual revenue from $900 million to $1.8 billion while rebuilding its technology infrastructure and expanding its data and licensing capabilities. He led licensing agreements with major technology platforms including Apple, Deezer, Meta, Spotify, Twitch and YouTube among others. He also negotiated Merlin’s early AI partnerships.\n\n\tPrior to Merlin, Sirota held business development, strategy and operational roles at Meta on the music team, was a senior record executive at Warner Music Group, and served as a technology lawyer at Morrison Foerster, where he did licensing work for entertainment companies and advised on intellectual property matters.\n\n\t“Jeremy is a rare leader who has spent his career working to improve every side of the music business – for fans, artists, music rightsholders, and platforms,” said Shulman, co-founder and CEO of Suno. “What truly sets him apart is his ability to build what doesn’t yet exist, finding opportunity where others see obstacles and bringing all sides with him. That mindset will help craft a better future of music for all, and I couldn’t be more excited to have him join Suno.”\n\n\tSuno recently announced a partnership with Warner Music Group and last fall, it launched what it claims is the the first generative audio workstation, Suno Studio, which blends pro-grade multi-track editing with AI stem generation.\n\n\t+ Sony Music Publishing has promoted Greg Prata to chief financial officer, effective March 31. He will continue to be based out of the company’s New York office and will report to SMP chairman & CEO Jon Platt.\n\n\tIn his new role, Prata will oversee all aspects of Sony Music Publishing’s financial operations globally, including reporting, accounting, budget, administration and IT. He succeeds Tom Kelly, who recently announced his upcoming retirement from his position as CFO, after a 35-year career.\n\n\tPlatt said, “Greg has been a trusted leader on our team, and I’m pleased to see him step into the CFO role as we advance our next stage of growth. At the same time, we thank Tom for his remarkable tenure. His leadership has helped drive our success and set a high bar for excellence that Greg will continue to build upon.”\n\t\n\n\tPrata joined Sony in 2012 as senior VP of financial planning & analysis, following his time at EMI. In 2019, he was promoted to executive VP of finance & corporate strategy. Prior to his roles at Sony Music Publishing and EMI, Prata spent over a decade in private equity and investment banking.\n\n\t+ Patron Saints of Music, the custom music house behind Bravo’s “Below Deck” and others, has named Allie Moskovits head of sync & business development. In this newly created role, Moskovits will lead sync strategy for Patron Saints’ expanding catalog to drive business across TV, film, advertising, gaming, and emerging media. She will also focus on developing new artists and songs to diversify the catalog and expand the company’s footprint beyond unscripted television.\n\n\t+ Culture Wave, a Los Angeles–based, “rock-forward” artist management company operating in partnership with Red Light Management, has expanded in several areas.\n\n\tArtist managers Ryan Cunningham and Mike Bingham of Polarizer Management have joined Culture Wave, bringing their rosters into the company’s management division. Cunningham represents the Armed, Prostitute, Trauma Ray, Patrick Shiroishi, Truck Violence, Jodi, while Bingham joins with Trauma Ray, Spiritual Cramp and Agriculture. Cunningham will remain in his role at Biz 3 Publicity where he’s been a publicist for 12 years.\n\n\tThe company also announces the promotion of Rachel Hacken to artist manager, transitioning from day-to-day support for Jason Mageau’s roster. Hacken now manages Kittie, Gore., Thousand Below, and Holy Wars; as well as:\n\n\tAlana Lopez joins as touring & logistics manager, supporting Jason Mageau’s roster and Culture Wave artists; Madison Stern joins as day-to-day manager for Andrew Jarrin; Ana Garcia joins as digital marketing coordinator; Erin Carignan joins as day-to-day manager for Ryan Cunningham; Joey Mullen joins as co-manager for the band Agriculture with Bingham.\n",

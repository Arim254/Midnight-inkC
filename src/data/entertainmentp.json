    "body": "\n\tOutgoing BBC director general Tim Davie, who resigned on Sunday amid a scandal over documentary program “Panorama’s” editing of Donald Trump‘s Jan. 6 speech, addressed his staff at the broadcaster’s headquarters on Tuesday.\n\n\tAccording to BBC News, Davie acknowledged during a 40-minute town hall alongside chair Samir Shah that “we did make a mistake” in the editing of Trump’s speech, but told staff: “I think we’ve got to fight for our journalism.”\n\t\n\n\tHe gave three reasons for his departure, including the scandal over the “Panorama” documentary on Trump as well as the BBC’s upcoming charter renewal in 2027 and the “relentless” nature of the role. He insisted that the BBC will “survive” his departure and said several times that he is “fiercely proud of this organization.”\n\n\n\tA timeline for Davie’s departure was not given, but Shah said the BBC board was in “succession mode.” Davie said he has “no regrets” about his time at the BBC and “wouldn’t change a thing.” He did not address Trump’s $1 billion legal threat to the BBC, but said political pressures were “challenging.”\n\n\tOn Monday, Trump sent a letter to the broadcaster threatening to sue for $1 billion unless the episode of “Panorama” was retracted, he received a formal apology and payment to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.”\n\n\tControversy erupted over the weekend after a leaked memo from former BBC Editorial Guidelines and Standards committee adviser Michael Prescott was published by The Telegraph suggesting that “Panorama” edited a Trump speech to make it sound like he encouraged the Jan. 6 riots. It resulted in the shocking resignations of both Davie and CEO of news Deborah Turness on Sunday night.\n\t\n\n\tPrescott’s memo said “Panorama” edited Trump’s speech to be: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not gonna have a country anymore.” Prescott wrote that Trump said the part beginning with “and we fight” 54 minutes after “we’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be with you.”\n\n\tOn Monday, BBC chair Samir Shah  apologized for the edit in a letter to the U.K. culture, media and sport committee and called it an “error of judgement.” Speaking with the BBC’s Katie Razzall following the letter’s publication, Shah said that he has been in contact with Trump’s team and is considering personally apologizing to the president. \n\n\tThe BBC has been flanked by several other controversies this year, including a Gaza documentary that was found to be a “serious breach” of Ofcom’s broadcasting rules and its handling of controversy at Glastonbury Festival when it aired the punk duo Bob Vylan chanting “death to the IDF.”\n\n\tDavie and Turness’ departure timeline and who exactly will replace them remains unclear.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAntonio Banderas will be honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Torino Film Festival in Turin, Italy, where the Oscar-nominated actor will present a special screening of Pedro Almodóvar’s semi-autobiographical 2019 drama “Pain and Glory.”\n\n\tBanderas will receive Torino’s Stella della Mole Award on Nov. 29 during the opening ceremony of the Italian event dedicated to indie cinema. As previously announced, the fest is set to kick off with David Freyne’s afterlife rom-com “Eternity.”\n\t\n\n\tIn Turin, Banderas will subsequently present a special screening of “Pain and Glory” in which he stars as Almodóvar’s alter-ego of sorts playing a director reflecting on his life and career. “Pain and Glory” earned Banderas the best actor award at Cannes Film Festival as well as Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations.\n\n\n\tTorino is celebrating Banderas for his longstanding collaboration with Almodóvar, which also comprises “Labyrinth of Passion” (1982), “Matador” (1986), “Law of Desire” (1987) and “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” (1988), as well as for his roles in Hollywood titles such as “Philadelphia” (1993), “Interview With the Vampire” (1994) and “Evita” (1996) and more recent films “Official Competition” (2021) and “Babygirl” (2024).\n\n\t“Antonio Banderas, shaped by Almodóvar’s creative vision, has been able to conquer Hollywood and embody the image of a complete actor,” said Torino Film Festival artistic director Giulio Base. He went on to call Banderas “a performer of dizzying depth and, at the same time, a global sex symbol of his generation.”\n\t\n\n\tBanderas will next be seen in A24’s Anthony Bourdain biopic “Tony” and in Trudie Styler’s “Rose Baby.”\n\n\tTorino’s 43rd edition is being held Nov. 21-29 in the Northern Italian city of Turin. \n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart came after Democrats for voting to end the government shutdown without extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which is the primary issue the Left has fought for throughout the 41-day stoppage.\n\n\t“They fucking caved on the shutdown,” Stewart said, fuming. “Not even a full week removed from the best election night results they’ve had in years, seven Democratic senators and an ‘Independent’ voted with their Republican counterparts to end the shutdown and reopen the government. And did they get their extended healthcare subsidies?”\n\t\n\n\tStewart turned to a sound bite from ABC 7 for the answer, “Democrats wanted the deal to include extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act. Instead, they got a promise to vote on it at a later date.”\n\n\n\t“I cannot fucking believe it,” Stewart continued. “You had the wind at your back! Election victories all over the country. The new Sydney Sweeney movie was box office bupkis! Apparently, her new MAGA fanbase didn’t show up in droves to see a biopic about a lesbian professional boxer who overcomes domestic violence to live her truth. Who could have seen that coming? Democrats, you sold out the entire shutdown not to get what you wanted, but for a promise to not get what you wanted later.”\n\n\tThe legislation to end the nation’s longest government shutdown in history passed in the Senate Monday night. However, it still needs to pass through the House and then get a signature from Donald Trump. With a Republican majority in the House, it is likely to pass, and Trump is expected to sign the bill with full support from the Right.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAn appellate court in South Korea has overturned the sexual misconduct conviction of O Yeong-su, an 81-year-old actor who starred in Netflix‘s global phenomenon “Squid Game,” according to the Yonhap News Agency.\n\n\tThe Suwon District Court on Tuesday acquitted O, reversing a lower court ruling that had found him guilty of sexually harassing a woman during a 2017 regional theater tour. O had been accused of hugging and kissing the woman on the cheek without her consent.\n\t\n\n\tThe appellate court acknowledged that suspicion existed, citing the fact that the woman sought counseling for sexual violence six months after the alleged incident and that O had apologized to her at her request. However, the bench expressed concern about the possibility of the victim’s memory being distorted over time and emphasized the need to protect the defendant’s interests when doubts remain.\n\n\n\tThe original ruling had sentenced O to an eight-month prison term, suspended for two years. Prosecutors had sought a one-year prison sentence in both the initial and appellate proceedings.\n\n\tThe alleged victim spoke out against the verdict following the ruling. “Despite today’s ruling, I will continue to speak the truth to the very end,” she said in a statement released through women’s rights organization Womenlink, adding that the acquittal would not “invalidate the truth or erase the pain I have suffered.”\n\n\tWomenlink criticized the ruling, saying they were “outraged by a ruling that once again conceals sexual violence in the theatre world,” according to BBC News.\n\n\tO gained international recognition for his performance in “Squid Game,” winning the Golden Globe for best performance by an actor in a supporting role on TV in 2022. The Netflix series became a cultural phenomenon and remains one of the streaming platform’s most-watched programs.\n\t\n\n\tThe veteran actor’s legal troubles had cast a shadow over his career following his role in the survival thriller series.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTatsuya Nakadai, one of Japan’s most celebrated stage and screen actors who was a frequent collaborator of director Masaki Kobayashi and led Akira Kurosawa titles such as “Ran,” “Kagemusha” and “High and Low,” has died. He was 92.\n\n\tNakadai’s death was reported Tuesday in Japan by The Japan News.\n\n\tWith more than 100 screen credits through his seven-decade-spanning career, Nakadai’s body of work spanned a veritable who’s-who of Japanese cinema for the second half of the twentieth century, working with filmmakers like Hiroshi Teshigahara, Mikio Naruse and Kon Ichikawa. He considered himself a theater actor first, and he never signed an overall contract with any Japanese studio, leaving him free to work with many different directors.\n\t\n\n\tOne of his first major on-screen jobs was an uncredited role playing a prisoner in Kobayashi’s 1953 drama “The Thick-Walled Room,” beginning a partnership that would continue through the next three decades and include titles like “Samurai Rebellion” and “Kwaidan.”\n\n\n\tTo Western audiences, Nakadai is perhaps best known for his leading turn in Kurosawa’s 1985 drama “Ran,” a Sengoku-period-set war epic inspired by Shakespeare’s “King Lear” that earned Kurosawa his only directing Oscar nomination. Then just in his early 50s, Nakadai played much older, wearing intense, ghost-like makeup to portray a desolate, world-weary warlord.\n\n\tNakadai was a fixture of the chanbara genre, leading some of the most enduring samurai films, including Kobayashi’s sublimely existential “Harakiri” and Kihachi Okamoto’s more comedic “Kill!” He played the grinning villain to Toshiro Mifune’s scowling hero twice — as a grinning, gun-toting gangster in 1961’s “Yojimbo” and a balder and more prideful samurai foil in 1962’s “Sanjuro,” the latter of which ended with one of the era’s most memorably bloody death scenes. Nakadai had been coming off a breakout lead turn in Kobayashi’s “The Human Condition” trilogy, in which the actor played a pacifist enduring Japan’s turn to totalitarian rule amid World War II.\n\t\n\n\tMifune and Kurosawa would collaborate again on the sprawling 1963 kidnap thriller “High and Low,” in which Nakadai played the chief detective who sets up base camp in the luxurious apartment of Mifune’s callous lead. In the late ’70s, Kurosawa tapped Nakadai again, this time to lead the jidaigeki epic “Kagemusha.”\n\n\tNakadai continued screen-acting through the second half of his life. He was a voice actor on the 2013 “The Tale of the Princess Kaguya” and even looped back to the long-running Zatoichi franchise with the 2010 revival “Zatoichi: The Last.” But Nakadai considered himself to be a theater actor first, and the most acclaimed work of his later years came onstage, leading productions of “Death of a Salesman,” “Barrymore” and “Don Quixote.” He played Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello and Richard III throughout his career.\n\n\tMotohisa Nakadai was born Dec. 13, 1932, in Tokyo, the second of four siblings. Nakadai was raised in Chiba, where his father worked as a bus driver until his death in 1941. His mother then moved them to Aoyama. In young adulthood, he began to pursue acting as a student at the Haiyuza Training School.\n\n\tNakadai won two of Japan’s Blue Ribbon Awards, the first for “Harakiri” in 1962 and the second for “Kagemusha” and “The Battle of Port Arthur” in 1980. In 2015, he received the Order of Culture, Japan’s highest honor for contributions to the arts and sciences.\n\n\tNakadai was predeceased by his wife, producer and playwright Kyoko Miyazaki. He is survived by their daughter, Nao Nakadai.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeff Goldblum says he’s gone vegetarian after playing the Wizard of Oz in Jon M. Chu’s blockbuster sequel “Wicked: For Good.”\n\n\tDuring a recent interview on “This Morning,” Goldblum discussed how lucky he feels to play such an impactful role as the Wizard at age 73. He also added that, because of the film’s themes surrounding animal cruelty, he has stopped eating meat.\n\n\t“It’s uncommon that you get to be doing this over a period of time and get more fertile and juicy and interesting and relevant roles for yourself at this period of time,” Goldblum said. “Working with Jon Chu [is] amazing. It’s changed me. You know, after doing this movie, we talked about the animal cruelty, I stopped eating meat and poultry.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “We need the world to work for everybody on Earth and every creature, too.”\n\n\tAfter putting his spin on the villainous ruler of Oz in 2024’s “Wicked,” Goldblum will reprise the role in “Wicked: For Good” on Nov. 21. His co-stars include Ariana Grande as Glinda, Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible.\n\n\tThe first “Wicked” earned 10 nominations at last year’s Academy Awards and took home two statues for best achievement in costume design and best achievement in production design.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is expected to repeat the 10 nominations led by best actress and best supporting actress picks for Erivo and Grande, respectively. If they both repeat, they would become the seventh and eighth performers in Oscar history to be nominated twice for the same role.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Group Corporation lifted its annual earnings forecast after posting double-digit profit growth for the July–September quarter, fueled by strong performances in its music and image sensor businesses that offset softness in gaming and consumer electronics.\n\n\tThe Tokyo-based conglomerate reported operating income of JPY429 billion ($2.78 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up 10% year-on-year from JPY389 billion, on sales of JPY3.11 trillion ($20.17 billion), a 5% increase. Net income attributable to Sony’s shareholders climbed 7% to JPY311.4 billion ($2.02 billion).\n\t\n\n\tSony raised its forecast for operating income in the year ending March 2026 to JPY1.43 trillion ($9.27 billion), up 8% from the prior guidance and 12% above the previous year’s result, citing higher earnings at its music and imaging & sensing solutions units and a lower-than-expected hit from new U.S. tariffs.\n\n\n\tThe music segment was one of the quarter’s standout performers. Sales surged 21% year-on-year to JPY542.4 billion ($3.51 billion) and operating income jumped 28% to JPY115.4 billion ($749 million), driven by growth in streaming and publishing as well as the blockbuster success of “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle.” \n\n\tSony’s Visual Media & Platform division, which handles anime and related content through its Aniplex subsidiary, saw quarterly revenue climb from JPY62.2 billion to JPY105.9 billion ($673 million), a rise of more than 70%, as the film’s theatrical rollout lifted soundtrack, licensing, and merchandise sales worldwide. The feature, distributed globally by Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures, had grossed $312 million worldwide by the end of September. Visual Media & Platform’s profit contribution rose to just under 30% of Sony Music’s total profit, up from less than 20% a year earlier, underscoring the deep cross-segment synergy between Sony’s music, animation, and theatrical operations.\n\t\n\n\tThe Imaging & Sensing Solutions division, which supplies smartphone camera sensors to Apple and other manufacturers, posted a 15% sales gain to JPY614.6 billion ($3.98 billion) and a 50% profit jump to JPY138.3 billion ($897 million), benefiting from increased shipments and higher unit prices for larger sensors.\n\n\tBy contrast, the Game & Network Services segment reported revenue up 4% to JPY1.11 trillion ($7.19 billion), but operating income fell 13% to JPY120.4 billion ($781 million) due to impairment charges related to Bungie’s “Destiny 2” and adjustments to capitalized development costs. Excluding those one-time items, segment profit would have risen 23%, reflecting continued strength in software and network services.\n\n\tThe Pictures division saw revenue dip 3% to JPY346 billion ($2.24 billion) and operating income decline to JPY13.9 billion ($90 million), while Entertainment, Technology & Services – which includes TVs and audio equipment – slipped 7% to JPY575.7 billion ($3.73 billion) in sales and JPY61 billion ($395 million) in profit.\n\n\tSony now expects full-year sales of JPY12 trillion ($77.78 billion) and operating income of JPY1.43 trillion, reflecting higher contributions from music, imaging, and a smaller tariff burden. The company maintained its interim dividend of JPY12.5 per share and plans a year-end dividend of the same amount, totaling JPY25 per share, up from 20 yen the previous year.\n\n\tEffective Oct. 1, Sony completed the spin-off of its financial services arm, Sony Financial Group Inc., which is now treated as a discontinued operation. From the third quarter onward, profits from the unit will be accounted for under the equity method. The group’s average foreign exchange rate for the quarter was JPY147.4 to the U.S. dollar, compared with JPY149.5 a year earlier.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFlorence Pugh appeared on the latest episode of “The Louis Theroux Podcast” and spoke openly about her experience with intimacy coordinators on film sets. Intimacy coordinators have become an industry standard, although the job has proven divisive in Hollywood. Pugh described the profession as one that makes sure sex scenes are filmed with the utmost safety for the actors involved, adding, “It’s not to get in the way. It’s not to confuse, it’s not to make things more complicated or make things more awkward. I’ve had good ones and bad ones.”\n\t\n\n\tGwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lawrence both made headlines recently for saying they didn’t feel the need to use the intimacy coordinators hired on their sets because they trusted their co-stars to be professional.\n\n\n\t“We did not have [an intimacy coordinator], or maybe we did but we didn’t really [use it]… I felt really safe with Rob [Pattinson]. He is not pervy,” Lawrence said about the making of “Die My Love.”\n\n\tPaltrow said on that the set of “Marty Supreme” she told the intimacy coordinator to “step a little back” when she was filming intimate scenes with Timothée Chalamet, adding: “I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but… if someone is like, ‘Okay, and then he’s going to put his hand here,’  I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.”\n\n\tPugh noted that she filmed many sex scenes without an intimacy coordinator in the past. While she’s always been “quite confident” and “quite happy in my skin,” the Oscar nominee remembered times when someone on set used “completely inappropriate” to direct a sex scene and there wasn’t an intimacy coordinator present to protect her.\n\t\n\n\t“But my view is changing about it as well, because I’m now having fantastic experiences with intimacy coordinators,” Pugh said about filming sex scenes. “However, that being said, I’ve also had a shit example where someone just made it so weird and so awkward and really wasn’t helpful and kind of was just like wanting to be a part of the set in a way that wasn’t helpful, and I think it’s a job that’s still figuring itself out.”\n\n\t“I will say that I’ve been able to understand better meaning now through working with great ones in sex scenes,” Pugh said about “finding the story of what it is, what kind of sex is it, how do you touch each other, how long have you been having sex for.”\n\n\t“Everybody’s just kind of working away to chip away at the scene. And I think when I worked with a fantastic coordinator, I was like, ‘Oh, this is what I’ve been missing, understanding the dance of intimacy as opposed to just shooting a sex scene,'” Pugh said. “There are good ones and bad ones, and it’s through the good ones that I have learned how effective it can really be.”\n\n\tPugh credited intimacy coordinators with giving female actors more agency on set. She said, “It’s a bit stickier” being a woman during filming because “you can’t really be a problem because people will say that you’re a nightmare.”\n\n\t“I remember I was doing a crying scene and there were just all of these specific beats that I needed to get, and specifically on specific lines,” Pugh remembered. “And we did it maybe six times, and each time you have to start with no tears and then gear up. So you have to stay in it. And we got it and the director wanted to go again. And when I’m in that state, I’m a bit mushy, so I’m like, ‘Okay, we’ll do it again.'”\n\n\tPugh said that as a woman, she would never speak up on set and tell the director that no more takes were needed of such an emotionally exhausting scene. It took her male co-star to do that on her behalf.\n\n\t“My co-star went out to the director and said: ‘Don’t do that, man. Don’t put her through that. She’s got it. We got it. You’ve got the close-up, you’ve got the wide, don’t do that,'” Pugh remembered. “And I realized when I was in the tent, I was like, ‘Oh, I wouldn’t have been able to have said that because that wouldn’t have been received well.'”\n\t\n\n\t“The Louis Theroux Podcast” is available on Spotify now.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFresh lettering has gone up on the marquee at Antone’s nightclub in Austin: “Forever.” That may err on the side of slightly wishful thinking, but the club at least has a better head start on eternal life than most. The nationally celebrated mecca for blues and other roots music has signed a 50-year lease deal with its landlord  to cap off a 50th anniversary celebration that has lasted throughout 2025.\n\n\tFew, if any, comparable nightspots that don’t own their own real estate have inked a deal that would guarantee them a home for decades going forward. But few are considered as indispensable to their communities as Antone’s is, and this one is benefitting from a landlord that not only understands the club’s history but wants visitors and tourists not to visit Austin at night only to find that there is no live music at the center of the self-proclaimed Live Music Capitol of the World. The deal is actually for 30 years, with two 10-year-extensions after that, but Antone’s is expecting to be putting a 100th birthday party on the marquee in 2075.\n\t\n\n\tIn other news announced Monday, Antone’s is also planning to build a museum on its second level that will be open for tourists during the day as well as clubgoers at night, which will double as a VIP room. The museum is expected to open in 2017.\n\n\n\tWill Bridges, the co-owner of Antone’s, and Zach Ernst, director of booking and creative, took over the venerable club and its attendant operations about a dozen years ago, with a move into the current downtown location a decadea ago. They talked with Variety about the venue’s past, its present — which just included an Antone’s-themed episode of “Austin City Limits” that aired on PBS Saturday  — and its apparently wide-open future.\n\t\n\n\t“The first 50 years was just such a heroic effort — all these twists and turns, with a fighting, scrappy, never-say-die attitude to get to 50,” says Bridges. “And of course it’s gonna take a lot of work to get through the next 50. But to have the vision and the runway to be able to presumably duplicate that, it’s empowering, for sure. And it certainly is going to be exciting to announce because, as much as we’ve been milking the 50th anniversary for everything it’s worth, I don’t think people were expecting us to jujitsu that into: Just when you thought we were done, we’re gonna do it for another 50.\n\n\t“Antone’s has moved a lot around in its first 50 year,” he adds. “We’re actually in the sixth location. And so it’s part of our DNA to persevere, and if Antone’s gets displaced, it goes and finds another home, and that in itself is unique. So in a way, this is kind of departing from that m.o. But longevity, of course. is the real goal.”\n\n\tPrior to this late-breaking development, the centerpiece of the 50th anniversary of Cliff Antone establishing a blues club in Austin was an elaborate boxed set on New West Records titled “Antone’s: 50 Years of the Blues” — a five-disc, 41-track collection with 18 new recordings as well as classic and previously unreleased material, produced by Ernst. Putting that together spurred the idea of forming an all-star blues revue in the tradition of the old Antone’s house band and doing a few select dates around the country, including an L.A. Troubadour show, a party/jam at the Village Recorder in West L.A., an AmericanaFest gig at Jack White’s Blue Room in Nashville, and a Lincoln Center outdoor show at Damrosch Park in New York … not to mention the “Austin City Limits” that just aired.\n\n\t“While it may have seemed like we were just inventing new things to come up with to do to celebrate the 50th,” says Ernst, “the boxed set was really the nucleus of all of it, and all those other projects were just ways to kind of tour it around. We have had a lot of fun traveling and taking Antone’s on the road for the first time in about 35 years.” Although Antone’s has not been strictly a blues club since at least the ’90s, this was a way to double up on that core mission. “The older class was saying this is the closest thing they’d experienced since the old house band, and a lot of the younger players were saying that this brought a sense of musical family that they had yearned for their entire careers. Those who were exposed to the old Antone’s culture always felt connected to it, but they never had that opportunity to find their flock or be with their tribe, and this was it. So it’s kind of turned into a thing that has a life of its own, and we’re excited to see where that continues to go” with more all-star revue concerts in the near future. \n\t\n\n\tGetting back to the 50-year lease, Bridges explains how it came about.\n\n\t“Eleven years ago, when Zach’s and my team took on the club, we signed a 10-year lease with two five-year options,” the co-owner says. “So we wouldn’t have been thinking quite that long-term yet, as far as necessarily needing to ask for a big extension, because we still had another 10 years left. But those first 10 years went by pretty quick, so we were at least cognizant of: OK, what happens in 10 years? Austin is getting increasingly more difficult, and if we do have to find a new home, the odds of that are getting slimmer. But there was this grant program that we first started getting involved with three years ago, when Austin created an economic development corporation sidecar entity that has been rebranded as Rally Austin. I’ve learned a lot about that being a model for growing municipalities, of kind of a trust to try to take control or ownership of venues or cultural assets spaces that harbor arts and music culture in different cities. I remember learning about one in San Francisco 10 or 15 years ago. It always sounded a little pie in the sky for Austin. But the idea is, if you can have some entity step in and be kind of a intermediary, it can help make sure these spaces don’t just go to the chopping block of commercial real estate.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAntone’s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCamryn Hutchens / @behindcamm\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut Rally Austin had a prerequisite for bringing spaces into the program, which is that they are either able to buy their property or have a long-term lease. “So that was the catalyst for us going to our landlord very early in that process, about three years ago, saying, ‘Hey, we wouldn’t normally be coming to you right now talking about this. But if you’re open to exploring a long-term lease that could unlock some funds for us…’ Our landlord said, ‘I’m open to it.’ And slowly but surely as the thing evolved, he got on board and really helped.”\n\n\tBridges says the landlord’s business “has a lot of key properties downtown. And so when we first went to him 12 years ago (about taking over Antone’s), we were very transparent about, ‘Hey, we’re a music venue. We’re not gonna be able to compete just on normal economics. We’re not gonna be the highest bidder for this space. But we bring a different type of value to downtown.’ Especially 11, 12 years ago, there was a lot of talk about music venues escaping downtown because of increasing rents and property tax and just property values overall. And Austin’s a young city — we’re always kind of reading ahead in the story to see how this plays out in markets that are further along than we are in their life cycle. But one of the doomsday things I remember everyone talking about is,  if you lose your cultural class, if you lose your arts and music in downtown, you’ll become a donut city.\n\t\n\n\t“We thought it was really important to make a point to go back into downtown,” Bridges continues. “And so part of our original pitch was in kind of the headwinds of all that questioning of the arts and music leaving downtown — escaping to greener pasture, so to speak — we made that commitment to him, saying, ‘We’re gonna do the opposite. We’re gonna plant the Antone’s flag back downtown as close to the original cross streets of the original 6th and Brazos location as possible, and reverse that trend and bring that cultural value back to downtown.'”\n\n\tSince they moved into Antone’s sixth location, it has been just shy of a decade — a nice round number that Bridges seems to have kind of let slip, until you query him about it. “It’ll be 10 years on New Year’s Eve, which we hadn’t even thought about. You know, maybe we should throw a 10-year anniversary party in the ‘new’ building! But … we’ve kind of eclipsed that” with all this other news, he laughs.\n\n\tThe museum was something they had hoped to put together off-site, until the eureka idea of doing it adjacent and slightly smaller than first imagined came up.\n\n\t“We have so much memorabilia that’s been gifted to us over the years, and so much generosity within our immediate network of folks that we knew would be happy to lend stuff,” Bridges says. “So we were toying around with that idea for a long time, but we couldn’t figure out where to put it. Finally, one of our board members inspired us to just put it upstairs, which we thought would’ve been too small of a space. But we took some tours and went to Memphis, for example, and saw Stax, which is amazing, but also saw Sun Studios, which showed me that you can pack a lot of amazing history into a small package and sometimes it’s almost more impactful in that way. — along with also being in a space where the music actually happened.\n\n\t“It’s gonna be installed there in the upstairs space, and there’ll be a lot of synergies having it open during the day, attracting more activity to the building in the daytime hours, but then also be open at night. So it won’t be a traditional museum; it will be on top of a music venue. There’ll still be a bar in there. \n\n\t“People already come by Antone’s, especially tourists of course, during the day, because there’s not a whole lot of music things you can do during the day in Austin. One of the lightbulb moments for me with having the museum on top of the club is: I remember coming in one day, and we have a record shop downstairs called Big Henry’s. I caught our record shop attendee giving a little impromptu tour of the club, and one of the tourists was taking a picture of the beer guy pulling beer in. And I thought, ‘We can do better than this! We can give him a little something better than the beer guy.’ \n\t\n\n\t“So people are yearning for daytime experiences and we hope to be a destination for schools and youth groups and people that want to take their kids to be exposed to music. But then at nighttime, on any given day, we have 200-400 people coming through the club who are there for the music. So, in Texas, we have the saying “shooting fish in a barrel.” We think it’s gonna be really easy to entice those folks to go upstairs for a small donation to the Clifford Antone Foundation. We also excited about it being kind of a special club for our Clifford Antone Foundation members during shows, because we’ve always had a camera system where you can still hear and see the show downstairs. So it can even be maybe analogous to a VIP experience like the Founder’s Room at House of Blues.”\n\n\tAntone’s is reemphasizing the blues with the 50th anniversary boxed set and shows, but on a day-to-day level, the club programs plenty of different genres. Ernst explains that evolution.\n\n\t“After doing this (booking) for a couple years, I realized that I could get the big cast of fans who love to come to Jimmy Vaughn shows or Maceo Parker shows or Billy Gibbons shows and maybe get them out once a month, but you can’t expect those people to come all the time,” he says. “So I have always been spacing those throughout the calendar just for our own enjoyment. But Antone’s also means a lot to the city of Austin as just a 400-cap room that touring bands can play for the first time, sort of like the Troubadour or Bowery Ballroom. We had a Billy Strings show, and a Lizzo show, and Jack Harlow, all these bands that have gone on to be arena acts, who play the club their first time through. So I’m always cherry-picking things and wanting to have a diversity of lineups and genres and older crowds and younger crowds. \n\n\t“So that hasn’t changed, but this year, really going out on a limb with this blues revue thing that we created, is just from knowing that people outside of Austin care about this stuff, and knowing that there’s an audience for it and not giving up on it just because a lot of the heroes have passed away. You know, they said ‘the blues is dead’ in 1975. Here we are 50 years later, and people might still say that stuff. We’re just having fun, reconnecting with all these old friends and making sure that we can continue to host them at our stage and think creatively about how to encapsulate that feeling and share it with the world.”\n\t\n\n\tContinues Ernst: “Yeah, Antone’s is a blues club, while presenting the genres that we’re passionate about underneath kind of the blues umbrella — R&B, zydeco, soul, gospel, all these genres that Clifford loved… Antone’s was like a lifeboat in Austin’s music history when other clubs would get closed or scenes would be displaced, because Antone’s would kind of absorb them, at least temporarily. That’s when Antone’s started to transcend beyond just being a home for the blues, and the blues just became almost like a term of endearment for soulful, authentic music here in Austin. It’s like jazz is to New Orleans. It is kind of our root genre, our mother tongue. So the mission is twofold: It’s focusing on those (root) genres, presenting that music, developing those artists. But it’s equally just sort of doing the same for Austin’s music ecosystem at large.”\n\n\tFor anyone who wants to get involved in the mission of Antone’s going forward, there is the Antone’s Forever Fund, administered through the Clifford Antone Foundation. “This is our battle cry, our mantra, our campaign for the next 50 years,” says Bridges. “You know, we were in this scrappy survival mode for the first 50. So we’re using this achievement and this milestone as a paradigm shift to go from surviving to thriving. And Antone’s Forever is what we call what’s gonna be this initiative to make sure that Antone’s thrives for another 50 years in Austin. We’re making a big cast plaque that’ll go in the entrance and people can put their name on it, and their name will be in the entrance of Antone’s for the next 50 years.” Or forever, whichever comes first. \n",

Kirkland, a metals dealer, and honed her craft at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.\n      \n\n          She gained recognition as one of Andy Warhol’s \"13 Most Beautiful Women\" in 1964 and became the first actress to ever appear completely nude on stage in an off Broadway production titled \"Sweet Eros\" in 1968.\n      \n    \n          Nearly 20 years later, Kirkland won a Golden Globe for her starring role in the 1987 comedy-drama \"Anna.\" Her highly-regarded performance also earned her an Oscar nod.\n      \n    \n          The legendary actress had more than 200 credits to her name ... other notable ones include \"Charlie’s Angels,\" \"JFK\" and \"Bruce Almighty.\"\n      \n    \n          Kirkland's interests were varied -- she was an ordained minister and was passionate about yoga. She also mentored dozens of aspiring actors over the years.\n      \n    \n          Sally is survived by her godson and filmmaker Coty Galloway (Baily), three cousins Brookie, Katherine and Tina Kirkland, and several close friends.\n      \n    \n          She was 84.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

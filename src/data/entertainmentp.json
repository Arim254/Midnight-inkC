    "body": "\n\tTaiwan‘s production infrastructure has made significant strides through platforms like Golden Horse FPP and Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF), but Each Other Films co-founders Jacqueline W. Liu and Tiffany Yu-Chia Chen argue the industry faces a more fundamental challenge: convincing audiences to commit to long-form storytelling.\n\n\tAs exclusively revealed by Variety, the company unveiled a cross-border slate on the eve of TCCF, marking seven years in operation.\n\t\n\n\t“The biggest change isn’t just in the industry — it’s in the audience,” Chen tells Variety. “Viewing habits have shifted, and fewer people are committing to long-form storytelling. That forces all of us to rethink what kinds of stories truly matter and why they should be told.”\n\n\n\tLiu adds that while festivals and markets provide essential connectivity, they haven’t solved for production continuity. “For creatives, these platforms are a lifeline — they connect talent to partners and give independent voices a place to be seen,” she says. “But the next step is sustainability: how do we turn that exposure into consistent production flow? That’s the structural gap we all need to bridge.”\n\n\tThe duo’s response to these conditions involves expanding Each Other Films’ international footprint through co-productions that maintain what they describe as emotional authenticity rooted in Asian experience. That approach informs “Heals,” the company’s first non-fiction project, co-produced with Thailand’s N8 and World of Wonder around Pangina Heals, the Thai-Taiwanese drag performer who hosts “Drag Race Thailand.”\n\t\n\n\tChen frames the documentary through parent-child dynamics prevalent across the region. “The relationship between parents and children is the timeless million-dollar question in Asia — how to get your parents to understand what you do, and to stop worrying as you grow into adulthood,” she says. “Especially between mothers and their children, that tension is universal here.”\n\n\tLiu positions the project as evidence that “non-fiction can carry the same emotional depth and cinematic ambition as scripted storytelling,” describing it as being “about the creative process of survival — how humor, artistry, and vulnerability become forms of strength.”\n\n\tThe company is also developing “Spent Bullets,” participating in the Taiwan Creative Content Forum, which spans Silicon Valley, Las Vegas and Taipei. Liu clarifies that despite being published under a Japanese pseudonym, Terao Tetsuya, the author is Taiwanese. The story follows two Silicon Valley engineers confronting buried secrets during a road trip.\n\n\t“Shooting across Silicon Valley, Las Vegas, and Taipei isn’t just a logistical choice; it’s part of the storytelling,” Liu says. “The shifting landscapes reflect the characters’ inner dislocation.”\n\n\tAlso in the pipeline: “The Odd Three: Madam Tiger,” designed as a potential pan-Asian character universe, and “Love Me If You Dare,” the latest installment of the “Accidental Influencer” franchise. The latter continues what the founders describe as the series’ balance of humor and vulnerability through characters “learning to love again, to grow up emotionally.”\n\n\tOn genre properties, Chen positions franchise development as creating “interconnected worlds with longevity” rather than straightforward sequels, while Liu emphasizes cultural authenticity. “In Madam Tiger, we’re not retelling the folklore as it was; we’re reframing it,” she says. “These characters are more than mythical superheroes; they’re also reflections of contemporary identity and resilience.”\n\n\tThe company’s track record includes “Little Big Women” and “Dreams in Nightmares,” projects that Chen says demonstrate that commercial and festival success aren’t mutually exclusive. “The key is to start from the story — if it’s emotionally strong and well-executed, it can work in both spaces,” she says.\n\t\n\n\tLiu distinguishes between different forms of industry validation. “Festival recognition gives you credibility, but audience love gives you longevity,” she says. “Our job is to make both happen — not by chasing prestige, but by creating work we genuinely believe in that connects with the audience.”\n\n\tOn representation, Liu argues the conversation needs to move beyond visibility. “It’s not just about who’s in front of the camera, but who gets to greenlight, to decide what stories are worth telling,” she says. “That’s where change truly happens.”\n\n\tChen notes progress in leadership roles: “What we’re seeing now are women who aren’t just participating — they’re leading, financing, and redefining creative culture. If we can help make that the norm rather than the exception, that’s the impact we want to have.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSebastian Stan is getting candid about his time with Marvel. \n\n\tDuring a recent interview on the “Stronger Podcast,” Stan, who played Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier, across seven Marvel films, said the blockbuster giant “really helped” him grow as a person and actor. However, now, at 43 years old, he’s trying to expand past the comic book action.\n\n\t“I have to try to offer something different than before,” Stan said. “And I’ve never favored one role over another. The Marvel stuff, I’ll always, till the end of time, [feel it] really helped me grow as a person and helped me grow as an actor and it taught me relationships and [I worked with] Robert Downey [Jr.] and Scarlett [Johansson] and all these people I looked up to. It was a business. It was a family and it gave me a sense of belonging, and it’s always there for that, but it was only the step one for me.”\n\t\n\n\tStan added that he feels “lucky” that his more refined work in films like “The Apprentice” and “A Different Man” came later in life. He added he looks at “young guys like Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler” and sees them achieving things “I could not have done at their age.”\n\n\tDue to his Romanian heritage, Stan also noted it took some time to fit in with the American movie industry.\n\n\t“There was a significant part of my youth that I had to spend to get Americanized or to fit in and really find my way in a different way,” he explained. “But it’s really now that I feel I’m finally getting to do the stuff I’ve always wanted to do.”\n\n\t2025 was a breakout year for Stan in terms of award recognition. His leading performance in “A Different Man” earned him a Golden Globe. He was also nominated for an Academy Award for best actor for his portrayal of Donald Trump in “The Apprentice.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tT-Series and JP Films have unveiled the first-look poster of Varun Dhawan from the highly anticipated Bollywood war drama “Border 2.”\n\n\tThe poster reveals Dhawan in an intense, action-packed avatar as an Indian soldier on the battlefield, wielding a gun and dressed in full army uniform. The hard-hitting image showcases the actor in what producers are calling a “never-seen-before” transformation, embodying the courage and spirit that has become synonymous with the “Border” franchise.\n\t\n\n\tThe reveal follows the recent unveiling of the first poster featuring franchise star Sunny Deol. With Dhawan’s addition, the film aims to introduce “a new generation of courage” while honoring the legacy of brotherhood and sacrifice that defined the original.\n\n\n\tSet in 1971, “Border” was headlined by Sunny Deol, and took place along the border region of Longewala, where a small battalion of Indian soldiers fought a large Pakistani strike force.\n\n\t“Border 2” is directed by Anurag Singh who previously helmed Akshay Kumar-starring “Kesari” (2019), based on the Battle of Saragarhi in which an army of 21 Sikhs fought against 10,000 Afghans in 1897.\n\n\t“Border 2” boasts an ensemble cast including Deol, Dhawan, Diljit Dosanjh, Ahan Shetty, Medha Rana, Mona Singh and Sonam Bajwa. The film is produced by Bhushan Kumar, J.P. Dutta and Nidhi Dutta, with Krishan Kumar joining as part of the production team.\n\n\tThe sequel is presented by Gulshan Kumar and T-Series in association with J.P. Dutta’s J.P. Films, continuing the franchise’s tradition of honoring the heroism of Indian soldiers through stories of patriotism and sacrifice.\n\t\n\n\t“Border 2” is strategically slated for a Jan. 23, 2026 release, capitalizing on the Republic Day holiday frame to deliver what makers say will be “one of the most anticipated cinematic experiences of 2026.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJane Wu never imagined that her worst portfolio would land her a job that would eventually lead to directing one of Netflix’s most acclaimed animated series. But the “Blue Eye Samurai” director’s unconventional path – from fashion designer to cleanup artist to Marvel storyboard veteran to Emmy-winning animation director – exemplifies the fusion of cultures and disciplines that defines her work.\n\n\tSpeaking at the Taiwan Creative Content Forum, Wu traced her three-decade journey through Hollywood animation and live-action filmmaking, revealing how the COVID-19 pandemic inadvertently created the conditions for international collaboration that made “Blue Eye Samurai” possible.\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Taiwan, Wu immigrated to the U.S. at eight and a half, speaking no English. After studying fashion and costume design at, she opened a comic book store — a decision that would change her career trajectory. “What got me into story was reading those comic books and those wonderful stories that those comic books had,” Wu said. “I was just hooked on story.”\n\n\n\tIn the 1990s, Wu landed her first animation job at Sony with what she describes as “the worst portfolio” — one that showed only that she could draw. Hired for cleanup work, she initially thought the position involved cleaning bathrooms. “That’s how much I didn’t know about the industry,” she admitted.\n\n\tShe quickly moved into character design on “Men in Black” Season 1 before transitioning to storyboarding for Season 2 — despite knowing nothing about it. “How hard can it be?” she recalled thinking. After initially failing and spending a summer teaching herself the craft, something clicked. “I realized I sort of found my voice in storytelling,” Wu said.\n\t\n\n\tWu’s career accelerated through Disney, where she spent years honing her skills, though she struggled with comedy assignments that didn’t suit her action-oriented sensibilities. Her breakthrough came when Joss Whedon contacted her about working on “Avengers,” having heard about her from two separate sources.\n\n\t“It’s really funny, when you go to Disney, you see these big white burly guys, and they do the cutest little drawing, the cutest little scenes. You see this little Asian girl, and I do all the action stuff, it should be the other way around,” Wu said.\n\n\tShe worked on several Marvel films, concluding with “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.” “I had to, right? Because it was the only Chinese superhero, and I had to do it,” she said of her involvement in Marvel’s first Asian-led superhero film.\n\n\tIn 2019, Netflix approached Wu about directing an animated series — an offer she initially declined, having left animation behind. But when her agent mentioned it was for adults, Wu reconsidered. “We only do that in the East. We don’t do that in the West,” she recalled thinking.\n\n\tAs news of COVID-19 spread from Asia, Wu made a calculated decision. “I instinctively knew we could do animation remotely. You could do live action remotely,” she said. Two weeks after accepting the “Blue Eye Samurai” job, the world shut down.\n\n\t“Blue Eye Samurai,” where Wu served as supervising director and producer, became one of the first shows produced 100% remotely, with talent spanning the globe: a stunt team in China, painters in Spain, designers from Japan, and animation studios in France. The production operated as a 24-hour studio across multiple time zones.\n\n\t“What happens when you work remotely is you can work with a broader range of people,” Wu explained. “I really think international collaboration is no longer a scary thing.”\n\n\tWu designed “Blue Eye Samurai” around the concept of fusion, inspired by the show’s biracial protagonist Mizu. “I describe it as if you go to a fusion restaurant, where you can taste where it comes from. But there’s also something, something jazzy going on that is new and inspiring and tastes oh so fresh,” she said.\n\n\tThe production intentionally blended Eastern and Western elements, drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone while incorporating Japanese Bunraku puppet movements and martial arts traditions. Wu, who studied wushu in the U.S., brought her martial arts training to bear on the choreography.\n\t\n\n\tShe emphasized the importance of cultural authenticity while acknowledging the show represents an Asian American interpretation. “This is our interpretation of our culture. Because I honestly believe that in global storytelling, it is not one or the other. It’s the most interesting stories are the ones right in the middle, because you have many points of view in the middle.”\n\n\tWu faced the challenge of teaching a French animation studio, Blue Spirit Animation, to animate Japanese culture accurately. She traveled to France with a suitcase full of kimonos and swords to demonstrate proper movement and clothing details.\n\n\t“It’s not a bathrobe,” she explained of teaching the kimono system. “I had to show them the kimono system and the many layers.” She also taught cultural gestures unfamiliar to Westerners, like the Asian “come here” gesture versus the Western version.\n\n\tWorking with a Chinese stunt team required similar cultural translation. “The Bushido system is very, very different than the Chinese martial arts system,” Wu noted, comparing the Japanese sword system to baseball — “there’s a silence there, and there’s a study of what are you going to do.”\n\n\tWu credited COVID-19 with inadvertently preparing American audiences for international content by teaching them to read subtitles. “Netflix said, Oh my God, there’s no more content because everything is shut down. So we have to order content from different countries,” she said, pointing to “Squid Game” as the breakthrough moment.\n\n\tThe success of “Shogun” particularly moved her. “When I was watching it, there was a meeting room, and it was all Japanese actors, and it was a dramatic part, and it was all subtitled,” Wu said. “I could not believe what I was watching – an American show with all Asian actors.”\n\n\tWu dismissed concerns about following industry trends, focusing instead on character-driven storytelling. “Don’t worry about creating the world. Create the character. Create the story first, because that’s what we do,” she advised.\n\n\tOn artificial intelligence in storytelling, Wu expressed cautious optimism. “I think what AI can’t do is understand how we filter the five senses,” she said. “If you let AI do everything, what you’re going to get out on the other side is something you can’t feel. It might look good, but you can’t feel it.”\n\t\n\n\tShe also broke conventional animation wisdom by hiring character designer Brian Kesinger — a white artist who initially seemed an unlikely choice for the Asian-focused series. “He said, I want to do your characters. I said, I don’t know. He goes, ‘Well, just give me a chance.’ And he did it,” Wu recalled.\n\n\tHer key production principle? “Your pipeline has to support the story, not the other way around.”\n\n\t“Blue Eye Samurai” Season 2 is expected to premiere in 2026. \n",

The Asian Students’ Film competition saw Lee Ji-yun’s “Floating” take the best film award (JPY300,000/$1,955), while jury prizes went to both Chen Li-hsuan’s “Forever and a Day” and Jung Hye-in’s “Reviving the Engine,” each receiving JPY100,000 ($65).\n\n\tThe prestigious Kurosawa Akira Award was presented to two recipients: Lee Sang-il and Chloé Zhao, with each receiving JPY1 million ($6,515).\n\n\tJapanese cinema legends Yamada Yoji and Yoshinaga Sayuri were honored with lifetime achievement awards.\n\n\tThe TIFF Ethical Film Award went to Luciano Vidigal’s “White House,” which received JPY200,000 ($1,300).\n\n\tThe ceremony featured both presenters and awardees favoring dark colors and delivering mostly low-key, apolitical speeches. One exception was best actress co-recipient Kawase Naomi, who appeared bare-shouldered in a dramatic red-and-black gown, a choice perhaps influenced by her many appearances as a director at Cannes, where glamor is a given.\n\n\tComplete list of winners:\n\n\tTokyo Grand Prix / The Governor of Tokyo Award“Palestine 36” \n\n\tSpecial Jury Prize“We Are the Fruits of the Forest” \n\n\tAward for Best DirectorAlessio Rigo de Righi, Matteo Zoppis – “Heads or Tails?” Zhang Lu – “Mothertongue”\n\n\tAward for Best ActressFukuchi Momoko, Kawase Naomi – “Echoes of Motherhood” \n\n\tAward for Best ActorWang Chuanjun – “Mothertongue” \n\n\tAward for Best Artistic Contribution“Mother” \n\n\tAudience Award“Blonde”\n\n\tAsian Future Best Film Award“Halo” \n\n\tAsian Students’ Film Best Film Award“Floating” \n\n\tAsian Students’ Film Jury Prize “Forever and a Day” “Reviving the Engine” \n\n\tKurosawa Akira Award Lee Sang-il and Chloé Zhao \n\n\t38th TIFF Lifetime Achievement Award Yamada Yoji Yoshinaga Sayuri\n\n\tTIFF Ethical Film Award“White House” \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Marrakech Film Festival has revealed the 28 projects and films selected for the 8th edition of the Atlas Workshops, whose patron this year is Romanian director Cristian Mungiu. The event runs from Nov. 30 to Dec. 4.\n\n\tMungiu, who won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2007 for “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,” said: “I am very happy to get back to Marrakech, a vibrant festival that uses the power of cinema to promote and unite people from different corners of the world. I gladly accept the position of patron of the Atlas Workshops for 2025, hoping that from this encounter, both the filmmakers I am going to meet and I myself will have a lot to learn. I believe cinema is a great tool for investigating reality and getting to know the other despite all stereotypes, and that we should use it as a tool to help us focus on what unites us rather than on differences of opinions we might have.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s Atlas Workshops includes:● Twelve projects in development (10 fiction and two documentaries, including five first features) from nine countries: Angola, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Mozambique, Palestine and Tanzania;● Ten films in production or post-production (nine fiction and one documentary, including five debut features) from seven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Yemen;● Five projects from Morocco in the Atlas Close-Ups (five fiction films in development, all of which are first features);● One Moroccan film nearing completion and seeking a festival premiere in the Atlas Film Showcase section.\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s edition of the Atlas Workshops features the most recent film by Palestinian directors Scandar Copti (who won the Étoile d’Or at Marrakech last year for “Happy Holidays”) and Maha Haj (“Personal Affairs,” “Mediterranean Fever”), as well as an adaptation of Augustin Sondé Coulibaly’s 1982 novel “Les Dieux délinquants” by Burkinabe director Boubacar Sangaré (“A Golden Life,” a participant in the 2022 Atlas Workshops). Jordanian director Amjad Al Rasheed (“Inshallah a Boy,” which participated in the 2022 Atlas Workshops and was selected for Critics’ Week at Cannes in 2023) also presents his new project.\n\n\tThe Atlas Workshops also includes new work by Tanzania’s Amil Shivji (“Tug of War,” which was presented at the Toronto Film Festival in 2021); Egyptians Jad Chahine (“The Call of the Brook,” which was selected for La Cinef at Cannes in 2023) and Mohammed Hammad (“Withered Green,” which screened at the Locarno Film Festival in 2016); and Ghana’s Amartei Armar (“Tsutsue,” a short film competition selection at Cannes in 2022). From Lebanon, participants include Vatche Boulghourjian (“Tramontane,” which screened in Critics’ Week at Cannes in 2016); Rami Kodeih, whose work has been presented at the Directors’ Fortnight in Cannes and at the BFI London Film Festival; Mounia Akl, who returns to Marrakech with her second feature film after “Costa Brava, Lebanon,” which was presented at the Venice Film Festival in 2021; and editor Michèle Tyan, who makes her fiction film debut in Marrakech.\n\n\tThe selection brings together Moroccan filmmakers Basma Rkioui (an Atlas Station participant in 2024), Zineb Wakrim, whose “Ayyur” was selected for La Cinef at Cannes in 2023, Laïla Marrakchi (“Marock,” “Rock the Casbah”), and Asmae El Moudir, who won the Étoile d’Or at Marrakech in 2023 for “The Mother of All Lies.” Director Mohamed Zineddaine unveils exclusive first footage from his new fiction film in the Atlas Film Showcase. In addition, the Atlas Close-Ups section features five feature-length projects in development, led by Moroccan filmmakers Halima Elkhatabi, Reda Lahmouid, Zahoua Raji and Ayoub Layoussifi, Shaden Safieddine Tazi and Leyna Tahiri.\n\n\tProjects and films selected for the 2025 Atlas WorkshopsProjects in development“Akal,” Basma Rkioui (Morocco), first feature documentary“Chapa 100,” Ique Langa (Mozambique), second fiction feature“Chentian,” Suha Arraf (Palestine), second fiction feature“A Childhood,” Scandar Copti (Palestine), third feature documentary“Les Dieux Délinquants,” Boubacar Sangaré (Burkina Faso), first fiction feature“Hold Me (If You Want),” Mounia Akl (Lebanon), second fiction feature“Last Cow,” Amil Shivji (Tanzania), second fiction feature“The Marches,” Vatche Boulghourjian (Lebanon), second fiction feature“Siméon Idriss,” Zineb Wakrim (Morocco), first fiction feature“Under Green Skies,” Jad Chahine (Egypt), first fiction feature“Under Her Eye,” Amjad Al Rasheed (Jordan), second fiction feature“Vanda,” Kamy Lara (Angola), first fiction feature\n\t\n\n\tFilms shooting or in post-production“Don’t Let the Sun Go Up on Me,” Asmae El Moudir (Morocco), second feature documentary“Goma Enough Is Enough” (Goma Trop C’est Trop), Elisé Sawasawa (Democratic Republic of the Congo), first feature documentary“Grey Glow” (Lueur Grise), Michèle Tyan (Lebanon), first fiction feature“La Más Dulce,” Laïla Marrakchi (Morocco), third fiction feature“Orient Adagio” (Qitar Al-Sharq Al-Bati’), Maha Haj (Palestine), third fiction feature“Safe Exit,” Mohammed Hammad (Egypt), second fiction feature“The Station,” Sara Ishaq (Yemen), first fiction feature“Trip to Jerusalem,” Michel Zarazir and Gaby Zarazir (Lebanon), first fiction feature“Vagabonds,” Amartei Armar (Ghana), first fiction feature“Wolves,” Rami Kodeih (Lebanon), first fiction feature\n\n\tAtlas Close-Ups“Earth and Ashes” (Terre Et Cendres), Leyna Tahiri (Morocco), first fiction feature“Into the Blue Night” (Vers La Nuit Bleue), Halima Elkhatabi (Morocco), first fiction feature“Remontada,” Reda Lahmouid (Morocco), first fiction feature“The Tanjawi” (Le Tangérois), Zahoua Raji & Ayoub Layoussifi (Morocco), first fiction feature“Today, I Am 25 Years Old,” Shaden Safieddine Tazi (Morocco), first fiction feature\n\n\tAtlas Film Showcase“Until Dawn” (Jusqu’à L’aube), Mohamed Zineddaine (Morocco), fiction feature\n\n\tParticipants and short films in post-production selected for the 2025 Atlas StationAtlas Station – selected Moroccan professionalsLamia BengellounKenza Berrada AmorInes LehaireLinda QibaaZainab RabbaaFadila TahaOumayma Zekri Ajarrai\n\n\tAtlas Station – short films in post-production“Barzakh” (Barzakh: Le Monde Intermédiaire), Kenza Tazi (Morocco), second short fiction film“The Bride of the Rain” (Taslit N’ounzar), Driss Ouaamar (Morocco), first short animated film in production“Deserted Streets” (Rues Désertes), Batoul Benazzou (Morocco), first short fiction film“Mesk Ellil,” Adnane Rami (Morocco), third short fiction film\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Taiwan Creative Content Fest forum, Stories in Motion: From IP to Investment to Global, drilled deep into how Asian stories move through the modern value chain – from original IP to financing to worldwide circulation. \n\n\tMr. Romance CEO Sean Saeyoon Shim and Yungsun Soh, senior VP and MD of A+E Global Media, Korea, one of the most influential women in international entertainment, joined the discussion moderated by DaMou Entertainment CEO Jayde Lin.\n\t\n\n\tThe conversation opened with Korea’s webtoon ecosystem, a prolific source of globally adaptable IP. “Webtoons come pre-tested by audiences. They give producers a solid foundation to gauge demand,” Shim said. “But international viability is just as crucial. For Korea or Taiwan, the key is pursuing themes that feel original and sincere – stories with emotional reach beyond borders.”\n\n\n\tSoh observed that despite surging global attention for Asian content, the path from IP to screen has become more complex. “Streaming competition and rising production costs introduce new pressures. That’s why aligning with partners who share the same creative and strategic vision is more important than ever,” she noted.\n\n\tPackaging remains a decisive factor in investment. Shim shared that he relies on informal audience feedback before aligning with financiers, but emphasized the second phase of the journey: “Once a show is on a platform, the big question is how it breaks through the noise.”\n\n\tSoh also agreed: “Everyone wants to stand out on global streamers. But Asian stories – from Korea and increasingly across the region – are resonating worldwide. Strong storytelling paired with strong marketing will find its audience.”\n\t\n\n\tShim cited “Moving,” the Disney+ hit that took seven years to shape its debut season, as an example of long-arc IP development paying off.\n\n\tLooking ahead to the global market, he sees two critical pathways for markets with shrinking domestic demand: international co-production to share risk and expand reach, and shifting development from B2B to B2C, including blockchain mechanisms that allow audiences to participate as micro-investors or even influence casting. “It creates a new communication channel between producers and viewers,” he noted.\n\n\tShim, CEO of Mr. Romance, who signed a memorandum of understanding with TAICCA in March, admitted that working within government-backed frameworks comes with both security and strings attached. Even so, both speakers were upbeat that the next wave of pan-Asian partnerships – Taiwan firmly in the mix – will push regional IP further onto the global stage.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMediawan Kids & Family is diving into the microdrama space with plans to launch its first vertical animation short-form content next year, president Julien Borde revealed at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest.\n\n\tSpeaking on a panel focused on cross-media IP adaptation, Borde said the animation industry is “really ready” for the burgeoning short-form trend that has dominated Asian markets. “The writers know very well how to tell a story in very, very short form,” he told the audience at the event.\n\t\n\n\tThe move signals a significant strategic move for the Paris-headquartered production and distribution company, which operates more than 80 production companies globally including Method Animation, the studio behind “The Little Prince” franchise. While Borde acknowledged that “Asia and Europe and Western countries in general are less advanced than Asia” in both live-action and animated micro-content, he expressed enthusiasm about the format’s potential.\n\n\n\tThe microdrama discussion highlighted ongoing challenges around monetization and subsidies. Laurent Duvault, vice president of business development and audiovisual rights at Media Participations-Mediatoon, noted that European subsidy systems have yet to catch up with the format. “People keep thinking it’s recycling content when it’s actually brand new content,” Duvault said, adding that finding “a healthy business model and healthy subsidies model” remains a key challenge.\n\n\tBorde suggested that micro-payment systems — already prevalent in Asia — could offer a solution when combined with subscription models. “Some platforms in Europe are testing micro payment,” he said, noting that his company is monitoring how this approach develops.\n\t\n\n\tBoth French executives emphasized their commitment to Asian partnerships, with Mediawan particularly focused on Taiwan. Chief operating officer Jean-Yves Patay has visited Taiwan multiple times, and the company currently has three co-productions with Taiwanese studios — one TV series and two features.\n\n\t“We are here for the long run and for building very strong partnership between Taiwan and France,” Borde said, marking his first visit to the territory.\n\n\tDuvault, representing France’s third-largest publishing group with more than 40 publishers producing 3,500 new books annually, said his team currently has nearly 200 projects in development globally. “One out of 10 should be on screen at the end,” he noted, with 20% of projects based outside France, including in America, Germany, England, Mexico and China.\n\n\tHe revealed a Taiwan-specific win: “Bob & Marley,” an animation project featuring a Taiwanese bear character that he’s now developing with local producers. “When I found out it was [Taiwanese], it became my priority to find a producer here, and magic happens,” Duvault said.\n\n\tThe panel delved into strategies for identifying which literary and comic IPs warrant adaptation. Media Participations leans on what Duvault calls “evergreen” characters — properties that have endured for 30, 40 or 50 years, citing examples like “The Little Prince” and “Astro Boy.”\n\n\tThe company is currently relaunching “The Marsupilamis” for Nickelodeon, a project nearly a decade in the making. “It’s the perfect example to turn a 70-year-old character into something fresh and new,” Duvault said.\n\n\tHowever, he cautioned that evergreens carry risks. “Anytime you come with a new iteration, people may dislike it because it is not the memory they have,” he explained, noting that some recent evergreen adaptations have disappointed when they failed to meet audience expectations formed during childhood.\n\n\tMediawan’s Method Animation has built its reputation on reinventing classic IP, having produced three different iterations of “The Little Prince” — one feature and two series. But Borde said the company is increasingly focused on properties with existing fan engagement. “It’s very hard to establish a new brand in such a fragmented consumption world,” he explained. “More and more we have to come to our partners with something already existing and very strong with billions of views.”\n\t\n\n\tRecent examples include “Ki and Hi,” an anime-adjacent series based on a French manga by YouTuber Kevin Tran that outsells Japanese manga in France, and “Mr. Crocodile,” based on the creation by author Joann Sfar. The series launched on France Televisions and Nick Jr.\n\n\tBoth executives acknowledged the evolving challenges of working with major streamers. “It’s more difficult than in the past, because pay TV is not as important as it was, and you have less slots available at all the streaming companies,” Borde said. Still, he praised partners including Disney (co-producer on “Miraculous Ladybug”), Warner and Nickelodeon for adding value to original concepts.\n\n\tDuvault, who joked about taking calls with Netflix at 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. that morning, noted the platforms’ different approaches to animation versus live action. “Animation is mostly centralized, either Asia or the Western world, mostly America. But if it’s live action, they act local,” he said. “You have to be prepared to have a very harsh legal discussion, very complicated contract.”\n\n\tThe economics remain challenging but necessary. “The payback would be better than the paycheck,” Duvault said.\n\n\tAsked about balancing evergreen IP versus original ideas, Borde stressed the importance of maintaining both. “If TF1 hadn’t take the risk of launching ‘Miraculous Ladybug’ more than 10 years ago, which was something really not known at all, we wouldn’t have had the opportunity to build that brand,” he said. “I want to be positive on new, original ideas, because the market has a tendency to say that only evergreen IPs are being done. And I think it’s not true.”\n\n\tDuvault agreed, noting that success stories like “Miraculous” — which became an evergreen “in less than 10 years” — justify continued investment in fresh voices. “That cash is mostly invested in new talents to make sure that new characters will come tomorrow,” he said.\n\n\tFor both companies, success hinges on finding what Duvault called “authentic, real voices” with “authenticity and freshness and originality” — qualities that transcend whether an IP has a 50-year heritage or launched last year.\n\n\tThe panel was moderated by San Lin, CEO of Sense Creative Management Ltd.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA teaser has been unveiled for “A Teacher’s Gift,” a British South Asian film backed by India’s National Film Development Corporation (NFDC). \n\n\tProduced by Eric Ollerenshaw, directed by Artur Ribeiro (“Terra Nova”), and co-written by and starring Rajdeep Choudhury (“IRaH”) alongside Anjali Patil (“Soch”) and Anthony Calf (“One Day”), “A Teacher’s Gift” follows Rohan, an ambitious Hindi language teacher navigating cultural expectations and personal desires. Set between London and India, the story explores his bond with a sophisticated Englishman – rooted in a shared love for literature and cricket – that transcends barriers of age, culture, and convention, leading to a journey of rediscovery and reconciliation.\n\t\n\n\tThe ensemble cast also includes Paula Lobo Antunes, Dhruv Sehgal, Virgilio Castelo, and Varun Buddhadev.\n\n\n\tThe film had its European premiere at the Tribeca Festival Lisboa 2025, with Rui Tendinha, Tribeca programmer in Lisbon, describing the film as “a beautiful fusion of cultures and a heart touching emotional story.”\n\n\tThe film played in Lisbon on the heels of earning a best feature film nomination at the BAFTA and BIFA-qualifying Iris Prize Film Festival in Wales. \n\n\t“For an independent British film that started its journey in the U.K. with a predominantly South Asian crew, then received support from NFDC WAVES Film Bazaar, and now selected and shown at Tribeca, has been an incredible journey,” said Ollerenshaw, a former Member of the U.K. Parliament.\n\n\tThe premiere was attended by Francisco Pedro Balsemão, CEO of Impressa, Portugal’s largest media company and one of the key figures behind bringing the Tribeca Film Festival to Lisbon. Balsemão appreciated the inclusion of “A Teacher’s Gift” in the program, noting it demonstrates Tribeca and Tribeca Lisboa’s commitment to promoting stories and artists from around the world.\n\t\n\n\tThe Tribeca Festival Lisboa 2025, co-founded by Robert De Niro, brought the iconic New York festival experience to Europe. This year’s edition featured appearances by Kim Cattrall, Giancarlo Esposito, and Meg Ryan, along with the Portuguese premiere of “Honeyjoon,” winner of the 2024 Tribeca Festival AT&T Untold Stories Award.\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n\n",

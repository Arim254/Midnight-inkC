    "body": "\n\tIf there was a scene that perfectly captured this year’s BFI London Film Festival — and its growing importance on the awards calendar — it was around midday on the fest’s first Sunday at Soho House’s flashy hangout 180 The Strand.\n\n\tIn a chaotic room bursting with guests and where elbow room was at an absolute premium, Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac, Mia Goth, Colin Farrell, Rian Johnson, Joel Edgerton, Felicity Jones and Kerry Condon graciously juggled meet-and-greets as trays of canapes were navigated between bodies with expert precision. Meanwhile, away from the noise and toward the — slightly — less crowded pool area outside, Guillermo de Toro held court at a table and, further down, Noah Baumbach casually chatted with a group including awards vet Lisa Taback.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s annual brunch has been a hugely popular LFF stop since it started just a few years ago, giving voters, industry movers and the press the chance to have a brief, friendly and PR-coordinated chinwag with a small selection of the streamer’s film talent over a (well-concocted) Bloody Mary. In 2024, “Emilia Pérez” star Selena Gomez brought some A-list pizazz to the event (sparking multiple selfie requests). But the 2025 edition was something else. Netflix was, as one guest noted, “really going for it.”\n\n\n\tIt wasn’t the only one.\n\n\tWhile LFF may be a public-facing event, for many in the industry it’s also risen to become the unofficial starter gun for awards season (at least from the international courting perspective), and where studios, streamers and indie distributors are now throwing resources — and star power — like never before.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s like there’s a film festival and a whole other awards festival happening alongside it,” says one seasoned awards veteran, who points out one of the chief reasons why — London has the largest concentration of AMPAS voters outside of the U.S. Some 800 reside in the U.K., 7% of the total, while across Europe the number more than doubles to 1,750 or 15% (many of whom flew in for the festival). And these are figures that have been rising steadily.\n\n\tThis year’s Oscars underlined the importance of the ever-growing international bloc — with multiple statuettes, including best picture, for Palme d’Or winner “Anora” and surprise win for silent Latvian indie animation “Flow.” To capture a large chunk of these voters in one easy swoop, London has become an extremely efficient place to start.\n\n\tWith that in mind — and with the 2025 festival lineup containing almost every title expected to be in awards contention — this year has seen more industry offerings, special screenings and Q&As than ever before, with many films getting multiple events. Among those that insiders suggested were being given a noticeable push were Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly,” del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia,” Luca Guadagnino’s “After the Hunt” and Nia DaCosta’s “Hedda.” (There were some notable absentees, of course — Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme,” already considered a dead cert for the awards race, didn’t make it to London).\n\n\t“We’ve seen a real confidence from studios and the independent sector that LFF has become the perfect opportunity to launch awards campaigns with gusto,” says DDA’s vice president of awards Sam Ross, speaking the morning after an evening in which his team oversaw five events. Ross notes that, while most of the movies premiered at other festivals and may have had “the odd” awards screening in the U.S. already, LFF was the “first time that all these films are together in one festival — so from our side it’s 10 days packed out with high-quality films and top talent filing out screening rooms and attending all the festival adjacent events.”\n\n\tAnd these events are becoming more elaborate, impressive and expensive. Alongside the festival screenings and red carpets, there have been multiple screenings and Q&As for BAFTA voters, AMPAS voters and at the various guilds, plus dinners, receptions, tastemaker events and parties. One awards insider said that London’s more popular screening venues had been “booked out for months” (and were also booked out until the end of the year). And then there’s the third-party events, with AMPAS hosting its annual reception for new members and the Golden Globes now having joined the fray — its cocktail reception at the Dorchester Hotel this year drew the likes of Channing Tatum from “Roofman,” Amanda Seyfried from “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Tessa Thompson from “Hedda” and Claire Foy from “H Is for Hawk.”\n\t\n\n\tFor “Hamnet,” BAFTA voters were offered three opportunities to see the film, one followed by a Q&A with Zhao and her lead cast, including Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley, and another with a Q&A with Zhao and her heads of department.\n\n\t“Frankenstein,” meanwhile, alongside Elordi, Isaac, Goth and del Toro’s presence at the Netflix brunch and several other special events, was given an entire exhibition — with film props, artwork and costumes displayed at the Old Selfridges Hotel next to the famed department store. Ahead of its public opening, Netflix bussed guests to the exhibition from a special screening of the film at BAFTA headquarters, where del Toro and stars gave an introduction. “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” the Mexican auteur’s last film, previously world premiered in London on its way to winning the best animation Oscar.\n\n\tSuch is London’s growing status, that talent looking to court votes are now having to give it much more than the cursory 24-hour visit they might have done in previous years.\n\n\t“Many are now coming into town and spending a few days here — and across those days are doing multiple events,” says Ross, who says that distributors are now planning entire European tours around their film’s London dates.\n\n\tThe hectic nature of it all has not gone unnoticed, with talent being whisked back and forth around the capital to events often happening simultaneously. Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, Cailee Spaeny, Kerry Washington and other stars of Rian Johnson’s LFF opening night film “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” hit the stage at the Royal Festival Hall to present the film, were swiftly transported over the Thames to the Ham Yard Hotel for a Netflix tastemaker screening Q&A (where Josh O’Connor, who narrowly missed the premiere after returning from a shoot, joined them), and then went back in time for the opening night party.\n\n\tJon M. Chu didn’t even have a film in the festival program — “Wicked: For Good” is not launching until November — yet was on an impressive, diary-busting charm offensive for the first half of the festival, with perhaps a hope that international voters might get him the best director Oscar nomination he missed out on last time. Alongside an extensive on-stage screen talk at the BFI Southbank, Chu was honored at a special BFI lunch, joined the cast of the “Wicked” West End musical on stage at the Apollo Victoria Theatre and even introduced a special screening of “Singing in the Rain” and “2001: A Space Odyssey” at the popular arthouse Genesis cinema.\n\t\n\n\tWith the voter count growing and more production and talent shifting to the U.K., London’s new status as an awards season curtain raiser — one that has been brewing for several years — doesn’t appear to be going anywhere soon. But any further growth might require at least one change.\n\n\tAs one attendee at the Netflix brunch noted: “They need to get a bigger venue next time.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures International Productions is set to showcase its IP adaptation playbook at the Tokyo International Film Festival‘s TIFFCOM content market, with executive VP of creative production and head of SPIP Shebnem Askin leading a deep dive into the studio’s strategy for turning local hits into global franchises.\n\n\tThe session comes as international interest in IP adaptations reaches fever pitch across the content industry. SPIP, which has carved out a distinctive niche producing local-language films across 10 countries, will pull back the curtain on how it strategically develops remake projects and localizes IP across diverse markets.\n\t\n\n\tAskin’s presentation will spotlight SPIP’s track record of cross-cultural adaptations, including the Spanish remake of Argentine IP “Ten Days Without Mom” (“Padre No Hay Más Que Uno”), the Spanish reimagining of Italian property “I Hate Summer,” and multiple adaptations of French IP “Price of Parenting” in Italy, Mexico and Spain. The studio has also produced a Thai remake of “50 First Dates,” a Brazilian version of “Friends with Benefits,” and Italian and Mexican remakes of SPIP’s German production “25 km/h.”\n\n\n\tJapanese IP figures prominently in SPIP’s strategy. The division recently produced a Mexican adaptation of “Shall We Dance?” and secured international distribution rights for the Chinese remake of “YOLO,” the comedy-drama from China’s top-grossing female director Jia Ling.\n\n\tUnder Askin’s leadership, SPIP has built a robust theatrical business anchored by three local-language franchises: the “3 Investigators” movies in Germany, “Father is the Only One” in Spain, and the powerhouse “Kingdom” franchise in Japan. Recent releases include Korean thriller “Highjack, 1971,” Taiwanese feature “Dead Talents Society,” Mamoru Hosoda’s “Scarlet,” and the studio’s first Thai production.\n\t\n\n\tBeyond theatrical releases, SPIP has delivered 11 direct-to-streaming movies for Amazon Prime, Netflix and Max in Mexico over the past three years, including Argentine film “The Heart Knows” and Netflix Italy originals “The Price of Family” and its sequel “The Price of Nonna’s Inheritance.”\n\n\tThe newly rebranded Tokyo IP Market: Adaptation & Remake launches its first open pitch session featuring Kadokawa, Kodansha, Shufu to Seikatsu Sha, Square Enix, Toei and Nihonbungeisha. The expanded market now includes visual content production companies alongside publishers holding original rights to Japanese manga and novels. Other highlighted programming includes a keynote from Tetsu Fujimura on the “One Piece” live-action adaptation and Japanese IP, Japanese animation seminars featuring Studio4°C, and the MPA/DHU/TIFFCOM Pitching Contest with “Elvis” producer Schuyler Weiss among the judges. The Tokyo Gap-Financing Market has selected 23 projects for presentation.\n\n\tTIFFCOM is organized by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and Unijapan.\n\n\tThe 22nd edition of TIFFCOM runs Oct. 29-31 at Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Trade Center Hamamatsucho-Kan during the Tokyo International Film Festival. The market aims to foster international co-productions and content business development through seminars, project markets, pitch contests and networking opportunities.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLYON, France — Speaking at the International Classic Film Market (MIFC) in Lyon as YouTube celebrates its 20th anniversary, Justine Ryst, head of the platform’s France & Southern Europe branch, opened with a bold statement: “YouTube is ‘the platform’ for heritage film, a place where culture endures (…) bridging generations of audiences.”\n\n\tAddressing an industry crowd from across Europe at the world’s biggest market dedicated to the business of classic film, Ryst described YouTube as an ally in keeping cinema history alive. Though she was speaking from the perspective of the French market, her remarks resonated far beyond France’s borders. “In the U.S.,” she reminded the crowd, “YouTube has become the most-watched video provider on television, outpacing traditional TV and other platforms.”\n\t\n\n\tRyst described YouTube as a space where contemporary viewing habits and classics meet – a kind of afterlife for cinema and television history, where the films find new audiences online.\n\n\n\t“On YouTube,” she went on, “films and programs don’t disappear, they live again through clips, restorations, recommendations, and new forms of engagement.” For Ryst, this ongoing dialogue between generations of viewers is central to the platform’s role in cultural preservation. “We see young audiences discovering films their parents loved, often through a thumbnail, a remix, or a short clip that draws them back to the original work,” she said. She highlighted the growing influence of creators who produce curated film shows, giving new life to heritage cinema for digital-native audiences.\n\t\n\n\tRyst was careful to underline a distinction often misunderstood in the public debate: YouTube, she said, “is not a channel but a platform.” It does not produce or editorialize content –it provides an infrastructure governed by algorithms and community guidelines.\n\n\t“YouTube is regulated by strict rules, and we take our responsibility seriously,” she emphasized, while adding that its defining feature remains its personalization. “Show me your YouTube and I’ll tell you who you are,” she said, to laughter from the audience.\n\n\tRyst highlighted a couple of French institutions that have embraced YouTube as a cornerstone of their digital strategy. The first is the Institut National de l’Audiovisuel (INA), the country’s vast audiovisual archive, which has uploaded thousands of hours of content ranging from classic television to historic interviews, disseminated across some 50 thematic channels. “INA has developed a masterclass in multi-format strategy,” she said. “You can make short vertical clips, long videos of 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or even 90 minutes. You can do podcasts, live streams. They have thousands of excerpts on every subject, uploaded with agility to match current social topics. It’s a case study in bringing images from 50 years ago back to light.”\n\n\tThe second is Arte, the Franco-German cultural channel, which she praised for what she called its “strategy of omnipresence” across linear TV, its website and more than 30 thematic channels on YouTube, enabling it to reach multiple audiences across a spectrum of interests, ranging from arthouse cinema to pop culture and science. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJustine Ryst and Thierry Frémaux \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Lise Pedersen\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“These examples show that it’s not about competing with the platform, but using it to amplify reach,” Ryst said.\n\n\tTurning to the future, Ryst addressed the growing role of artificial intelligence in YouTube’s ecosystem, especially in areas like dubbing and translation. She described how these tools could expand access to French and European works, helping them travel more easily across languages and borders.\n\n\t“These tools can be incredibly powerful for rights holders to take their work as far as possible,” she said. “It’s valuable when rights holders develop a direct community on YouTube – what I call a live asset. When you then go to distributors or represent other films, you can demonstrate that your YouTube community represents thousands, even millions of subscribers, and that you have millions of hours of content in your asset. That’s credibility.”\n\t\n\n\tHer reflections align with YouTube’s global strategy, highlighted at this week’s Mipcom, where the platform’s significant presence underscored its role in the creator economy and TV at large. Industry leaders discussed how YouTube bridges traditional media and digital content, fostering new business models and collaboration with major studios.\n\n\tClosing her talk, Ryst reflected on YouTube’s longevity as both a tech company and cultural platform. “We’ve been around for 20 years,” she said, “and we hope to be around for at least another 20.”\n\n\tRunning alongside the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon, France, the MIFC closes on Oct. 17.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Foundation” and “Miss Austen” star Synnove Karlsen will make her New York theatrical debut as Eliza Doolittle in Gingold Theatrical Group’s production of George Bernard Shaw‘s “Pygmalion.”\n\n\tMark Evans (“Waitress,” “The Play That Goes Wrong”) will star opposite Karlsen as Professor Henry Higgins in Shaw’s celebrated work, which inspired the musical “My Fair Lady.” Set in pre-World War I London, the comedy lampoons the rigid British class system and explores women’s independence as a celebrated professor of phonetics wagers that he can pass a bedraggled Cockney flower girl off as a duchess by teaching her the tools of education.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a real joy to be joining ‘Pygmalion’ off-Broadway and to be playing Eliza Doolittle,” Karlsen tells Variety. “Eliza is a fiercely intelligent woman who throws herself wholeheartedly at the chance to build a better life for herself. What I love most about Eliza is her fire, her wit and her refusal to stay in the box society has put her in. I’m very excited to work with this wonderful team of actors and to be working in New York for the first time.”\n\n\n\tThe New York production follows Karlsen’s U.K. stage debut earlier this year in Laura Lomas’ “The House Party,” a reimagining of August Strindberg’s “Miss Julie” directed by Headlong’s artistic director Holly Race Roughan.\n\n\tKarlsen starred in Season 3 of Apple TV Plus’ acclaimed sci-fi epic “Foundation” as new series regular Bayta Mallow, joining returning stars Lee Pace and Jared Harris. Based on Isaac Asimov’s revered trilogy, the series is consistently ranked in Apple TV Plus’ global top 10.\n\t\n\n\tEarlier this year, she starred as Cassandra Austen in “Miss Austen” for BBC and Masterpiece, an adaptation of Gill Hornby’s best-selling novel written by BAFTA winner Andrea Gibb (“Elizabeth Is Missing,” “Mayflies”). Keeley Hawes played Cassandra in her later years.\n\n\tKarlsen’s previous credits include Netflix’s “Bodies” alongside Stephen Graham and Shira Haas, and the key role of Jocasta in Edgar Wright’s “Last Night in Soho,” the psychological horror starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Thomasin McKenzie and Matt Smith. She is also known for her leading television role in the BBC psychological thriller “Clique” and her role as Clarice Orsini in Netflix’s “Medici: The Magnificent.”\n\n\tAdapted and directed by David Staller, “Pygmalion” will have a five-week limited engagement at Theatre Row’s Theater 5. Previews begin Oct. 22, with opening night set for Nov. 2 and the final performance on Nov. 22.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMidnight Chimes and the Mise En Scène Company have unveiled additional first-look images from “Forelock,” a dark comedy starring David Krumholtz that will premiere as an opening night marquee selection at the Austin Film Festival on Oct. 23.\n\n\tThe “Oppenheimer” actor, who also executive produces, is stepping into gritty character actor territory with the indie film, marking the solo feature directorial debut of writer-director Caleb Alexander Smith, who also stars.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDavid Krumholtz – “Forelock”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMidnight Chimes\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Playing Randy was a chance to pay homage to the character portrayals of actors like Nicholson, Pacino, and Dustin Hoffman – those unsavory underdog characters you can’t help but root for,” Krumholtz says. “My Ratso Rizzo moment was perfectly imagined in a modern context by Caleb.”\n\n\n\tThe reference to Ratso Rizzo – Dustin Hoffman’s iconic downtrodden hustler from 1969’s “Midnight Cowboy” – signals the kind of meaty, morally ambiguous character role that allows actors to showcase their dramatic range.\n\n\tThe film follows Caiden (Smith), a hapless fitness enthusiast who moves to Los Angeles dreaming of becoming a trainer, only to be diverted by Randy (Krumholtz), an opportunistic Hollywood Boulevard grifter who exploits his likeness to the world’s most famous superhero. The pair must hustle their way out of trouble involving a temperamental drug boss and a whimsical cop investigating a celebrity murder.\n\n\t“Forelock,” named for the iconic curl on a certain superhero’s forehead, draws from Smith’s real-life experience as a superhero lookalike after arriving in Los Angeles, where he was told to “go stand on Hollywood Boulevard.”\n\t\n\n\tShot entirely on location in Los Angeles, the film takes an unflinching look at the city, from the homeless crisis and public disorder to mansion dwellers in Bel Air.\n\n\t“‘Forelock’ is somewhere between a love letter to LA and a passionately scrawled breakup note, crumpled and hurled at the face of a city full of potential and contradiction,” Smith says. “Inspired by how ‘Midnight Cowboy’ shined a light on the grit of late ’60s Manhattan, we strove to capture a frighteningly authentic snapshot of downtown Hollywood.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCaleb Alexander Smith – “Forelock”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMidnight Chimes\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs executive producer, Krumholtz says he wanted to be more than just a performer on set. “Making any indie is an uphill battle, but making one on the streets of Los Angeles is particularly thorny,” he notes. “What results is a dynamic and comedic thrill ride that capitalizes on the relatable themes of a specific brand of desperation: Hollywood desperation.”\n\n\tThe Austin Film Festival, now in its 32nd year, is showcasing “Forelock” in its marquee lineup alongside Texas premieres of Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” and Park Chan Wook’s “No Other Choice.”\n\n\tRoberto Schaefer (“Quantum of Solace,” “Stranger Than Fiction”) served as cinematographer. The film was produced by Midnight Chimes, founded by Smith and entrepreneur Lindsay McCormick.\n\n\tKrumholtz’s upcoming slate includes “Deliver me from Nowhere,” A24’s “Altar” and a role as Zor-El in DC Studios’ 2026 tentpole “Supergirl.”\n\n\tSmith has television credits including “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and “Modern Family” and is set to recur on Ryan Murphy’s upcoming Hulu series “All’s Fair,” whose recently released trailer became the streamer’s biggest ever trailer launch with over 57 million views in 24 hours.\n\n\tThe Mise En Scène Company is handling global sales.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCaleb Alexander Smith, David Krumholtz – “Forelock”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMidnight Chimes\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCarlotta Films is set to co-produce “Twist & Shoot Mister Suzuki,” an ambitious new documentary on Japanese cult auteur Seijun Suzuki, directed by Yves Montmayeur (“Sangre del Toro”).\n\n\tThe leading French classic film distributor announced the project at the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon, where Suzuki is being honored with a five-film retrospective, including the world premiere of the restored “Carmen from Kawachi,” screening for the first time outside Japan.\n\t\n\n\tA co-production between Brilliant Pictures, Beall Productions and Carlotta Films, in partnership with Nikkatsu Corporation – which holds global rights to nearly all of Suzuki’s films – the documentary will explore the life and legacy of the filmmaker who redefined postwar Japanese cinema with cult classics such as “Tokyo Drifter” and “Branded to Kill.”\n\n\n\tWorking within the rigid studio system of 1960s Japan, Suzuki broke every rule in the book, turning out wild gangster movies packed with pop-art color, absurd humor and radical editing. Though often dismissed at the time, his films went on to influence generations of filmmakers, from Jim Jarmusch, Quentin Tarantino and Wong Kar-wai to Baz Luhrmann, Damien Chazelle, John Woo and Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\n\tThe documentary will trace Suzuki’s singular vision through rare archival material, interviews with Suzuki himself, his regular leading man Joe Shishido, and longtime production designer Takeo Kimura, alongside contemporary directors inspired by his work.\n\n\tMontmayeur, a specialist of Japanese cinema (“Citizen Kitano,” “Tokyo Paranormal”) and currently in Lyon to present his Guillermo del Toro documentary “Sangre del Toro,” said the film will mirror Suzuki’s “free jazz style,” breaking from traditional documentary conventions.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBranded to Kill\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile centered on film, the documentary will also explore how Suzuki’s visual signature rippled across other art forms, from manga whose bold framing and frenetic rhythm owe much to Suzuki’s pop sensibility, to contemporary visual art, where his playful disregard for convention has left an indelible mark.\n\n\tCarlotta’s collaboration with Nikkatsu extends beyond the film. The French distributor is spearheading a major campaign to reintroduce Suzuki’s work to global audiences, starting with the Lumière screenings and continuing with an 11-film theatrical and home entertainment rollout next year.\n\n\tThe project reflects Carlotta’s broader philosophy, founder Vincent Paul-Boncour told Variety. “Carlotta Films has always sought to go beyond a ‘simple’ film release or retrospective. Following our documentaries on Kinuyo Tanaka, Kiju Yoshida and Bollywood cinema, this collaboration with Yves Montmayeur will offer audiences a deeper understanding of Suzuki’s work and help expand its reach across platforms and media.”  \n\n\tAlongside the Suzuki project, Carlotta arrives at the Lumière Festival’s 13th Marché International du Film Classique (MIFC) with a string of high-profile acquisitions. The French distributor has picked up “Queen Kelly” (1929), Erich von Stroheim’s legendary unfinished silent classic, in a newly reconstructed and never-before-seen 4K-restored version. The film, acquired from Kino Lorber on behalf of Milestone Films, screens this week in Lyon as part of the festival’s “Sublimes Moments du Muet” section.\n\n\tCarlotta is also expanding its Hungarian slate with 14 restored titles by Miklós Jancsó, acquired from the National Film Institute – Film Archive in Budapest, including cult works “The Round-Up” (1966) and “Red Psalm” (1972), alongside rarer gems like “Electra, My Love” (1974) and “Hungarian Rhapsody” (1979). Hungary is this year’s guest of honor at the MIFC.\n\n\tThe Lumière Film Festival runs in and around Lyon until Oct. 19, with the MIFC closing on Oct. 17.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBritain’s media regulator Ofcom has found that the BBC documentary “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone” broke broadcasting rules by “materially misleading” audiences, concluding a months-long investigation that began after the controversial program was pulled from BBC iPlayer in February.\n\n\tThe ruling, announced Friday, found what Ofcom described as a “serious breach” of its rules and will require the BBC to broadcast a statement of Ofcom’s findings on BBC Two at 9 p.m. on a date to be confirmed.\n\t\n\n\tOfcom’s investigation found that the documentary’s failure to disclose that the 13-year-old narrator’s father held a position in the Hamas-run administration constituted a material breach of rules requiring factual programs to provide audiences with accurate information. The narrator, Abdullah, is the son of Ayman Alyazouri, who served as Hamas’s deputy minister of agriculture.\n\n\n\t“It meant that the audience did not have critical information which may have been highly relevant to their assessment of the narrator and the information he provided,” Ofcom stated in its findings.\n\n\tThe regulator emphasized the severity of the breach, noting that trust is fundamental to the relationship between broadcasters and their audiences, particularly for public service broadcasters like the BBC. “This failing had the potential to erode the significantly high levels of trust that audiences would have placed in a BBC factual program about the Israel-Gaza war,” Ofcom said.\n\n\tA BBC spokesperson told Variety: “The Ofcom ruling is in line with the findings of Peter Johnston’s review, that there was a significant failing in the documentary in relation to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines on accuracy, which reflects Rule 2.2 of Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code. We have apologized for this and we accept Ofcom’s decision in full. We will comply with the sanction as soon as the date and wording are finalized.”\n\t\n\n\tThe investigation was launched in July after Ofcom examined the BBC’s own internal review, which had concluded the program breached the corporation’s editorial guidelines on accuracy. Ofcom also considered 20 complaints from viewers that had completed the “BBC First” process, the initial step required before the regulator can intervene.\n\n\tThe documentary, produced by independent company Hoyo Films, aired on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer in February before being removed from the streaming platform five days later amid growing questions about the contributors’ backgrounds.\n\n\tThe BBC’s internal review — conducted by Peter Johnston, director of editorial complaints and reviews — found that three members of Hoyo Films knew about the narrator’s father’s position when the program first aired, but no one at the BBC was aware of this information at the time. While the review determined that Hoyo Films did not intentionally mislead the corporation, it concluded the production company bore most of the responsibility for the oversight.\n\n\tCrucially, the BBC review found no other breaches of editorial guidelines, including on impartiality, and no evidence that outside interests “inappropriately impacted on the program” or that the narrator’s father or family influenced its content.\n\n\tBBC director-general Tim Davie apologized in July when the internal review findings were published. “Peter Johnston’s report identifies a significant failing in relation to accuracy in this documentary,” Davie said at the time. “I thank him for his thorough work and I am sorry for this failing.”\n\n\tThe broadcaster implemented new editorial safeguards following the review, including enhanced scrutiny of narrators for contested current affairs programs, strengthened editorial controls with “First Gate” and “Final Gate” approval processes, and the creation of a new director role for long-form news content. The BBC confirmed it has no current or future planned commissions with Hoyo Films.\n\n\tThe controversy attracted significant political attention, with U.K. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy questioning why no disciplinary action had been taken against BBC staff. The case also divided public opinion, with over 500 public figures signing an open letter opposing what they characterized as a politicized backlash against the documentary, while other groups criticized the BBC’s Gaza coverage more broadly.\n\t\n\n\tBBC chair Samir Shah and Davie appeared before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in September to answer questions about the documentary and other editorial matters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt a session titled “Claynosaurz: Rise of the Interactive Franchises: Why the Future Belongs to Creators,” Claynosaurz co-founder and creative director Nic Cabana told a packed View Conference room in Turin what many studios suspect but struggle to operationalize: Audience behavior has outpaced linear release cycles and the next franchises should consider building in public, across platforms, with fans inside the tent from day one.\n\n\t“Entertainment’s nonlinear,” Cabana said, adding that for creators, “Distribution is free.” His thesis: if you design for the way people already move through culture with short-form video, games, GIFs, digital stickers, toys, pop-ups, the “show” becomes only one node in a networked IP. “Kids want interaction, especially today,” he said. “We create with the internet. We don’t silo ourselves.”\n\t\n\n\tCabana sketched a rapid three-year ramp for Claynosaurz, the dinosaur-driven transmedia brand launched by alumni from Sony, DreamWorks, Illumination and Disney. The team self-funded an initial short, which later won a Webby, then used a drop of 10,000 high-fidelity digital collectibles as a crowdfunding mechanism. Those avatars now flow through every surface of the brand from social clips, a forthcoming mobile game with Gameloft, merchandise, live events and, soon, a YouTube-native show co-produced with Mediawan, recently reported by Variety.\n\n\n\t“We’re in development for an episodic show. It’s gonna be 40 episodes, 7 minutes. We’re gonna go straight to YouTube,” Cabana said. The choice is deliberate: Episodes are modular, ‘Family-Guy’-style, so discovery can start anywhere the algorithm lands a viewer. In parallel, Gameloft is building a long-form mobile game; Claynosaurz is also layering a loyalty system and “proof-of-view” tech that can reward accounts for watching specific episodes, turning viewing into a gamified viewing loop. \n\t\n\n\tThe content lab runs on nonstop A/B testing. The team “make thumbstopping content on social media,” think short reels, evergreen mini-stories, trend “cameos” when they fit, and measure what travels organically. “We do not cheat the algorithm,” Cabana insisted. The numbers he cited: roughly 910,000 followers across platforms, videos approaching one billion views, some individual clips near 60 million, and about 300 million views for Claynosaurz GIFs on Giphy. This is a company with much in common with the tech startup sector’s approach of capturing an audience fast and mastering monetisation later.\n\n\tCrucially, the audience isn’t only engaged, it’s enlisted. “We consider them co-creators,” Cabana said, pointing to recurring “casting” of community avatars into shorts, hiring prolific fan artists onto the team, releasing free rigs for students at France’s Annecy Animation Festival, and encouraging memes, fan art and remixes, something traditional IP may struggle to get passed legal departments. Building “in the open,” he argued, is a creative superpower: rough storyboards, concept sheets and desk videos spark comment-driven micro-iterations and deepen buy-in well before release.\n\n\tCabana said it’s latest digital Telegram sticker pack sold $223,000 worth in 20 seconds, while the latest digital collection launch of Popkins  drew $18 million in demand. That strange phrasing “in demand” used a random blind box system whereby anyone could buy in but only a portion of participants won a Popkin character. Those who missed out were refunded automatically. The novel strategy virtually guaranteed an instant sell out and provided tangible data of what true consumer demand was in real time. He framed the strategy bluntly, “We de-risk IP by prepackaging it with culture in advance.”\n\n\tBy Cabana’s account, the approach has already shifted the company’s leverage with incumbents. “You do not need the studio system,” he said.“We made $3,000,000 in our first year… we’ve made $11 million total in year three,”  he told Variety, adding that the broader collectible ecosystem trades around $40,000,000 in value with the company receiving royalties on every trade. Organic traction, he argued, translates into better-structured talks with streamers, toy companies and distributors, as the audience is demonstrably there.\n\t\n\n\tFor studios, Cabana’s message is part provocation and part market signal. The target product may be a YouTube series instead of a pilot; the marketing may be the making-of itself; the IP bible may be updated weekly by the community. “Our mantra was… we’re going to meet the audiences where they’re at, which is everywhere. Entertainment is clearly nonlinear now,” he said.\n\n\tThe north star, he suggested, is brand memory: not just a show someone watched, but a sticker they used, a pop-up they queued for, a toy they unboxed, a short you shared with a friend because “that’s so you.”\n\n\tThere’s nothing theoretical about the urgency for studios to take note of different approaches, Cabana pointed to peers following adjacent tracks from Glitch’s “Digital Circus” to creator-merch viral character Nobody Sausage as proof the model scales when characters, not formats, are prioritised. From that broad, passionate fanbase, characters can later be slotted into film and series formats or anything else one might imagine.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Sharjah Intl. Film Festival for Children and Youth, now in its 12th edition (Oct. 6-12), affirmed its growing stature as one of the Arab world’s most dynamic and globally connected showcases for new cinema. This year’s program featured 76 films from 26 countries, selected from over 1,700 submissions, including first time entries from Sao Tomé and Principe, Belize and Ecuador, reflecting both an expanding international reach and deepening artistic ambition. From intimate animations to socially-charged dramas and visually-daring documentaries, SIFF celebrated stories that blend emotional honesty with creative risk.\n\t\n\n\tThe festival’s launch of the Global Children and Youth Film Congress underscored its evolving role not just as a screening platform, but as a space for dialogue, mentorship and cross-cultural collaboration. More than ever, the films in competition demonstrated how stories rooted in youth perspectives can carry striking emotional and political weight, exploring identity, resilience, and belonging through fresh perspectives.\n\n\n\tAmong this year’s standouts were works that redefined what youth and family cinema can be: emotionally-sophisticated, visually ambitious and deeply human.\n\n\tAnimated Feature Films‘Miss Moxy’ (2025)(Wip Vernooij and Vincent Bal, Netherlands, Belgium. Produced by Jolande Junte and Petra Goedings)A highlight of this year’s Sharjah Film Festival, “Miss Moxy” took home the award for best animated feature, charming audiences with its warmth and wit. Directed by Vincent Bal and Wip Vernooij, the film follows a pampered cat who gets lost while on holiday and embarks on an unexpected odyssey across Southern Europe alongside a goofy dog and a wise old bird, the very creatures she once disdained. Featuring the voices of Carice van Houten, Sarah Bannier and Tom Vermeir, this co-production from Phanta Animation, BosBros and Eyeworks Film & TV Drama balances playful adventure with heartfelt lessons about empathy and belonging. In addition to its big win in Sharjah, it took home the audience award at Poland’s Tauron Young Horizons Festival this October.\n\t\n\n\t‘Jumbo’ (2025)(Ryan Adriandhy, Indonesia. Produced by Anggia Kharisma and Novia Puspa Sari)Directed by Ryan Adriandhy and produced by Anggia Kharisma and Novia Puspa Sari for Visinema Studios, “Jumbo” is a landmark Indonesian animated feature that shattered records as the country’s most-watched film and Southeast Asia’s highest-grossing animated feature. The heartfelt fantasy follows Don, a bullied orphan who befriends a ghost named Meri on a quest to reunite her with her parents, discovering courage and friendship along the way. Crafted over five years by 400 local artists, “Jumbo” blends emotional depth, dazzling visuals and universal storytelling that speaks to the child in everyone\n\n\tFeature Films‘My Driver and I’ (Salma wa Gamar, 2024)(Ahd Kamel, Saudi Arabia. Produced by Georgie Paget and Thembisa Cochrane)Winner of the Feature Film Competition at the Sharjah Film Festival, “My Driver and I” marks Ahd Kamel’s powerful debut feature. Set in 1980s and ’90s Jeddah, the film follows a young Saudi girl and her Sudanese driver whose unlikely friendship defies social boundaries and time. Loosely drawn from Kamel’s own childhood, the OSN+ Original is, in her own words, “a story about love, loss and the invisible ties that shape who we become.” Crafted with quiet elegance, the film captures how personal memory can become universal truth.\n\n\t‘Hajeer’ (2024)(Sara Talab, Saudi Arabia. Produced by Amal Alhajjar)Directed by Sara Talab, this evocative period drama unfolds in 1960s Jeddah, where a young musician’s life is upended when illness robs him of his hearing. Abandoned by society yet driven by resilience, Hajeer transforms silence into strength, composing a symphony of redemption and love. With heartfelt performances from Abdul Aziz Faisal, Reem Alhabib and Khaled Alharbi, the film, produced by Amal Alhajjar for Shadow Films, celebrates perseverance, memory, and the music that endures even in silence.\n\n\t‘The Mystery of the Black Hand’ (2024)(Vsevolod Aravin, Russia. Produced by Dmitry Semenoff)Set aboard a cross-country train in post-Stalin 1954, “The Mystery of the Black Hand” transforms childhood imagination into a poignant view on a nation in flux. Six-year-old Misha’s playful hunt for a phantom spy unfolds against the quiet unease of Soviet adulthood, blending innocence with historical introspection. Drawing on director Vsevolod Aravin’s own memories, the film recreates the textures of mid-century life with meticulous period detail, authentic 1950s costumes, and a nostalgic orchestral score recorded with the Moscow Bolshoi Theater Symphony, evoking both the innocence and the melancholy of a nation in transition.\n\t\n\n\t‘2:15 PM’ (2023)(Seryeong Jeong, South Korea. Produced by Ga Hye Kim)Set in a quiet Korean neighborhood, “2:15 PM” traces the tender friendship between two young girls bound by secrecy and resilience.

Thirteen-year-old Said roams the medina of Rabat collecting empty beer bottles, selling them to buy food for a stray dog he secretly cares for. When his best friend warns him it’s haram, forbidden in Islam, Said’s kindness collides with faith, family and social expectation.

Written and directed by Fatima Abdulaziz Alshamsi, “Wa’ad” portrays how affection can be strained by unspoken expectations, and how even the most caring guidance can leave emotional fractures. Shot over two days with striking simplicity, the film reflects Alshamsi’s gift for emotional nuance and cultural reflection. A self- and crowd-funded passion project made with community support, “Wa’ad” has screened at Poppy Jasper, Ambitus, Sharjah, and the Kineko Film Festival in Tokyo.\n\t\n\n\tInternational Short Films‘How to Open the Door’ (2024)(Ji Wan Park and Joan Ji Yey Hui, South Korea. Produced by Kim Nam-gil)Winner of the international short film award at Sharjah, “How to Open the Door” by Ji Wan Park and Joan Ji Yey Hui blends realism and surrealism in a haunting portrait of isolation and renewal. Following a young woman navigating life after growing up in an orphanage, the film transforms her shrinking apartment into a dreamlike maze of memory and loss, using striking visual metaphors to explore belonging, self-worth, and the fragile hope of starting over.\n\n\t‘Sour Candy’ (Anaar Daana, 2024)(Nishi Dugar, India. Produced by Nishi Dugar, Kush Patel)In her tender debut short, writer-director Nishi Dugar delicately explores how children confront the first ripples of loss. Set within the fading warmth of an ancestral home, the film follows free-spirited five-year-old Guddal and her siblings, whose playful pranks and sibling squabbles are suddenly interrupted by an unexpected tragedy. With remarkable sensitivity and restraint, “Sour Candy” captures the bewildering moment when innocence collides with grief, and laughter turns to silence, yet curiosity and love remain. Self-funded and produced by Dugar alongside Kush Patel, the film premiered in the Generation KPlus section of the 74th Berlin Intl. Film Festival (2024).\n\n\t‘The Most Handsome Fish on Earth’ (Ikan Terganteng Sedunia, 2024)(Netanya Yemima, Indonesia. Produced by Bela Nabila, Bayu Arief, and William Chandra)Indonesian filmmaker Netanya Yemima crafts a playful yet pointed coming-of-age satire in this 18-minute short, where two best friends accidentally kill their school’s beloved mascot fish, recently crowned “the most handsome fish in Indonesia.” What begins as slapstick chaos soon reveals a layered critique of vanity, authority and the pressures of appearances. Blending youthful energy with biting humor, Yemima and producer-writer Bela Nabila use comedy to expose the absurdity of power structures through children’s eyes. Developed at LOCK x Full Circle Lab Indonesia and funded by Layar Indonesiana 2024, the film captures the innocence and rebellion of school life with vibrant performances and disarming warmth.\n\n\t‘Punishment’ (2025)(Puya Mofid, Iran. Produced by Puya Mofid)Written by Mahdi Asghari Azghadi and directed by Puya Mofid, this searing Iranian drama unfolds within the confines of an elementary school, where a teacher’s harsh discipline leaves a young Black student traumatized and voiceless. As the boy’s family seeks justice, the teacher confronts an agonizing reckoning with guilt and the corrosive power of authority. Rooted in psychological realism, “Punishment” examines how cycles of violence and silence perpetuate across generations. Independently produced, the film has screened at Dokufest, Ningbo, Newport Beach, Sharjah and Rehoboth Beach film festivals.\n\t\n\n\tDocumentariesGuardians of the Mountains (2025)(Ali Fuad, United Arab Emirates. Produced by Naiem Ayman, Hanzallah Alam, Rahaf Walid)Winner of the Documentary Competition at this year’s Sharjah festival, “Guardians of the Mountains” is a meditative ode to the timeless communities inhabiting the peaks of Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah and Musandam in the UAE. Foregoing narration and dialogue, the film invites viewers to experience the region through the rhythm of wind, stone and ritual. In conversation with Variety, the director described the work as “a hymn to endurance and belonging,” seeking to preserve a way of life slowly vanishing amid modernization. Lyrical and elemental, it transforms observation into reverence, making the invisible pulse of the mountains palpable.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Hadhadah”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Ali Ali Alabdullah\n\t\n\n\n\n\t‘Hadhadah’ (2024)(Ali Alabdullah, Saudi Arabia. Produced by Mohammed Arafat)This lyrical Saudi documentary, directed by Ali Alabdullah, transforms the lullaby from a simple childhood song into a profound study of emotional heritage and collective memory. Through intimate interviews and sensory imagery, “Hadhadah” explores how these maternal melodies shape infants’ emotional development and connect generations through sound, rhythm and tenderness. Produced by Close Media, Al-Ahsa Cinema Club and Hazel Films, the film offers a poetic reflection on motherhood, psychology and Arab cultural identity, capturing the lullaby as both music and memory.\n\n\tOther winners at the 12th edition of SIFF underscored the breadth of talent emerging across the region and beyond.

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Sources familiar with Ace's situation tell us ... he suffered a brain bleed when he took a fall in his studio a couple weeks ago -- forcing him to cancel his upcoming tour dates -- but his health has not improved.\n      \n    \n          We're told he's been on a ventilator for some time, and hasn't gotten better -- so, his family is considering turning off support ... perhaps as soon as Thursday evening.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          While there are several social media posts indicating he's already passed ... we're told the 74-year-old guitar icon was still on the ventilator as of Thursday afternoon.\n      \n\n          Following Frehley's fall and subsequent cancelations ... a September 25 statement on his official IG page claimed, \"He is fine, but against his wishes, his doctor insists that he refrain from travel at this time.\"\n      \n    \n          A week later, a second statement was released, stating simply ... \"Due to some ongoing medical issues, Ace has made the difficult decision to cancel the remainder of his 2025 dates.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The musician was a founding member of KISS ... linking up with Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss. He shredded guitar with the group from 1973 to 1982 -- but, left the group amid creative differences and substance abuse issues.\n      \n    \n          Frehley then struck out on a solo career ... founding the band Frehley's Comet -- his own nickname was \"The Spaceman\" -- which played together from 1984 to 1988. He rejoined the group for their 1996 reunion tour and remained with them until 2002.\n      \n    \n          Among the many hit KISS songs Ace Frehley helped make are ... \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" \"I Was Made for Lovin’ You,\" \"Detroit Rock City.\" Frehley's solo career might best be remembered for his cover of the song \"Back in the New York Groove\" and \"Into the Night.\"\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Ace Frehley\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tWhile “Orion” is an ambitious indie space saga, its examination of human nature is decidedly earthbound.\n\n\tThe film stars Andrew McCarthy as Jim, a NASA bigwig tasked with helping Apollo (Drew Van Acker), an astronaut with memory loss, figure out what happened to cause his ship to crash and leave the other crew dead. Their back-and-forth makes up the core of the film, as twists, turns and discoveries gradually unfold.\n\n\n\tDirector Jaco Bouwer found plenty of grounded elements in Anne Vithayathil’s script for “Orion.” Audiences will set sail on the film’s maiden voyage when it has its world premiere at FilmQuest in Provo, Utah, on Oct. 25.\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t think we have an absolute truth anymore in this world,” he says. “This really touches on that without being super on the nose. Science fiction intrigues me a lot. I like the genre because it’s a little bit more of an expressionistic way of going about emotions.”\n\n\tBouwer credits his collaborators for helping walk the film’s tricky tightrope of making a largely two-hander feel expansive. He cites McCarthy’s curiosity about the script — which is miles from the Brat Pack roles that first made him famous — as one big benefit.\n\n\t“He needs to know exactly what’s going on,” Bouwer says of McCarthy. “He really portrays Jim in a good way: There’s a cerebral aspect to him, he’s the master manipulator. In our film, there’s a moment towards the end where we do see some part of humanity behind it. I find him really professional, and I think his range is much bigger than we’ve seen before.”\n\n\tBeyond the dialogue, Bouwer and his cinematographer David Kruta were eager to make the contained film feel taut and dynamic — no easy feat on an indie production.\n\t\n\n\t“We actually used quite a few different lenses,” Bouwer says. “For the flashbacks, we used anamorphic, and we also changed the ratio. We sometimes went extreme wide-angle. Most of the effects were done in-camera. For me, it’s always performance first, so it’s important that the actors feel that. Because everything happens under one roof, the movement is motivated. So I would come in in the morning and we would block it in a way, and once we’ve done that, then I had a meeting with my DP to see how we can best choreograph the camera to suit them. Sometimes it’s purely for a visual, but mostly it was plotting their journey and letting the camera follow them or capture them in the best way.”\n\n\tAlso critical were the sparingly-used glimpses of the further regions of outer space, which helped to convey the scale of the story — including a stunner of a final scene. \n\n\t“Especially that shot at the end, you pull back and just see the smallness and the scale of it,” Bouwer says. “There’s something really great for me, and emotional and sad as well, about that image. It’s kind of subliminal, but it was always in the back of my mind to make it feel that there is something bigger around. It makes the world bigger, although it’s a two-location film.”\n\n\tAnd while the vastness of the universe is worth considering, Bouwer had the most fun conjuring all of the fun and thrills out of a small-scale story.\n\n\t“I was really trying to mislead the audience in subtle ways,” he says. “I think it boils down to performances. If the performances weren’t believable, you’re in big trouble. So I was very happy to have Drew and Andrew as my main guides through this maze of twists and turns.”\n\n\tWatch the first footage of “Orion” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGus Van Sant is still moving. \n\n\t“I think a lot of the films I’ve made, even unintentionally, have been based on real things,” Van Sant says with his familiar mix of understatement and curiosity. “That’s a genre, I guess. I’ve always been drawn to what makes people do what they do.”\n\n\tIn “Dead Man’s Wire,” Van Sant’s latest film, which premiered at AFI Film Festival on Saturday, that fascination becomes electrified — literally. The historical true-crime drama, based on the real-life 1977 Tony Kiritsis hostage case, unfolds like a pressure cooker between desperation and spectacle.\n\t\n\n\t“When I read the script,” he recalls, “there were links embedded in it — you could click them and hear the real 911 calls. Tony talked so fast, like Scorsese on a cocaine bender, cracking jokes and losing his temper. I thought, ‘This is an amazing character.’”\n\n\n\tVan Sant’s words carry a quiet thrill, the sound of an auteur who has spent a career balancing empathy and danger. From “Drugstore Cowboy” and “My Own Private Idaho” to the Oscar-nominated “Good Will Hunting” and “Milk,” he’s never chased a single genre; only human behavior.\n\n\t“The story had this weird barnstormer energy,” he shares. “We were meeting in the Soho House, and the producer said, ‘We have to start shooting in Louisville in two months.’ That was the most appealing thing — just hitting the road like Huckleberry Finn.”\n\n\tNow 73, Van Sant is nostalgic when talking about creative chaos. “The best thing about film is still the accident,” he says. “River Phoenix used to love when something unexpected happened on set. He’d come alive inside those moments — he could feel his character reacting in real time.”\n\t\n\n\tThat memory lingers, as does the one of the fog machines at the 1998 Oscars that made him physically ill while “Good Will Hunting” (1997) lost most of its awards to “Titanic.”\n\n\t“I’m allergic to stage fog now,” he says with a chuckle. “So I never use it on set.”\n\n\tIt’s been seven years since his last theatrical film (“Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot”), but Van Sant is back with a story that echoes his fascination with real American tragedy and absurdity — a director drawn, as ever, to the ragged edge between empathy and obsession.\n\n\tWith “Dead Man’s Wire,” Van Sant delivers his most arresting and charged work since “Milk.” The film hums with the restless energy that defined his early 1970s-like masterpieces while showcasing a sharpened maturity in tone and control. Skarsgård gives a career-best performance, grounding Tony Kiritsis’ volatility with flashes of humor and heartbreak, while Dacre Montgomery and Colman Domingo deliver richly textured performances. Dark horses for the Oscars? Of course. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be considered. In particular, Van Sant’s direction is at once intimate and explosive, framing the chaos with empathy, allowing the audience to feel the pulse of desperation behind every decision. The film’s screenplay, adapted from real events by first-time screenwriter Austin Kolodney, is infused with humanism and dark wit, standing as one of the year’s finest.\n\n\tIn a wide-ranging interview with Variety, Van Sant talks about his past, present and future in the industry he’s spent over four decades mastering.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Dead Man’s Wire”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefania Rosini SMPSP\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLooking at your filmography, this fits with your interest in real-life characters and crimes.\t\n\n\tYeah, I think so. A lot of my films, even the fictional ones, are based on something from the real world — a news story or an article. “Drugstore Cowboy,” “Elephant,” and “Last Days” all came from that impulse. It’s not “true crime” like television, but it’s about what makes someone act a certain way — that question inside the crime.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you settle on Bill Skarsgård for Tony and Dacre Montgomery for Richard?\t\n\n\tCasting was probably as important as the script. I was at a spa one weekend, listening to ambient music, trying to decide if I should jump into this project immediately — we had to start shooting in November. I’d always wanted to work with Bill. I’d offered him roles before that didn’t happen. He has this fascinating career — horror films, yes, but he’s like Lon Chaney, the man of a thousand faces. He’s also 10 years younger than the real Tony, which made it interesting.\n\t\n\n\tDacre I knew because of his audition tape for “Stranger Things.” It’s one of those legendary tapes actors pass around — perfect lighting, perfect eyelines. I didn’t even watch the show at first, just his scenes. He felt new, unpredictable, and that was what the movie needed.\n\t\n\t\tAnd Colman Domingo as the radio DJ — it’s such an inspired choice.\t\n\n\tWe actually modeled that character after the DJ in “The Warriors.” That was in the script. We had a few actors pass before Colman came aboard. He was working with our producer, Cassian Elwes, on another project and said, “I’d love to work with Gus.” He was perfect — his presence grounds the film.\n\t\n\t\tFans always ask if you’d ever revisit “Drugstore Cowboy.”\t\n\n\tActually, there are screenplays that the same writer wrote — James Fogle. There were four different ones, and one of them is called “Satan’s Sandbox,” that I think James Franco wanted to do, but that was the one I kind of preferred. It’s set in San Quentin prison. And actually, when we met him and made the movie, he was in Walla Walla State Penitentiary in Washington State, and so he had some stories when they were out of prison, like “Drugstore Cowboy,” when they were running around, selling drugs and stealing drugs. So there are other ones, yeah, there are other ones that exist.\n\t\n\t\tRiver Phoenix was so prolific in your cinema journey. He definitely is one of the core reasons I, myself, fell in love with movies. How often does he cross your mind?\t\n\n\tI mean, I think about him all the time — there’s a picture on the wall of him. He was sort of like, you know, a very great collaborator. And we only did that one piece, and we were planning on — he was planning on being in what turned out to be “Milk.” But that didn’t happen till later, before he died, so there was a project that we were talking about. But, yeah, he was very spontaneous. He loved to improvise. That was his favorite thing. And I don’t think he got to, necessarily, depending on who he was working with, go off the page and improvise. It probably wasn’t the type of films that he was doing — he was doing traditional pieces that were pretty much, like, securely in Hollywood. You know, he was doing traditional pieces, that’s what he was offered.\n\t\n\n\tAnd in that environment, you’re not making a film like — you know, like you’re mentioning Scorsese — where they improvise whole scenes. And when we did, he found out that I liked it, you know, that I was okay if he just did something for like five minutes that wasn’t even in the screenplay, because then he could actually research stuff, and he could feel very open about what he was playing. So that was kind of magical, that he liked it, and he had not been able to do it. So he was very excited about it, because he wasn’t normally doing it.\n\n\tI don’t know, there’s lots of things. His upbringing was such that he didn’t really have a lot of film history connected to his memory banks. He was homeschooled, so he didn’t have a lot of teaching that he knew about concerning war. His homeschooling consisted of, like, no war. So characters like General MacArthur weren’t in his world — he didn’t know who they were. And then conversely, he didn’t know what humor was. He didn’t know what, like, a quote-unquote joke was, until he was nine, he said.\n\n\tHe found that out because he went to a traditional school — a public school — and kids were telling jokes. It was an era when kids were all about jokes. He didn’t know what they were; they were just like a foreign thing to him. He also didn’t have a smile, which people don’t necessarily know. He told me that — he said, ‘Well, I don’t have a smile.’ And I said, ‘You’re kidding.’ And then he smiled and showed me his smile, and I said, ‘Oh yeah, I don’t see that smile in your films.’\n\n\tSo he had this interesting thing — for a movie star, an interesting absence of that kind of giant smile. But meanwhile, he was very funny, and his most favorite thing was just to laugh and tell stories.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve been nominated twice for an Oscar. What do you remember about those mornings?\t\n\n\tMostly that I didn’t realize when the announcements were happening. I woke up to a bunch of phone calls. It’s the big Hollywood prize — it feels great. At the ceremony for “Good Will Hunting,” they unveiled this huge Titanic ship set, and fog rolled out everywhere. I got so sick sitting there, I swore I’d never use fog on my sets again.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a lot of talk about the “death” of cinema. Do you believe that?\t\n\n\tNot at all. Movies always follow technology — from nickelodeons to iPhones. What matters is the gathering, that communal experience. The art form isn’t dying; it’s just shifting. The best films of the 1920s were miracles because nobody knew what cinema was yet. We’re in another one of those periods of discovery.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCan we expect another film soon? Or do we have to wait another seven years?\t\n\n\tI hope so. I did the Gucci project and six hours of “Feud,” so I haven’t been idle. There are hundreds of ideas — digital files full of them. Some might take decades, like “Milk” did. But they’re there, waiting.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Disney+ develops “Hocus Pocus 3,” Thora Birch, who played young Dani Dennison in the original 1993 film, says she’s willing to reprise the role.\n\n\tDuring an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress responded to questions about Dani’s return in the third installment, saying “Yeah, I’d like to know what they land on for how Dani wound up. I’m super open to the idea.”\n\n\tBirch was 11 years old when Disney released the first “Hocus Pocus.” She played the youngest member of the central Dennison family alongside her on-screen siblings, played by Omri Katz and Vinessa Shaw. Though the film failed to excel at the box office upon release, it has since garnered a strong following.\n\t\n\n\t“It was so devastating when it first came out. It was such a bomb and we were all bummed because we loved making it,” Birch reflects, “We were like, ‘What, you don’t like it?’ and then ten years later they’re like ‘Oh my God, are you that girl from ‘Hocus Pocus.'”\n\n\tThe film received the legacy sequel treatment with the release of Disney+’s ‘Hocus Pocus 2‘ in 2022. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy reprised their roles as the central antagonists from the first film, but the original Dennison family ensemble was left out of the sequel. The film was a smash hit for the streamer, accumulating 2.7 billion minutes watched during its opening weekend.\n\n\tPerhaps they will have a chance to return in the threequel. Though Birch expressed interest in the idea, she concedes that the prospect is open-ended, stating, “They like talking about this stuff, so we’ll see.”\n\t\n\n\tBirch may be getting the call back to Salem sooner than she thinks. Midler recently shared during an appearance on “Watch What Happens Live” that she read an early draft of the script and thought it was “brilliant.” \n\n\t“Well, you know, they sent a script, and a lot of it was brilliant,” she said. “So I got very excited, and now we’re trying to figure out what it is and where it’s going to be and how much it’s going to cost and all those logistical things.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent sit-down with NPR, Guillermo del Toro asserted that he would “rather die” than use artificial intelligence, “particularly generative AI,” in any of his future films. He compared the growing cultural fascination surrounding the controversial tech to the “arrogance” displayed by the titular literary madman in his Netflix adaptation of “Frankenstein.”\n\n\t“AI, particularly generative AI — I am not interested, nor will I ever be interested,” del Toro said. “I’m 61, and I hope to be able to remain uninterested in using it at all until I croak. … The other day, somebody wrote me an email, said, ‘What is your stance on AI?’ And my answer was very short. I said, ‘I’d rather die.'”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Pan’s Labyrinth” director explained that the true dangers aren’t with the technology itself, but with “natural stupidity,” which could drive the mishandling of AI. He added that “natural stupidity” is what pushes “most of the world’s worst features.” He went on to connect the character of Victor Frankenstein to those at the forefront of AI development.\n\n\t“I did want it to have the arrogance of Victor [Frankenstein] be similar in some ways to the tech bros,” he said. “He’s kind of blind, creating something without considering the consequences and I think we have to take a pause and consider where we’re going.”\n\n\tDel Toro’s “Frankenstein,” adapted from Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel of the same name, stars Jacob Elordi, Oscar Issac, Mia Goth, Christoph Waltz and Ralph Ineson. The film comes to Netflix on Nov. 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKamala Harris gave her first exclusive UK interview on the BBC‘s “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.” During the conversation with the titular host, she talked about the present and future states of American politics and her role within them.  The former Vice President and Presidential candidate says, “I am not done. I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.”\n\n\tHarris, who served as a California Senator and District Attorney before becoming the 49th Vice President under Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, has worked in politics for several decades. As the Democratic Party’s nominee for the 2024 Presidential election, she went toe-to-toe with Republican nominee Donald Trump, warning voters about his potential dangers throughout her campaign.\n\t\n\n\tThough Harris lost the election to Trump, she stands by her rhetoric. “I was asked if he was a fascist, and I said ‘yes,’ the reason is I look at what is happening right now,” Harris says, “It is what I predicted. He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice and he has done exactly that.”\n\n\n\tShe calls the U.S. President a “tyrant,” citing, “how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists.” She also noted how the FCC went after Disney in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. “His skin is so thin, he couldn’t endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process,” she says.\n\n\tHarris was the U.S.’s first female Vice President and if elected, would have been the first female President. She says that her grandnieces would “in their lifetime for sure” see a female president. When asked if it would be her, she said, “possibly,” suggesting another potential run for the top office, though she has not officially committed to that decision.\n\t\n\n\tSome polls currently place Harris as an outside to win a place on the Democratic ticket in 2028. Harris brushes them off, though, stating, “I’ve never listened to polls. If I listened to polls, I would not have run for my first office, or my second office, and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”\n\n\tThe full interview will air on Sunday at 9 a.m. on the BBC.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJune Lockhart, a popular actress of the 1950s and ’60s known for her roles in “Lost In Space,” “Lassie” and “Meet Me in St. Louis,” died of natural causes on Oct. 23 in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 100.\n\n\tLockhart became known for her performances as Timmy’s foster mother, Ruth Martin, on the CBS series “Lassie” from 1958 to 1964. She took over from Cloris Leachman as the Martin family moved on to the famous collie’s farm and became foster parents to both the orphaned Timmy and Lassie.\n\t\n\n\tShe then starred as Dr. Maureen Robinson on the CBS series “Lost in Space” from 1965 to 1968. She played a brilliant biochemist and loving mother of three who is marooned in space along with her family. \n\n\n\t“When I wasn’t shooting Lassie, I became the mistress of Scrabble with my hairdresser and the crew,” she told Closer magazine in 2024. She also noted that “Lost in Space” was her favorite project. “It was so campy,” she said, “And I truly enjoyed my relationship with my space family.”\n\n\tOver nearly eight decades on screen, Lockhart went on to appear in dozens of series and movies well into her 80s, with recurring roles on “Petticoat Junction,” “General Hospital” “Beverly Hills 90210,” and guest appearances on shows from “The Beverly Hillbillies” to “Happy Days” to “Full House, “Roseanne” and “Gray’s Anatomy.”\n\n\tThe daughter of actor Gene Lockhart and actress Kathleen Lockhart, she was born in New York City in 1925. She made her feature film debut at 13 years old, starring alongside both of her parents in Edwin L. Marin’s 1939 “A Christmas Carol,” where she played Belinda Cratchit. After her breakout role, she appeared in films such as “All This, and Heaven Too,” “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “The Yearling,” and “Sergeant York.”\n\t\n\n\tPrior to the TV series, Lockhart appeared in the feature “Son of Lassie” as Priscilla, the Duke of Rudling’s granddaughter. In the 1950s, Lockhart guest-starred in several Western series such as “Wagon Train,” “Cimarron City,” “Gunsmoke,” “Have Gun – Will Travel,” and “Rawhide.” \n\n\tShe was nominated for two Emmys, including Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series for her performance in “Lassie.” She also received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for motion pictures and one for television. Lockhart was previously the recipient of a Special Tony Award for Outstanding Performance by a Newcomer for her role on Broadway in “For Love or Money” in 1948.\n\n\tA private service has been planned in her honor. Instead of sending flowers, Lockhart’s family suggests donating to The Actors Fund, ProPublica and International Hearing Dog, Inc. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSteven Soderbergh is speaking out about his unmade “Star Wars” movie, “The Hunt For Ben Solo.”\n\n\tAfter would-be star Adam Driver revealed the project in an interview with AP on Monday, the “Ocean’s Eleven” director took to BlueSky to write that he “did not enjoy” hiding the project from fans, but emphasized the importance of keeping it under wraps.\n\n\t“For the record, I did not enjoy lying about the existence of ‘THE HUNT FOR BEN SOLO,’ but it really did need to remain a secret…until now!” Soderbergh wrote on Monday.\n\t\n\n\tOn Friday, he added, “Also, in the aftermath of the ‘HFBS’ situation, I asked Kathy Kennedy if LFL had ever turned in a finished movie script for greenlight to Disney and had it rejected. She said no, this was a first.”\n\n\t“The Hunt for Ben Solo” was set to take place after the events of “The Rise of Skywalker,” and would have followed Driver’s Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, on a search for redemption. Driver called the unmade film “one of the coolest” projects he’s ever been a part of.\n\n\tSoderbergh had previously told AP of developing “The Hunt for Ben Solo,” “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”\n\n\tOn Friday, Collider reported that a group of “Star Wars” fanatics paid for a plane towing a banner reading “Save ‘The Hunt for Ben Solo’” to fly over Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif. A reporter for the outlet was able to take pictures of the stunt while on location.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe latest poster for “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” features a painting of Bruce Springsteen in concert, viewed from the side, his index finger held high in the air. If you examine his face, you’ll see that it looks a lot more like Bruce than it does like Jeremy Allen White, the actor who plays him. You can understand why: Jeremy Allen White doesn’t look very much like Springsteen. (There’s a touch of last-minute desperation to that poster.) The lack of an acute resemblance isn’t fatal in a biopic, but it’s one of a number of things about “Deliver Me from Nowhere” that just feel…off.\n\t\n\n\tAnother disarming detail is the aha moment when Bruce first gets the idea for “Nebraska” by catching “Badlands” on TV. In a way, it makes sense — the album’s title track will be told from the point-of-view of Charles Starkweather, the sociopathic killer who’s the antihero of Terrence Malick’s famous film. What’s odd about the scene is that three years before it takes place, back in 1978, Springsteen released “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” an album whose greatest song was … “Badlands.” (It was always clear that title was a nod to the movie.)\n\n\n\tThat said, the pivotal thing that feels off about “Deliver Me from Evil” is “Nebraska” itself. I can’t even talk about this without being accused of blasphemy, because there is such a mystique surrounding that album, in all its lo-fi acoustic demo-with-reverb Dylan-meets-Suicide dark-heart-of-America austerity. No one ever deviates from calling “Nebraska” a “masterpiece” and one of Bruce’s greatest records. The album is one of the dour sacred cows of music criticism, right up there with such landmarks of anhedonia as “White Light/White Heat” and “Unknown Pleasures.” At the time of its release, Greil Marcus, writing about it as if he was adding a chapter to his seminal book “Mystery Train,” called it “the most convincing statement of resistance and refusal that Ronald Reagan’s USA has yet elicited, from any artist or any politician.” Marcus set the template for viewing “Nebraska” as a political album, and that was embodied in its stripped-down aesthetic, its whole Bruce-vs.-the-overblown-music-industry aura.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s just one problem. (Blasphemy alert!) “Nebraska” is an arid art film of an album — poetic to a fault, with a couple of good songs, like the title track and “Atlantic City,” but I’ve always found it to be a piece of dusty folk-rock wallpaper. It you love it, fine, but my point is that whatever claims of greatness are made for the record, they have almost nothing to do with what people have loved about Bruce Sprinsteen for 50 years. His music is deep, and yes it can be dark, but mostly Bruce, as an artist, radiates rock ‘n’ roll joy. And that’s the quality that’s perversely missing from “Deliver Me from Nowhere.”\n\n\tAt home, when I’m making dinner with my daughters, we always play music, and mixed in with the new stuff I like to give them a dose of music history, so I’ll play everything from Nina Simone to Steely Dan to the Clash to ELO to Dylan to the Spinners to the Ramones. But the one time I put on “Nebraska,” we were four tracks into it when Sadie, who is 13, looked at me with a wince of pain and said, “Can we play something else?” She had never said that before, and I was amused to see her reaction directly echoed in the movie by the Columbia Records executive Al Teller (David Krumholtz), who hears a couple of minutes of the record and then says can you please take it off. It’s not just that the album “isn’t commercial.” For many of us, there’s a punishing monotony to “Nebraska.”\n\n\tThe album, in its way, is all about pain, and “Deliver Me from Nowhere” captures how creating the record all by himself in his New Jersey bedroom was therapy for Bruce. That’s a moderately interesting chapter in the larger Bruce saga, and when he actually goes to therapy, the film treats it as cataclysmic — as if millions of us haven’t been there, and as if he was the first rock celebrity who ever walked into a shrink’s office.\n\n\tThe core issue the Bruce of the film is dealing with is the trauma inflicted upon him as a boy by his hard-drinking, abusive, ’50s-macho father (Stephen Graham), who he was desperate to please. “Deliver Me from Nowhere” is supposed to be about the schism in Bruce’s soul, and about how he used the making of “Nebraska” to heal it. But I have another interpretation of what the album means. The myth of greatness that has surrounded “Nebraska” for 43 years, propped up by the music-critic establishment and by Bruce himself (who has said it’s the work of his he feels closest to), is that what matters on the record isn’t so much the music (its bare-bones country vibe, all those goddamn major chords) but the lyrics, which strain at every turn to be badlands poetry. Yet I would suggest that in trying to make a rock album this doggedly artistic and severely high-minded, an album “pure” enough to make Bob Dylan look schmaltzy, Bruce was playing out his demons in a different way. He still had a primal need to please and impress his father, and that’s what “Nebraska” was about. He wanted what this movie gives him: not his due, but a gold star.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKathryn Bigelow’s “A House of Dynamite” is filled with uneasy tension from start to finish as it follows the immediate threat of a nuclear missile headed straight for the United States. That driving tension and anxiety are largely thanks to the team of artisans, which included composer Volker Bertelmann, editor Kirk Baxter and sound designer Paul Ottosson, who worked closely behind the scenes on their respective crafts to bring it together.\n\t\n\n\tBigelow’s film, now streaming on Netflix, is divided into three chapters, telling the story from three different perspectives. It all starts in the White House Crisis Room as Captain Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson) works with Major Daniel Gonzalez (Anthony Ramos) and his team at a military base in Alaska. An incoming missile gives them 20 minutes to react and respond accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEros Hoagland/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOttosson says reading the script was an anxious experience in itself. “As I was reading it, I was really tense, and I was curious to see how it would come together because the structure was different,” he says. Bertelmann knew the score needed development in each chapter. “You need to have some things in your pocket to make the tension higher,” he says. “The opening presents the whole palette of music of what we can expect and what film this will be. You hear those first sounds and know where we are. We are not in a romance. We are in a thriller that will be quite dark in certain areas.” But it took a few attempts at scoring those first moments to get it right. Bertelmann says he worked on shaping the score, pulling back a bit, and then moving into the second chapter.\n\t\n\n\tIn cutting those moments, Baxter used the score to track the temperature of his edit, especially as the second chapter begins. Baxter says, “[Bertelmann’s] score peaks at the end of Chapter One, and you reset. You get these clues that come in with little bits of audio.” He adds that the idea was for audiences to wonder what’s going to happen next. Is it the aftermath of the missile impact? Instead, he says, “Those sprinkles start, and then you’re back in panic mode, and it stays there. It’s the score that tells you quickly that you’re in it.”\n\n\tOttosson’s approach was to look at the sound by each chapter. “In Chapters One and Two, people are confident and educated in doing something. But of course, things go wrong, and I tried to make it more tumultuous because you can’t control the environment.” Chapter Two resets everything back to the start of the day to show more departments. By the third chapter, the focus shifts back to the Oval Office. This time, Idris Elba, who has only been heard via the black box, is revealed. When the day resets for the last time in the film, his sequence brings humanity to the chaos.\n\n\tBaxter says, “In the first chapter, we stayed with Rebecca and made Volker’s music the focus.” By the third chapter, which switches to the President’s point of view, it was about the human experience and “one man’s decision. Silence and Volker’s music are really what make that work so great. Having the chaos in the beginning gives you great appreciation for the delicate human factor in Chapter Three.” \n\n\tThe decision not to reveal him earlier was always the intention. “I leaned into the black square by giving it a bunch of screen time,” says Baxter. “Especially in that second chapter when it’s just sitting and they’re waiting for answers. The shots just hold on it, and it’s just silence. It’s like looking down a well. It builds the anticipation of wanting to meet him and get answers.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe final chapter really dives into the emotional state of mind of the President. He’s the last man left to make the decision. “He also has to deal with human problems, and there are a lot of things not working that make it so emotional,” explains Baxter. While a lot of the story was on the page and scripted by screenwriter Noah Oppenheim, some moments came together in the edit. One example was in that third chapter the President had a phone call with Russia. “It wasn’t written to be on during all of that because we had experienced it previously. On the page, you would go, ‘We don’t need to hear that entire conversation again.’ But in the President’s journey, there’s a joy in re-experiencing it on his face, and it amps up all of the tension of the ‘I need a minute,’ and then you go to Africa.”\n\t\n\n\tSuddenly, there were wide shots of his wife on safari with Ottosson’s sounds of elephants.  He says, “It sort of applies this pressure to that scene, you know, as well as all of humanity, of just wanting to have a connection between people.” \n\n\tThe artisans also had access to a military advisor, Dan Karbler, who was accessible at all times. Says Ottosson who relied on Karbler’s advise says, “It was about staying true to what could happen in these rooms and situations. It was never about a cool sound what they felt about how it sounded. It was ‘What would you feel in this situation and what would that sound like?’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCzech documentarian Tatana Markova says she became intrigued by her subject in “Kingdom of Soap Bubbles” – a once-great Bohemian dynasty that’s been nearly forgotten – after meeting one of its would-be heirs.\n\n\t“One of the protagonists of my last film, “Libussa Unbound,” was U.S.-based director and producer Constantin Werner. He told me some family stories and I found them so appealing I wanted to find out more about the Schicht family he came from.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Schicht name was once known in every household in what is today the Czech Republic and Slovakia – and considerably beyond. It rose to prominence during the last days of the Habsburg Empire, built around the phenomenal success of entrepreneur Georg Schicht, who founded a soap factory in what is today the town of Rynoltice.\n\n\n\tWith bold innovations such as the sidelines Elida cosmetics and Kalodont toothpaste, the sourcing of coconut and palm oil from Africa, brilliant branding and marketing with a wholesome billboard girl and slick silent film promos, the Schicht brand eventually became synonymous with “easy, cheap and clean” in households far and wide.\n\n\tAnd its signature product, the “soap with the stag,” known for its distinctive leaping deer symbol, was nearly as recognizable in the early 20th century as Apple or Starbucks is today. \n\n\tNowadays, just a shell of the family’s industrial base and their nearby mansion remain in the Czech city of Usti nad Labem – known during the family’s heyday under the Habsburg Empire, as Aussig.\n\t\n\n\tAnd it’s into the darkened halls and corridors of these buildings, stripped nearly bare, that Markova’s camera rolls as her documentary, competing in the Czech Joy section of the Ji.hlava film fest, opens.\n\n\tShe began writing in 2019, just in time for the challenges of COVID lockdowns, says Markova, but she soon faced another difficulty almost as great.\n\n\tShe wanted to film the company heirs venturing into the former family home, she says, but “the descendants of the entrepreneurial Schicht family are spread all over the world and they are quite busy. It is not possible for them to travel to the Czech Republic often.”\n\n\tThere was also much ground to cover: The founding of Czechoslovakia after World War I “wasn’t beneficial to the Schichts,” as the film recounts, dropping them into the middle of a linguistic power struggle in which the German language was no longer to be officially used and many felt resentful of all things not Slavic.\n\n\tThe Schichts managed to survive and thrive, building the company, merging with Unilever, founding a cinema, building international networks and even taking to the skies in airplane races.\n\n\tBut with World War II soon looming, and a company base squarely in the middle of what Nazi Germany would call the Sudetenland, the family was to find itself in an increasingly hazardous world – in fact, as the Third Reich rose, the Schicht company was under pressure to prove itself Aryan – and even to work on components of V1 rockets, says Markova.\n\n\tWas she was not permitted to ask about any of these subjects? “No,” says Markova. “They were very open.”\n\n\tAfter the war, Czech citizens who were ethnic Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia, and their land and assets were seized.\n\n\t“That collective guilt was applied to the whole family,” says Markova. “The Ústí nad Labem property of Georg Schicht was confiscated after World War II, despite the fact that he lived in London, had British citizenship and his sons fought in the British army.\n\n\t“I am using the memories from the diary of Eleonore Schicht and a written recommendation by Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Masaryk in the film to demonstrate this fact.”\n\n\tWith the country soon under Soviet control, successful capitalists such as the Schichts were considered public enemies – and the factory became the state-run enterprise Setuza. What’s more, after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, Czechs who had their property seized by the state were allowed to reclaim much of it through a restitution system – but not ethnic Germans who lost it under the post-war Benes decrees.\n\t\n\n\t“The Benes decrees, which legally expelled Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II, were never repealed; there was no restitution process for the property of Czech Germans.”\n\n\tThe Schicht family moved into other businesses and investments in London, Zurich and even Brazil after World War II, eventually doing well enough that they were able to buy back the former family home in Usti, which they plan to open to the public, they say.\n\n\tIn this city, at least, they were never forgotten, says Markova, in part because the company was known for its socially conscious local investments, building homes for its workers, a community pool, and more.\n\n\t“In 2006 the so-called ‘Soap King’ Johann Schicht was the winner of a local survey,” Markova says, “for the most important citizen of Aussig in last 150 years, so many people know the name. Outside Ústí nad Labem not so many.”\n\n\t“Johann Schicht (the company director in the generation after founder Georg) was a visionary and a philanthropist. He had a relationship to the place where he had his business, his son Heinrich as well. This is not the case of many contemporary entrepreneurs.”\n\n\t“A once-famous name can fall into oblivion, a big industrial empire can burst like a bubble, but something from the non-material values, such as social responsibility and philanthropy, can be passed down through generations,” Markova says.\n\n\t“It is a nice act of respect for ancestors to buy their villa with the vision to open it to the public.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney fans behold: “Disneyland Handcrafted,” a new feature documentary from producer and director Leslie Iwerks, will premiere — and be available to stream — on Disney+ and Disney YouTube on Jan. 22. Built from rare archival footage and original audio recordings, the film will give viewers an inside look into the magic of Walt Disney’s dream and the extraordinary artistry and grit it took to create The Happiest Place on Earth. \n\t\n\n\tDisneyland has been operating for more than 70 years. But Disney wasn’t built in a day, and “Disneyland Handcrafted” tells the tale of how the park came to be the iconic spot it is today ahead of its opening on July 17, 1955. Through newly unearthed materials from the Walt Disney Archives, Iwerks and her team uncovered previously forgotten 16mm film reels and audio recordings that aim to bring audiences along for the tumultuous year ahead of the park’s creation, capturing both the legacy and nostalgia leading up to the creation of the Disneyland Resort. \n\n\n\tFirsthand accounts from the artists, craftsmen and Imagineers who were there also provide insights into the park’s creation, creating a fly-on-the-wall perspective aimed to capture what was truly happening behind the scenes. \n\n\n\tIwerks herself also has a special connection to Disney; she’s the daughter of Don Iwerks, a former Disney executive, and the granddaughter of Ub Iwerks, the animator and co-creator behind Mickey Mouse. Her previous projects include “The Imagineering Story,” “The Pixar Story” and “League of Legends: Origins.” \n\t\n\t\tSPECIALS\t\n\n\tThe ABC News year-end special “What You Need to Know: 2025” has premiered exclusively on Disney+.\n\t\n\n\tHosted by correspondents James Longman and Rachel Scott, the special episode will highlight memorable stories that defined the year.\n\n\t“In under 15 minutes, we took the stories that people couldn’t escape and brought them together in a way that is uniquely ‘What You Need to Know,’” Longman and Scott said in a joint statement. “When we sign off, our hope is that viewers feel a little more informed, a little more hopeful, and reminded that even in a whirlwind of headlines, we’re all sharing this story together.”\n\n\tFrom global reporting and politics to pop culture headlines and viral videos, “What You Need to Know: 2025″ will unpack the biggest moments in under 15 minutes.\n\n\t“What You Need to Know” launched in July 2025 with morning episodes streaming exclusively on Disney+ and expanded in July to twice-daily episodes so viewers can follow the top stories and headlines as they continue to develop. It is ABC News’ first daily streaming news series exclusive to Disney+.\n\t\n\t\tPROGRAMMING\t\n\n\tTurner Classic Movies will honor the life and career of filmmaker Rob Reiner with a programming tribute of his most popular films on Jan. 28, 2026.\n\n\t“The profound sense of loss we’re all feeling is heightened by Rob’s lofty standing in Hollywood; he was universally loved inside the entertainment industry,” Ben Mankiewicz, TCM host, said in a statement. \n\n\tHe continued, “I did not know him as well as I would have liked, but he always made me feel like we had been pals for decades. Rob’s character was defined by the qualities we see in those films: kindness, decency, humor, compassion, and most of all, a belief in humanity.”\n\n\tThe tribute will be headlined by a special premiere presentation of “The Princess Bride” with “When Harry Met Sally,” “Stand By Me” and “This Is Spinal Tap” to follow.\n\n\t*\n\n\tThe documentary “Roads of Fire” has set a TVOD release date, becoming available across Amazon, Apple TV and Fandango at Home starting Jan. 6.\n\n\tDirected by Nathaniel Lezra, “Roads of Fire” provides a look into human smuggling and migration, following three different stories of individuals and groups on perilous journeys towards prospective freedom.\n\n\tThe film won Best Documentary at the 2025 Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the Audience Award at the Brooklyn Film Festival and Best Cinematography at the Pacific Northwest Documentary Showcase.\n\t\n\n\tThe TVOD release marks the film’s first nationwide digital availability following its limited theatrical and festival runs.\n\t\n\t\tPARTNERSHIPS\t\n\n\tThe Fox-owned Los Angeles duopoly KTTV Fox 11 and KCOP Fox 11+ has been named the official media partner of the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment Commission, the company announced Thursday. As an official partner, the stations and its digital property, Fox Local, will provide coverage of marquee events with a focus on the upcoming FIFA World Cup 26 and Super Bowl LXI in 2027. \n\n\t“We’re proud to welcome Fox 11 as our Official Media Partner at a time when Los Angeles is preparing to host some of the world’s most iconic events,” said Kathryn Schloessman, president & CEO of the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission, in a statement. “With their support, we can recognize the organizations that make it all possible and celebrate the unique opportunity our region has over the next three years.”\n\n\tThrough exclusive access, in-depth reporting and behind-the-scenes content from events, Fox 11 will provide Angelenos with compelling content across digital, broadcast and social platforms, with a special focus on showcasing the ways Los Angeles locals can be part of the major events coming to their city.  \n\n\t“We are honored to partner with LASEC during this historic and thrilling year for Los Angeles and to provide Angelenos with a backstage pass to the most prestigious events and sports happening locally and on the world stage,” added Amber Eikel, senior vice president and regional general manager of Fox Los Angeles and San Francisco duopolies, in a statement. “We are ready to highlight our communities, as well as celebrate each momentous occasion leading up to, during and after the World Cup and Super Bowl.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel returned to late-night on Monday after his winter break, and he used his first monologue of 2026 to tease Donald Trump about the low ratings from the Kennedy Center Honors broadcast.\n\n\t“You know he hosted an awards show over the break,” Kimmel said at the top of Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” broadcast. “After boasting about what a great host he is and how much better he is than I am and how huge his ratings would be, Trump hosted the lowest rated Kennedy Center Honors telecast of all time.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Kennedy Center Honors, held on Dec. 7 and hosted by Trump, averaged 3.01 million viewers, according to a report from Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data. That represents a 25% decline from 2024’s numbers, which set a record low with 4.1 million viewers.\n\n\n\t“Boy, I’d hate to be the White House intern who had to tear that headline out of all the papers and eat ’em,” Kimmel added. “You know, as I recall, he said he’d step down if this happened. He said, ‘If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel, then I don’t think I should be president.’ Hey, a deal is a deal. Back to Mar-a-Lago you go.”\n\n\tTrump was the first sitting president in history to host the Kennedy Center Honors, which celebrate “individuals whose unique contributions have shaped our world,” according to the organization’s website. The 2025 honorees were George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, KISS, Michael Crawford and Gloria Gaynor.\n\n\tThe president has developed a fixation on the Kennedy Center during his second term. In December, he renamed the historic forum “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” The name change was met with significant uproar, and several scheduled acts canceled their performances in the fallout.\n",

    "body": "\n\tStreaming services, social video platforms and connected TV are poised to dominate Asia-Pacific screen revenue growth through the end of the decade, even as traditional television continues its structural decline, according to Media Partners Asia‘s newly released Asia-Pacific Video & Broadband 2026 report.\n\n\tThe Singapore-based research firm projects total screen revenues across the region will reach $196 billion by 2030, growing at a 2.8% compound annual growth rate between 2025 and 2030. All net growth will come from online video, which is forecast to expand at 7% CAGR over the period.\n\t\n\n\tPremium video on demand – encompassing both subscription and advertising-supported models – will add approximately $12.5 billion in incremental revenue between 2025 and 2030, reaching $52 billion by decade’s end. Japan, China and India will lead that growth, followed by Australia, South Korea and Indonesia.\n\n\n\tIndia is set to overtake China as the largest market for SVOD subscriptions by 2030, reaching 358 million individual subscriptions. However, India’s premium VOD revenue – including both subscriptions and advertising – will remain 4.5 times smaller than China’s and 2.5 times smaller than Japan’s, reflecting lower average revenue per user (ARPU).\n\n\tUser-generated and social video revenues are projected to expand even more dramatically, adding $11.4 billion to reach $44.5 billion by 2030. That makes creator-led platforms the single largest growth engine across the Asia-Pacific screen economy, according to MPA’s annual industry assessment.\n\n\tTraditional television, meanwhile, faces an $8 billion cumulative revenue decline over the same period, driven by ongoing weakness in linear advertising and pay-TV subscriptions. China, Japan and India will account for nearly 70% of that contraction, while Australia and Korea will contribute more than 15% combined.\n\t\n\n\tConnected TV has emerged as a structural growth driver across the region. MPA estimates CTV households across Asia-Pacific excluding China now number close to 160 million and are expected to add nearly 100 million more by 2030. Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia have the largest installed bases. The shift to big-screen viewing is materially improving engagement, pricing power and advertising yields.\n\n\tMarket concentration is increasing among online video platforms, with the top 15 accounting for 58% of total online video revenues in 2025. YouTube, ByteDance’s Douyin and TikTok, and Netflix lead the field, alongside strong national champions including JioHotstar and U-Next.\n\n\tJapan and India emerge as the two largest contributors to incremental video and streaming revenue growth outside China, though through different dynamics. Japanese growth is driven by higher average revenue per user, supported by premium-priced tiers, local content and sports differentiation. India’s growth remains more volume-led but is increasingly supported by monetization upgrades, advertising-supported offerings, ARPU increases projected after 2026 and expanding CTV usage.\n\n\tPremium AVOD revenues are projected to grow from $8 billion in 2025 to over $12 billion by 2030, led by India, Japan and Australia, followed by South Korea and Indonesia. Platforms across the region are raising prices, introducing higher-tier products and bundling premium sports and local content.\n\n\tUser-generated and social video platforms remain the major beneficiaries of online video advertising growth. Outside China, YouTube, Meta and ByteDance’s TikTok account for the majority of incremental spend. In China, Douyin, Kuaishou and Tencent lead the market. Short-form platforms are also evolving toward episodic consumption, with micro-dramas emerging as a measurable revenue category in China and expected to gain relevance in India, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand.\n\n\tAI-enabled tools are being deployed across content development, localization, post-production and marketing, reducing unit costs and accelerating production timelines. MPA notes this dynamic will reinforce scale advantages and favor platforms with large libraries and diversified monetization strategies.\n\t\n\n\t“Value is shifting decisively toward streaming, social platforms and CTV-led monetisation,” said Vivek Couto, CEO and executive director of Media Partners Asia. “Markets with scale, pricing power and strong local content ecosystems will continue to outperform, while traditional television economics face long-term structural erosion. What differentiates winners in this cycle is not volume alone, but the ability to monetise premium experiences, anchored by sports, high-quality local programming, emerging formats such as micro-dramas, and increasingly by AI-enabled efficiency across the content value chain.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKristen Stewart recently told “Entertainment Tonight” that she “would love” to direct a reboot of “Twilight,” the 2008 vampire romantasy film that launched her career.\n\n\t“I would love — look. I love what Catherine [Hardwicke] did, I love what Chris [Weitz] did, I love what all of the directors did with the movies,” Stewart said. “They were so themselves and weird and kind of like, squirrelly, and just so present in that time when they didn’t really know what they were yet, like before they blew up.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart said ideally, she would receive a “huge budget” and “a bunch of love and support” from fans for the hypothetical project.\n\n\n\t“Yeah, sure, I’ll do the remake,” she added. “I’m doing it! I’m committed!”\n\n\tStewart starred in the “Twilight” franchise alongside Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. The 2008 original spawned four sequels: 2009’s “New Moon,” 2010’s “Eclipse,” 2011’s “Breaking Dawn – Part 1” and 2012’s “Breaking Dawn – Part 2.” The series grossed more than $3 billion in total at the worldwide box office.\n\n\tWhile Stewart is happy to return to Forks, Wash., Pattinson may not be so quick to buy in. He told GQ in 2022 that he spent much of his time on the “Twilight” set “infuriated” because the studio did not agree with his vision of the film.\n\n\t“I wanted to make it as arty as possible,” Pattinson said at the time. “We had this strange tension where the studio was scared to make things a little bit too emo and stuff. I thought that was the only way to play it. I spent so much time [on set] infuriated… I can’t believe the way I was acting half the time.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart recently made her directorial debut with “The Chronology of Water.” Starring Imogen Poots, Thora Birch and Jim Belushi, the film follows a woman who copes with her childhood trauma through swimming and the written word. The film landed Stewart on Variety‘s annual 10 Directors to Watch for 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCon Pederson, one of four special effects supervisors on “2001: A Space Odyssey,” died Friday at the MPTF residence in Woodland Hills following complications from Alzheimer’s. He was 91. \n\n\tPederson was a fixture in the field of science fiction filmmaking, particularly thanks to his involvement on Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” in 1968. Alongside three other special effects supervisors including Douglas Trumbull, Wally Veevers and Tom Howard, Pederson’s work led the director to his Oscar win for best visual effects in 1969. On set, Pederson ran the “war room,” where the VFX shots were planned, scheduled, tracked and evaluated. For each shot, anywhere from eight to ten elements were added to the original camera negative, an intricate process that took months.\n\t\n\n\tIn Michael Benson’s 2018 book “Space Odyssey,” the author quotes Trumbull as saying, “The film’s post-production process was epic in its complexity and Con was the smartest guy in the room.” He added that “‘2001’ absolutely would not have happened without Con.”\n\n\n\tAfter working on the film, Pederson went on to co-found pioneering computer animation company Robert Abel and Associates, where he worked as an animator and programmer alongside Bob Abel. Following the company’s closing, he continued as a creative lead at Metrolight Studios alongside Tim McGovern. \n\n\t“Con was a constant source of wisdom and knowledge,” said John Nelson, who met Pederson during his time at Robert Abel and Associates. “He was a Renaissance man who was both an artist and a technician. He could animate by hand or write computer programs to generate animations. Several people from Robert Abel’s went on to win Oscars for Visual Effects. I was lucky enough to be one of them.” \n\t\n\n\tBefore Pederson began his career in the film industry, he attended UCLA, where he majored in art and anthropology. During his time there, Pederson was hired at Disney after making student films. He was then drafted into the U.S. Army, where he worked with Wernher von Braun on rocket projects. Pederson went on to work at Graphic Films following his time, where he wrote and directed the 1964 film “To The Moon And Beyond” for the world’s fair. Kubrick saw the film, and thus hired Pederson to work on “2001: A Space Odyssey.”  \n\n\tOutside of work, he created crossword puzzles that were published across the New York Times, the Wall St. Journal and the Washington Post, and loved science fiction, hiking, sailing and collecting and building things with bricks he had collected from all over the country.\n\n\tPederson is survived by his wife Carole and his son Eric, stepchildren Tracey and Morgan and grandchildren Alex and Vivi.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart went after Donald Trump for fixating on oil after launching airstrikes on the Venezuelan capital and capturing the nation’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n\t“Now look, generally, in American history, when we intervene in another country, whether true or not, we come up with a high-minded pretense,” Stewart said partway through Monday night’s broadcast. “Liberating a people, spreading democracy, introducing baseball to the Japanese. They complained at first, but totally worth it. On what moral foundation will this conflict be framed?”\n\t\n\n\tThe show then cut to footage of a press conference on the morning after the strikes, where Trump told reporters, “We’re going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil. We’re going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.”\n\n\n\t“Seems a little on the nose,” Stewart joked. “Oil, precious commodity, certainly. But not the reason a country formed 250 years ago on the ideas of liberty and self-determination would go into a country and snatch a man at night. There must be a slightly more noble pretense?”\n\n\tStewart then cut to Trump on Air Force One, where he told a gaggle of press, “We need total access. We need access to the oil.”\n\n\t“Sir, again, I see where we are going here,” added a frustrated Stewart. “Do you mind reframing that? I’m not quite clear on the high-minded principle behind this.”\n\n\tStewart then played another clip from the Saturday press conference, where Trump plainly stated, “In other words, we’ll be selling oil.”\n\t\n\n\tThe late-night pundit then exclaimed, “Is this your first war? What the fuck?”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil’s debut as the anchor of the “CBS Evening News” came widely heralded — by Tony Dokoupil.\n\n\tThe broadcast journalist, who since 2019 had been CBS’ morning show co-anchor, came into the seat once held by Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and Katie Couric with plenty of attitude, saying in a recent social-media comment that he would be “more accountable and more transparent” than had been legendary anchor Cronkite and, on New Year’s Day, sharing a video in which he declared his broadcast had often “missed the story” by privileging “the perspective of advocates and not the average American.” \n\t\n\n\tAll of which conveniently mirrored the career-long attitude of Dokoupil’s new boss; Bari Weiss, the opinion journalist brought in last year as CBS News’ editor-in-chief by new Paramount leader David Ellison, has long evinced a relentless focus on presenting her perspective as that of the common man, no matter how many of her fellow Sun Valley attendees may coincidentally share it. \n\n\n\tDokoupil carried out the brief. On his hurriedly moved-up debut Saturday night, before his official start date, the anchor covered the U.S. capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro almost exclusively through a lengthy but unchallenging interview of U.S. defense secretary Pete Hegseth, one in which the administration’s perspective was aired so thoroughly as to raise the question of when an interview becomes a press release. (In this aspect, Dokoupil’s work certainly suited the Weiss doctrine: The news chief’s first big scandal on the job arose right before Christmas when she held a “60 Minutes” segment over its not sufficiently representing the side of the administration, who had declined comment in the first place. For Weiss, it may not be news if the nation’s current leadership doesn’t get an unchallenged say.) \n\t\n\n\tAnd in his official first broadcast on Jan. 5, Dokoupil betrayed a Weissian willingness to bulldoze past that which might seem too untidy for whatever hypothetical viewer he and his editor have in mind. Dokoupil blandly stated to the camera that a Russian-Chinese-Iranian base of influence in Venezuela will be destabilized by the U.S. military action, without citing any source or consulting any guest; a brief interview with a financial expert about how the events in South America will affect the price of gasoline never broached the notion of whether the U.S. extracting Venezuelan petroleum is legal. Perhaps that might have constituted consulting advocates, and not the average American. But it would have been part of telling the whole story. \n\n\tNot that that seems to be Dokoupil’s strong suit, or his interest. Elsewhere, in a segment about health and human services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s newly announced and seismic shifts to the recommended vaccine schedule for children, Dokoupil began an interview with a CBS News medical journalist by asking what this expert would say to “parents out there who are celebrating,” because they thought their kids were obliged to be injected with too many vaccines. He ended the segment by declaring “So, parents are going to have some options for themselves!” when, to a large portion of the audience, the precise opposite is true — they’ll now need a physician consult to obtain a vaccine for their child that was once more easily obtained. Dokoupil thanked his guest and announced, brashly, “You clarified it for us.” The guest could be said to have tried his best, despite Dokoupil. \n\n\tWeiss has been reported to have pursued Fox’s Bret Baier and CNN’s Anderson Cooper for this role, but after both stars wisely chose to keep their sinecures, she likely had to choose from among the army she had — but Dokoupil lacks the charisma and aptitude to turn the “Evening News” into whatever it is she may want. He babbled confusedly, then fell silent, when a segment about Sen. Mark Kelly jumped ahead of a segment about Gov. Tim Walz in the lineup — the kind of shift an anchor is supposed to be able to handle without painfully long seconds of dead air. “First day, big problems here,” Dokoupil said with evident frustration.\n\t\n\n\tAnd an newscast-ending segment about a small town in Oregon raising funds by selling a nude calendar of senior citizens felt neither like the news (the movie “Calendar Girls,” about a similar real-life case in the U.K., is more than 20 years old) nor conveyed with wit, elan — or even access. Weiss’ journalism, through her career, has many things that distinguish it, but it fundamentally lacks sensibility. Why was just broadcasting a bunch of nude photos of senior citizens a story? So that Dokoupil could giggle through it. \n\n\tThankfully, just like parents, viewers have some options for themselves — and few, it seems likely, will choose this reboot. The hypothetical viewer who wishes their news were pitched at a more conservative tenor is super-served by Fox News and Newsmax; evening newscast viewership has been dropping across the board, and, in terms of comfort in the chair and ability to convey thought, Dokoupil has a way to go and will likely move in the wrong direction. Say this much, though: Weiss’ management of “60 Minutes” has so far been a tragedy, in that it is shattering the credibility and prestige of what remains to this day one of the signature, and most popular, programs of any type in American television. The “Evening News” has been ebbing into irrelevance for years for reasons entirely beyond political slant. Perhaps sequestering Dokoupil there might contain the damage that might be done by an anchor whose ambitious ability to see which way the wind blows has so far outstripped his broadcasting talent.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe team behind Yash‘s “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has revealed Rukmini Vasanth as Mellisa, continuing the character-driven rollout that has positioned the production as one of 2026’s most anticipated releases.\n\n\tFollowing character unveilings for Kiara Advani as Nadia, Huma Qureshi as Elizabeth, Nayanthara as Ganga and Tara Sutaria as Rebecca, the poster introduces Vasanth’s character within a 1960s party atmosphere. The image captures Mellisa moving through festive surroundings with focused determination, presenting a figure who maintains sharp composure amid surrounding chaos.\n\t\n\n\tVasanth made her Kannada-language film debut with “Birbal Trilogy” in 2019. She earned the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress – Kannada for her performance in the two-part romantic drama “Sapta Saagaradaache Ello – Side A and Side B” in 2023. Her subsequent work includes “Baanadariyalli,” “Bagheera” and “Bhairathi Ranagal,” alongside her Telugu-language debut in “Appudo Ippudo Eppudo.” In 2025, she entered Tamil cinema with “Ace” and “Madharaasi,” and appeared in “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1,” one of the year’s highest-grossing Indian film. Vasanth trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.\n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\t\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\t“What I admire most about Rukmini is her intelligence as an actor. She doesn’t just perform, she processes. She asks questions, not out of doubt but out of curiosity. It pushes me to think deeper and sometimes even my own choices as a director,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “Watching her work reminds me that intelligence on screen often lies in what is left unsaid. Between shots, I often see her quietly writing in her journal, capturing thoughts, small anecdotes from the set. Those moments say a lot about her process. She is constantly building her own inner world. I find her approach incredibly thoughtful, and at times I honestly wish I could steal those pages and read through them, just to understand the mind behind such a layered performance.”\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tWritten by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic: A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has been shot simultaneously in Kannada and English, with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\tThe production features National Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer TP Abid. Action choreography comes from Hollywood’s JJ Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside National Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe actors are about to have their say.\n\n\tThe Screen Actors Guild Awards may have a new name, but their importance in the Oscar race is as vital as ever. Now called the Actor Awards, nominations will be announced Jan. 7. With more than 122,000 SAG-AFTRA performers eligible to vote — the largest voting body of any major awards show — the results often reflect populist tastes and broad mainstream appeal.\n\n\n\tThis year’s eligibility window covers performances released between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2025, setting up what appears to be a competitive field across all categories.\n\t\n\n\tSince the ensemble category was introduced in 1995, only four films — “Braveheart” (1995), “The Shape of Water” (2017), “Green Book” (2018) and “Nomadland” (2020) — have gone on to win best picture at the Academy Awards without earning a SAG ensemble nomination. Since the Academy expanded the best picture field in 2009, 61 of the 80 films nominated for SAG ensemble — a 76% success rate — have also received best picture nominations, underscoring the category’s value as a reliable Oscar indicator.\n\n\tThe ensemble race is as crowded as ever. \n\n\tWarner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” is entering as an early frontrunner with a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn, and a lineup that fits the guild’s well-established preference for recognizable names. There’s also some history to possibly be made. At a projected seven nominations, Paul Thomas Anderson’s action epic is poised to become the most nominated movie in the history of SAG. And there’s still room for one more in case Regina Hall makes the cut in supporting actress alongside Teyana Taylor.\n\t\n\n\tThe list of the most nominated films in SAG history is currently a six-way tie with five each: “Shakespeare in Love” (1998), “Chicago” (2002), “Doubt” (2008), “The Banshees of Inisherin” (2022), “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022) and “Wicked” (2024). Of those, “Shakespeare,” “Chicago” and “Everything Everywhere” went on to win the SAG Award for best cast ensemble before clinching the Academy Award for best picture. “Doubt” took home best actress at SAG for Meryl Streep (but lost the Oscar) while “Banshees” and “Wicked” both went home empty-handed.\n\n\tObviously, SAG’s predictive strength extends to the film acting races as well. Since 2009, SAG’s film acting nominees have overlapped with the Academy Awards an average of 16 out of 20 slots, an 80% match rate. The strongest alignment came in 2009, the year of “The Hurt Locker,” when 19 of 20 SAG nominees went on to earn Oscar nominations. The weakest crossover occurred in 2021, the year of “CODA,” when the overlap dropped to 12 of 20.\n\n\tLast year’s best actor winner, Timothée Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), continues his momentum and is back with his turn as table tennis prodigy Marty Mauser in Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme.” Notably, no film actor has ever won back-to-back SAG Awards. That could open the door for someone else to take the top spot. Nonetheless, DiCaprio, Michael B. Jordan and Ethan Hawke are all expected to hear their names called. The organization has not been kind to non-English language performances, which is why a snub is projected for “The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura. Despite emphatic praise from critics, the guild’s longstanding hesitation to nominate non-English language performances — see Sandra Hüller’s omission for “Anatomy of a Fall” — remains a barrier.\n\n\tStill, there is some expected recognition for non-English storytelling with Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas all predicted to make their respective lineups for the Norwegian family drama “Sentimental Value.”\n\n\tActors who are mainstays at the ceremony such as Glenn Close (who has 10 individual nominations and could appear for “Wake Up Dead Man”) or William H. Macy, who could find his way to a nomination for his work in “Train Dreams,” which is predicted to land in the cast ensemble category.\n\t\n\n\tOn the television side, the drama series race will likely be dominated by streaming platforms, with Apple TV’s “Severance” and HBO Max’s “The White Lotus” expected to lead the pack alongside Netflix’s final season of “Stranger Things.” In comedy, FX’s “The Bear” and HBO’s “Hacks” remain fixtures, while Apple TV could break through with Seth Rogen’s “The Studio.” \n\n\tSome of the other individual acting categories showcase a mix of established favorites and veterans — Jean Smart, Jeremy Allen White, Adam Scott — and relative newcomers like Glen Powell for “Chad Powers.” \n\n\tThe limited series categories are heavily weighted toward Netflix, which could claim as many as eight of the 10 nomination slots across both male and female actor categories, led by their Emmy-winning miniseries “Adolescence.”\n\n\tNominations will be announced Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. Final voting to determine the winners will take place from Jan. 14 through Feb. 27 at noon Pacific time. The 32nd annual Actor Awards, presented by SAG-AFTRA, will air live on Netflix on March 1.\n\n\tThe final predictions in all film and TV categories are below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFilm Categories\n\n\tCast Ensemble in a Motion Picture\n\n\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n“Marty Supreme” (A24)\n“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) \n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\n\n\tAlternates: “Sentimental Value” and “Wicked: For Good”\n\n\tMale Actor in a Leading Role\n\n\nTimothée Chalamet, “Marty Supreme” (A24)\nLeonardo DiCaprio, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\nJoel Edgerton, “Train Dreams” (Netflix)\nEthan Hawke, “Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics) \nMichael B.

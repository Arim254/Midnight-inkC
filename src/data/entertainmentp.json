    "body": "\n\tThe FBI announced on Thursday that it would increase the reward to $100,000 for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie or to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance. \n\n\tThe agency also released new identifying details about a possible kidnapper, describing the suspect as “a male, approximately 5’9” – 5’10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack,” the Phoenix bureau of the FBI posted on X. \n\t\n\n\tThe bureau has received over 13,000 tips since Savannah Guthrie‘s mother was reported missing on Feb. 1, and it said the description might help narrow down the tips. \n\n\n\tThe description was obtained from a forensic analysis of the Ring camera video from Guthrie’s front door . On Tuesday, the FBI released the first images taken from the Ring camera, which showed a masked man with a backpack who was armed with a gun. The video appeared to be captured just before the camera was disabled. \n\nToday, the FBI is increasing its reward up to $100,000 for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.New identifying details about the suspect in the kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie have been… pic.twitter.com/GJcx4ra6wX— FBI Phoenix (@FBIPhoenix) February 12, 2026\n\n\n\tNancy Guthrie was reported missing on Feb. 1, and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department declared her disappearance a crime on Feb. 2. Sheriff Chris Nanos said that he believed Nancy Guthrie did not leave her house “on her own” after investigators found “concerning” evidence at her Arizona residence.\n\n\tAlso on Tuesday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department told ABC News that a person had been detained for questioning in connection with the case and that authorities were preparing a search of a location in relation to the detainee. However, that person was later released. \n\t\n\n\tPatel wrote with the release of the photos, “Working with our partners – as of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie’s front door the morning of her disappearance.”\n\n\tSavannah Guthrie on Monday posted a video to her Instagram begging for the public’s help in recovering her mother. \n\n\t“We believe our mom is still out there,” Savannah Guthrie said in the video. “We need your help. Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home — trying to find her. She was taken and we don’t know where. And we need your help.”\n\n\tShe continued, “So I’m coming on just to ask you not just for your prayers, but no matter where you are — even if you’re far from Tucson. If you see anything, if you hear anything, if there’s anything at all that seems strange to you — that you report to law enforcement. We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has described its recently released “The Pete Davidson Show” as a “video podcast” — and now SAG-AFTRA has signed an agreement with the streamer that covers the production as such.\n\n\tThe talk show hosted by the “Saturday Night Live” alum, which debuted Jan. 30 on Netflix, sort of looks like a TV show. For one thing, it’s available exclusively on Netflix, not widely distributed on major audio platforms like Apple Podcasts or Spotify as is typical for podcasts.\n\t\n\n\tAfter the Davidson show was announced, SAG-AFTRA reached out to Netflix to discuss whether the project should be treated as a TV show or a podcast. On Thursday, the actors union announced that it struck a podcast agreement. \n\n\n\t“SAG-AFTRA and Netflix have executed a podcast agreement covering ‘The Pete Davidson Show,'” a rep for the union said in a statement to Variety.\n\n\tThe news comes as SAG-AFTRA on Monday (Feb. 9) commenced a round of bargaining on a new overall agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), of which Netflix is a member.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA didn’t disclose the terms of the podcast agreement with Netflix for the Davidson show. But typically the union’s podcast agreements have less stringent requirements than TV agreements do. Whereas TV contracts require payment of residuals, podcast contracts generally do not. In addition, TV contracts have relatively strict rules regarding a production’s safety protocols, working hours, breaks and travel, which are often simplified in podcast agreements.\n\n\tAccording to its FAQ on podcast contracts, the union says, “SAG-AFTRA negotiates term Podcast Agreements with podcast companies that have minimum rates and specific terms that may be different from our promulgated agreements. We also have contracts and relationships with broadcast shops and audiobook companies that produce podcasts.”\n\t\n\n\tOn “The Pete Davidson Show,” the comedian sits down “with his famous friends for revealing conversations from the comfort of his garage,” Netflix says. The guests on the first two episodes of the show are Machine Gun Kelly (MGK) and Charlamagne Tha God.\n\n\tThe podcast is produced by Above Average president Marc Lieberman and Ayala Cohen (former head of  talent at “SNL”). Sarah Brennan Kolb directs. Separately, Davidson has made two comedy specials for Netflix: 2020’s “Alive From New York” and 2024’s “Turbo Fonzarelli.”\n\n\tNetflix also has an original video podcast hosted by former NFL star Michael Irvin called “The White House,” featuring sports analysis from a rotating roster of co-hosts including former pro football wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Currently SAG-AFTRA and Netflix do not have a podcast agreement covering this show.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRapper Cardi B has repeatedly spoken out about her dislike of Donald Trump, but now the Grammy-winning rapper is beefing with the Department of Homeland Security over Jeffrey Epstein’s files.\n\n\tIt all started with her Wednesday night concert in Palm Desert, Calif., as part of her “Little Miss Drama Tour.” Cardi B sounded off on any potential ICE federal agents that may have been at the concert.\n\n\n\t“Bitch, If ICE comes in here, we gon’ jump they asses,” she reportedly said on stage. “I’ve got some bear mace in the back! They ain’t taking my fans, bitch.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Department of Homeland Security’s X account then had a scathing reply to a TMZ article about Cardi B’s ICE comments.\n\n\n\t“As long as she doesn’t drug and rob our agents, we’ll consider that an improvement over her past behavior,” Department of Homeland Security posted. The reply was a reference to Cardi B’s comments years ago about how she allegedly would drug and rob men in hotels when she worked as a stripper. In 2019, she said “whether or not they were poor choices at the time, I did what I had to do to survive” and “I never claimed to be perfect or come from a perfect world.”\n\n\tCardi B fired back at the Department of Homeland Security by replying, “If we talking about drugs let’s talk about Epstein and friends drugging underage girls to rape them. Why y’all don’t wanna talk about the Epstein files?”\n\n\tSince the Department of Justice unveiled more than three million more files of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in recent weeks, several celebrities, politicians and major public figures have had to answer for their past ties with him. Trump is named more than 5,300 times in the Epstein files, according to the New York Times, but he’s denied any wrongdoing and has so far not faced any consequences. \n\t\n\n\tIn the music world, Wasserman Group founder Casey Wasserman is facing backlash over his past ties to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s associate who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex trafficking. Chappell Roan, Orville Peck and more artists have left Wasserman Group and called for the CEO to step down from the company.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNineteen92 is ready to show off its latest magazine cover after teasing a photo shoot with “Heated Rivalry” star Robbie G.K. on Instagram two weeks ago.\n\n\tAnd only Variety has the first look at one of the covers and a selection of the sexy pics from the digital magazine’s February issue.\n\n\tIn one photo, G.K., who plays Kip on the hit queer hockey series, shows off his body, going shirtless underneath a blazer. In another shot, he flexes his biceps in an asymetrical tank top.\n\t\n\n\tThe black and white portraits are by photographer and Nineteen92 editor-in-chief Tyler Chick. Andrew Matarazzo served as creative director, with styling by Peiwen Wang and groom by Abraham Esparaza.\n\n\n\t“He has such a great leading man look, and I think it was really elevated in the way we captured him,” Matarazzo says. “Watching him embrace clothes that were very much outside of his personal style, and seeing his confidence grow from the start of the shoot was exactly why I enjoy directing actors who are open to going outside their usual comfort zones. Robbie is definitely starting a new chapter ahead.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyler Chick\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” propelled its four male leads – Hudson Williams, Connor Storrie, François Arnaud and G.K. — to stardom within weeks of HBO Max acquiring the series from Canadian streamer Crave and premiering the first two episode over the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n\tThe show follows the secret decade-long affair between champion hockey players Ilya (Storrie) and Shane (Williams). In the third episode, professional hockey player Scott (Arnaud) comes out of the closet by kissing Kip on the rink after his team wins the Stanley Cup.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyler Chick\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“For Nineteen92, I’ve taken a lot of inspiration from old masters like Albert Watson and Peter Lindbergh, and when I partnered with Andrew he really saw the uniqueness of showing the soul of the person in the work,” Chick said. “I want to capture people, not airbrush away their humanity. Our humanity is so precious and so filtered nowadays, I’d like to look back at this project as something that was authentically honest and captured who these artists were at this point in time.”\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” is based on “Game Changer,” Rachel Reid’s series of queer hockey romance novels. While storylines for Season 2 have yet to be revealed by series creator Jacob Tierney, Reid told me in December that she hopes Scott and Kip will be featured more because of the couple’s popularity among the show’s fans.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyler Chick\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMore of G.K.’s photos will be released on Nineteen92’s Instagram throughout this weekend.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe axe is still swinging above CBS News.\n\n\tThe Paramount Skydance unit is considering a fresh round of layoffs, according to three people familiar with the matter, and the cuts could total at least 15% of current staff, marking the latest move by editor in chief Bari Weiss as she attempts to focus the news division on streaming video and presenting more points of view to audiences.\n\n\tCBS News declined to make executives available for comment. Discussions around layoffs and staff reductions remain fluid, two of these people say, and a timeline for putting them into place — if that decision is final — could start as early as March and as late as May. And while the discussions around personnel have not solidified, they are serious, one of these people said.\n\t\n\n\tSome staffers have already chosen to head to the exits. About 11 producers tied to “CBS Evening News” have opted for buyout packages that were initially offered last month.\n\n\tDuring a recent town hall meeting, Weiss told staffers that CBS News needed to do less so-called “commodity” news that people could get from other outlets, and seek instead “to do things that are antimemetic, that are not imitative, that are differentiated, that are things you can’t get anywhere else.” She unveiled a spate of new hires of podcasters who focused less on straight journalism and more on niche fields including politics and medical health. “Right now in America, people are skeptical of institutions, but they trust individuals,” Weiss said.\n\n\tOne of those individuals, a longevity guru named Peter Attia, has come under scrutiny because of revelations of tries he had to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Weiss, a conservative-leaning opinion writer who sold The Free Press to Paramount for $150 million, has resisted calls to purge Attia from the roster of new CBS contributors she brought on board.\n\t\n\n\tCBS News, like other parts of Paramount Skydance, has already been through a few rounds of cuts, as both old managers and new — the Redstones who backed Pararmount for years, and the new David Ellison-led company that has formed since a sales — have lopped employee rolls across the conglomerate. Like many of its rivals, Paramount Skydance is hobbled by a suite of declining cable networks that carry less relevance to video-watchers who have grown accustomed to creating their own viewing schedules across different streaming hubs.\n\n\tWhile there are reasons to shake up parts of CBS News — its evening and morning programs have long run in third place — Weiss appears to be more focused on making news programming more relevant to people who might find it on Paramount+ rather than CBS. Even so, CBS News programs such as “60 Minutes” and “CBS Sunday Morning” continue to have sizable influence and grab good-sized TV audiences — and the advertising dollars that follow them. If there are fewer people at CBS News, will the remaining staff be ample enough to make new content for streamers, while keeping the TV audience coming in?\n",

    "body": "\n\tMargot Robbie is crediting Rachel McAdams with helping her become an A-list movie star. During a BBC Radio 2 interview on the press tour for “Wuthering Heights,” the “Barbie” actor and three-time Oscar nominee revealed she used to study McAdams’ viral audition for “The Notebook” before her own auditions in order to get into the right headspace. \n\n\t“I used to watch Rachel McAdams’ audition for ‘The Notebook’ before I would go to auditions. She’s so good, and she’s so charming and real, and like, in it,” Robbie said. “I used to watch it before I’d go to an audition, I was like, ‘OK, just try and be as good as her.’” \n\t\n\n\tWhen asked if McAdams’ “Notebook” audition actually ever got Robbie to win a role, Robbie answered: “Technically, you could say any part I got would’ve been in thanks to her because I was always watching her audition before. It’s just the commitment. I always watched it to remind myself that you have to fully commit in the audition room. And I got to work with her in ‘About Time.’ I had a small role, and she’s the lead in it. I was absolutely no one back then and she was so lovely to me and my brother. I’ll never forget how she’d go out of her way to be so kind. I just love her.”\n\n\n\tMcAdams won the role of Allison “Allie” Calhoun in “The Notebook” opposite Ryan Gosling, and the duo’s chemistry helped power the 2004 movie to become one of the most century’s most iconic romance movies. Robbie did not disclose which movies McAdams’ audition tape helped her land, but it sounds like a quite a few.\n\n\tRobbie and McAdams have both been out on the press circuit this winter promoting their new releases. McAdams is the star of Sam Raimi’s “Send Help,” which has topped the box office in its first two weekend of release. Robbie headlines “Wuthering Heights” opposite Jacob Elordi. The Warner Bros. release opens in theater Feb. 13 and is targeting a No. 1 debut with around $50 million.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor four seasons, “Bridgerton” fans have obsessed over every costume detail, like Daphne’s debutante whites, Penelope’s emerald transformation and the Queen’s increasingly outrageous wigs. The show’s costume designers have built their reputation on creating unforgettable looks that viewers screenshot, analyze and admire.\n\n\tSo when it came to Sophie Baek’s (Yerin Ha) silver masquerade gown in Season 4 — arguably the most narratively important costume in the show’s history — the team made a counterintuitive choice, intentionally keeping the design understated. Arguably, forgettable.\n\t\n\n\tWhen Sophie appears at the masquerade ball, she’s wearing a borrowed silver gown that matches the chandeliers in the Bridgertons’ ball room. It’s the dress that launches the season’s central romance, haunting Benedict Bridgerton’s (Luke Thompson) dreams and sketches. But according to costume designers John Glaser, George Sayer and Dougie Hawkes, the memory was always more important than the dress itself.\n\n\n\t“What’s interesting is that when you think about the silver dress, we see it when she puts it on, we see it at the ball, but then it’s no longer an important costume,” Glaser explains. “What is important is the image of it, because he draws it. It’s the memory of the shoe clip, the memory of the glove. We no longer see that costume. It’s all just the memory.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha, left, as Sophie Baek, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton in “Bridgerton.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRather than create something sharp and penetrating, Glaser and co-designers Sayer and Hawkes built what they described as an illusion. The team deliberately avoided anything that would create a clear memory in Benedict’s mind. “If it was a red dress with a hard red mask, and a hard dress that had a shape, his memory would have been much sharper,” Glaser says of the alternative. “But because it was an illusion, like a ghost.”\n\t\n\n\tThe fabric itself was chosen to remain unfocused. Sayer describes layering silver lace, sequins and crystals onto a light silver base, all done subtly so the dress would only reveal itself when Sophie moved. “You just see when she moves, you get this kind of shift, and you might get a shimmer of pattern,” she says. \n\n\tThe mask, too, was kept deliberately fuzzy. “You don’t really know where it started or stopped,” Glaser adds.\n\n\tWhile Sophie drifted through in silver uncertainty, other characters arrived in bold, unmistakable costumes — Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) as Zeus, Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie) as Joan of Arc with a distinctive bob. “Those are straightforward looks,” Glaser says. “You remember Cleopatra’s mask. You remember Joan of Arc. But can you describe what Sophie’s silver dress looked like? Not really. Silver. And that’s the idea — she is a little blurrier. You’re not really sure what it is over there.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAdjoa Andoh, left, as Lady Danbury, Ruth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton in “Bridgerton.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShowrunner Jess Brownell acknowledged the challenge of making Benedict’s failure to recognize Sophie believable — a plot point that has baffled viewers who wonder how he doesn’t see through such a minimal disguise. It requires, she admits, a willing suspension of disbelief.\n\n\t“We definitely talked about putting Sophie in a full face mask, a wig, etc., and at the end of the day, the meeting between the masked woman and Benedict is so important that she needed to be able to emote,” Brownell tells Variety. “But I think what we’re really relying on is the fact that class was such a major divide in that time period that even for someone like Benedict, who is fairly progressive, he just would never expect that the lady that he’s been looking for who he met at a ball would be a housemaid. The staff were essentially invisible during that period.”\n\n\tThat ambiguity carried through to the ball, which had no set theme or unified color palette beyond a single rule: avoid silver. Guests arrived as historical, fantasy or literary figures in a cacophony of color and character. The designers had ensured each bold costume harmonized with the others while standing in deliberate contrast to Sophie’s silver simplicity. “We wanted her to be the center of attention,” Sayer says, “but in the most subtle way possible.” \n\t\n\n\tBeyond the grand spectacle of the masquerade, the costume team also embedded quieter details that, surprisingly, even the show’s most devoted fans haven’t caught. Among them: Benedict’s leather bracelet, a signature accessory he wears throughout the season that many fans may have overlooked.\n\n\t“It’s the first time any man in ‘Bridgerton’ has worn a bracelet or anything on their wrist, and no one’s picked up on it,” Glaser says. “I find it amazing that no one’s like, ‘Oh my God, he’s got a bracelet. What does it mean?'”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLuke Thompson, left, as Benedict Bridgerton, Yerin Ha as Sophie Baek in “Bridgerton.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Bridgerton maid uniforms changed, too, with the team subtly altering the neckline to make them slightly sexier for Sophie’s storyline. The adjustment was delicate, Sayer explains, since viewers have seen these uniforms for three seasons. “It could only be a really slight change to the neckline in order to change it up a bit and make it look a little bit sexier.”\n\n\tFor the Cavender household scenes, Sayer made sure the neckline was open for practical reasons. When Benedict sees Sophie’s clothes in the rain, the water needed to soak through the sheer fabric against her skin. “To me it’s a major thing, but no one else has noticed it,” Glaser says of the uniform changes overall.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek in “Bridgerton.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOli Higginson, left, as Footman John, Sophie Lamont as Celia, Geraldine Alexander as Mrs. Wilson in “Bridgerton.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s clear that a well-oiled machine is essential for creating costumes this detailed. From research to fabric sourcing to sketches to embellishment, a single dress takes four to six weeks with four to five people working on it simultaneously. The Queen’s dresses, with their elaborate embellishment and grander nature, can be in production for months.\n\n\tWith only a handful of days to complete it the silver dress required an all hands-on approach, needing an army of people sat around the gown applying crystals, sequins and lace by hand. “There were about five or seven people all sitting around the dress doing the embellishment,” Sayer recalls. The timeline prompts Glaser to joke: “Let’s change that number to four to six years.”\n\n\tYet what makes Sophie’s gown particularly poignant is its origin. Unlike the other masquerade guests in deliberate costumes, Sophie isn’t wearing a fancy dress at all. “She wasn’t in fancy dress. She was just in a borrowed evening dress,” Sayer emphasizes. Her stepsister Rosamund’s maid Alfie found it in an attic. “I thought that was charming,” Hawkes says of the narrative choice. “The color was dictated by the fact it’s a borrowed dress, and that gave a lovely, soft story there.”\n\t\n\n\tSeason 4 gives us a Cinderella story stripped to its bones: a borrowed dress, a masquerade ball and a woman out of her depth. The gown looks stunning on screen, but try to describe it later and the details slip away just like Sophie when the clock strikes 12. It persists in Benedict’s perception, and by extension the audience’s, not as a catalogable object but as an impression: silver-toned, luminous, elusive.\n\n\t“It’s a little fuzzy,” Glaser says. “You’re not really sure. It’s not sharp enough.”\n\n\tExactly as designed.\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Multiple sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ ... producers currently have no plans to replace Jill on the E! series after she was fired this week over her controversial statements about Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime performance, which many people found to be racist.\n      \n    \n      \n      Jill Zarin’s review of Bad Bunny’s #SuperBowl Halftime Show… 🥴 pic.twitter.com/XH8f0HjQpI— Gibson Johns (@gibsonoma) February 9, 2026\n              @gibsonoma\n          \n  \n    \n          We're told the show's producers feel the remaining women are more than capable of carrying the show and don't need anyone else to take over Jill's spot.\n      \n    \n          Our sources also tell us fans could still see familiar faces from past RHONY seasons because there's chatter about cameos during filming. Speaking of former cast members, Dorinda Medley has just joined the reunion show ... but not as a full-time cast member, as of now.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported, Blink49 Studios cut ties with Jill on Tuesday after she posted and then deleted an Instagram video on Sunday criticizing Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show. The clip, later reposted on X, sparked backlash and ultimately led to her termination from the E! project.\n      \n    \n          Sources close to Jill told us she believes she was punished for expressing an opinion, especially when other Housewives have weathered controversies without losing their roles. Our sources tell us she quickly deleted the video after realizing she misspoke and, after rewatching the performance, came to better understand its cultural significance.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to reps for E! ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jill Zarin\n              \n                          \n                Bad Bunny\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Real Housewives\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Ellison’s heated battle with Netflix for ownership of Warner Bros. Discovery could wind up playing out prominently in Brussels, where regulatory officials are expected to formally open an antitrust probe as part of their approval procedure, once a deal with one of the two contenders is sealed in the U.S.\n\n\tBut even before a Warner Bros. Discovery deal is clinched stateside, so-called “pre-notification discussions” reviewing the rival merger scenarios are already underway within the European Union’s regulatory offices.\n\t\n\n\tSo where do Netflix and Paramount stand with Brussels?\n\n\n\tEllison, who is a man on a mission, made his case for Paramount Skydance with members of the EU’s Directorate-General for Competition as part of a recent European lobbying tour-de-force that also took him to France, where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron, and to Germany and the U.K.\n\n\tFollowing that European tour, Ellison sent an open letter earlier this month to journalists around the world — including in the U.K. and France — vowing that if Paramount Skydance clinches the Warner Bros. Discovery deal, that combined entity would produce at least 30 feature films per year which, he underlined, would all be released in movie theatres.\n\n\tIn the missive, which was published as a paid announcement in newspapers around the world, Ellison argued that audiences “are best served by greater choice — not less — and by a marketplace that encourages the full spectrum of filmmaking, content creation, and theatrical exhibition.” He claimed that a Netflix merger would instead eliminate “meaningful competition by creating a monopolistic or dominant entity.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix, meanwhile, is also believed to be discussing the ins and outs of a Warner Bros. Discovery merger with the EU regulator. And it’s an entity that the U.S. streaming giant knows well.\n\n\tNetflix has “a well-oiled machine when it comes to lobbying in Europe,” says François Godard, an analyst at Enders Analysis. The company has a longstanding dialogue with Brussels, he notes, having engaged in lots of back and forth over the EU’s Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS) norm that forces foreign streamers to invest a portion of their revenue into local productions. A norm that, by and large, Netflix abides by.\n\n\tBut at this stage, it can be argued that Paramount has an image advantage.\n\n\tMax von Thun, director of Europe at the Brussels-based Open Markets Institute, says he cannot rule out the possibility that a Netflix deal could clear regulatory hurdles in U.S. and then hit a wall in Europe, where the key regulatory issues will be the acquisition’s effect on European consumers as well as jobs in the production and theatrical exhibition businesses.\n\n\tAccording to Von Thun, Paramount Skydance is somewhat at an advantage with the European regulator because the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would have “a more clear impact on consumers,” he says, since “Netflix are obviously a bigger player in streaming than Paramount are.”\n\n\tThe EU is very sensitive on the issue of consumer prices. There are concerns that if Netflix decided to merge Netflix and HBO Max – which Netflix execs have said they will not do, at least initially — that would give them more leverage to hike subscription costs. Combining Netflix and HBO would also give a merged Netflix-WB more leverage in negotiations with European indie producers and content providers.\n\n\tAccording to Godard, just as in the U.S., the main concern in Europe over Netflix clinching the Warner Bros. Discovery deal revolves around the fear that Netflix’s victory could harm the theatrical business.\n\n\tThat’s a concern “which obviously Paramount is in a better position to defend,” he says.\n\n\tBut at the same time, Godard also thinks Netflix “could give very strong reassurances to European regulators that they don’t want to kill movie theatre releases.”\n\n\tIn mid-December, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Macron and French film bosses while he was in France for the premiere of “Emily in Paris” Season 4. He vowed to keep Warner Bros. movies in theaters during a fireside chat with Canal+ Group CEO Maxime Saada. “Our intention is to continue to release Warner movies theatrically, respecting traditional theatrical windows, and we will continue to operate Warner studios independently,” Sarandos said.\n\t\n\n\t“Netflix is after IP in this deal,” according to Godard. “I think they understand that the theatrical window still creates enormous long-term IP value; much more than TV or streaming,” he notes, citing the fact that the value of the “Harry Potter” and “Star Wars” franchises was created by theatrical play.\n\n\tThe International Union of Cinemas (UNIC), which represents film trade associations and theater operators in 39 countries across Europe, also recently met with the EU’s Directorate-General for Competition. After the meeting, they underlined in a statement that theatrical release windows are a “key principle” that has to be protected in any deal. But UNIC added that it does not support either of the current bids, noting that both mergers could result in a “significant downside for European cinema.”\n\n\tGerman producer Martin Moskowicz, former head of Constantin, which makes the “Resident Evil” franchise, agrees. “Neither of these deals are good for business,” he says.\n\n\tBut on the EU regulatory side, Moskowicz thinks Netflix has a slight advantage over Paramount.\n\n\tNetflix’s “antitrust exposure” is lower, he says, since it is already “deeply embedded in local production” in Europe where the company has “a lot more consumer and industry relationships” than Paramount has.\n\n\t“The one thing the EU will look into is [theatrical] windowing,” notes Moskowicz who, like Godard, believes Netflix will be able to make a convincing case that the streaming giant does not pose an ulterior threat to Europe’s withering moviegoing ecosystem.\n\n\tMoskowicz and Godard both note that Brussels could ask whichever contender emerges as victor for assurances on specific points, or impose some conditions before the EU gives their deal the greenlight. \n\n\tBut as Von Thun, Godard and other analysts have pointed out, EU regulators very rarely block media mergers. It did not happen with Disney-21st Century Fox in 2018, with Comcast’s bid for Sky the same year or with the 2021 merger of AT&T’s WarnerMedia and Discovery Communications.\n\n\tSo the biggest impact the EU could have on either Warner Bros. Discovery merger deal “could be delay,” says international lawyer Joseph Gulino, managing partner at DRRT. “In the U.S., I think we’ll see a quicker move to approve any deal that is favored by the DOJ and the White House,” Gulino points out. \n\t\n\n\tUltimately, in Europe, giving the green light will be up to the EU’s antitrust chief, Teresa Ribeira, who has been slapping hefty fines lately on Google and Elon Musk’s X for breaching European Union rules.\n\n\tBut while merger reviews are legally independent from each other in different jurisdictions around the world, don’t forget the bigger political picture.\n\n\tIn practice, “even if the regulators in Europe would say that they are not influenced by what happens in the U.S. obviously, they do take that into account,” says Von Thun.\n\n\tIn the end, U.S. President Donald Trump’s blessing for either deal may be as crucial to winning this battle in Europe as some consider it to be stateside.\n\n\t“We are in a very fraught geopolitical moment,” Von Thun says. “So I’m sure they [European regulators] will be thinking: ‘Oh, if we block this and Trump approves it, are we going to get some kind of backlash?'” \n",

    "body": "\n\t“All Heroes Are Bastards,” new series about migrants who gain superpowers and fight against injustice, was born out of frustration. \n\n\t“We made this series because we felt very powerless. We wanted to build a world where we had the power,” said Esra Phul. She directed and produced the show for Picture Me Rollin alongside Patrick Phul.\n\n\t“If we don’t tell these stories, no one will. As people from a minority, we can no longer rely on politics, the police or the press, which should challenge institutions but instead acts as their PR machine. So what’s left? This industry, because that’s where we get a chance to speak up.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, in Germany, the industry still “adds fuel to the fire.” \n\n\n\t“I attended a panel called ‘Up Next: Germany,’ and HBO Max presented two series. Both were about criminal immigrants, and one was a prequel to ‘4 Blocks,’ which has been very damaging to our community. The Berlin police allegedly used it as a material for their trainees to show them who they would see on the streets.”\n\n\t“It was really hard, and we left the room. I can’t stand it anymore and that’s how this series came to life: because of our anger. We suffer because of these shows. We’re good producers, we’re successful, and it’s important that we tell them what they’re making.” \n\n\tSpeaking during Berlinale Series Market panel “Rebel Rebel: Series Battling the Status Quo,” she added: “Wiedemann & Berg Film and HBO Max portray my people as criminals. We chose to show them as they are: as superheroes.”\n\t\n\n\tThe creators of eco-thriller “Phoenix” spent four years developing the show and interviewing activists, legal experts and political observers to ensure young climate activists were portrayed “responsibly and with nuance,” noted Philipp Kreuzer, CEO at Maze Pictures.\n\n\t“We’re not trying to excuse radicalism, and we’re certainly not celebrating it. What interested us was the moral dilemma: the moment when people who believe they’re doing the right thing cross a line. This inner conflict hasn’t often been explored in depth.”\n\n\tKreuzer, a lawyer, followed the legal team during the International Automobile Fair in Munich, which was met with large-scale protests. \n\n\t“When you meet many of the activists, you realize they’re educated, committed, and often deeply thoughtful people. At the same time, you sense a certain helplessness. When political or economic systems don’t seem to respond, frustration can intensify. Understanding that dynamic doesn’t mean endorsing radicalization, but if we want to prevent it, we have to understand how it develops.” \n\n\tEntertaining shows can reach people who wouldn’t normally be interested in politically charged subjects. \n\n\t“When I was growing up, one of my favorite shows was ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.’ It made me laugh, but it talked about important topics like Black history, identity and injustice,” said Patrick Phul.\n\n\t“With ‘All Heroes Are Bastards,’ on the surface, it’s about action and superheroes, but it talks about real-life issues. We want to reach people who don’t deal with these topics every day.” \n\n\tThe superhero genre made it easier.\n\n\t“There are some exceptions, like ‘Black Panther,’ but when you think about ‘Iron Man’ or ‘Batman,’ these heroes are billionaires. In real life, billionaires are usually the bad guys. In ‘All Heroes Are Bastards’ we try a different approach, but you still know who the villains are. To reach people, you can’t be too abstract.” \n\n\tAccording to Pandora da Cunha Telles, the creator of “The Marquise,” characters that question the status quo are exactly what the world needs right now. \n\n\t“It’s obvious that there needs to be a rebellion,” she said, mentioning that many women are still “trapped in small violences” from which they cannot escape. The protagonist of “The Marquise” is stuck in a convent in the 18th century. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘The Marquise’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUkbar Filmes\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The message for someone trapped in her life is that she has the power to be a rebel and a leader. It’s not just the politicians – each one of us can change something in our lives. Creating female characters that are not black-and-white helps contemporary viewers understand that.” \n\n\tMaking sure women were on both sides of the camera was also crucial. \n\n\t“In Portugal, it’s still hard to put female creators in charge of shows. One of the biggest challenges is empowering scriptwriters and creators. In our show, we depict women enjoying cakes and long erotic scenes. In the editing room, we heard: ‘Aren’t they too long?’ Would you ask the same thing if a man was leading these scenes? It was one of the shows I worked on with more women, and it was a whole new ballgame.”\n\n\t“All Heroes Are Bastards,” “Phoenix” and “The Marquise” were all presented at the Berlinale Series Market Selects.\n\n\tRebellious characters can scare decision-makers. “Phoenix” ended up being a part of a public inquiry in France.\n\n\t“It was striking to see our series discussed in parliament. In a country with such a strong tradition of political art and debate, that shows how sensitive these topics have become. But perhaps that’s not a bad thing. If a story doesn’t create discomfort, maybe it isn’t engaging deeply enough,” said Kreuzer. \n\n\tIn today’s polarized climate, content creators should try to represent all parts of our society, including those who feel unheard or “who vote differently from how we might expect.” \n\n\t“Ignoring that frustration won’t make it disappear. Fiction can create space for understanding without necessarily agreeing.” \n\n\tNational broadcasters have a huge responsibility when it comes to inspiring change, stated da Cunha Telles, with Kreuzer calling Europe’s public broadcasting model ‘worth defending’.”\n\n\t“It allows fiction to engage seriously with political and social questions. Commercial systems often prioritize different pressures, but our model provides space for stories that aren’t purely market-driven, and that space is valuable.”\n\n\tPatrick Phul admitted that broadcaster ARD Degeto Film motivated them to “be real.” But getting a seat at the table wasn’t easy.\n\t\n\n\t“We come from YouTube and we didn’t know anyone in this industry. We were lucky because someone with an immigration background opened the door for us,” said Esra Phul. Previously, the duo created “Hype.” \n\n\t“We also built our own awards show, Talent Over Privilege. It’s very, very difficult for people like us to enter these rooms.” \n\n\tStill, they did. And so can others. \n\n\t“There are those in the industry who recognize good stories and give people a chance,” said Patrick Phul. \n\n\t“Don’t give up.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Phoenix’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaze Pictures\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince and King Charles’ brother, was arrested Thursday morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\n\n\tAccording to the BBC, vehicles believed to be unmarked police cars arrived to Sandringham Estate in Norfolk early Thursday — Mountbatten-Windsor’s 66th birthday — where the disgraced royal has been living since he was ordered to leave his Windsor home following further revelations about his relationship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He is currently in custody as further searches are carried out in Berkshire and Norfolk.\n\t\n\n\tThe arrest comes after the Thames Valley Police said they were investigating a complaint that alleged the former prince had shared confidential material with Epstein. It marks the first time a modern British royal has been arrested.\n\n\n\t“As part of the investigation, we have today arrested a man in his 60s from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. The man remains in police custody at this time,” a statement from Thames Valley Police reads. “We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court.”\n\n\tIn a statement, King Charles said: “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office. What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”\n\t\n\n\tMountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal title in October over his ties to Epstein, and was mentioned and pictured many times in the over 3 million pages of documents — known as the Epstein files — released by the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month.\n\n\tMountbatten-Windsor, who had a longtime friendship with Epstein and maintained contact with him after his 2008 conviction of procuring a child for prostitution, has previously apologized and denied any wrongdoing. However, he has recently faced renewed scrutiny as the new documents included a photo of him that appears to be with Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with him as a teenager, which he had insisted was doctored. In 2022, he reached a settlement with Giuffre that did not include any apology or admission of liability. Giuffre died by suicide in April 2025.\n\n\tEarlier this month, Prince William and Kate Middleton released a statement about the latest Epstein documents. “I can confirm the Prince and Princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations,” a spokesperson said. “Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJioHotstar has joined forces with OpenAI to bring a ChatGPT-branded discovery experience to what is India’s most widely used streaming service, enabling its nearly half a billion monthly users to search for content through spoken or typed natural language rather than conventional menu navigation.\n\n\tThe partnership sees OpenAI’s technology embedded directly into the JioHotstar app, replacing keyword-driven search with an assistant capable of interpreting contextual and emotionally nuanced requests. Rather than hunting for titles manually, a viewer could describe a family situation or a personal quirk and receive tailored suggestions in response. The tool is also designed to work alongside live sports coverage, giving users a conversational way to access match information, player data, and key moments in real time.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal is designed to work in both directions. JioHotstar’s catalogue – which comprises over 300,000 hours of programming in 19 languages, drawn from a broadcast network of more than 100 channels as well as original and licensed content – will also be surfaced within ChatGPT itself. Users asking the chatbot for viewing suggestions will receive recommendations with direct links to relevant JioHotstar titles.\n\n\n\tJioHotstar’s parent company is JioStar, the Indian media giant formed from the merger of Disney’s Star India and Reliance’s Viacom18. \n\n\t“AI marks a transformative shift for the media and entertainment industry. It fundamentally disrupts every aspect of the value chain, from conceptualisation and production to discovery and monetisation,” said Uday Shankar, vice chair of JioStar. “Our partnership with OpenAI will allow viewers to discover, engage with, and even curate content simply using their voice. This is a fundamental reimagining of the entertainment experience; one that anticipates culture and feels deeply personal to every viewer.”\n\t\n\n\tFidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI, added: “Traditionally, entertainment is a one-way experience where you passively consume content – AI completely changes that dynamic. Through our partnership with JioHotstar, we’re bringing personalized AI directly into entertainment and live sports, turning every moment into an opportunity for deeper engagement.”\n\n\tThe experience will be introduced gradually, with an initial rollout across a limited set of features before broader deployment across both on-demand and live formats.\n\n\tThe announcement places JioHotstar among the first major streaming platforms in India to embed a named AI assistant at the core of its product, as the country’s increasingly crowded digital entertainment market pushes services to compete on intelligence and personalization rather than library size alone.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIko Uwais is returning to his home turf. The martial arts star who became a global name through the “Raid” franchise is set to lead “Warrior,” a new Indonesian action thriller that brings him back to the Silat-based fighting style that launched his career.\n\n\tThe film follows a former elite Silat practitioner who walks out of prison determined to leave his violent past behind – a resolution that quickly unravels when a Malaysian crime syndicate moves into his neighborhood, seizing control of local streets and going after the people he cares about. Drawn back into the world he tried to escape, he finds himself the sole obstacle between the syndicate and the community it wants to control. The conflict spirals from street-level intimidation into full-scale warfare, played out across Jakarta’s markets, back alleys and rooftops.\n\t\n\n\tThe film represents the first foray into solo directing for John Radel ACS, a cinematographer and producer who has worked on major productions across Asia and Hollywood, including Dev Patel’s “Monkey Man” and Michael Mann’s “Blackhat.” Radel has built an extensive working relationship with Uwais over four previous films as both DP and producer, and is also aboard the forthcoming action feature “Warpath,” which pairs Uwais with Scott Adkins.\n\n\n\tOn the producing side, the project unites Indonesian industry veteran Delon Tio – whose Nation Pictures banner has been behind many of the country’s most significant films, including the Mo Brothers’ debut “Macabre” – with Erika North and Nick North of Yeti Entertainment, a company with deep roots in international film development and finance across Asia and the U.S. Rounding out the team is Mike Leeder, an action producer working through Red Packet Media.\n\t\n\n\tUwais will take on an executive producer role alongside Ryan Santoso through his newly established Uwais Pictures label. International sales have been entrusted to K-Movie Entertainment.\n\n\tThe project is the first to emerge from a newly formed joint venture between Asia Media Alliance Group and Nation Pictures, which is focused on genre filmmaking across Southeast Asia for the international market. A broader slate of action and horror titles is expected to be unveiled in the coming months.\n\n\tProduction is set to kick off this summer, with the entire shoot based in Indonesia, drawing on local locations, crews and up-and-coming martial arts performers. \n\n\tUwais is represented by Brett Norensberg at Gersh and Mike Straut at Vault.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMMA fighter Sean Strickland went on a bigoted tirade on Wednesday during the Paramount+ and UFC media day event, during which he called Bad Bunny a “f—-t” and said women have been empowered “too much” to the point where they’ve “ruined society.”\n\n\tStrickland participated in the Paramount+ and UFC Media Day to promote his fight with Anthony Hernandez on Saturday night. The fight marks Strickland’s first bout since he was suspended from the UFC in July 2025 for attacking another fighter while working as a cornerman during an event.\n\t\n\n\tParamount+ did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. Reps for the UFC did not immediately respond for comment. \n\n\n\tWhen asked about Netflix’s upcoming MMA match between Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano, Strickland called the event an “insane” idea and suggested they should fight “half naked.” He then joked about Rousey’s abusive relationship with her ex-boyfriend.\n\n\t“Ronda Rousey can fight,” Strickland said. “That bitch can fight… I think she lost a few fights to her ex, but bitch can fight.”\n\n\tHe then said of Carano, “I like Gina. She’s like super conservative. She was hot, you know. I was like a kid when she fought. I may have jerked off to her once or twice back in the day.”\n\n\tThe former UFC middleweight champ went on to say that “no one gives a fuck about women’s sports.” He added, “There’s nothing wrong with women. They do great things. They cook, they clean.”\n\n\tIn later comments about the NFL, Strickland called Super Bowl LX halftime performer Bad Bunny a “fucking f—-t” and lamented the days when the National Football League was the “fucking standard of being a fucking man.”\n\t\n\n\t“I think they all get together around a table and say, ‘You know what guys, how do we ruin this sport? How do we gay it up?’” Strickland said, mocking NFL leadership. “’Why don’t we bring in a gay foreigner who doesn’t speak fucking English and have him perform [the halftime show]?’”\n\n\tIn August 2025, Paramount inked a seven-year deal with TKO Group under which Paramount+ became the exclusive home of all UFC events in the U.S. The contract has an average annual value of $1.1 billion, with an overall value of $7.7 billion. \n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert Carlyle has been cast as the guest lead in the seventh installment of Jed Mercurio‘s hit BBC crime thriller “Line of Duty.” \n\n\tThe BAFTA-winning actor, known for his roles in “Trainspotting,” “The Full Monty” and “28 Weeks Later,” will play Detective Constable Shaun Massie when the series begins filming this spring. Made for the BBC by World Productions, the new series is set to air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer next year.\n\n\n\tCarlyle joins returning series leads Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar, and is the first new cast member unveiled for the upcoming run. He follows a distinguished line of guest leads that has included Kelly Macdonald, Stephen Graham, Thandiwe Newton, Daniel Mays, Keeley Hawes and Lennie James.\n\t\n\n\tDC Shaun Massie is a Specialist Rifle Officer and veteran marksman operating with Tactical Operations Unit 7 (TO-7), tasked with taking down Organized Crime Groups. Described as a gruff loner who keeps to himself, Massie’s detached demeanor changes drastically when his commanding officer, DI Dominic Gough, is accused of being a sexual predator.\n\n\tThe new series picks up with AC-12 disbanded and rebranded as the Inspectorate of Police Standards, with Steve Arnott, Kate Fleming and Ted Hastings assigned their most sensitive case yet in what is described as an increasingly challenging climate for anticorruption work.\n\n\t“Having been a huge admirer of Jed Mercurio’s work for many years, I’m delighted to be given the opportunity to join such an exceptional cast for series 7 of ‘Line of Duty,'” Carlyle said. “The scripts for the series are excellent and will absolutely maintain the quality that the audience have come to expect from this fantastic show. DC Massie is an extraordinary character and I look forward to bringing him to life.”\n\t\n\n\tMercurio, who writes and creates the series and will direct episodes four through six, added: “Robert always brings mesmerising power and depth to every role; I know viewers will be on the edge of their seats wondering what his character will do next, and why.”\n\n\tWorld Productions CEO and creative director Simon Heath said: “As a young script editor starting out in the 90s, I was blown away by Robert’s stunning performances in ‘Trainspotting’ and ‘Cracker,’ so it’s a particular thrill to be working with him now.”\n\n\tLindsay Salt, director of BBC Drama, added: “Robert Carlyle is one of our greatest actors and the perfect fit for the phenomenon that is ‘Line of Duty.’\n\n\tJennie Darnell will direct the first three episodes, with Ken Horn serving as producer. Executive producers are Mercurio, Heath for World Productions and Nick Lambon for the BBC. The series will once again film in Belfast with support from Northern Ireland Screen. World Productions, part of ITV Studios, is handling international distribution.\n\n\tSeasons 1-6 of “Line of Duty” are currently streaming on BBC iPlayer.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Yuen Woo-ping needed horses, he used real horses. When he needed desert landscapes, he shot in actual deserts. And when he needed actors who could perform Hong Kong-style wirework and martial arts sequences without relying on digital enhancement, he assembled a cast of wushu champions — led by Wu Jing and Jet Li — who could deliver the physical authenticity his vision for “Blades of the Guardians” required.\n\n\t“Getting shots in camera has always been my way of working,” the director tells Variety. Yuen’s influence on martial arts cinema spans decades, from choreographing Jackie Chan’s “Drunken Master” to defining the visual language of “The Matrix” trilogy and “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” For “Blades of the Guardians,” that meant returning to practical filmmaking methods. “In Hong Kong filmmaking, many stylistic choices were born from necessity and limitation. We invented wirework because we didn’t have visual effects and that became a hallmark of Hong Kong filmmaking. For this film we knew we wanted to shoot it on location because we could not replicate the desert or working with actual horses and skilled stunt people using visual effects.”\n\t\n\n\tWell Go USA Entertainment released the historical action film in North America. The cast also includes Nicholas Tse (“Raging Fire”), Yosh Yu (“Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms”), and K-pop artists Jun (Wen Junhui) of Seventeen and Winwin of NCT. Based on Xu Xianzhe’s graphic novels, the film follows a skilled mercenary named Biao Ren navigating the harsh deserts of the Western Regions during the Sui Dynasty under the rule of the oppressive Emperor Yang Guang, who becomes entangled in a perilous scheme while completing what initially appears to be a simple escort assignment.\n\t\n\n\tThe filmmaker’s approach to choreography emphasizes what he calls clarity, weight and consequence. “Fight scenes to me are a kind of dialogue between characters,” Yuen says. “There is a back and forth and there are consequences with every movement. In a dialogue if a line doesn’t need to be said, it should be cut out. The same applies to fight scenes. Every move should advance the story.”\n\n\tThe film’s road movie structure allows this storytelling approach to unfold across different encounters and locations. “‘Blades of the Guardians’ is in some ways a road movie: we meet various characters, see different locations and get into all sorts of trouble along the way,” Yuen notes. A key storyline centers on Dao Ma and Di Ting, former brothers in arms now pitted against one another. “Their ending fight is a spectacular sequence but in the final moments, we suddenly see their differences in completely different light,” he reveals. “The journey that started a physical journey through the desert culminates in an emotional character journey and in a split second we are taken back to where the journey started.”\n\n\tAssembling the ensemble presented unique challenges. “Casting was a very big part of this film,” Yuen says. “Firstly because this is an adaptation of graphic novels, we wanted to capture the spirit of those characters created by Xu Xianzhe. Being an action actor doing real stunts is not easy work. On top of that they have to be good actors, which is even more difficult. Every generation produces a small handful of talented actors and I tried to match the best actor to every role from the graphic novels.”\n\n\tWorking with Jet Li again brought together decades of shared martial arts cinema history. “The challenge with casting Governor Chang is since Wu Jing is Dao Ma, Governor Chang must be Jet Li to make it believable that he can even be Wu Jing’s adversary,” Yuen explains. “Jet Li is such a skilled martial artist all the other actors bring their best to set every day. Even though Wu Jing, Jet Li and Max Zhang have dozens of injuries between them, they gave their best every day because it is rare to be able to work with such skilled performers.”\n\n\tWu Jing, Jet Li and Zhang are all wushu champions, which Yuen says creates a particular physicality on screen. “Wu Jing is a wushu champion like Jet Li and Max Zhang, so they all ‘speak’ the same language when it comes to martial arts,” he says. “There is a gracefulness in the movements and physicality of wushu that is perfect for a period film like this.”\n\t\n\n\tTony Leung Ka-fai, known for his versatility across genres rather than martial arts expertise, brought different strengths to the production. “Tony is a very professional actor. Even though he is not a trained martial artist, he was ready to learn,” Yuen says. “Hong Kong is a small film industry, but Tony and I never had the chance to work together until this film. He was able to bring emotional weight to Chief Mo’s character, who is the emotional core to Ayuya’s storyline.”\n\n\tFor younger cast members who underwent extensive physical training, Yuen emphasizes the importance of finding individual voices within the genre rather than simply replicating what has come before. “I think the most important thing I can pass on is that every filmmaker and every actor should find their own voice in this genre. That is the only way we will come up with new ideas and new stories,” he says. “When I first started directing, I realized my specialty was mixing action with comedy. It wasn’t a proven combination but it became very popular. In my experience trying to repeat what works usually doesn’t work.”\n\n\tAfter shaping action cinema across Hong Kong and Hollywood for decades, Yuen views the film as establishing the world of Xu’s graphic novels for potential future installments. “I am always looking to do something new and I also try not to think too far ahead,” he says. “With this film, I think we were able to establish the world of the graphic novels. There are so many books and so many characters; there are many ways to continue the story. This film took four years to put together, so first I will take a break for a few months!”\n\n\tPeace Film Production produced the project, with the screenplay written by Yu Baimei, Chao-pin Su, Chan Tai Lee and Larry Yang.\n",

Documentary Festival, which runs March 5-15, has been unveiled.\n\n\tThe 14 films taking part will be vying for a series of prizes, among them the Golden Alexander, accompanied by a cash prize of 12,000 euros ($14,200), and the Silver Alexander, accompanied by a cash prize of 5,000 euros ($5,900).\n\n\tTIDF is an Oscars qualifying festival and the film that wins the Golden Alexander will automatically be eligible to submit for Academy Awards consideration in the Documentary Feature category.\n\t\n\n\tHere’s the lineup of the International Competition (descriptions courtesy of the festival):\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Bugboy”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “Bugboy,” Lucas Paleocrassas, Greece-Denmark-France, 2026 (World premiere)George, a shy teenager with misaligned eyes, struggles to connect with others after his parents’ divorce. Finding refuge in the world of insects, he bonds with a cricket named Isabella. Through a portrait of transformation and self-discovery, the film reminds us that even the smallest creatures can help us find where we belong.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Golden Grip”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “The Golden Grip,” Fokion Bogris, Greece, 2026 (World premiere)In the mid-1960s, Kostas left his village in Crete dreaming of becoming a star. His rugged physique and humble background afforded him only small “tough-guy” roles, yet in numerous Greek films – from big studio productions and renowned auteur masterpieces to low-budget exploitation films alike. By placing a support actor at centerstage, the film traces five decades of Greek cinema.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Way Elsewhere”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “The Way Elsewhere,” Eirini Vourloumis, Greece, 2026 (World premiere)A portrait of Athens told through the lives of three veteran taxi drivers who move through the city as quiet dreamers. Konstantinos is approaching retirement after half a century behind the wheel, and begins each shift with a private ritual beneath the Acropolis. Sunny, a Nigerian actor and family man, drifts between faith, fatigue and a desire to return to artistic expression. Yorgos, an innate performer, sings love songs in small clubs at night. Blending observation with musical sequences, the film inhabits routine, memory and desire in a city shaped by crisis and persistence.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“All About the Money”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “All About the Money,” Sinéad O’Shea, Ireland, 2026 (European premiere)Can the system truly be overthrown from within? Who, if not Fergie Chambers, is better suited to answer such a question? The politically insurgent son of one of America’s wealthiest families, a staunch communist and sworn enemy of the plutocratic environment he was born and raised in, creates a revolutionary base in rural Massachusetts so as to fight against capitalism from within. With a subversive spirit and remarkable directorial finesse, the riveting “All About the Money” attempts an incredibly fascinating (and extremely alarming) study of the power and financial structures that dominate the modern world, while simultaneously outlining the portrait of a figure as mesmerizing as it is riddled with contradictions.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Around Paradise”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “Around Paradise,” Yulia Lokshina, Germany, 2026 (International premiere)Lost in the untouched landscapes of Paraguay, a strange community of Europeans attempts to build an enclosed “paradise,” far from everything they consider as decay in the modern world. Conspiracy theorists, right-wing extremists, and all sorts of eccentric people arrive in the community, whose founder and leader is a shrewd German man. Crafting the portrait of the community’s leader and tracing the stories of both the settlers and the Paraguayans around the sect that presents itself as a utopia, “Around Paradise” is an insightful film that – upon indirectly and allusively casting light on the so-called paradise through dark humor and a metaphysical lens – addresses a number of pressing issues of our time: from the rise of the far right and its historical roots to modern colonialism through the economy and digital technology.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Birds of War”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “Birds of War,” Janay Boulos and Abd Alkader Habak, U.K.-Syria-Lebanon, 2026 (European premiere)As civil war engulfs Syria, two young journalists begin collaborating remotely, exchanging text messages and voice notes to document the conflict. Abd captures stories from the ground, risking his life to film the war, while Janay shapes his footage from London, where she has lived since leaving Lebanon. Gradually, their professional relationship evolves into an intimate bond, despite never having met in person. Drawn from a remarkable archive spanning 13 years of revolution and war, the film reveals a love story shaped by distance, risk, and shared purpose. At the same time, it offers a powerful reflection on journalism, exposing the limits of news coverage and revealing the deeply human stories that exist beyond the headlines.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Candidates of Death”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “Candidates of Death,” Maciej Cuske, Poland, 2026 (World premiere)A father goes on holiday with his son and two of his friends, during which time they make an amateur horror film together. As the years pass, they continue to shoot scenes for their “handcrafted,” carefree, imaginative horror project, with even more passion, dutiful consistency, and unwavering commitment: the documentary chronicles a decade of this beautiful adventure, as Maciej and the kids become a group of people who grow up… and yet somehow still manage to grow younger together. An unexpected blend of documentary and coming-of-age film unlike any other; it’s as if the kids from “Stand by Me” decided to make a thriller, alongside a dad-director who refuses to grow up.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Closure”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Michal Marczak\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “Closure,” Michał Marczak, Poland-France, 2026 (European premiere)Shortly before dawn on May 27, 2023, 16-year-old Chris sneaked out of his house and took a bus to Warsaw. A closed-circuit camera captured images of him standing for 20 consecutive minutes on a central bridge in the city, silently looking out over the water. When the camera returned to the same spot a few moments later, Chris was gone. Daniel, Chris’s father, has been searching for him ever since, along the banks of the Vistula River, improvising methods and means of investigation. Mapping out a hypothetical path of loss and suicide, Daniel becomes a timeless and yet contemporary tragic hero, struggling to unearth answers to questions doomed to remain unresolved. A heart-wrenching journey through unfinished mourning and undying sorrow, with the unattainable promise of closure as its final destination.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Derek vs Derek”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “Derek vs Derek,” James Dawson, U.K., 2026 (World premiere)On a country road in Devon, England, live two implacably opposed neighboring farmers, both called Derek. One believes in intensive farming of his land so that food can be produced in abundance; the other is creating an oasis for nature on his land, driven by an entirely different perception of agriculture and a farmer’s duties. A wonderful ecological documentary that juxtaposes two wholly opposing approaches to farming, introducing us to two characters who share the same name, and whose constant clashes you’ll never tire of watching. The exquisite film, “Derek vs Derek,” raises pressing environmental issues, while conducting an exquisite study of idiosyncrasies at the same time, free of any pretension, though full of humor and substance.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“La Pietà”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “La Pietà,” Rafa Molés and Pepe Andreu, Spain-Iceland-Lithuania, 2026 (World premiere)At the foot of Europe’s largest glacier, seven Icelandic siblings once lived in deliberate isolation, dedicating their lives to observing ice and nature long before climate change had a name. Their abandoned farmhouse becomes a living archive, animated by photographs, objects, and a 16mm film that restores gestures, spaces, and a vanished way of being in the world. Blending observational filmmaking with found footage, Rafa Molés and Pepe Andreu, the duo behind the 2020 unforgettable Icelandic story of “Lobster Soup,” return to the Arctic North to craft a poetic, contemplative elegy in which time, memory, and matter converge. The glacier – now wrapped in vast white shrouds in a desperate attempt to slow its melting – emerges as both subject and body, altar and loss. “La Pietà” is a quiet yet devastating meditation on ecological grief, reverence, and the belated effort to protect what once shaped our existence.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Nuisance Bear”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “Nuisance Bear,” Gabriela Osio Vanden and Jack Weisman, U.S.-Canada, 2026 (International premiere)“I’ve never told this story. It might seem simple, but each story is a labyrinth that leads us somewhere we’ve never been”: Thus, an elderly Inuit begins recounting the story of his homeland: Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, “the Polar Bear Capital of the World,” where thousands of large animals wind up following the rhythm of the universe and the formation of ice. As a primordial thread lyrically and melancholically unfolds, intertwining the human and the non-human, a “disturbing” presence disrupts a vast landscape that has already been altered by human intervention – overtourism, mining, industrialization, mass settlement, desertification. Reintroducing us to a leading lady we met in one of the most impressive and commercially successful short films of recent years (“Nuisance Bear”), the directing duo from the fringes of the Arctic circle undermines the human gaze cast upon the planet and proposes a cinema that is, in essence, ecological – an ecosystem where all beings exist in the same way, laughing, hurting, wondering, and looking for food for the next day.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Soap Fever”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “Soap Fever,” Inka Achté, Finland-Sweden, 2026 (World premiere)With the Soviet Union’s dissolution dragging down the economy of neighboring Finland, the Scandinavian country was plunged into a period of protracted recession. And with no recovery in sight, a soap opera offered Finns a respite from the grim reality; the debut of “The Bold and the Beautiful” on television quickly amassed a vast and dedicated following, whereas the arrival of the series’ American idols in the country, on tour, elicited unprecedented frenzy. But beyond providing an indulgent, meta retrospective on the historical impact that the early 90s hit series had on Finland, “Soap Fever” also examines the circumstances in which the yearning for escapism reaches a breaking point, especially when everything seems bleak.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Beauty of Errors”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “The Beauty of Errors,” Jukka Kärkkäinen, Finland-Norway-Sweden, 2026 (International premiere)Family ties remain one of the most wondrous human mysteries, and the relationship between father and son is a relationship that has it all: tenderness, interdependence, esteem, conflict, disillusionment. Rarely does a film capture all the nuanced subtleties of the bitter, sometimes unbearable reality of the father-son bond, but also the remarkable devotion it requires: in “The Beauty of Errors,” Jukka Kärkkäinen revisits two figures he introduced in 2009 in his film, “The Living Room of a Nation”; Tero and his newborn at the time son, Henri. The subtle, yet insightful observation of Tero’s relationship with Henri, now at the threshold of adulthood, unfolds against the backdrop of the sleepy Finnish countryside, showcasing a story that at times resembles a pocket-sized epic (all passion and intensity), and at other times, a film by Kaurismäki or a wistful waltz, carrying a bittersweet affirmation of life – and its unceasing continuity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Golden Swan”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t● “The Golden Swan,” Anette Ostrø, Norway-Sweden-Denmark-The Netherlands (World premiere)In 1995, young Norwegian artist Hans Christian Ostrø travels to India in search of meaning and artistic growth. Months later, he is kidnapped in Kashmir and held hostage by the militant group al-Faran. During five weeks in captivity, he secretly writes poems and letters to his sister, filmmaker Anette Ostrø. Found on his body after his execution, these texts become the foundation of an intimate reconstruction of his final months. Through personal archives and present-day reflection, “The Golden Swan” transforms a landmark act of early modern terrorism into a deeply human story of courage, forgiveness, and moral resistance in the face of fear.\n",

The release noted police \"we will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance.\"\n      \n    \n          As you know, Andrew had close ties with Epstein over the years while the notorious pedophile was allegedly sexually abusing underage girls. Andrew's name is all over the Epstein Files, which were released by the Department of Justice after President Trump signed a bill requiring them to be made public.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          In the Epstein Files, Andrew is pictured kneeling over an unidentified woman sprawled out on a floor, touching her stomach over her shirt. Last October, Andrew was stripped of his royal titles due to his association with Epstein.\n      \n    \n          In 2019, Epstein died by suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.\n      \n    \n          This is a developing story.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

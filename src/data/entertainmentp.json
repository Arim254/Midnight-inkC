    "description": "\n\tThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inducting the White Stripes did not result in the reunion of the long-dissolved duo, as many had hoped, with Meg White ",
    "body": "\n\tThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inducting the White Stripes did not result in the reunion of the long-dissolved duo, as many had hoped, with Meg White remaining out of the spotlight, as she has been since they announced their split nearly 15 years ago. But if she was absent from the Hall of Fame proceedings at Los Angeles’ Peacock Theatre, her presence was very much felt in remarks from Iggy Pop, who formally inducted the pair, and especially from Jack White, who accepted on both their behalfs and even read a fable he wrote down this week about their origin story. \n\t\n\n\tFollowing the speeches, here were also salutes offered by two twosomes: Olivia Rodrigo and Feist, who sang “We Are Going to Be Friends” as a tender duet, and Twenty One Pilots, one of the few other true duo acts in the recent history of rock, recreating “Seven Nation Army” as a bass-and-drums-only rocker.\n\n\n\tSpeaking to his former drummer’s absence, White said: “I spoke with Meg White the other day, and she said that she’s very sorry she couldn’t make it here tonight, but she wanted me to tell you that she’s very grateful. And to all of the folks who supported her in all the years, it really means a lot to her. She also helped me write all this… I sent these things to her. She checked it for me for a lot of punctuation and corrections. She’s pretty good at that.”\n\n\tHe continued by sharing a random thought of Meg’s: “She said, ‘Do you remember, Jack? We used to walk around and animals, for some reason, would stare at us. They would stop and stare at us for some reason. Even at the Detroit Zoo, an elephant did the exact same thing one time.’ She just wanted me to tell you that,” he explained, to crowd laughter.\n\t\n\n\tWhite gave props to some other iconic duos — representing non-musical disciplines — that preceded the White Stripes onto the national artistic stage.\n\n\t“There was a duo of songwriters important around the time of the birth of rock ‘n’ roll called Leiber and Stoller, and they wrote a lot of songs that a lot of people probably never heard of, but they also wrote a couple that really connected with folks, like ‘Jailhouse Rock’ and ‘Stand By Me,’ and you for sure heard those songs,” White said. “There was once a duo called Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and they were a comic-book-hero writing team who came up with all kinds of heroes you’d never heard of — Slam Bradley and Dr. Occult and so forth — but they also came up with this character that really connected with people: Superman, I’m sure you heard of. And there was once a comedy duo called Abbott and Costello that I remember hearing from my father as a child that had thousands of jokes kept on white cards in a file cabinet, jokes and routines that nobody had ever heard before and they never got to perform, but they also developed a joke that for some reason really connected with people, and the routine was called ‘Who’s On First?’ I know you’ve heard that one.”\n\n\tMaking the connection, White added: “I myself have been in a lot of bands that you probably never heard of, but for some reason people especially connected with this one two-piece duo project that I was in called the White Stripes. We don’t know why these things connect with people, but when they do, it’s the most beautiful thing you can have.”\n\n\tWhite read off a litany of musicians he wanted to thank as influences, including such varied names as Loretta Lynn, Fugazi, the Misfits, Jethro Tull, the Troggs, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Arthur Lee and Love, the Flat Duo Jets, Dick Dale, Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow, the Sonics, Pavement, Black Flag, Sleater-Kinney, the Breeders, the Cramps, Merle Haggard, the Hives, Them, the Damned, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Minor Threat and Captain Beefheart.\n\n\tThere were other thanks to give. “To the factories and tools and electricity and vacuum tubes, we say thank you. To the Coney Islands of Detroit and the honky-tonks of Nashville and the corner pubs of London, we say thank you. To the homeless and the powerless and the forgotten, we always say thank you.”\n\t\n\n\tAs advice, he offered, “To the young artists, I want to say: get your hands dirty and drop the screens and get out of your little room and get obsessed. Get obsessed with something… We all want to share in what you might create.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJack White at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd then, a parable, which he said Meg White would be hearing for the first time along with the audience. \n\n\t“I was gonna send this to Meg, but I didn’t get around to it, so I thought I’d read it to you all tonight,” White began. “One time a girl climbed a tree and in that tree was a boy — her brother, she thought — and the tree looked so glorious and beautiful, but it was just an oak tree. And these two so loved the world that they brought forth a parade float, one they built in their garage behind the oak tree with their own bare hands. And the boy looked at this giant peppermint on the wheels and felt pride. Pride that it was produced in the Motor City, just like in the big factories, but it was just in their garage. He looked at the girl — his sister, he thought — and like the Little Rascals, they said, ‘Let’s put on a show.’ And they paraded this float through the Cass corridor, standing atop the peppermint pulled by white horses, or maybe it was a RedVanLines van. And many of the blocks they traveled were empty, but some had people. And some of those people cheered, and some laughed, and some even threw stones.\n\n\t“And with their bare hands,” White continued, “the two started to clap and sing and make up songs. And some people kept watching and swaying and moving. And then one person even smiled. And the boy and the girl looked at each other and they also smiled and they both felt the sin of pride, but they kept on smiling. Smiling from a new freedom, knowing that they had shared and made another person feel something. And they felt the person smiling at them was a stranger. So they didn’t even know. But it wasn’t just a stranger, it was God.”\n\n\tKeeping up the sibling theme to the end, he concluded: “My sister thanks you and I thank you.”\n\n\tIn his intro, fellow Detroit native Iggy Pop said, “The first time I saw them was in a photograph… grinning like they had some kind of fun secret, like they stole some cookies from a cookie jar. Basically I was looking at a 20th century Adam and Eve who had started a rock ‘n’ roll band… Cute ckids, they’ll probably go places,” he remembered thinking.\n\t\n\n\tPop saluted “Meg White, who is a timeless beauty. Meg White, who gave her name to the group, was a charismatic, naturally likable person. I met her once and she had the most genuine and charming smile. She  gave the drum kit a good whack like Fred Below did for Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. I think it was Meg’s support that helped launch the rocket of racket that was Jack White.\n\n\t“Jack could screech like an owl. He could twang like a hillbilly… I hear echoes of the Who, the Small faces, the Beatles, art-rock and country-blues in his playing. He could do it all. And the writing he is capable of was something that was not typical of the great Detroit bands of the ‘60s and ‘70s —  this was more melodic, more hooky. After all, it was a new century, and the White Stripes’ music was coming from a foundation of love instead of revolution.”\n\n\tIn the video tribute that the Rock Hall put together for the duo, Rodrigo offered a younger generation’s appreciation of the pair — and the highest possible veneration for “Seven Nation Army” in particular: “Do you hear those seven notes? There’s no question what it is. ‘Seven Nation Army’ is the most iconic song of all time — it’s just so ingrained into who we are as humans.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlthough it has been a few years since actor-comedian Pete Davidson was last seen on “Saturday Night Live,” he recently said that if series creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels asked him to come back, he would take the opportunity. “I owe that guy my life. He jump-started everything,” Davidson told People on Nov. 8. “I’d do anything for Lorne, and he knows that.”\n\n\tOne of the youngest cast members to be part of the “SNL” ensemble, Davidson joined the show during its 40th season when he was just 20 years old. He stands alongside Eddie Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Anthony Michael Hall as one of the few “SNL” stars who joined before their twenty-first birthdays.\n\t\n\n\tDavidson starred on the show for eight seasons between 2014 and 2022, and returned to host an episode in October of 2023. “I had a great time hosting last time, and anytime you get that call, it’s an honor and a privilege,” he said of the experience. \n\n\tDuring his tenure at SNL, Davidson co-wrote and starred in the Judd Apatow-directed dramedy, “The King of Staten Island,” and has since appeared in “Fast X,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” and “The Pick-Up” as well as the Peacock series “Bupkis.” He also starred in an ad campaign for Taco Bell and is currently partnering with Amazon for Alexa+.\n\n\tThe actor-comedian still holds his “SNL” origins in warm regards, though. “It’s always relevant,” he said of the show, “It’s a hot show. People look forward to it, and the cast is great.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNikki Glaser opened her “SNL” monologue with an ode to the Big Apple: “Here I am in New York City, Epstein’s original island!”\n\n\tShe returned to the topic of the infamous sex offender — and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell later in her monologue while talking about her Gen Z friends who “have a really big fear of being trafficked.” \n\n\t“In my 20s, I just feared good old-fashioned rape. I didn’t think it would be a career. We didn’t think it was anything more than a temp job at a frat house futon,” said Glaser, who is 41. “They’re like, ‘We’re safer when you’re with us because they think you’re our madam. You have resting Ghislaine face, so keep that up.'”\n\t\n\n\tGlaser didn’t shy away from taboo topics in her monologue, and later jokingly worried that she might be a pedophile while telling a story about her four-year-old nephew asking to take a shower with her.\n\n\n\t“My sister’s like, ‘He can take a shower with you. It’s fine. He does it with us,'” she said. “‘OK, that’s fine for you guys, but are you okay with an adult showering with your child? … What if I molest him?’ She was like, ‘Would you?’ I was like, ‘No! I would never! That’s disgusting! But that’s what I’d say if I was gonna.'”\n\n\t“Don’t trust anyone. I don’t even trust myself,” Glaser continued. “I don’t want to go in there. How do you become a pedophile? You don’t get to choose what you’re into, dude. What if it’s one of those things you don’t know you until you get in there, and you’re like, ‘Well, this is my thing,’ and it opens up a part of my brain? I know that sounds crazy, but there have been so many things in my life that I’ve been like, ‘I would never do that.’ And now I’m like, ‘Looks kind of fun, actually.”\n\t\n\n\tGlaser also made jokes about Donald Trump’s “orange” tan.\n\n\t“He picked an insane shade. He went pretty dark,” she said. “He didn’t go Kamala, but he picked a shade that half of America was like, ‘Okay, we can still tell he’s white.'”\n\n\t“It is kind of insane that white people can just paint their skin,” Glaser continued, making fun of her own spray tan this time. “I feel like that’s cultural appropriation. I don’t know. I mean, it’s not blackface, but it is Guatemalan leg. This is not my leg. I’m like, ‘Oh my god, me llamo is Nikki!’ Am I saying that right?”\n\n\tGlaser is a first-time “SNL” host. Next year, she will host the Golden Globes for the second consecutive year. Hulu will also debut a comedy special from Glaser that was taped in October. \n\n\tSombr was the musical guest during Glaser’s episode, also making his debut on the show.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tPete Davidson made a surprise return to “Saturday Night Live” for a sprawling Weekend Update segment that tackled Zohran Mamdani’s election victory in New York, Davidson’s controversial decision to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival and a few jokes about his old boss, Lorne Michaels.\n\n\t“If Lorne Michaels has taught us anything, it’s that you never, ever give up. Even if everyone says the time has come and Tina Fey is ready to take over,” Davidson said, drawing some scattered but passionate applause from the crowd and a somewhat squirmy off-screen laugh from Weekend Update co-anchor Michael Che.\n\t\n\n\tDavidson brought up such perseverance because he was introduced by Colin Jost to discuss a ferry that the pair had purchased together with plans to transform it into an upscale entertainment venue — and a recent New York Times article about it that deemed the vessel a “money-losing fiasco.” \n\n\n\t“In case you’re wondering why I had to do a show in Saudi Arabia, we’re losing millions on this ferry. I assume that’s what the article says. I can’t spend $5 on a paywall when I got a kid on the way,” Davidson said. “I’m just excited to be a dad and to give it all the energy and enthusiasm I never had for this show.”\n\n\tSpeaking about New York City mayor-elect Mamdani, Davidson poked fun at Staten Island, the only of the five boroughs to turn in a majority vote for Mamdani’s main opponent, Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\t“I have a message for everyone who did not vote for our new mayor. Hey, Staten islanders! Did you promise to move out of New York if Mamdani won but have too many warrants in New Jersey and not enough guns for Florida?” Davidson exclaimed, introducing a new photoshopped image of his ferry. “Welcome to New Staten Island! … We can’t call it the Titanic anymore, since the people on this ship will actually love running into ICE.”\n\t\n\n\tDavidson was an “SNL” cast member for eight seasons, running from 2014 to 2022.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf Tom Hanks is known as the “everyman” of movies — you know, the ordinary guys, so approachable and unpretentious that just about everybody can relate to him in one way or another — then Jim Gaffigan is the “everyman” of comedy. He focuses his humor on everyday observations about universal experiences. And although most outsiders see the divisive political climate at this time in history as putting humor on trial, Gaffigan looks at it differently.\n\t\n\n\t“I think this will go down in history — and it may be ending as we speak — but like, this is the best time that standup comedy has ever had,” he says. “When I started — versus even in the time of Lenny Bruce or George Carlin — comedy was a much more middle-class/lower middle-class occupation, meaning, there was not an expectation of an upper middle-class existence. Now, if you’re a functional comedian, you can make a great living. So, from a monetary standpoint, like having a kind of financial security, it would never exist. But it exists now.”\n\n\tThese days political humor gets comedians in hot water no matter which side of the issues they fall. But Gaffigan chooses to not go there, siting the pandemic as an example. “Take politics out of it,” he says. “There were expectations that you can address it. But, people, we’ve gone through the pandemic; we don’t want to hear too much about it. … There are comedians that will have very strong views, you know, and have a formula of bringing up this hot button issue. Their audience will stay with them. They’ll have some brilliant insights surrounding it. But I’m kind of of the opinion that, you know, people don’t wanna live in denial, but they also want a break from it.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Illinois native has accomplished a whole lot since moving to New York in 1990 to pursue a career in comedy. It all began when a friend in an acting class dared him to attend a stand-up seminar that required the students to do a live comedy set at the end of the course. He loved it, but it began a cycle of attempting to determine — and nailing down — his style. The guy now known as the “clean comic” with the laid-back delivery tried everything from impressions to “angry comedy.” Seven years later, he found his voice, and his comedy has been evolving ever since.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGaffigan performs onstage during the 2025 Night of Too Many Stars benefiting Next for Autism.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSome might call the quiet confidence he projects on stage courageous, but Gaffigan sees it differently. “I think it’s just mental illness, honestly,” he jokes. But on a more serious note, he compares the mental psyching up a comedian must do on stage to what parents face every day. “I see this as a parent, that we develop these kind of metaphorical calluses or scabs that make us much more resistant.”\n\n\tParenting five children, ages 13-21, has been the inspiration for much of his act and a catalyst for the evolution of his humor, because, as he says, if you have that many kids, you have to have a sense of humor. “I’ve said this for years — if your kids aren’t annoying you or you aren’t frustrated by the task of parenting, that means you’re not participating in the task of parenting,” he says. “I think the love I have for my children and the absolute fear that I’m failing colossally is shared by every parent. So the impact of parenting is so enormous on my stand-up.”\n\n\tParenting teenagers in this day and age of social media has not been easy, one that Gaffigan calls “a disaster” and “impossible” — but it certainly has resulted in both his personal growth and his growth as a comedian. “The fact that I have this approach of the ‘drowning continues’ is something that is a nice reprieve for parents. Do you know what I mean? Where they’re not alone. The struggles of being a parent and the struggles of your child are so understandably private. I have this joke right now where I talk about parents of teenagers always sound like they’re hiding something, and it really resonates.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s that experience of parenting that has evolved. So people that enjoy my standup, they might be at a different point in their parental journey, but they can identify with what I’m talking about.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGaffigan with his wife Jeannie, left, and their children attending a ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’ world premiere in 2016. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCaroline Hirsch, founder and former owner of the New York comedy club Carolines on Broadway, is known for an innate knack for identifying the next big thing in comedy… and Gaffigan was one of those comedians. “I first met Jim when he was performing and honing his craft very early in his career at my club [Carolines on Broadway] on Broadway,” she recalls. “Even then, he had such a distinct voice, literally and comedically. There was this sharp observational humor and a quiet confidence about him that stood out. He could make the everyday and the mundane feel hilarious and relatable without ever being mean-spirited.”\n\n\tHirsch also reflected on his professional evolution. “It’s been incredible to watch Jim’s growth over the years,” she adds. “His material has deepened. He’s still just as funny, but there’s a warmth and perspective that have come with his experiences as a father, husband and seasoned performer. Jim has managed to stay true to his comedic voice while continuing to evolve creatively, which is why he remains one of the most respected and beloved comedians in the industry today.”\n\n\tRespected, indeed. Gaffigan is a seven-time Grammy nominated comedian, actor, writer, producer, two-time New York Times best-selling author, three-time Emmy winning top touring performer, and multi-platinum-selling recording artist. Yet, he still has an air about him that is humble, sincere and, as Hirsch put it, warm.\n\n\t“I feel like if I’m humble and sincere, it’s out of necessity, you know what I mean?” he jokes, proving the point. “Like, I think, if something could go wrong or will get complicated, it will happen to me. It’s kind of an ongoing joke with my manager. But that being said, I’m also grateful and appreciative of the things I’ve gotten to do.”\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tPioneering female rap group Salt-N-Pepa, who are in the middle of a dispute over ownership of their masters, used their induction speeches at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony on Saturday to call out “the industry” for a situation that has seen their music removed from major streaming platforms.\n\t\n\n\tAs Cheryl “Salt” James, Sandra “Pepa” Denton and Deidra Roper (DJ Spinderella) accepted the Musical Influence award, James said, “As we celebrate this moment, fans can’t even stream our music. It’s been taken down from all streaming platforms because the industry still doesn’t want to play fair.\n\n\n\t“Salt-N-Pepa have never been afraid of a fight,” she continued. “This is the Influence Award. We have to keep using our influence until the industry honors creativity the way the audience does — with love, respect and fairness — and that includes streaming platforms too.”\n\n\n\tSalt-N-Pepa filed a federal lawsuit against Universal Music Group — which owns their masters — in May, accusing the label of violating the Copyright Act for not allowing them to reclaim control of their music, despite a law allowing some musicians to do so after 35 years.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the lawsuit, the pair filed notices of termination in 2022 to reclaim the rights to those songs, which were released by its subsidiaries Next Plateau London Records. However, UMG followed with a filing that claimed the group could not exercise those “termination rights” because they didn’t sign the contract themselves. A UMG spokesperson said that the company had made “repeated attempts” to “resolve this matter amicably,” adding “Clearly, the artists’ legal counsel thinks they can use the threat of negative media coverage from the lawsuit to achieve their unreasonable demands. Despite this, and consistent with our longstanding practice, we remain committed to working towards an amicable resolution.”\n\n\tHowever, the induction was mostly celebratory, reflecting on the group’s influences, influencees — including Miessy Elliott, who inducted the group and herself was the first female rapper to be inducted into the Hall of Fame two years ago — and families. “This is for every woman who picked up a mic when they told her she couldn’t,” James said. DJ Spinderella made note of the overdue nature of her induction, saying, “I’ve been DJ-ing for 40 years, and I’m the first female DJ in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”\n\n\tThe group also performed a medley of their hits, “My Mic Sounds Nice,” “Shoop” and “Let’s Talk About Sex,” before being joined by En Vogue for their 1993 hit together, “Whatta Man.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” got straight to President Trump in its cold open for this week’s episode, with James Austin Johnson’s commander-in-chief bragging from the Oval Office about the ongoing government shutdown, which has dragged on since Oct. 1. \n\n\t“The Supreme Court said we could stop feeding poor people. You can clap for that. SNAP!” Trump said. “For those of you who can afford food — no, you can’t. I promised grocery prices would plummet and they did. They plummeted straight up. People are saying, ‘But sir, how will I afford my Thanksgiving turkey for my family? Well, good news is your family’s not coming because all the planes are gone.'” \n\t\n\n\tThe cold open was referencing the Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday that allowed the Trump administration to continue paying reduced food stamp benefits.\n\n\n\t“Anyways, government is still shut down, all thanks to the Democrats and some Republicans and all Republicans and me,” Trump continued. “We’re going to keep the government shut down. We’re looking into perhaps stealing Christmas. We’ll be doing Grinch. I like the Grinch. He’s a great guy.”\n\n\tThe sketch also kicked off with a recreation of an incident from Thursday, in which an Oval Office guest collapsed during Trump’s announcement of a weight loss drug cost reduction program.\n\n\t“Didn’t see you there. Someone was dying in my office,” Trump began. “I think I’m playing this very normal. Just stand there and stare like a sociopath.”\n\n\tThe Nov. 8 episode of “Saturday Night Live” was hosted by Nikki Glaser, with musical guest Sombr. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” made fun of the viral “spirit tunnel” videos from “The Jennifer Hudson Show” in a sketch during Nikki Glaser‘s episode.\n\n\tThe sketch was styled like an advertisement for antidepressants, beginning with shots of Glaser sadly staring through a window at the rain outside. In voiceover, a woman said, “Are you anxious? Overwhelmed? Have you stopped feeling like yourself? Are you overcome with an intense feeling of foreboding and dread? If so, you may be one of the many celebrities who are scheduled to dance through the Jennifer Hudson spirit tunnel.” \n\t\n\n\tOn her phone, Glaser watched TikTok videos of stars like Kathryn Hahn and Simon Cowell dancing down a hallway as the staff of “The Jennifer Hudson Show” cheers them on.\n\n\n\tThen Glaser addressed the camera directly. “I love Jennifer Hudson, but as an uncoordinated white woman, I felt trapped. I tried practicing, but everything I came up with looked career-ending,” she said. “I even tried to put my ass into it, but I don’t have one.”\n\n\t“I just kept imagining myself in that tunnel,” Glaser said, looking distressed as the “Jennifer Hudson Show” staff sang the song “Hey Mickey” — but with “Nikki” replacing “Mickey.” “It felt like there was no way out.”\n\n\tThen her tone brightened. “That’s when my doctor told me about Hudsacillin,” Glaser said as the sketch cut to the pink and purple packaging of a pill. “Hudsacillin is the only medication proven to kill spirit tunnel-related symptoms. Hudsacillin works. Not by taking your anxiety away, but by making you so violently ill you have no choice but to cancel. It works fast — maybe too fast. Thirty seconds after my first dose, I was shaking on the bathroom floor, not knowing which end of me to aim at the toilet.”\n\t\n\n\t“That’s because Hudsacillin is made from a gentle blend of E. Coli, influenza, C. Diff. and rancid buttermilk. I finally have my life back, and now my spot in the tunnel can go to someone who really wants it,” Glaser said as “SNL” cast member Marcello Hernandez was shown in the tunnel.\n\n\tAs the sketch ended, a man in voiceover said, “Hudsacillin. ‘Cause what’s the alternative? Lightening up and being fun? Good luck.”\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for all eight episodes of “All Her Fault,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tIn the final moments of Peacock’s twisty limited series “All Her Fault,” Peter Irvine died as he lived: misguidedly believing he was still the hero of his family.\n\n\tAcross eight episodes — the series from creator Megan Gallagher, based on the 2021 novel by Andrea Mara — slowly but intentionally contradicted its own title by absolving the women at its center for the perceived failings of their families, which they often bear no matter who is actually at fault. Marissa (Sarah Snook) is accused of negligent parenting when her son Milo is kidnapped during a playdate she’d casually scheduled over text. Jenny (Dakota Fanning) is charged with letting her job cloud her judgment by failing to properly screen Carrie (Sophia Lillis), the nanny who used her family to get close to Milo. Carrie, meanwhile, is villainized for her admittedly deluded quest to reunite with her biological son in a world that has dismissed them. But in the end, their stories were deeper than the aspersions cast upon them. Instead, the blame for the botched kidnapping plot, the shocking revelation of a long-held family secret and a soapy baby swap all landed on the shoulders of Marissa’s husband Peter (Jake Lacy), who was the lynchpin in it all.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBy the season’s end, in fact, more than a few travesties are laid at Peter’s feet. First, it’s revealed that the whole kidnapping was rooted in a car crash five years earlier on the night he and Marissa brought their newborn son home. Peter was driving when their car collided with the one carrying Carrie and her own newborn. The Irvines’ son died in the crash, and Peter used the cover of the most inexplicably desolate street in Chicago to switch his body for Carrie’s healthy son while the two women lay unconscious. Years later, Carrie figured out what had happened and kidnapped Milo in the hopes that forcing Peter and Marissa to reveal the truth might get her son back. But through a series of (further) unfortunate events, Carrie’s plan unraveled thanks to her own unpredictable father, whom Peter killed during a failed ransom drop and then staged the miraculous return of Milo. This all happens while Peter has been at home playing the role of concerned but aloof husband. Further complicating matters are the tidal wave of family secrets exposed by the strain Milo’s disappearance put on Peter and his siblings, Brian (Daniel Monks) and Lia (Abby Elliott). Just as Peter is trying desperately to conceal his shared history with Carrie, Brian and Lia come to realize that the original sin of their family –– the time when Brian was injured and permanently disabled as a child –– was not actually Lia’s fault, as Peter had always led them believe. Rather, he was the one who accidentally hurt his brother, setting up a lifelong lie that led to Lia’s drug addiction, Brian’s struggle to live independently — and Peter’s demonstratively needy and controlling behavior, which has turned murderous.\n\t\n\n\tWhen the gunsmoke finally clears, Peter had killed Carrie in front of Marissa to silence her; their family friend Colin (Jay Ellis), who was secretly sleeping with Lia, has also been shot and killed (by Carrie) in the struggle; and Peter is left to continue (unsuccessfully) gaslighting his family into thinking he is the good guy for spilling blood in the name of protecting them. It is a massive amount of guilt to lay on one character, but Gallagher liked muddying up a man with needy emotional baggage for once.\n\n\t“I see it so often with scary or bad female characters that are scary or bad because they, as women, are obsessed with relationships or need love in some way,” Gallagher tells Variety. “We don’t see male characters, who are our bad guys, operating from a place of needing love. So I was enormously excited to develop a male character who is the root cause of our problems in this series, and all of his decisions and poor decisions at that come from needing to be loved and needing people to need him. He just can’t function without that.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor his part, Lacy found the fatty layers of lies that Peter has added over time to be a fascinating character study in not only narcissism, but also the struggle of a compulsive liar trying to keep the charade of his life going after one self-induced tragedy after another.\n\n\t“He fully believes in his own existential innocence in each of these situations, and that lack of willingness to accept responsibility or accountability is really the most damning thing in the end,” Lacy says. “He can’t see or hear another person’s perspective outside of his own. I think it is what drives Marissa to kill him. There is no path forward with this person in their lives, and his reality and her reality are getting further and further apart from one another.”\n\n\tMarissa does, in fact, kill her husband in the final episode, not because she is just as cruel as he is but because she has no other choice. She knows telling the truth about why Carrie kidnapped Milo might get him taken away. But by not turning Peter in, she also becomes somewhat complicit in his opportunistic murder of poor Carrie, which he can dangle over Marissa should she try to leave him. With no other options, Marissa uses Peter’s vulnerabilities against him as he did so many others, specifically his soy allergy. With just a touch of it on her lips from the hors d’oeuvres at Colin’s funeral, she induces an allergic reaction and, wouldn’t you know, she happens only to have an expired EpiPen. In Mara’s book, Peter’s death is revealed in a newspaper-clipping coda at the end of the story. But Gallagher couldn’t bear robbing the audience — and Marissa — of the satisfaction of his downfall.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s too big of a moment to be off screen,” she says. “Marissa is the heart and soul of the series, and it’s such a great way to end a book, with the newspaper clipping, which I absolutely love. But in a series, we want to see it, and we want to be with her during the decision making. We know what’s going to happen, really before it happens, we just don’t know how. That’s the fun of it. You love this character so much after eight episodes, and you know she’s not an irrational person, or an evil or bad person. But she’s still gonna do this thing, because her back is truly up against the wall. What is Option B? There isn’t one, really. So it’s about wanting to be with her, this relatable woman, doing this thing that feels bananas to us, but we think we might also do in her position. I couldn’t bear to have it off screen.”\n\n\tRight to the end, Peter fights not only the soy that is tightening his throat with each passing second, but also the loss of control that he so desperately clung to since he was a child cleaning up his horrible mistakes. Even up to the moment he has to untie his tie and face the reality of the situation, Lacy notes that Peter is still playing the diplomatic husband role, telling Marissa it’s OK she might have touched soy or forgotten his epipen. It’s only in her quiet, unspoken glare directed at him as he suffocates that he realizes the trap he’s fallen into.\n\n\t“Peter knows it’s the end of the road,” Lacy says. “I mean, obviously, he’s dying. But to the last breath, I think he is sure that he will find a way back. That the medics will show up and they’ll put the paddles on and then he’ll be back. I don’t think that ego, or that belief in his own infallibility, ceases in the end or that he succumbs to any of it. He fights right to the end, and there is a fury in him at the person, who he believes he’s done all of this for, who is now killing him.”\n\n\tThose who read Mara’s book prior to watching the series might feel like Lacy’s Peter is even more unforgivably cruel, in part because of the additions Gallagher and her writers made to the story. The biggest change is the deepening of the Irvine siblings’ story, specifically with the inclusion of Brian’s disability. From a character perspective, Brian’s need for support puts him in a place where he doesn’t feel like he can reject Peter’s constant, selfish supervision. Peter has trapped his sibling in a vicious cycle of need, one meant to foster some form of absolution for his secrets.\n\t\n\n\t“Peter’s goal is to keep Brian on his feet,” Lacy says. “Whether that’s an experimental surgery or pain meds or whatever it takes to keep him up and mobile, that’s Peter’s goal because that represents a kind of quote-unquote normalcy that somehow undoes the damage he’s done to his brother.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom a storytelling standpoint, Gallagher saw the necessary expansion of Mara’s book as a unique and personal opportunity to represent the spectrum of disabilities. In addition to Brian’s story, Michael Peña’s Detective Alcaras is working to place his son, who has severe learning disabilities, into a specialized school.\n\n\t“I had the space to develop the Irvine siblings a lot more, so putting that storyline there really tells us a lot about Peter and who he is and what he’s capable of,” Gallagher says. “But the deeper, emotional thing behind it all, especially when it comes to Michael Peña’s storyline, is that I have a disabled child. It just seemed like this was the kind of story that allowed me to put two different kinds of disability on the screen. One being cognitive, which his son is grappling with, and, as a parent, dealing with how to navigate work and how to protect a child that is going to have needs for the rest of his life. And there’s the disability of Brian, and just being to be really truthful about all of that in some meaningful way, and try to capture it correctly. In other words, it came from my heart.”\n\n\tBeyond representation, the deeply rendered stories of living with a disability provide just one more means of indicting Peter’s character in the end. It’s a different kind of villainy not only to blame his family for his actions, but then to use the prison of that guilt and shame to reap love from them at his discretion. It’s all Peter knows, and that’s why he’s so desperate to hold onto it when Carrie finally confronts the family in the house in Episode 8. For Lacy, Carrie’s death (which unfolds “off screen” in the book) is the moment that sealed Peter’s fate.\n\n\n\t“That scene — and maintaining the reality of the Peter that we’ve built to that point — hinges on grabbing this gun and saying, ‘Let go!, as though Carrie is holding this weapon,” Lacy says. “Even though she’s saying, ‘Take it, take it, take it!’ She is trying to get her hands free of it. But instead, we see him both overpowering her and then simultaneously building the narrative of self-defense as he moves in to kill her. It all hinges on that, because then you move right into some severe gaslighting, or an attempt at gaslighting, in which he’s telling Marissa that the thing you saw is not the thing you saw. \n\n\t“That’s not a sane person. There’s no living with that person.”\n\n",

In July, he did threaten to block the building of the new stadium if the Washington Commanders did not revert back to their old \"Redskins\" nickname.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to ESPN, the Washington Commanders alone cannot name their stadium ... the District of Columbia Council is leasing the stadium to the team and the National Park Service manages the land.\n      \n    \n          The new stadium will be built up on the ground where RFK Stadium -- named after Robert F. Kennedy, which might be where Trump got the idea -- still stands. The Commanders moved out of the stadium in 2019.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          And, we're sure the Commanders will want to sell the naming rights to a rich corporate sponsor which would pay millions for the chance to put their brand on the stadium.\n      \n    \n          Trump doesn't want to pay or have a rich sponsor pay on his behalf, according to ESPN ... he just wants the team to tribute him for free, the report states.\n      \n    \n          President Trump will attend the Commanders game Sunday ... and, he may just make his desires clear to owner Josh Harris when they meet face to face.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Robert F.

We recognize how difficult an allegation of this nature is for all involved. Out of respect for the legal process, we will not comment further on the case.”\n      \n    \n          Smith has played Bubbles -- one of the three main characters -- on 116 episodes of \"Trailer Park Boys,\" the mockumentary TV comedy which debuted in 2001 and ran consistently until 2007.\n      \n    \n          Netflix picked up the show in 2014, leading to the release of five more seasons as well as several made-for-TV movies. The show's 13th season was announced by Smith in January ... and it's scheduled to premiere in April 2026.\n      \n    \n          This isn't Smith's first run-in with the law ... we broke the story that he was arrested back in 2016 after he allegedly pinned a woman against a wall.

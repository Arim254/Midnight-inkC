    "body": "\n\tNew “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil experienced an on-air mishap during his official debut broadcast Monday, mixing up a segment transition and acknowledging the error live on camera.\n\n\tDuring the broadcast Monday night, Dokoupil fumbled a transition between segments, mixing up a story about Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\n\tThe on-air confusion was evident, with Dokoupil saying: “Other news, as you just heard from Jill… well as to other news now to Gov. Walz, no, we’re going to do Mark Kelly.” He then stated, “First day, big problems here,” before proceeding to the Kelly segment.\n\t\n\n\tThe Kelly story concerned the Arizona senator possibly being demoted from his retired Navy rank of captain. The segment reported that the Navy had issued what’s known as a letter of censure for the Democrat over his participation in a video that called on service members to defy illegal orders, without specifying which orders he had in mind. The report noted that the Navy called what the former combat pilot and astronaut did an act of sedition.\n\n\tDokoupil then transitioned to the Walz segment, saying: “Now we go to Minnesota, a surprise announcement from the Great Lake state there today, Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee.”\n\n\tOn Saturday, Dokoupil made an early debut covering the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, two days ahead of his scheduled Monday launch. He was named the new anchor of “CBS Evening News” after Bari Weiss’ takeover of CBS News spurred by new Paramount chief David Ellison.\n\n\tIn a video on New Year’s Day, Dokoupil outlined his mission as the show’s new anchor, vowing that the “average American” would come first.\n\t\n\n\t“On too many stories, the press has missed the story,” he said. “And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or, we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\n\tHe continued: “I report for you, which means I’ll tell you what I know, when I know it and how I know it. And when I get it wrong, I’ll tell you that too.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFabian Munsterhjelm’s Oscar-shortlisted live-action short film “Pantyhose” is to be released globally on Cyon Media’s new streaming service, the producer has revealed.\n\n\tIn addition, the director’s feature-length film, which is in development, is likely to utilize Cyon’s crowdfunding service as a financing tool.\n\n\t“Pantyhose” is being shown in select theaters in Finland ahead of feature-length film “Dead of Winter,” directed by Brian Kirk and starring Emma Thompson. It is being distributed by Cinemanse.\n\t\n\n\t“Pantyhose” will be available globally via Cyon Media’s Web3-powered player, which can be found across Cyon’s socials, including its Substack.\n\n\n\tProducer Jenni Ripatti at Wildhog Productions said, “Audiences can experience the film in cinemas in Finland but also from the home couch anywhere in the world. Currently we’re developing a feature with Fabian, and Cyon’s platform could be a key in bringing this story to life.”\n\n\tMunsterhjelm added, “Together with Jenni we’re developing a feature about a wrong guy being freed from jail, and the chase following this mishap is a hilarious, full-on action-comedy-chase that the whole family can enjoy together. I believe the times we live in require feel-good cinema and its power of bringing people together around a good old, entertaining story.”\n\n\tCyon Media is a Finland-based company founded by broadcast systems architect Tracie Mitchell and producer Lotta Stenroos.\n\n\tMitchell said, “We are delighted to be a part of this film’s journey toward global recognition.

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart went after Donald Trump for fixating on oil after launching airstrikes on the Venezuelan capital and capturing the nation’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n\t“Now look, generally, in American history, when we intervene in another country, whether true or not, we come up with a high-minded pretense,” Stewart said partway through Monday night’s broadcast. “Liberating a people, spreading democracy, introducing baseball to the Japanese. They complained at first, but totally worth it. On what moral foundation will this conflict be framed?”\n\t\n\n\tThe show then cut to footage of a press conference on the morning after the strikes, where Trump told reporters, “We’re going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil. We’re going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.”\n\n\n\t“Seems a little on the nose,” Stewart joked. “Oil, precious commodity, certainly. But not the reason a country formed 250 years ago on the ideas of liberty and self-determination would go into a country and snatch a man at night. There must be a slightly more noble pretense?”\n\n\tStewart then cut to Trump on Air Force One, where he told a gaggle of press, “We need total access. We need access to the oil.”\n\n\t“Sir, again, I see where we are going here,” added a frustrated Stewart. “Do you mind reframing that? I’m not quite clear on the high-minded principle behind this.”\n\n\tStewart then played another clip from the Saturday press conference, where Trump plainly stated, “In other words, we’ll be selling oil.”\n\t\n\n\tThe late-night pundit then exclaimed, “Is this your first war? What the fuck?”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMickey Rourke is denying any involvement in a GoFundMe page asking for donations so that the Oscar-nominated actor could avoid eviction. \n\n\tIn a video posted to his Instagram page on Monday night, Rourke said: “Somebody set up some kind of foundation or fund for me to donate money, like in a charity, and that’s not me, OK? If I needed money, I wouldn’t ask for no fucking charity. I’d rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger.”\n\t\n\n\tRourke, who was speaking while holding his dog Lucky and sporting a pink V-neck and his signature cowboy hat, said he was “frustrated and confused” by the situation.\n\n\n\t“Whoever did this, I don’t know why they did it, I don’t understand it. I wouldn’t know what a GoFund foundation is in a million years,” he continued. “You know, my life is very simple, I don’t go to outside sources like that. And yeah, it is embarrassing, but I’m sure I’ll get over it like anything else.”\n\n\tThe GoFundMe page, which says it was set up by Liya-Joelle Jones for Kimberly Hines, is almost at its goal of $100,000, having raised over $97,000 so far. The donation page description claims that after Rourke, once a “force of nature” in Hollywood, stepped away from acting to become a professional boxer, he was saddled with “lasting physical and emotional scars” and abandoned by “the industry that once celebrated him.”\n\n\t“Fame does not protect against hardship, and talent does not guarantee stability,” the description reads. “What remains is a person who deserves dignity, housing, and the chance to regain his footing.”\n\n\tIn his video message, Rourke encouraged his fans and those who had donated to not “give any money, and if you gave money, get it back.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m going to talk to my lawyer — I hate talking to him, but I’ve had him forever and I love him. But I’m going to talk to Bill and get to the bottom of this,” Rourke said. \n\n\tThe actor was served a notice in December to pay about $60,000 in owed back rent or face eviction from his Los Angeles Home (via People). Rourke opened up a bit about his financial state in the video, saying: “COVID and the writers’ strike killed my money, but I was in a really bad situation with the place I was renting. Everything was good for five or six years, and then two scumbags from New York bought the house and they wouldn’t fix anything … But I would never ask strangers or fans or anybody for a nickel. I mean, that’s not my style. You ask anybody that knows me, it’s humiliating and it’s really fucking embarrassing.”\n\n\tRourke added that he’s “very grateful for what I have” and assured fans that he has “a roof over my head” and “food to eat.”\n\n\t“Just get your money back, please,” Rourke concluded. “I don’t need anybody’s money and I wouldn’t do it this way. I got too much pride, man.”\n\n\tThe highest donation on the GoFundMe page was for $5,000 from an anonymous donor. The second highest was $2,500, followed by $1,500.\n\n\t“A small gesture to a film legend and modern icon, the strong & great Mickey Rourke,” wrote one donor.\n\n\tAnother donor penned, “For all the joy and inspiration you gave to mankind (and dogkind, I guess), you deserve to get supported during hard times. Hope you get back on your feet soon.”\n\n\tRourke broke into Hollywood starring alongside Matt Dillon, Diane Lane and Dennis Hopper in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1983 drama “Rumble Fish.” His other major works include “The Pop of Greenwich Village,” “9½ Weeks,” “Angel Heart” and “Barfly,” as well as more recent films like “Man on Fire,” “Sin City” and “The Wrestler.”\n\n\tWatch Rourke’s full message below.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tStreaming services, social video platforms and connected TV are poised to dominate Asia-Pacific screen revenue growth through the end of the decade,",
    "body": "\n\tStreaming services, social video platforms and connected TV are poised to dominate Asia-Pacific screen revenue growth through the end of the decade, even as traditional television continues its structural decline, according to Media Partners Asia‘s newly released Asia-Pacific Video & Broadband 2026 report.\n\n\tThe Singapore-based research firm projects total screen revenues across the region will reach $196 billion by 2030, growing at a 2.8% compound annual growth rate between 2025 and 2030. All net growth will come from online video, which is forecast to expand at 7% CAGR over the period.\n\t\n\n\tPremium video on demand – encompassing both subscription and advertising-supported models – will add approximately $12.5 billion in incremental revenue between 2025 and 2030, reaching $52 billion by decade’s end. Japan, China and India will lead that growth, followed by Australia, South Korea and Indonesia.\n\n\n\tIndia is set to overtake China as the largest market for SVOD subscriptions by 2030, reaching 358 million individual subscriptions. However, India’s premium VOD revenue – including both subscriptions and advertising – will remain 4.5 times smaller than China’s and 2.5 times smaller than Japan’s, reflecting lower average revenue per user (ARPU).\n\n\tUser-generated and social video revenues are projected to expand even more dramatically, adding $11.4 billion to reach $44.5 billion by 2030. That makes creator-led platforms the single largest growth engine across the Asia-Pacific screen economy, according to MPA’s annual industry assessment.\n\n\tTraditional television, meanwhile, faces an $8 billion cumulative revenue decline over the same period, driven by ongoing weakness in linear advertising and pay-TV subscriptions. China, Japan and India will account for nearly 70% of that contraction, while Australia and Korea will contribute more than 15% combined.\n\t\n\n\tConnected TV has emerged as a structural growth driver across the region. MPA estimates CTV households across Asia-Pacific excluding China now number close to 160 million and are expected to add nearly 100 million more by 2030. Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia have the largest installed bases. The shift to big-screen viewing is materially improving engagement, pricing power and advertising yields.\n\n\tMarket concentration is increasing among online video platforms, with the top 15 accounting for 58% of total online video revenues in 2025. YouTube, ByteDance’s Douyin and TikTok, and Netflix lead the field, alongside strong national champions including JioHotstar and U-Next.\n\n\tJapan and India emerge as the two largest contributors to incremental video and streaming revenue growth outside China, though through different dynamics. Japanese growth is driven by higher average revenue per user, supported by premium-priced tiers, local content and sports differentiation. India’s growth remains more volume-led but is increasingly supported by monetization upgrades, advertising-supported offerings, ARPU increases projected after 2026 and expanding CTV usage.\n\n\tPremium AVOD revenues are projected to grow from $8 billion in 2025 to over $12 billion by 2030, led by India, Japan and Australia, followed by South Korea and Indonesia. Platforms across the region are raising prices, introducing higher-tier products and bundling premium sports and local content.\n\n\tUser-generated and social video platforms remain the major beneficiaries of online video advertising growth. Outside China, YouTube, Meta and ByteDance’s TikTok account for the majority of incremental spend. In China, Douyin, Kuaishou and Tencent lead the market. Short-form platforms are also evolving toward episodic consumption, with micro-dramas emerging as a measurable revenue category in China and expected to gain relevance in India, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand.\n\n\tAI-enabled tools are being deployed across content development, localization, post-production and marketing, reducing unit costs and accelerating production timelines. MPA notes this dynamic will reinforce scale advantages and favor platforms with large libraries and diversified monetization strategies.\n\t\n\n\t“Value is shifting decisively toward streaming, social platforms and CTV-led monetisation,” said Vivek Couto, CEO and executive director of Media Partners Asia. “Markets with scale, pricing power and strong local content ecosystems will continue to outperform, while traditional television economics face long-term structural erosion. What differentiates winners in this cycle is not volume alone, but the ability to monetise premium experiences, anchored by sports, high-quality local programming, emerging formats such as micro-dramas, and increasingly by AI-enabled efficiency across the content value chain.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel returned to late-night on Monday after his winter break, and he used his first monologue of 2026 to tease Donald Trump about the low ratings from the Kennedy Center Honors broadcast.\n\n\t“You know he hosted an awards show over the break,” Kimmel said at the top of Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” broadcast. “After boasting about what a great host he is and how much better he is than I am and how huge his ratings would be, Trump hosted the lowest rated Kennedy Center Honors telecast of all time.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Kennedy Center Honors, held on Dec. 7 and hosted by Trump, averaged 3.01 million viewers, according to a report from Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data. That represents a 25% decline from 2024’s numbers, which set a record low with 4.1 million viewers.\n\n\n\t“Boy, I’d hate to be the White House intern who had to tear that headline out of all the papers and eat ’em,” Kimmel added. “You know, as I recall, he said he’d step down if this happened. He said, ‘If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel, then I don’t think I should be president.’ Hey, a deal is a deal. Back to Mar-a-Lago you go.”\n\n\tTrump was the first sitting president in history to host the Kennedy Center Honors, which celebrate “individuals whose unique contributions have shaped our world,” according to the organization’s website. The 2025 honorees were George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, KISS, Michael Crawford and Gloria Gaynor.\n\n\tThe president has developed a fixation on the Kennedy Center during his second term. In December, he renamed the historic forum “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” The name change was met with significant uproar, and several scheduled acts canceled their performances in the fallout.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe team behind Yash‘s “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has revealed Rukmini Vasanth as Mellisa, continuing the character-driven rollout that has positioned the production as one of 2026’s most anticipated releases.\n\n\tFollowing character unveilings for Kiara Advani as Nadia, Huma Qureshi as Elizabeth, Nayanthara as Ganga and Tara Sutaria as Rebecca, the poster introduces Vasanth’s character within a 1960s party atmosphere. The image captures Mellisa moving through festive surroundings with focused determination, presenting a figure who maintains sharp composure amid surrounding chaos.\n\t\n\n\tVasanth made her Kannada-language film debut with “Birbal Trilogy” in 2019. She earned the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress – Kannada for her performance in the two-part romantic drama “Sapta Saagaradaache Ello – Side A and Side B” in 2023. Her subsequent work includes “Baanadariyalli,” “Bagheera” and “Bhairathi Ranagal,” alongside her Telugu-language debut in “Appudo Ippudo Eppudo.” In 2025, she entered Tamil cinema with “Ace” and “Madharaasi,” and appeared in “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1,” one of the year’s highest-grossing Indian film. Vasanth trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.\n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\t\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\t“What I admire most about Rukmini is her intelligence as an actor. She doesn’t just perform, she processes. She asks questions, not out of doubt but out of curiosity. It pushes me to think deeper and sometimes even my own choices as a director,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “Watching her work reminds me that intelligence on screen often lies in what is left unsaid. Between shots, I often see her quietly writing in her journal, capturing thoughts, small anecdotes from the set. Those moments say a lot about her process. She is constantly building her own inner world. I find her approach incredibly thoughtful, and at times I honestly wish I could steal those pages and read through them, just to understand the mind behind such a layered performance.”\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tWritten by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic: A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has been shot simultaneously in Kannada and English, with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\tThe production features National Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer TP Abid. Action choreography comes from Hollywood’s JJ Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside National Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMiniStudio didn’t launch with a splashy marketing campaign or a traditional development slate. The Paris-based AI studio rolled out in 2024 with just one IP, “Fuzzlets” which has quietly become a breakout hit, generating 159 million monthly views across YouTube and amassing 3.1 million followers without a single dollar spent on advertising.\n\n\tPitched as the “first fully AI-native animation ecosystem for kids and families,” the Paris-based studio was founded by a bunch of millennials with impressive track records: Youmna Chamcham, who previously co-created, starred in and produced “Mini Studio,” one of the MENA region’s longest-running kids TV franchises and built LiveLove, a 17-million-strong digital community; alongside Marcella Ricca, an education and behavioral-science specialist; and Fabrice Nadjari, a former tech adviser to the French presidency and an Emmy-nominated storyteller who worked in Afghanistan.\n\t\n\n\tFrom left to right: Fabrice Nadjari, Marcella Ricca and Youmna Chamcham. (Courtesy of MiniStudio)\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMiniStudio, which is being currently courted by animation powerhouses, had anticipated the emerging collaborations between traditional and AI players, as seen recently with Disney making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI and licensing its intellectual property (including 200 characters) to Sora.Already backed by major tech and media players including PocketWatch’s Chris Williams, a16z Games, Xavier Niel and Mistral AI’s JC Samuelian, MiniStudio is now scaling up, opening its internal AI tools to creators, expanding personalization and developing its first animated feature film.\n\n\tChamcham says MiniStudio has opened its tools to creators to democratize animation production and unlock a new wave of original IP with fewer structural barriers.  The company also points out a six-person team can produce an episode in roughly three weeks – two weeks of storyboarding, one week of animation and post-production — at a cost of about $1,000 per minute, says MiniStudio, which cites “Bluey” as an example of premium preschool animation that typically requires teams of dozens, several months of production and post production, and budgets closer to $16,000 per minute. \n\t\n\n\tNadjari oversaw the development of the studio’s proprietary workflows, while Ricca, who has built education curricula and large-scale experiential projects, shaped the platform’s emotional and pedagogical framework. The idea behind MiniStudio is to deliver content that’s “emotionally intelligent” and helps children unwind and connect, rather than produce fast-paced, algorithm-driven kids content. Set in Joyville, “The Fuzzlets” is an animated series following soulful, mischievous characters as they lead children on journeys learning empathy, bravery and kindness. \n\n\t“When a child sees themselves inside a story, the psychology changes. It stops being entertainment and becomes recognition,” said Ricca. “They’re not just watching someone else, they’re experiencing what it feels like to be at the centre of the narrative, practicing courage, empathy and creativity. For us, personalization is the architecture of self‑worth,” she continued.\n\n\tMiniStudio is also launching tools that allow users to create their own cartoons using the same AI workflows that power Fuzzlets. These tools give full creative control over characters, stories and styles.Users can personalize Fuzzlets stories and songs, and create musical cards, holiday messages and short-form videos built around positive emotional cues. The company has already tested personalized cartoons and reported many reels becoming viral. On top of positioning itself as an animation banner, MiniStudio is also a technology platform that’s building new templates, new visual styles, expanded toolsets, and a community page where users can share and collaborate on cartoons. \n\n\t“We make stories with the heart of an animation studio and the flexibility of AI, creating worlds that respond to the child who enters them. We’re not just tech; we’re not just media; we’re something entirely new,” said Nadjari.\n\n\tMiniStudio is now expanding its Fuzzlets IP into long-form storytelling for its animated feature debut, “Sunhaven and the Sunkeepers.”Set in the twilight world of Sunhaven, the film will follow four children pulled from Earth into a realm where joy and color are draining away. Each child embodies an emotional trait – courage, creativity, empathy and wisdom — and must face a deeply personal trial to restore balance. Alongside them are Fuzzy and Purp, two Fuzzlet brothers searching for their lost family. The company is also extending its IP’s beyond screens with a merchandising line including soundbooks and plush toys.\n\n\tSpeaking of MiniStudio’s longterm vision, Chamcham said the company’s goal is “to build a world where every child can be part of the stories they love. Whether they’re alongside a Fuzzlet or future iconic IP partners, the message is always: you belong.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

But Eric tells us there’s no bad blood -- he actually feels bad about how things went down and wants to make things right this time around.\n      \n    \n          Eric admits Mickey deserves way more -- but says $1K is the best he can swing as a small indie filmmaker. He also tells TMZ he’s already winding down editing on the movie, which stars Michael Musto, Roberta Pacino, and late actor Ángel Salazar -- famously Al Pacino’s right-hand man \"Chi Chi\" in \"Scarface.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The plan is to drop the film around April… meaning if Mickey takes the offer, the cameo would be very last-minute.\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Mickey is allegedly $59,100 behind on rent and recently let a friend launch a GoFundMe in his name, aiming to raise $100K to help him dodge eviction.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Mickey Rourke\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

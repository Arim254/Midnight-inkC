    "body": "\n\tOscar, Golden Globe and Emmy-winning actor, director and producer Regina King will serve as the ambassador for the American Black Film Festival‘s landmark 30th anniversary edition.\n\n\tThis year’s ABFF, presented by Nice Crowd, will be held in Miami Beach from May 27–31 under the celebratory theme “The Homecoming.”\n\n\tAs ambassador, King will play a central role in the milestone event, welcoming attendees to the festival on opening night and headlining a featured “Creator Conversation,” where she’ll reflect on her remarkable career and ABFF’s cultural legacy of empowering emerging talent and showcasing film and TV content by and about people of African descent. King’s relationship with ABFF spans nearly three decades, back to the festival’s inception in 1997, when she participated in what was then known as the Acapulco Black Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\t“ABFF has championed countless artists and storytellers, growing into a powerful global platform,” said King in a statement announcing her role in the 2026 edition. “What Jeff and Nicole Friday have built over 30 years has made a lasting impact across our industry. Returning feels like a homecoming — a celebration of our creativity, resilience, and excellence. I’m truly honored to serve as ambassador for this milestone year.”\n\n\n\tPrevious ABFF ambassadors include Issa Rae, Lena Waithe, Halle Berry, Magic Johnson, Anthony Mackie, Common, Taye Diggs, Taraji P. Henson, Mary J. Blige, Tracee Ellis Ross, Lala, Regina Hall, Morris Chestnut, Omari Hardwick, Idris Elba, Jay Ellis and the late John Singleton. Last year’s ambassadors were “Love Jones” stars Nia Long and Larenz Tate. \n\t\n\n\t“Regina has been part of the ABFF family since the very beginning,” said Nice Crowd CEO and founder Jeff Friday and president Nicole Friday. “From those early years in Acapulco to everything she’s achieved since, we’ve watched her journey with so much pride — cheering her on from up close and from afar. She represents everything this festival was created to celebrate — artistry, integrity, and excellence. Having her serve as our festival ambassador for our 30th year is truly a full-circle moment and a reflection of the mutual respect and admiration we’ve shared over the years.”\n\n\tKing’s decades-spanning career began with her role as Brenda Jenkins in the sitcom “227” and her resume includes memorable roles in films such as “Boys N the Hood,” “Jerry Maguire” and “Ray.” She won an Oscar for her role in “If Beale Street Could Talk” and is a four-time Primetime Emmy winner for her work in the television series “American Crime,” “Seven Seconds” and “Watchmen.” Her other acting credits include “The Harder They Fall” and “Shirley,” where she portrayed America’s first Black congresswoman Shirley Chisholm.\n\n\tKing’s directing credits include episodes of “This is Us,” “Scandal,” “Insecure” and “A Man In Full” (for which she also served as executive producer). In 2020, she made history as the first Black woman to debut a film at the Venice International Film Festival with her feature “One Night in Miami”; she earned a best director nomination at the Golden Globes for the movie.\n\n\tMost recently, King directed and executive produced the adaptation of Judy Blume’s “Forever” for Netflix; the series, from showrunner Mara Brock Akil, has already been picked up for a second season. King can currently be seen starring opposite Austin Butler in Darren Aronofsky’s crime thriller “Caught Stealing” for Sony; next, she is part of the star-studded ensemble cast for Paramount’s film adaptation of “The Children of Blood and Bone,” directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\t2025 has seen a number of anime-inspired hits both in theaters and on streaming services, with “Demon Slayer” and “K-Pop Demon Hunters” among the titles breaking viewing records this year. Now, Toyota is entering the fray with the latest installment in its anime series, “GRIP, A Toyota Movie.”\n\n\tOriginally created by marketing agency Intertrend, alongside executive producer Frank Mele, the content series is dubbed as a “high-octane anime adventure that combines heart-pounding action and a battle between the human spirit and computer control” (yes, it also features some showstopping Toyota cars).\n\n\n\tEpisode four of the series premieres November 5 with a ten-minute short film written and directed by Yoriaki Mochizuki, who helmed 2023’s animated “Harley Quinn” series, and worked as a story artist on films like “Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse” and “The LEGO Batman Movie.”\n\n\tThe new episode of “GRIP” follows the protagonist Jae as he navigates a futuristic world dominated by self-driving cars while — literally — dodging a mysterious villain who is determined to harness the power of AI to take over the city. While the filmmakers insist the plot wasn’t inspired by any recent events (or any specific tech overlords in the news) the short film is nonetheless incredibly relevant, as self-driving cars and AI-dictated content become an ever present part of our daily lives.\n\n\tToyota has long been a leader in innovation when it comes to automotive technology — the Prius, for example, was the world’s first mass-produced electric hybrid when it was released in 1997 — and the automaker says the new short film isn’t an indictment on progress, but rather a reminder to keep a human element at the core of every project and design. “The goal was to tie in human connection and technology and how they can work together,” explains Sean Mahase, Toyota’s Multicultural and Brand Marketing Director, who adds that ‘GRIP’ is “an authentic, high-quality story that connects emotionally with audiences instead of focusing solely on brand promotion.”\n\n\n\t“This final chapter takes everything fans loved about ‘GRIP’ — the artistry, the energy, the emotion — and amplifies it into a cinematic statement about humanity and technology,” adds Matthew Choy, executive director of strategy/creative at Intertrend. “With ‘GRIP, A Toyota Movie,’ Toyota celebrates both the thrill of driving and the heart behind it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tToyota\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor filmmaker Mochizuki, the series finale of ‘GRIP’ was doubly personal. While the director and storyboard artist had a chance to watch earlier episodes of the animated series, he was given license to tell his own story for his episode, and he immediately knew he wanted to add an arc about the main character’s relationship with his father. \n\n\t“As co-writer and director, I was brought on by Intertrend to create an emotional story about the relationship between the protagonist Jae and his late father, and make the car action not only exciting and visually dynamic but personal,” he tells Variety. “One of my favorite memories with my father was driving from Los Angeles to the Grand Canyon with just the two of us. We didn’t talk much, like in a typical Japanese father and son manner, but we shared the fun of driving on empty desert roads. He’s passed away since, and I wish we talked much more back then, so I can empathize with Jae’s longing to show his father what he can do as a grownup.”\n\n\tWhile Mochizuki says he was inspired by his relationship with his late father, he also wanted the new episode of ‘GRIP’ to nod to his own fatherhood journey, raising two young girls in Los Angeles. “I have two young daughters now and I can also relate to Jae’s father, who wished to leave a legacy behind for his child,” Mochizuki says. “A scene of the father teaching young Jae how to drive is inspired by my personal wish that someday I can do the same for my daughters so we can share our love of driving like my father and I did.”\n\n\tAn Easter egg: “Making this movie offered us another fun memory as my 10-year old daughter voiced young Jae,” Mochizuki reveals. “Recording her in the cramped closet is one of my career highlights.”\n\n\tYou can watch a sneak peek of “GRIP, A Toyota Movie” below. The automaker says the anime-inspired film and campaign has generated more than 300 million impressions since the first episode debuted last year, driving double-digit lifts in brand perception among Gen Z and multicultural audiences.\n\n\n\tAs the short film description states, “Set in a near-future world dominated by AI-powered self-driving cars, ‘GRIP, A Toyota Movie’ follows a team of passionate drivers as they fight to preserve humanity’s love for driving against a villain determined to erase it forever. Amid the battle, a son seeks to reconnect with his father, a daughter rekindles a lost bond, and a forgotten moment is rediscovered—reminding viewers that it’s human connection, not technology, that truly drives us forward.”\n\n\n\n\n\tThe full film premieres globally November 5, 2025, at www.toyota.com/grip.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hotel del Coronado lives in Hollywood history as the key location of Billy Wilder’s classic comedy “Some Like It Hot.” But for 10 years, the hotel and the island of Coronado have played host to a small but mighty film festival where fans can take in top awards season fare, talk to movie creatives and engage in a wide array of cinematic activities.\n\n\t“I’m just excited about the lineup. It was such a strong year for independent film as well as studio feature films,” says Merridee Book, CEO and artistic director of the Coronado International Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tThe fest, which runs Nov. 5-9, opens with Gus Van Sant’s “Dead Man’s Wire” on Nov. 6.  The film’s screenwriter, Austin Kolodney, will receive the festival’s ScreenCraft Award and attend a Q&A following the film’s screening.\n\n\n\tThe fest closes with Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value.” Centerpiece films include “The Secret Agent,” “Jay Kelly,” “Arco,” “Blue Moon,” “The Choral,” “The Tale of Silyan” and “Train Dreams.” CIFF also screens a full range of shorts, and programs panels with showbiz insiders.\n\n\t“Just the fact that they can blow your mind in, like, two minutes or 15 minutes is just astounding to me,” enthuses Book\n\n\tCIFF also celebrates indie filmmakers and screenwriters with its Jury Awards presentation on Nov. 7, awarding $20,000 in cash prizes to winners in several disciplines. There are also audience awards and prizes for student filmmakers.\n\n\t“As a film festival, as a nonprofit in an organization that champions storytellers, we need to be investing in those storytellers as well as recognizing their work,” says Book, who notes that the prizes are selected by a panel who work in the entertainment industry. \n\t\n\n\tCoronado has set a lineup of honorees including Beau Bridges, who will receive the Legacy Award; Delroy Lindo will receive the Leonard Maltin Award in recognition of his performance in “Sinners”; stunt professional Heidi Moneymaker (“Thunderbolts”) will receive the Trailblazer Award; costume designer Deborah L. Scott will receive the Artistry in Film Award in recognition of her work on “Avatar: Fire and Ice”; and music editor Adam Smalley (“The Morning Show”) will receive the Transcendent Award.\n\n\t“We’ve always honored below the line at our tribute, not just the celebrity presence. We love our celebrities! They’re great. But the heart and soul of the collaborative process of filmmaking is the below-the-line talent,” says Book.\n\n\tShe also points out that the festival is “very big on female representation. That was something that was championed right out of the gate,” noting that the festival’s founder is a woman, Doug St. Denis. “We have our ‘Women on the Move’ panel that’s turned into an incredible sisterhood networking event, and a lot of relationships and connections have come out of that.”\n\n\tBeatles experts Tom Frangione, Chuck Gunderson and Bruce Spizer will lead a special program on the Fab Four and celebrate the 60th anniversary of the group’s 1965 concert in San Diego and their film “Help!” The documentary of Frangione’s 2022 SiriusXM interview with Paul McCartney “Tug of War,” will screen. \n\n\tThe festival also is hosting the world premiere of Aaron Davidman’s “American Solitaire,” a film about a veteran dealing with gun violence in his community. Book notes that the military is important to the festival — Coronado is home to the Navy SEAL team. She hopes the film’s nuanced storytelling will move the audience as much as it moved her. “There are a lot of unseen battles that our veterans go through, that for those of us that didn’t serve, we won’t ever understand, and it’s a really remarkably transparent and honest film.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tLast year, the Round Top Film Festival decided to do something unusual: honor a stunt person. You’d think this would be a common thing, given that they routinely risk their lives to create the big action set pieces that provide the “trailer moments” that draw audiences into theaters and give them some of their most enduring movie memories. But anonymity is part of the gig, necessary to preserve the illusion on screen and, in some cases, the egos of the stars they double in front of the camera. This could explain why it took more than three decades of lobbying by the stunt community, spearheaded by Jack Gill, before the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences finally announced last April that it would honor the craft with a stunt design award, debuting in 2028.\n\t\n\n\tBut Round Top chose to honor stunt people from the get-go of the fest, which was launched in November 2024 by the mother-daughter duo Shanna Schanen and Skylar Schanen in Round Top, Texas, a small town (population: 95) between Austin and Houston best known for its triannual antique shows that attract more than 100,000 visitors each year.\n\n\n\tIn 2024, Round Top’s inaugural Maverick Stunt Award went to R.J. Casey, who’s been on the stunt teams for tentpole features including Christopher Nolan’s “Inception” and “Dunkirk,” as well as Netflix’s “Extraction 2,” where he served as the rescue coordinator and participated in a daring 50 mph helicopter-to-moving-train jump executed without safety wires. \n\n\tFor the second edition of the fest, which runs Nov. 6-9, they decided to establisha tradition.\n\t\n\n\t“We said, ‘Wouldn’t it be fun if every year going forward the Maverick Stunt recipient chooses the new person?’” says Round Top artist director Blair Hunt.\n\n\tCasey’s choice is Chris O’Hara, a 25-year industry vet who earned a Taurus World Stunt Award for best second unit director/stunt coordinator for his work on 2024’s “The Fall Guy,” an action-comedy about a stunt man (Ryan Gosling) who goes in search of a missing movie star, directed by a former stunt man, David Leitch. O’Hara’s other credits include doubling Matt Damon in “The Bourne Supremacy” and Bradley Cooper in “The Hangover” franchise and such films as “Jurassic World,” “Venom,” “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,” “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” and “Fight Club.” He was also active in lobbying for the new stunt design Oscar.\n\n\t“The Fall Guy” is “a movie that is really important to the stunt community,” says Casey. “It’s a movie about stunts with an amazing script, good story and all these insane stunts. There hasn’t been a movie like that since [the 1978 Burt Reynolds starrer] ‘Hooper,’” which was also directed by a former stuntman, the late Hal Needham. \n\n\tO’Hara will receive the Maverick Stunt Award, presented by Variety, on Nov. 9. The program will also feature a pair of panel discussions, “From Combat to Camera,” moderated by Casey, and “From the Jump: Film and TV Stunt Designers in Conversation,” moderated by second unit director and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Dunkirk,” “Dune”). The latter panel will feature Vic Armstrong, who’ll also be receiving Round Top’s Lifetime Achievement Award in Stunts. \n\n\tArmstrong’s credits include doubling Christopher Reeve in “Superman” (1978) and Harrison Ford in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), along with second unit director gigs on a long list of films, including a trio of James Bond movies, “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997), “The World Is Not Enough” (1999) and “Die Another Day” (2002).\n\n\t“He was a very easy choice,” says Casey of Armstrong. He’s “in his 70s, still getting after it, assembling amazing stunt teams and visualizing amazing stunts that he knows his team can execute, while keeping everybody safe.”\n\t\n\n\tTipsheetWHAT Round Top Film FestivalWHEN Nov. 6-9WHERE Round Top, TexasWEB roundtopfilmfest.org\n",

    "body": "\n\tShailene Woodley (“Divergent,” “Big Little Lies,” “Three Women”) is donning her running shoes for the upcoming ultramarathon-set psychological thriller “Ultra.”\n\n\tThe film is being written and directed by Victoria Negri (“Gold Star,” “Personal Best”), with producers including Allison Rose Carter and Jon Read for Savage Rose Films (“Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “American Honey”) and Iris Torres (“In Dubious Battle”). Executive producers are Andrew Kortschak and Lisa Ciuffetti for End Cue (“The History Of Sound”), and Toby Halbrooks for Sailor Bear (“The Green Knight,” “A Ghost Story”).\n\t\n\n\tMister Smith Entertainment is onboard for international sales and will launch the film to buyers at the 2025 AFM. WME Independent will handle U.S. sales.\n\n\n\t“Ultra” sees Negri drew from her personal experience as a long-distance runner and as the director of ultramarathon documentary short “Personal Best.” The story follows Eve (Woodley) who, following the tragic death of her twin sister, enters into the most intense athletic endeavour on the planet: the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon, a 135-mile race through Death Valley, where temperatures reach 54°C. As she takes on the unforgiving elements and intense physical and psychological strain of the race, Eve finds herself pursued by an unknown runner in white, consistently closing the gap between them as they surge through the desert. Trying to outrun the ominous presence, she will face the darkest parts of herself and uncover what she is made of.\n\n\t“Tragic circumstances, for better or worse, are transformative, and ‘Ultra’ is a film born from that experience,” said Negri. “My father was a distance runner, left paralyzed by a stroke. Running, the thing that gave him life, was taken from him. He suffered, and finally succumbed. While finding my emotional footing, I grew to become an ultrarunner, since completing two 100-mile races, numerous 50 milers and many marathons. It’s through testing my limits in each of these epic races that I process loss — physical pain being the greatest metaphor for the emotional. Although my grief is always with me, I’ve learned I’m strong enough to handle it, to handle anything.”\n\t\n\n\tNegri said she wrote ‘Ultra from this “intense personal journey,” using running as the cinematic vehicle to depict the ways in which we process grief — whether we carry it with us by our side, or see it in the rearview mirror, we’re never able to outrun its lingering presence.”\n\n\t“Ultra” joins a growing slate of upcoming projects for Woodley. She is set to join the second season of Hulu’s political thriller “Paradise” in a recurring role, and was recently cast in Netflix thriller “Unabom,” about domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski, as well as in “Count My Lies” for Hulu alongside Lindsay Lohan, for which she will also serve as an executive producer. Woodley is also confirmed to produce and portray Janis Joplin in the upcoming Janis Joplin biopic. Most recently, she starred alongside Alan Ritchson in the action-thriller “Motor City” from director Potsy Ponciroli, which premiered at both the Venice International Film Festival as well as the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n\tNegri’s feature debut “Gold Star,” which she wrote, directed, produced and acted in, featured Robert Vaughn in his last on-screen performance. Her feature and shorts have premiered at Oscar qualifying film festivals including, Austin Film Festival, Cucalorus, Hollyshorts, Tallgrass and more. \n\n\tWoodley is represented by CAA, Range Media Partners and Shelter PR. Negri is represented by Entertainment 360.\n",

The Dutch director also helmed the Netflix horror series “Ares” and was named one of Variety’s 10 European Directors to Watch in 2013.\n\t\n\n\tWritten by Patrick Whistler (“In Cold Light”), “Any Other Night” follows two strangers in Berlin whose lives unexpectedly intertwine over the course of a single night. Maslany plays Maggie, freshly dumped and spiraling through emotional free fall, while Kenzari stars as Sam, a failed musician turned cab driver. What begins as a five-minute ride turns into a wild, chaotic odyssey through the city — and through the wreckage of their own bad decisions.\n\n\t“It’s been amazing shooting my first English-language film with talents like Tatiana and Marwan,” said ten Horn. “Being from the same generation, we instantly connected on what this film should be.”\n\n\tThe helmer said “‘Any Other Night’ explores what happens after you’ve chased your big dreams and realized this isn’t ‘it.’ Life isn’t a romcom — it’s far more complicated. Yet sometimes, one special encounter can shift your perspective.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film is a European co-production between Lithium Studios (“In Cold Light”), One Two Films (“Holy Spider” – Cannes 2022 Best Actress), Lemming Film (“The Secret Agent” – Cannes 2025 Best Director and Best Actor), and Film Forge (“Infinity Pool” – Sundance 2023). Elevation Pictures will release the film in Canada, Port au Prince in Germany and Austria, and The Searchers in Benelux.\n\n\tLucky Number describes the film as an “anti-romcom — a fresh take on romance that’s both clever and entertaining.” The company said “Any Other Night” portrays “wonderfully imperfect, three-dimensional characters that audiences can easily relate to, while taking us on a wild, emotionally charged ride through Berlin at night.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Fantomas,” a reboot of the iconic French crime franchise, has assembled a strong local cast, including Guillaume Canet (“La Belle Époque”), Romain Duris (“The Three Musketeers”), Lyna Khoudri (“The French Dispatch”) and Louis Peres (“Les Misérables”).\n\n\tSet to start shooting in January in Paris with filmmaker and co-writer Frédéric Tellier (“Through the Fire”), the action-packed thriller is slated for a 2027 French release. Previously announced by Variety, “Fantomas” will be pitched to buyers by SND, which handles financing, production, French distribution and international sales, at the American Film Market next week. \n\t\n\n\tSND is producing with Wassim Beji, the French producer of “Boite noire,” via his Paris-based company Wy Productions.\n\n\n\tCreated in 1911 by Marcel Allain and Pierre Souvestre, Fantomas is one of France’s most popular fictional characters, along with Arsene Lupin. Fantomas was first adapted for the big screen by into a silent crime film serial directed by Louis Feuillade for Gaumont in 1913. The property was later adapted into a crime comedy trilogy starring Jean Marais and Louis de Fines in 1964. Claude Chabrol and Juan Luis Buñuel also adapted the property into a limited TV series in 1980. A ruthless and multi-faceted thief and assassin, Fantomas has been a source of inspiration for some of the greatest artists of the 20th century, including the surrealist poet Guillaume Apollinaire.\n\n\tThe ambitious film will be set in Paris, in 1914, and will revolve around Fantomas, a master of deception and chaos, who is being chased by Lieutenant Juve as he investigates a series of violent crimes that have put the city on edge. “In an era of violence and political tensions, Lieutenant Juve finds himself hunting for a man with no motive, no agenda, no pattern or identity,” reads the synopsis. \n\t\n\n\tSpeaking of the cast, Tellier said “the chemistry between these actors will be electric, and I believe they will perfectly capture the essence of these iconic characters.”\n\n\t“Bringing together two pillars of French cinema, Romain Duris and Guillaume Canet, alongside international stars Lyna Khoudri and rising star Louis Peres, creates a dynamic will mirror the tension and evolution the story requires,” continued Tellier, who added that his film will “bring a fresh perspective to the iconic character while staying true to its timeless essence.”\n\n\tThe film’s key crew will include cinematographer Glynn Speeckaert (“In the Beginning”), producer designer by Florian Sanson (“Holy Motors”), costume designer Olivier Bériot (“Lupin”), and artistic director Frédéric Cambon (“Lupin,” “John Wick 4”). The original score is composed by GuillaumeRoussel, whose credits include “The Three Musketeers” and “Dog 51.” The special effects will be conducted at Atelier 69 (“Titane”). \n\n\t“With more than 30 novels, 13 films, theater plays, and series, the character has transcended time andborders,” said Ramy Nahas, SND’s head of international sales.\n\n\t“Much like ‘The Count of Monte Cristo,’ ‘Fantomas’ is an adaptation of timeless classic destinedto become the next global blockbuster,” Nahas continued. \n",

    "body": "\n\tCinematographer Robbie Ryan’s collaboration with Yorgos Lanthimos has always been defined by technical daring and dark humor, and “Bugonia” is no exception. In their latest project — a surreal sci-fi tale “about bees and a basement,” as Ryan recalls — the pair leaned into both analog imperfection and formal precision to create a visual world that feels unsettlingly alive.\n\n\tThat sense of unease extends to the story itself: “Bugonia” buzzes with eerie tension as Michelle (Emma Stone), a sharp-tongued pharma CEO, is kidnapped by Teddy (Jesse Plemons) and his cousin Don (Aidan Delbis), who demand she confess to being an alien. Held captive in a shadowy basement, Michelle’s ordeal blurs the line between paranoia and revelation on Teddy’s remote ranch, where his hive of bees becomes a haunting metaphor for control.\n\t\n\n\tFrom the start, Ryan and Lanthimos were determined to push the boundaries of large-format film. They chose to shoot “Bugonia” on VistaVision cameras — specifically the Wilcam W11 and the Beaucam — using prototype lenses developed by Dan Sasaki, nicknamed “GW lenses” after the late cinematographer, Gordon Willis. The combination produced extraordinary resolution and texture, but also a fair share of headaches. “The camera pushes the film horizontally through the gate instead of vertically,” Ryan explained, “so you get brand new problems that I didn’t know existed, which is camera jams. We ended up using it in the film. It’s interesting looking.”\n\n\tLanthimos’ signature low-angle framing returns here, grounding the film in a subtly distorted perspective that keeps viewers off balance. Speaking with Variety, for Inside the Frame, Ryan said, “If there’s ever a shot at normal height.” He added, “He’ll say, ‘What’s this all about? This is horrible.’” Movement, too, is meticulously choreographed: “Yorgos’ approach to filmmaking is if somebody’s moving, the camera should be moving; if they stop, you stop. The timing is very precise.”\n\t\n\n\tOne of the film’s standout moments — the early kidnapping sequence — captures that precision and playfulness. Shot over the first days of production, the scene was rigged with cameras on the bonnet of a G-Wagon, capturing chaos as Emma Stone’s character fights back against her would-be captors. Despite a few technical hiccups (“the speed bumps made [the camera] shake and jam”), the sequence embodies Lanthimos’ blend of absurdity and tension. Ryan describes it as “observational,” filmed mostly in wide shots that let the awkward clumsiness of the attack play out in real time.\n\n\tLighting, as usual for Lanthimos, leaned heavily toward the natural. “He tends not to want film lighting if he can get away with it,” Ryan said, admitting he snuck in a small light for one car shot out of fear that the reflections would obscure Stone’s face. “He probably would’ve given out to me for that,” he added with a grin.\n\n\tPerhaps the most striking shot in the kidnapping scene, filmed through the glass of Stone’s character’s modern home and across her indoor pool, was born from improvisation. A crane setup intended for a cut scene became a new vantage point. \n\n\t“Yorgos just said, ‘Why don’t we try the attack from inside over the pool?’” Ryan recalled. The result is a quietly surreal image that encapsulates the film’s tone: brutal yet darkly funny.\n\n\tIn “Bugonia,” the imperfections of vintage cameras, the precision of Lanthimos’ direction, and Ryan’s instinct for how the camera should move fuse into something wholly unique. “Anytime I work with Yorgos,” Ryan reflected, “I feel like an audience member. I never know what’s coming next.”\n\n\tWatch the video above.\n",

    "body": "\n\tObsidian, launching this week with Imagine Entertainment as a key partner, is an AI-powered studio start-up. But its founders say that’s not the full picture: Their venture, they say, is focused on using technology to empower creatives to make their entertainment and advertising productions more efficient — and ultimately pack an even bigger emotional punch.\n\n\tThe company was incorporated in January 2025 by Wes Walker, a commercial director who hails from Texas, and Louis Gheysens, a Belgian native who is CEO of global creative studio Gang Group. The two have been working together for almost two years to start up the company. “AI gives us a chance to imagine beyond the limits of production,” says Walker. “It’s a way to build new worlds and bring audiences closer to stories that feel vivid and human.”\n\t\n\n\tThe co-founders say Obsidian’s approach compresses production cycles from months to weeks while protecting human-led creativity. While both Walker and Gheysens come from the advertising world, they say Obsidian’s approach translates to long-form entertainment productions as well.\n\n\n\t“We always had high-end cinema in mind,” says Walker. The AI-enabled processes Obsidian is developing are well-suited for commercial campaigns, which typically have much shorter turnaround times, while they also apply to feature films, he says.\n\n\tObsidian has a creative partnership with Imagine, the film and TV production company co-founded by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. Together, the companies are exploring how Obsidian’s director-driven units of storyboard artists, CG generalists, editors and AI specialists can serve both Hollywood and global brands. Each unit begins with hand-drawn storyboards and “human-centric design,” before then moving through AI-enabled iteration and high-end VFX, according to Obsidian. \n\t\n\n\tThe Imagine partnership with Obsidian extends across development, previsualization, and post-production, including for upcoming feature film and documentary projects.\n\n\t“At Imagine, we are committed to emotionally resonant, human storytelling and we have already seen the ways AI can be a beneficial tool in that mission,” Justin Wilkes, president of Imagine Entertainment, said in a statement. “Obsidian’s artist-led approach is exactly the kind of collaboration we stand behind to amplify human creativity and we’re excited to be working with them.”\n\n\tTo train its AI workflows, Obsidian uses storyboards and custom datasets developed with veteran industry artists including Marc Vena (“Logan,” “Passengers,” “War for the Planet of the Apes”) and Tani Kunitake (“Black Panther,” “The Matrix,” “Fight Club,” “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”). The company’s patent-pending technologies include DigitalForge, a live team-based production system that can bring AI and CGI directly on set to let artists collaborate with directors and brand partners in real time.\n\n\t“The artist sits at the center of everything we do,” says Walker. “Technology alone doesn’t move people — emotion does. It’s the artist using the tools, not the tools themselves, that makes the image feel real, the spirit tangible, and the connection with the audience unmistakable.” While Obsidian develops its own AI models, Walker says the company is able to work with all commercially released AI tools and VFX platforms, \n\n\tGheysens says Hollywood filmmakers and global brands both face the same challenge: to produce more stories on tighter budgets. Obisidian’s DigitalForge model “was designed for exactly that, scaling production efficiently while keeping creative integrity intact,” he says.\n\n\tIn addition to Imagine, Obsidian has worked with Disney’s ESPN to create previsualizations for ad campaigns, which has let the sports programmer conduct A/B testing on creative that’s more than just a script, according to Walker. Obsidian also has collaborated with brands including Louis Vuitton, Longchamp, Crayola, Aramco, Amazon and the NBA on films and marketing campaigns.\n\n\tObsidian (obsidian.studio) is owned by Walker and Gang Group, which is co-founded by Gheysens, with no outside investors. The company has 27 employees and brings on freelancers as needed on a per-project basis. Its team operates worldwide, including in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Riyadh and Dubai.\n\t\n\n\tPictured above: Obsidian co-founders Louis Gheysens (left) and Wes Walker\n",

    "body": "\n\tActor, comedian and U.S. Marine Corps veteran Rob Riggle is back to host this year’s edition of the Veterans Day special “American Valor: A Salute to Our Heroes,” marking his sixth time as emcee of the annual TV event. \n\n\tThis year’s special, which will be syndicated to TV stations across the country throughout the weekend of Saturday, Nov. 15, will feature narration from stars including Kristen Bell, Joe Buck, Candace Cameron Bure, Chris Evans, Michael Keaton, Chris Pine and Chris Pratt.  Special presentations will also come from Shawn Johnson East and Sawyer Spielberg, as well as “Band of Brothers” stars Wilmer Valderrama, Charlie Weber and James Madio.\n\t\n\n\tPer the logline, Riggle will “guide viewers through a moving lineup of true stories honoring the courage, sacrifice and legacy of America’s service members.”\n\n\n\tVeterans featured in the special include some of the last living soldiers from World War II, as well as those who’ve served in the Korea, Vietnam and modern wars, spanning eight decades of service. \n\n\t“As a Marine, it’s the greatest honor to stand alongside those who’ve served and to help tell the stories of the true heroes who’ve shaped our country,” Riggle said in a statement. “Their courage, their sacrifice, and their legacy deserve to be celebrated and remembered, not just on Veterans Day, but every day.” \n\n\tThe American Veterans Center is behind “American Valor,” which this year will include musical performances by the United States Naval Academy Glee Club and the United States Air Force Band’s “Airmen of Note.”\n\t\n\n\tBesides being syndicated to ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and The CW affiliates around the country, “American Valor” will also be seen by active duty military members and their families on the American Forces Network around the globe.\n\n\t“’American Valor’ is about remembering who we are as a nation, and who we owe,” said American Veterans Center president Tim Holbert, who is also exec producer of the special. “This year’s program brings together voices from across generations to honor the legacy of our heroes and ensure their stories are never forgotten.”\n\n\tHere are the segments set for this year:\n\n\t“The Heroes of World War II”: “A final salute to the last surviving veterans of World War II, whose average age now exceeds 100. These men helped secure victory in battles from Normandy to the Pacific and include soldiers who liberated Nazi concentration camps. Their stories are a living connection to history. With upwards of 50 surviving WWII heroes brought together with the support of Gary Sinise Foundation, ‘American Valor’ honors them all on stage, one last time. Story narrated by Chris Pine.”\n\n\t“The Rosie the Riveters”: “Millions of American women stepped into critical roles during World War II, building the planes, ships, and tanks that made victory possible. Known as Rosie the Riveters, they paved the way for generations of women to come. This segment honors the few surviving Rosies who are still with us today. Narrated by Kristen Bell.”\n\n\t“The Miracle of Christmas”: “In December 1950, U.S. forces carried out a massive evacuation of over 100,000 North Korean refugees from Hungnam during the Korean War. One ship, the SS Meredith Victory, rescued 14,000 people despite being built for only 60. Among those saved were two Korean babies born on board, and the last surviving American crewman, all set to join this year’s event. The mission became known as the ‘Miracle of Christmas.’ Narrated by Michael Keaton.”\n\n\t“Captain Melvin Pender, Jr.”: “A Vietnam War combat veteran and member of the 82nd Airborne Division, Mel Pender was also a world-class sprinter. After recovering from injury and returning from combat, he went on to win Olympic gold in the 4×100-meter relay in 1968. He later set multiple world records well into his senior years. His story is one of unmatched perseverance and patriotism. Narrated by Joe Buck.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Last Flight Out”: As Saigon fell in April 1975, five Pan Am stewardesses volunteered for a dangerous, last-minute mission. With the airport shut down and chaos on the ground, they flew an empty 747 into the city and evacuated 463 Vietnamese civilians—over 100 more than the plane could safely hold. Their courage saved hundreds of lives. This is their incredible true story. Narrated by Savannah Guthrie.”\n\n\t“The Horse Soldiers”: In the weeks following 9/11, twelve U.S. Army Green Berets from Operational Detachment Alpha 595 entered Afghanistan on horseback to lead the charge against the Taliban. Partnering with the Northern Alliance, they helped topple the regime and launch the manhunt for Osama bin Laden. They were America’s first boots on the ground in the War on Terror. This year’s broadcast reunites nearly the entire surviving team. Narrated by Chris Pratt.”\n\n\t“A Final Closing Toast”: “Narrated by Chris Evans, this segment honors the World War II generation while passing the baton to a new generation of service members. It is a moment of remembrance, gratitude, and continuity. A toast to heroes, past and future.”\n",

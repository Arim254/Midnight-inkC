    "body": "\n\tWhile AI has been dividing Hollywood, Michael Mann is agnostic when it comes to it. In fact, he will likely be experimenting with it in “Heat 2.”\n\n\t“I don’t I experiment with technology gratuitously,” Mann said. “When I have a dramatic need or esthetic need for it, then I go deep into what I need.”\n\n\tHe added, “Aging and de-aging may be very important in the next film,” Mann said, referring to the long-anticipated sequel to “Heat” which he said on Friday during a wide-ranging masterclass that will hopefully start filming next summer. \n\t\n\n\tMann, who received the Lumiere Award from the hands of Isabelle Huppert last night, also addressed the fact that “Heat 2” has moved from Warner Bros. to Amazon MGM-owned United Artists and producer Scott Stuber. \n\n\n\t“Heat 2” is an “expensive movie to make, but I believe it should be made at the proper size and scale,” Mann said. “It’s going to shoot in Chicago, Los Angeles, Angeles, Paraguay, and possibly some parts in Singapore.”\n\n\t“People make dramas at a certain budget level, because of the costs, not because of anybody being greedy. If it was at a lower price, I could have made it anywhere. But it’s complex. I can’t get into all the politics of it. But we moved from Warner Brothers to Amazon and United Artists, but it will be absolutely released theatrically, in the United States, probably in about 4,000 cinemas and for at least 45 days. \n\n\tRegarding the plot of “Heat 2,” Mann said it would move back and forth in time, before and after the events of the original film. The story will pick up one day after the movie ends, “only Val Kilmer’s alive, and he has to flee the United States.”\n\t\n\n\t“The characters of “Heat” are so alive to me. Then, an idea occurred to me, based on the rapport between two lethal adversaries, Pacino’s Hannah and De Niro’s McCauley, about how to do both before the events of “Heat” and after.” He pointed out that Hannah and McCauley were changed by events that occurred in 1988, when Hannah was a cop in Chicago and McCauley had “a wife, he has a stepdaughter, he has a nuclear family that he’s very attached to.”\n\n\tMann also gave an update on his following project set against the backdrop of the 1968 Battle of Hué, during the Vietnam War, which he’ll do after “Heat 2.” \n\n\tThe film will be based on a book by Mark Bowden, the helmer of “Black Hawk Down.” “It’s a very human, a very powerful piece, and I spent a lot of time and talked with a lot of survivors of that battle,” Mann said, adding that the book had also inspired Al Pacino’s character from “Heat” — “Al Pacino’s history, that he was a Marine who was in the Battle of Hue in 1968 and that in 1988 he’s still suffering from PTSD.” \n\n\tThat movie will be “like “Rashōmon” with several perspectives, several points of both the American side and on the Vietnamese side,” Mann teased. \n\n\tMann also said during yesterday’s masterclass that he’ll produce a Western titled “Comanche” which will be directed by Scott Cooper, whose latest film “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” played this week at Lumiere Festival\n",

    "body": "\n\tA jury on Friday rejected “9-1-1” actor Rockmond Dunbar‘s claim that he was fired from the show due to his religious conviction against getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\tThe eight-member federal jury found unanimously in favor of Disney-owned 20th Television. When the verdict was read, Dunbar put his head in his hands.\n\n\t“Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!” he shouted, and then turned to his wife and children, who were sitting in the gallery. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. We’ll be okay.”\n\t\n\n\tDunbar sued the company in 2022, alleging that the production failed to accommodate his belief in the tenets of the Congregation of Universal Wisdom, which disapproves of vaccines and other medical interventions.\n\n\n\tDunbar’s character, Michael Grant, was written out of the show in 2021, once the company imposed a vaccine mandate on actors and crew members on set. During a four-day trial in Los Angeles, Dunbar testified about his belief that the COVID vaccine is harmful and against God’s teachings.\n\n\t“Man created the COVID-19 vaccine to separate you from God,” he said. “This is a spiritual war. This is a war of evil against good. I stood on the side of good. I stood on the side of God. I stood on the shoulders of God.”\n\n\tDisney’s lawyers, led by Maria Rodriguez of McDermott Will & Schulte, argued that Dunbar lacked credibility. She noted that Dunbar routinely takes synthetic testosterone and anastrozole, which the leader of the Congregation of Universal Wisdom called “sacrilegious.”\n\n\tDunbar acknowledged on the witness stand that he is not “perfect.” In her closing argument, Rodriguez scrolled through a list of 37 medications Dunbar has taken.\n\t\n\n\t“This is way far from perfect,” she said. “This isn’t even close.”\n\n\tDunbar testified that he was making $100,000 an episode, and was paid even for episodes in which his character did not appear.\n\n\t“It was a dream job,” he said. “It was like winning the lottery.”\n\n\tDunbar testified that since his firing, he has struggled to find work.\n\n\t“I’m underwater. I’ve spent my entire retirement,” he said. “This has taken my life into a hole financially that I will never be able to get out of.”\n\n\tBut he said he had acted on instruction from God not to take the vaccine, and stands by that.\n\n\t“Take my cars, my money — I don’t care. You have to leave here with your soul intact,” he said. “This is my spiritual test and I passed.”\n\n\tDunbar said he is “not an anti-vaxxer,” but testified that his children have not received any vaccines. \n\n\tHe also told the jury that he believes the vaccine has killed more people than COVID-19, and that the vaccine was made with aborted fetal cells and contains “disease.” He also testified that six foreign objects have been found in the Pfizer vaccine that cannot be identified under a microscope.\n\n\tDisney’s lawyers called Dr. Glenn Braunstein, who had consulted for the company during the pandemic, and who testified that there is no live disease or fetal cells in any of the vaccines. He was also asked about the claim the foreign objects seen under the microscope.\n\n\t“Hogwash,” he said. “It’s a ridiculous concept.”\n\n\tScott Street, Dunbar’s attorney, argued that his willingness to sacrifice his job underscores the sincerity of his religious views, which he said are no less real for being outside the mainstream.\n\n\t“What matters is whether he is true to himself and true to his belief,” Street said. “It doesn’t have to be right. There are plenty of beliefs that are right, wrong, kooky — who cares? What matters is whether you believe them. It’s not up to your employer to question your belief.”\n\n\tIn her closing argument, Rodriguez stated that the company was not there to “judge religion.” But she questioned whether Dunbar was seeking to pass off his sincere, but non-religious, opposition to the vaccine as a religious belief.\n\n\tShe also argued that Dunbar failed to engage in an interactive process with his employer to accommodate the issue, suggesting that the situation could have been resolved more favorably if Dunbar had communicated better.\n\t\n\n\tIn a statement, 20th Television said, “We are pleased with today’s verdict, which affirms that 20th Television acted fairly and lawfully toward Mr. Dunbar.”\n\n\tAsked for comment outside court, Dunbar said, “God still won today.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 2025 Lumière Film Festival reached its climax Friday night with the presentation of its top honor, the Lumière Award, to Michael Mann, celebrating the filmmaker of “Ali,” “Heat” and “The Insider.”\n\n\tThe ceremony kicked off with a surprise message from Quentin Tarantino, projected on the Amphithéâtre’s giant screen. “It seems we have a message from someone,” said Lumière festival director and Cannes chief Thierry Frémaux, introducing an email from Tarantino – one of the first Lumière Award laureates, honored back in 2013 – welcoming Mann “into the club.”\n\t\n\n\tAs he took to the stage to receive his award from the hands of 2024 laureate Isabelle Huppert, Mann was visibly moved. “Now I know why so many directors like Clint Eastwood and Tim Burton are speechless when they come up here. This is fantastic. Thank you so much.”\n\n\n\tHe went on to recall the moment he decided to become a filmmaker: “The idea to make films entered my life when I was 19 or 20, on a cold and brilliantly clear winter night in Wisconsin after screening a silent film. I was walking downhill from the campus buildings and it was as if the skies parted, then a giant hand came down and said, you should direct films.”\n\n\tHe said it was “one of those rare moments in all of our lives when profound truth takes you over and there’s no negotiation, no second thinking, this is what you’ve got to do. And I’m profoundly fortunate to have found artistic work I feel so impelled to do throughout my lifetime.”\n\n\tMann closed his speech with gratitude: “I receive this wonderful honor with gratitude on behalf of the spirit we all share to make dramatic cinema – and also on behalf of that same imaginative spirit residing within every person here, to be impacted upon, transported by, and aroused by all that cinema does. Tonight will be an enduring memory for me. I am totally, profoundly grateful for this honor. Thank you very much.”\n\t\n\n\tBefore handing over the award to Mann, Isabelle Huppert, last year’s laureate, paid homage to Mann, calling him “a filmmaker who listens to his actors, looks at them with curiosity, and offers them roles that both challenge and reveal them.”\n\n\t“To receive the Prix Lumière here in Lyon is not only a reward, it’s a return to the source — to that original light of which you have become one of the great heirs,” she said. “Thank you, Michael Mann, for continuing to surprise us, to unsettle us, to share our obsessions, and for making cinema a place of tireless exploration, always renewed. Thank you for your demanding, lyrical, and sensual body of work, and for your fidelity to the light itself. May that light continue to be with you. And long live cinema.”\n\n\tThe celebration also showcased a richly layered montage of clips from Mann’s movies, a short film delving into the making of “Heat,” as well as a clip retrospective of cult classics and contemporary films that have marked cinema history. Robert Redford and Diane Keaton, who passed away this year, were also remembered during the ceremony.  A festival regular, French singer Camelia Jordana performed “We Shall Overcome” a capella and a song from Charles Aznavour. \n\n\tMann is the latest in a long list of American filmmakers honored at the Lumiere Festival, alongside Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton and Clint Eastwood. Introducing him on stage earlier today, Fremaux said Mann may not have won an Oscar, but “he’s here. He is in our lives. His films are here and we’ve been living with them for a number of years now. He’s one of those completely unpredictable filmmakers whose work is a series of bravura pieces.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBased on a true story of German resistance to the Third Reich during World War 2, “Truth and Treason” plays it conventionally straight. The familiar elements of a historic film telling an epic story are all there: the righteous hero, the conflicted villain, the systemic violence. There are fiery speeches, chase scenes and tense moments. But Matthew Whitaker’s film never surprises at any point during its running time, failing to add any singular artistic flair. While telling a compelling story, it plays like so many other films about that dark time in not-so-distant European history. \n\t\n\n\tHelmuth Hübener (Ewan Horrocks) is a religious 17-year-old living an ordinary life with his family in Hamburg — as ordinary as can be during the troubled time the film takes place. He goes to school, plays with his friends and even gets a job at a local government office. Then he starts questioning what was happening around him. The bishop in his church begins to pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler before his sermons. His inclusive Mormon church bans Jews from entering its premises. One day, he discovers that one of closest friends, Solomon Schwarz (Nye Occomore), has been abducted by the state for being Jewish. When his older brother brings home a radio that plays stations from outside Germany, especially the BBC, he starts to realize that what he’s being told is all lies and propaganda. \n\n\n\tAs a studious and smart young man, Hübener has a knack for oratory and writing influenced by his love of reading. He uses those skills and what he learns listening to the news on the radio to write pamphlets about the truth of the war. He enlists two of his friends, Karl-Heinz Schnibbe (Ferdinand McKay) and Rudi Wobbe (Daf Thomas) to distribute them all over Hamburg. There’s a propulsive energy to those early scenes. Whitaker, working from a screenplay he wrote with Ethan Vincent, manages to create some tension-filled moments. What happens to Schwaz is not overtly shown. The audience is only privy to his fear in the moments leading up to his abduction — and to Hübener’s devastating discovery in the aftermath — although there’s plenty of violence, with many fist fights and beatings resulting in blood-soaked faces as Hübener deals with the wrath of Nazi sympathizers in his community, including his own stepfather (Sean Mahon). \n\t\n\n\tTrue to the facts, the courageous teenager is eventually caught by the Gestapo. The second half of the film dissolves in a dreary interrogation and torture narrative. As the investigator, Rupert Evans takes a larger role in the narrative. At first, he can’t fathom that this teenager is working alone, yet as he gets to know him, a sense of admiration creeps in. This part of the film is much more obvious and less energetic than what precedes it. Still, Horrocks and Evans match each other well as the relationship between captive and jailer is explored. \n\n\tDespite these mostly persuasive elements, “Truth and Treason” is ultimately an old-fashioned period piece with epic aspirations. The characters and narrative are accompanied by sweeping, intrusive music that tries hard to dictate to the audience exactly how to feel at every beat of the story. The actors speak in clipped English accents that seem jarring to the German story. The script does not allow for shading to the characters, with the exception of Evans’: They are presented either as good-hearted and supportive of Hübener or outright odious fascists out to get him. \n\n\t“Truth and Treason” is a well-intentioned, competently made film that never transcends the safety of its own conventions. Whitaker makes a sincere film full of admiration for Hübener’s courage and idealism. However, sincerity cannot make up for stereotypical storytelling. This is a dutiful attempt at re-creating the life of a noble man that nonetheless does not offer its audience much in the way of art or entertainment. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDick Van Dyke‘s record as oldest performer to win a Daytime Emmy didn’t last long. At this year’s ceremony, legendary British broadcaster, writer and naturalist Sir David Attenborough has made history, winning the 2024 Daytime Emmy award for outstanding daytime personality – Non-Daily — for Netflix’s “Secret Lives of Orangutans” at the age of 99. (He turns 100 next May.)\n\n\tThat makes him a hair older than Van Dyke, who previously set the record last year at 98 when won the guest performer in a daytime drama series Daytime Emmy last year via his spot on Peacock’s “Days of Our Lives.” \n\t\n\n\tAttenborough’s win was one of three for Netflix’s “Secret Lives of Orangutans,” which also won directing team for a single camera daytime non-fiction program.\n\n\n\tAttenborough won over Brad Bestelink, “Living with Leopards” (Netflix); Andi Sweeney Blanco, Courtney Dober, Rob North & Kirin Stone, “The Fixers” (BYUtv); Anthony Mackie, “Shark Beach with Anthony Mackie: Gulf Coast” (National Geographic); and Martha Stewart, “Martha Gardens” (Roku).\n\n\tAttenborough is known as one of the world’s most famous natural sciences broadcasters, starting with 1954’s “Zoo Quest.” As a narrator, his more recent successes include include “Planet Earth” and its sequels, “Blue Planet” and its sequels, “The Green Planet,” “Wild Isles,” “Dinosaurs: The Final Day With David Attenborough,” “Life In Colour,” “Frozen Planet” and more. \n\n\tHere’s the logline for “Secret Lives of Orangtutans”: “Orangutans are not just one of our closest relatives, they’re perhaps more relatable to us than any other great ape. Narrated by David Attenborough, this film follows a remarkable group of orangutans in the pristine jungles of Sumatra. At the centre of this story is 8 year old Eden, who’s about to embark on the most challenging moment of her life.”\n\t\n\n\tThe 52nt annual Daytime Emmy Awards took place on Friday, Oct. 17, at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains very light spoilers about “Black Phone 2,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tThe minute Joe Hill saw The Grabber’s mask, he knew “The Black Phone” could become a franchise.\n\n\t“The mask was crafted by Tom Savini and Jason Baker,” Hill says. “I saw the mask with its swappable mouths: Sometimes the devil face is grinning, sometimes it’s frowning, and sometimes he has no mouth at all. I saw that mask and thought, ‘Oh, I think there’s gonna be a whole bunch of these movies.’ It struck me as instantly iconic in the way Freddy Krueger’s glove is iconic, in the way Michael Myers’ mask is iconic. I thought, ‘This is nightmare fuel, and people are going to want a lot of it.’ I thought he had the potential to become of these big, memorable ongoing horror villains, and if that’s going to be the case, I’d rather he be in good movies than bad ones.”\n\t\n\n\tHill’s intuition was spot on, as he brought up this memory during a discussion on the release date of “Black Phone 2,” the sequel from Universal Pictures that is now playing nationwide. The author has a busy few days, as his 900-page new book “King Sorrow” is set to come out during the same week, on Oct. 21. \n\n\n\tBut he’s eager to discuss the expanded world of “Black Phone,” as the 2021 film, which introduced the murderous Grabber, played by Ethan Hawke, was developed from one of Hill’s short stories. The sequel, written by the team from the first film, Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill, embarks on territory beyond the source material. Hill was the first one of the trio to suggest actually doing the sequel, which follows Finney (Mason Thames), who escapes The Grabber in the first film, and his sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), who starts getting scary phone calls in her dreams, which leads to a way for the recently deceased Grabber to return.\n\t\n\n\t“They didn’t know if they wanted to do a second film,” Hill says. “The first film was beautifully self-contained, so it’s not obvious that there should be a second film. But the thing is, it was just sitting right there. There’s this phone that Finney, our hero, uses to speak to people who have died. And I just thought, ‘What if the next person who calls him on it was The Grabber in Hell? I told that idea to Scott and Cargill, and Cargill especially was like, ‘Yes!’ I had some other concepts that they liked — some of them they passed over and some of them ended up in the film. We were just guys spitballing, seeing where we could land.”\n\n\tHill was thrilled that the duo were interested in making the sequel, with Derrickson also returning as director. The author says the pair is able to conjure something deeper from the material.\n\n\t“If there was going to be a sequel, I want it to be Scott and Cargill who did because I had confidence they would deliver quality,” Hill says. “They would deliver something really fun to watch, and the hallmark of their work is a deep affection for their characters, and a sense of warmth even in the iciest of films. ‘Black Phone 2’ is pretty chilly, but you sense that warmth for the lead character, for the kids. If there’s going to be a sequel, let’s hopefully get them to be persuaded to do it, and then it will be good.”\n\n\tWhen asked about another sequel featuring The Grabber, Hill is emphatic that it’s on his mind, but he doesn’t want to put the cart before the horse.\n\n\t“We’ll see if people want more,” he says. “At the time we’re doing this interview, I have seen some numbers on the Thursday previews and they look pretty good. I’m pretty hopeful for where the film is going to land financially. But people vote with their dollars. If people want ‘Black Phone 3,’ they’ll let us know by banging down the doors to go see ‘Black Phone 2.'”\n\n\tAs for what the next chapter could look like?\n\n\t“One of the things which is fun about ‘Black Phone’ is the first story is about Finney in danger and his sister trying to save him,” Hill says. ‘He’s the lead, and she’s the key second character. But in this film, there’s a flip where Gwen is the lead character and her brother is trying to save her. To me, the logical thing is if there is a third film, they are dual stars where they’re sitting trying to save each other. Maybe there’s a way to do that, maybe there isn’t … we’ll have to see.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the ‘Black Phone 2’ trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Faith and Family,” the series premiere of CBS’ “Boston Blue.”\n\n\tWhen “Blue Bloods” came to an end ",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Faith and Family,” the series premiere of CBS’ “Boston Blue.”\n\n\tWhen “Blue Bloods” came to an end last year after 14 seasons, there were multiple questions viewers still had about what happened to the Reagan clan. Luckily, with spinoff “Boston Blue,” led by Donnie Wahlberg’s Dannie Reagan, they got one big answer in the first moments of the Oct. 17 premiere.\n\n\n\tIn the finale, Danny finally asked his longtime partner, Maria Baez (Marisa Ramirez) to get pizza. And in the first minutes of the premiere, he was shown in bed with Baez; their banter returned, this time with a romantic twist.\n\t\n\n\t“Once we realized we were getting a chance to continue Danny Reagan’s story, Brandon and I looked at what the dangling threads were from the finale, and what was owed. Obviously, the big one was what happened when they went out for pizza,” co-showrunner Brandon Margolis tells Variety. “We really did want to feel like this show is continuing that story in fairly real time. It’s going to be about a year since the finale was off the air, so if Danny and Baez were together, where are they at, and what would that look like? How could that potentially complicate a journey going from New York to Boston? It was important to us we pay service to that and continue to establish that relationship.”\n\n\tWhile Ramirez hasn’t yet signed on to more episodes, the relationship will continue, Sonnier confirms. “Long-distance relationships are a thing. I think we can expect to play that relationship through and really get a sense of where they are in the progression of this relationship that we’ve been watching for a decade,” he says. “It’s a four-hour drive!”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMika Amonsen as Sean Reagan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCBS\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the premiere, Danny pairs up with Detective Lena Silver (Sonequa Martin-Green), the eldest daughter of a prominent law enforcement family — something he knows a thing or two about — in Boston. He’s taking on a new role with the Boston Police Department in order to stay close to his son, Sean (Mika Amonsen), after he suffers an injury while on the job as a police officer.\n\n\tOne big difference from “Blue Bloods” is that Sean has been recast; while Andrew Terraciano played the character for 292 episodes of “Blue Bloods,” Mika Amonsen has taken over the role for the spinoff.\n\n\tWe love Andrew and the work he did over the years on ‘Blue Bloods.’ Really, it came down to we’re telling a new chapter in both of their lives. It’s not just Sean who has joined the family business as it were and is turning over this new leaf, but it’s also now Danny Reagan is the father to a cop, which he’s never been before,” explains Margolis. “So there are all these new storytelling lanes to explore. It felt like there was an organic opportunity to bring in a new performance with a new energy, to help dramatize that change. It is the same character, it’s the same relationship, but it’s also completely different. We love what Mika has brought to Sean, this vulnerability, yet this desire to prove himself. It’s just been great to watch it come to life.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSonequa Martin-Green as Lena Silver, Bridget Moynahan as Erin Reagan Boyle, and Donnie Wahlberg as Danny Reagan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCBS\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe show will have a similar tone to “Blue Bloods” and will likely include more familiar faces. Bridget Moynahan’s Erin Raegan appeared in the premiere, arriving in Boston to make sure Danny was okay, which seems to be just the start.\n\n\t“Can we expect some family members? Can we expect some visits and some trips? Yes, we can,” co-showrunner Brandon Sonnier adds. “We truly mean that we are an expansion of the universe. It’s not just a run-of-the-mill spinoff. It is a different look at a different dynastic law enforcement family through the eyes of the Reagans. But the Reagans exist. They are still out there in the world, living those lives that we watched for so long.”\n\n\tPlus, every episode will feature a family dinner — the Silver family’s Shabbat dinner, which was part of the premiere, which Danny and Erin excitedly joined.\n\t\n\n\t“We will have Shabbat dinner every episode. We hope to honor the original show and their Sunday dinners were so much a fabric of what that show was about, what that family was about,” says Sonnier. “One of the things Donnie would always tell us about was how many real-life law enforcement people he would meet over the course of working on ‘Blue Bloods’ would express how much they appreciated that the Reagan family reminded them of their family. They would sit down and they would have dinner. This is an organic way to continue that universe. It’s something we do. I sit down to dinner as often as possible with my family. I have four young children. Everyone’s got baseball and dance and all the things that people have. But as often as we can, we sit down and we do celebrate Shabbat, so Friday is our time that we get to connect as a family.”\n\n\t“Boston Blue” airs at 10 p.m. ET on CBS and streams on Paramount+ the next day.\n",

Environmental thriller “The Reserve” (“La reserva”) by Pablo Pérez Lombardini scooped Best Feature, Director and Actress (Carolina Guzmán).\n\n\tPérez Lombardini’s debut feature first caught people’s attention at Ventana Sur last year.

    "body": "\n\tThey’re celebrating in Port Charles. ABC’s “General Hospital” dominated the 52nd Daytime Emmys, winning seven prizes on Friday night — including  outstanding drama series.\n\n\t“GH”  also picked up wins for lead actress in a daytime drama (Nancy Lee Grahn), supporting actor (Jonathan Jackson), writing team, directing, costume design/styling and for guest performer Alley Mills. \n\n\tThis year’s Daytime Emmys took place at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, hosted by “Access Hollywood” anchor Mario Lopez. The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences are behind the show, which this year has struck a deal with “Access” to do a deep recap of the ceremony — including red carpet coverage, winner reactions and other footage — on Monday. Viewers who want to watch the Daytime Emmys live can do so on NATAS’ The Emmys app, as well as at watch.theemmys.tv. (This marks the first year in a while that the Daytime Emmys didn’t run on CBS, which carried the kudocast from 2020 to 2024.)\n\t\n\n\tAmong other big winners, Apple TV+’s “The Secret Lives of Animals,” which picked up three Emmys — including outstanding science and nature program. And then there was Netflix’s “Secret Lives of Orangutans,” which also won three — and made history.\n\n\n\tThat’s because “Secret Lives of Orangutans” narrator Sir David Attenborough became the oldest Daytime Emmy winner ever, at 99. He surpassed Dick Van Dyke, who previously set the record last year. Attenborough’s win was one of three for the doc, which also won directing team for a single camera daytime non-fiction program.\n\n\tAmong other multiple winners: CBS Media Ventures’ “The Drew Barrymore Show” won three, including for outstanding daytime talk host and for outstanding hairstyle and makeup. Also from CBS Media Ventures, “Entertainment Tonight” won two, for outstanding entertainment news series and outstanding daytime personality — daily. Netflix’s “Black Barbie” has won two, for arts and popular culture, and for its writing team. \n\t\n\n\tPeacock’s “Days of Our Lives” won two, including one for lead actor Paul Telfer, and one for casting. And then Food Network’s “The Delicious Miss Brown” also won two, for outstanding culinary instructural series, and for culinary host.\n\n\tAmong specials, ABC’s “Disney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade” won for daytime special and for technical Direction/camerawork/video. Other big prizes included two for “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” while  “Live with Kelly and Mark” won for daytime talk series.\n\n\tThanks to “General Hospital” and “Secret Lives of Orangutans,” ABC and Netflix led the winner’s circle with nine each. They were followed by syndicator CBS Media Ventures, with six. Others with multiple wins include Apple TV+ (three), and CBS, Food Network, NBCU and Peacock, with two each.\n\n\tThe Daytime Emmys previously took place in June; the decision to move it to October came as NATAS realigned the timing for some of its biggest shows. This year’s eligibility window was between Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2024; among major changes to this year’s Daytime Emmy competition are new categories including Outstanding Emerging Talent in a Daytime Drama Program (won by “The Bold and the Beautiful” star Lisa Yamada), while the Culinary Series category has been split into two: Outstanding Culinary Instructional Series and Outstanding Culinary Cultural Series; and the Outstanding Travel, Nature, and Adventure category was also divided into Outstanding Travel and Adventure Program and Outstanding Nature and Science Program.\n\n\tA few other major changes: instead of a separate Creative Arts ceremony, the 52nd Annual Daytime Emmy Awards is being held as a single ceremony this year. And fans were offered the chance to buy tickets and attend for the first time in several years.\n\n\t“Welcome to the Daytime Emmys, the awards show for people who actually still watch television and aren’t doom scrolling on TikTok,” Lopez said in his open. The hot topic of AI also was addressed early in the ceremony, as Jodi Long, the current president of the SAG-AFTRA Los Angeles local chapter, introduced the guest performer category by noting, “Only humans can win an acting award!”\n\n\tDeborah Norville has been tapped to receive the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences’ lifetime achievement award, which she was set to receive at Friday’s ceremony. Also during the ceremony, “Days of Our Lives” cast members past and present took the stage to mark the soap’s 60th anniversary.\n\t\n\n\tNATAS prexy/CEO Adam Sharp and Lisa Armstrong are executive producers with Rachel Schwartz serving as Head of the Daytime Emmy Awards. \n\n\tHere are this year’s Daytime Emmys winners:\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Daytime Drama Series \t\n\n\t“Days of our Lives” (Peacock)\n\n\tWINNER: “General Hospital”  (ABC)\n\n\t“The Young and the Restless”  (CBS [Sony Pictures Television])\n\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Lead Performance in a Daytime Drama Series: Actor \t\n\n\tPeter Bergman as Jack Abbott, “The Young and the Restless” (CBS) \n\n\tEric Martsolf as Brady Black, “Days of our Lives” (Peacock)\n\n\tGreg Rikaart as Leo Stark, “Days of our Lives” (Peacock) \n\n\tWINNER: Paul Telfer as Xander Kiriakis, “Days of our Lives” (Peacock) \n\n\tDominic Zamprogna as Dante Falconeri , “General Hospital” (ABC)\n\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Lead Performance in a Daytime Drama Series: Actress \t\n\n\tSharon Case as Sharon Newman, “The Young and the Restless” (CBS) \n\n\tEileen Davidson as Ashley Abbott, “The Young and the Restless” (CBS) \n\n\tMelissa Claire Egan as Chelsea Lawson, “The Young and the Restless” (CBS) \n\n\tWINNER: Nancy Lee Grahn as Alexis Davis, “General Hospital” (ABC)\n\n\tMichelle Stafford as Phyllis Summers, “The Young and the Restless” (CBS)\n\n\tLaura Wright as Carly Spencer, “General Hospital” (ABC)\n\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Supporting Performance in a Daytime Drama Series: Actress\t\n\n\tLindsey Godfrey as Sarah Horton, “Days of Our Lives” (Peacock)\n\n\tCourtney Hope as Sally Spectra, “The Young and the Restless” (CBS)\n\n\tKate Mansi as Kristina Corinthos Davis, “General Hospital” (ABC)\n\n\tEmily O’Brien as Theresa Donovan, “Days of Our Lives” (Peacock)\n\n\tWINNER: Susan Walters as Diane Jenkins Abbott, “The Young and the Restless” (CBS)\n\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Supporting Performance in a Daytime Drama Series: Actor\t\n\n\tTajh Bellow as TJ Ashford, “General Hospital” (ABC)\n\n\tBlake Berris as Everett Lynch, “Days of Our Lives” (Peacock)\n\n\tMichael Graziadei as Dianel Romalotti, “The Young and the Restless” (CBS)\n\n\tGregory Harrison as Gregory Chase, “General Hospital” (ABC)\n\n\tWINNER: Jonathan Jackson as Lucky Spencer, “General Hospital” (ABC)\n\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Daytime Talk Series \t\n\n\t“The Drew Barrymore Show” (CBS Media Ventures) \n\n\t“The Jennifer Hudson Show” (Warner Brothers Television Distribution [JHUD Productions | Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tWhen it comes to true crime TV shows, especially ones about serial killers, there’s a common element among most series: violence. While some claim to focus on the victims’ stories, they also feature murder, sometimes ghoulishy rendered, and an extensive backstory for the killer.\n\n\n\tWhen Patrick Macmanus began his journey of creating a series about John Wayne Gacy’s case, that was the opposite of what he wanted to do. In fact, he refused to do the show unless it was strictly about the victims and didn’t show any of the actual murders of Gacy’s 33 known victims. \n\t\n\n\tBelow, Macmanus reflects on initially turning the series down, working closely with GLAAD throughout the process, reaching out to five victims’ families, and the competition — namely Ryan Murphy — in the true crime genre.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve done multiple true crime series now, most recently two seasons of “Dr. Death.” What drew you to John Wayne Gacy’s crimes and his victims specifically?\t\n\n\tLook, the short answer is that it didn’t draw me in. I turned it down a couple of times before I said yes, because I didn’t have the foresight of what it could be. What was right in front of me at the time was another serial killer story, and I didn’t want to do another circular story. I am so grateful that Universal and Peacock pushed me. I said I would do it if I could focus on the victims, the police, the lawyers and the families, and when I said it to them, I didn’t know what that meant. It wasn’t until we got the room up and running that I realized that we could do these short stories. I even pitched it to the studio, asking, “Are you going to be OK with me doing these stories that have absolutely no connection to John Wayne Gacy, except little light droppings here or there?” They said yes. I thought they were lying, but they were so supportive right off the bat.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow do you think audiences will react to not showing the actual violence?\t\n\n\tI’m really curious how this is going to go. We know that a certain way of telling the story that leans into something that might be seen as a little bit more salacious or gratuitous, that it works. It brings in people, and I don’t know if a show that doesn’t show a murder is going to work — or that allows itself to slow down and tell just the story of hope or tragedy, or dreams lost, or dreams found, or love, or what it’s like to be a sex worker in Chicago in the ’70s. I don’t know if it’s gonna work, but it was definitely worth a shot.\n\t\n\t\tCan you talk about the research process?\t\n\n\tAll of our research began with NBC News and the Peacock documentary. So they had an extraordinary treasure trove of research. We built out various books that became our go-to for information and for inspiration. And then on top of that, we have Patrick Murphy, who’s our private researcher. He came up with thousands of pages of research that came from court documents, interviews, interrogations, etc.\n\n\tFrom the beginning, we wanted to make every effort to reach out to all of the living family members and even a couple of the living victims. And so a list was put together that came from a lot of hours of research that I had nothing to do with, trying to hunt down home addresses, emails, phone numbers of everyone that we could find. We only ultimately ended up connecting with five people. We reached out with full understanding that there was a probability that they would be angry or that they would be hurt. The point of this isn’t for people to give us their blessing. The point of this is for them to be heard and and while it wasn’t going to stop us from making the show, I wanted them to be able to have the ability to be able to tell us what they really thought and guide us as much as they possibly could if they wanted to. I will say that of the five people that we connected, five for five wished us well. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJames Badge Dale as Kozenczak and Gabriel Luna as Tovar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou didn’t show any of the trial. Did you ever discuss including any of that? \t\n\n\tNo, I hate trials. “Dr. Death” was an example of where I strategically showed the trial, and that was only because we knew from the beginning that it was in the trial that we would show the surgeries for the first time. With “Devil in Disguise,” the trial was so well known and so well worn. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe score of this show, done by Leopold Ross and Nick Chuba, includes 33 tracks, the number of known victims. Whose idea was that?\t\n\n\tThat was actually a late conversation with our composers, where we were trying to find how to score the show in a way that could also honor the victims. So much of what they do and why I work with them over and over again is that they are exceptional at their jobs. I don’t mean just the scoring of our shows, but fundamentally understanding the vision of what each of the shows is. I give them complete credit for hearing rambling from me and creating something so special with our score.\n\t\n\t\tI know most of your writers’ room is queer, and you also worked closely with GLAAD on this. What was that process like?\t\n\n\tEarly on in the process of us developing the show, even before the writers’ room, I knew there was going to be a portion of the story that was about the latent homophobia that coursed through the investigation of John Wayne Gacy. It was really important to me that GLAAD become a partner. They agreed to take a look at our outlines and advise on the scripts. They didn’t agree to come on as formal advisors at that point because they wanted to see the final product before they could formalize our partnership, which I completely understood. But I have to tell you, I don’t think I was nervous about anything in this process except waiting for GLAAD to watch the cuts. I remember exactly where I was when I got the call from GLAAD saying that they were on board to become formal and public partners for the show. That is the thing I am most proud of in this entire process — that they gave us what we needed to know to tell this story right, real, and respectfully.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s dive into the formatting. Each episode focuses on a different victim’s story, but I found it interesting that the last two episodes were the stories of David Cram and Jeffrey Rignall — both of whom were survivors. How did you land on that decision?\t\n\n\tThere was no method to the madness as it related to the order of the story, with the exception of Johnny Szyc in Episode 2, because we were connecting the high school ring to the story. David Cram’s story is difficult, because there are a lot of conspiracy theories out there about his complicity in Gacy’s life. It was so conflicting that we chose not to explore it outside of the moments where [prosecutor William] Kunkle was questioning him. But we felt that it was important to do the grooming story towards the end. It just felt like it fit correctly.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd then in the finale, you told Jeffrey Rignall’s story.\t\n\n\tBefore there was a writers’ room, when I was doing the research alone, I knew that Rignall was going to be the last story. I knew it for two reasons. No. 1, it was really the only story that could properly summarize the neglect and the systemic failure of the police department. It was a story that fully encompassed that. The second reason is very nuanced, and I don’t know if everyone’s going to get it because we never state it outright. Because Jeffrey was a part of a throuple, he was very much bohemian and sexually free. He lived life to the fullest. He just was so full of life and love. For John Wayne Gacy, people tried to explain away what he did because he came from an alcoholic, abusive father. They can try to explain it away because he was struggling with his identity. \n\n\tOne of the things that we wanted to make very clear to audiences is that there were millions of people who are struggling under the yoke of an abusive parent. And there are millions of people who have struggled with their identity in the face of cultural bias, systemic bias, school bias, family bias. But none of them killed 33 people. So by showing this life that was so free in every single way — and that would probably be judged to this day — we were making a statement that this queer person was just living life to the fullest and had nothing to do with debauchery.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIn the finale, we see Gacy only in one scene, in the car, smoking with Rignall. Was that a conscious decision not to show him?\t\n\n\tVery, but it didn’t start that way. We have about 23 minutes of Gacy footage of scenes that we shot — the script originally was all about the day of his execution, and we had Gacy all over it. In the edit, I woke up one Sunday morning and had a feeling it was wrong. I called up an editor, Ryan Denmark, and I asked if he’d cut Gacy out to show me. I said, “I feel like it’s our last chance to tell the audience that Gacy is not the center of the story.” He did the cuts, and we watched it together on Zoom. We got to the end, and I looked at him, and said, “What do you think?” He said, “This is exactly how it should be.” And I agree. Then I got scared about telling Chernus. He watched it, and totally got it. He asked me, “Was my performance bad?” I was like, “No, no, no, your performance is great, but you get it?” He goes, “Yeah, I get it.” That scene on the answering machine? It’s so good.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo you plan on watching other upcoming shows about serial killers? Do you watch your competitors?\t\n\n\tI understand why you frame it that way, but I will never call them competitors. This is not just a canned line. I have always believed that art, whether it is TV or film or dance or painting or theater, is subjective. And there is no objectivity in art. I am a fan of a lot of other people’s work. I will say it outright. I am a very big fan of Ryan Murphy’s. I have been since “Nip/Tuck” days. What Ryan does is that he always swings for the fences, and whether he hits it out every time or not, is to be determined by subjectivity. But more than anything, what Ryan did from the very beginning is he was one of the very first creators and showrunners to actually open up the aperture of television and allow people that didn’t typically look like they belonged on TV or didn’t come from a particular background on TV, and he deserves a great deal of credit for what he has done for television. And so that is a long-winded way of me saying I will most certainly be tuning in and checking out what he’s done, because, for subjectivity’s sake, whether you like it or you don’t like it, I am always intrigued by what he does.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

And Lilah, mom says, is also a huge Taylor fan.\n      \n\n          Taylor entered the picture last week after catching wind of Lilah's situation. It all started on February 24 when Lilah suffered a seizure while her mom went into labor at their home.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Lilah was taken to a hospital, where doctors performed a scan and found a mass on her brain that was later determined to be a stage 4 cancerous tumor. She then went under the knife to remove the tumor and the surgery proved successful.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          But, a few days later, Lilah was diagnosed with a rare aggressive form of brain cancer with only 58 documented cases last year in the U.S. The tot returned to the hospital for 3 months of chemo and 3 months of stem cell treatment.\n      \n    \n          Clearly, Lilah's backstory struck a chord in Taylor, who coughed up a pretty penny for her mom to help pay the medical bills.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Taylor Swift\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

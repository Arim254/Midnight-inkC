    "body": "\n\tVince Gill received the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award during the CMA Awards on Nov. 19. Preceding Gill’s acceptance of the honor, a musical tribute took the stage, featuring Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless covering Gill’s hit song “When I Call Your Name.”\n\n\tAfter the performance, country legend George Strait took the stage to present Gill with the award. He said of the 22-time Grammy winner, “There is not a more deserving person to receive this honor, which bears the name of the true Icon himself, Mr. Willie Nelson.”\n\t\n\n\tGill kept it light with his acceptance speech, opening with a joke before gushing about the award’s history. He told the audience, “It’s not lost on me that we had to have girls come out here and sing for me tonight. None of the boys can get up that high.” He added. “This is amazing. In the history of this award, I think it’s been given to maybe ten people, nine or ten, something like that. And that list of people is astounding.”\n\n\n\tAfter sharing a message of love and gratitude to his management and family, Gill gave a final shoutout to the award’s namesake: “Willie, if you’re out there listening, 92 years old, you’re still inspiring us to this day. God bless.”\n\n\tBorn in Oklahoma, Gill began his career as a session player and solo act, working on David Grisman’s 1983 album “Here Today” and releasing his debut EP the following year. In 1990, he had his first hit single with “When I Call Your Name.” Two years later, he released the quadruple platinum album “I Still Believe in You,” which solidified him as a major star and leading figure in country music. \n\t\n\n\tToday, Gill has released 20 albums, selling over 30 million records and charting 45 singles. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2007 and has previously earned 18 CMA Awards as well as 22 Grammys.\n\n\tHis history with the CMA runs deep. In addition to receiving 18 awards and now the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, he also hosted the show every year from 1992 to 2003 and has become a part of the ceremony’s iconography. \n\n\tGill continues to play and create, performing with the Eagles at the intermittent Sphere concerts in Las Vegas. He also continues his solo career, having just recently reupped his deal with MCA Records and relased the  EP “I Gave You Everything I Had” in October.\n\n\tThe 59th annual CMA Awards took place at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena in Tennessee and were broadcast live on ABC. The event was hosted by Lainey Wilson.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Friends” diehards can finally watch the conclusion of the short-lived spinoff series “Joey.”\n\n\tThe final eight episodes of the 2004 NBC sitcom, which starred Matt LeBlanc as the wisecracking Joey Tribbiani, never aired in the U.S. after the show was canceled in 2006 during its second season. But now, those eight installments are available to watch on the “Friends” YouTube channel, along with he 38 others that comprise the complete series.\n\t\n\n\tOutside of LeBlanc, other cast members included Drea de Matteo, Paulo Costanzo, Jennifer Coolidge and Andrea Anders. The series followed Joey as he “leaves New York for Hollywood in order to take his acting career to the next level.” While in Los Angeles, he reunites with “his high-strung sister Gina (Matteo)” and “Michael (Costanzo), his 20-year-old genius nephew,” per an official description.\n\n\n\tCreated by “Friends” producers Shana Goldberg-Meehan and Scott Silveri, the show’s pilot debuted to an impressive 18.6 million viewers. However, hype quickly died down through the remainder of Season 1 and Season 2.\n\n\tAfter “Joey” came to an end, “Friends” executive producer and director Kevin S. Bright gave his thoughts on why the spin-off failed to find an audience. He told The Age in 2006, “On ‘Friends’ Joey was a womaniser but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn’t get a job, couldn’t ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit that accused Vin Diesel of sexually assaulting his assistant in 2010 on grounds that California law does not apply in Georgia.\n\n\tThe assistant, Asta Jonasson, sued Diesel in Los Angeles Superior Court in 2023, alleging that he had pinned her against a wall and masturbated while he was in Atlanta for the filming of “Fast Five,” the fifth “Fast & Furious” movie. \n\n\n\tAccording to the complaint, Diesel had brought Jonasson to his hotel suite and forced her onto the bed. She protested and tried to get away, but he pushed her against the wall, tried to pull down her underwear, and then forced her to touch his erect penis, the suit alleged.\n\t\n\n\tShe also alleged that, hours later, Diesel’s sister called her and fired her. She had worked for Diesel for nine days.\n\n\tThe judge, Daniel M. Crowley, previously dismissed four of Jonasson’s 10 claims, citing the statute of limitations. In his ruling on Wednesday, he dismissed the remaining six claims due to lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\t“It is undisputed that the alleged sexual assault took place in Atlanta, Ga.,” the judge wrote, adding that the claim “fails as a matter of law because California statutes are presumed not to have extraterritorial effect unless the Legislature expressly states otherwise in adopting the statute.”\n\n\tJonasson’s entire suit would ordinarily have been beyond the statute of limitations. But in 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, which revived certain sexual assault cases dating back to 2009.\n\n\tThe judge ruled that nothing in the law indicates that it applies outside the state of California.\n\t\n\n\tIn a statement, Jonasson’s lawyers said they plan to appeal.\n\n\t“The Court did not decide anything about the truth of Ms. Jonasson’s allegations,” they said. “The ruling was based on a legal technicality, with which we respectfully disagree. Ms. Jonasson intends to appeal.”\n\n\tDiesel’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, denied the allegations when the case was first filed and said there was “clear evidence” that refutes them.\n\n\t“We are grateful that the court put an end to this meritless lawsuit,” Freedman said Wednesday. “We are pleased that this matter has been resolved entirely.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tChain-smoking and foul-mouthed, Socorro (Luisa Huertas) — a veteran, can’t-suffer-any-fools lawyer — clings to the memory of her dead brother both like a chain that keeps her captive and the engine that keeps her going in “We Shall Not Be Moved,” writer-director Pierre Saint-Martin’s blistering and tightly conceived feature debut. The sound of a helicopter haunts Socorro, who uses hearing aids, either as a bad omen from a distant past or a warning for the tenebrous path she is inching closer to in her restless quest for retribution. In the opening sequence of this black-and-white chamber piece, Huerta’s piercing gaze points directly at the lens, as if Socorro acknowledges the viewer’s intrusion into her microcosm.\n\t\n\n\tCoque, her brother, died at the hands of a soldier during the state-sanctioned student massacre that ravaged Mexico City’s Tlatelolco apartment complex on Oct. 2, 1968. And for the last 50 years, Socorro has been searching for the name of the killer. Documentary footage of the protests that preceded the bloodshed serve as the film’s prologue. Through a perpetually irate visage, the ferocious and magnetic Huertas imbues this woman with a virulent conviction, sculpted from a lifetime of hurt that weighs heavy on her weathered body and tattered soul. Her guilt-driven resolve is all-consuming and pathological. She appears trapped taking meetings with clients in the apartment, as if still waiting for Coque to return. For a while that suspicion convinces her he’s reincarnated as a white dove.\n\n\n\tInside her home, a fortress of folders and documents collected over a lifetime dedicated to attaining justice for others by any means necessary (she’s not above violence or bribery as a means to an end), Socorro interacts with her distressed son Jorge (Pedro Hernández), an unemployed journalist; her daughter-in-law, Lucia (Argentine actress Agustina Quinci); and her estranged sister, Esperanza (Rebeca Manriquez). The outside world enters her purview in the form of playful phone conversation with former mentor, Cardiani (Juan Carlos Colombo), and the visits that Sidarta (José Alberto Patiño), a giddy but loyal pseudo-assistant, pays her. Patino’s charisma counterbalances the sternness of Huertas’ part.  \n\t\n\n\t“Justice in this country is for the rich or those with power,” Socorro, her eyes full of assertive wisdom, tells Sidarta once her brewing bitterness can finally be channeled into action. A package from an old contact reveals the name of the man she’s after. Socorro sets in motion her “eye for an eye” plan, with Sidarta doing her bidding. In this portrait of inescapable rage, Saint-Martin and his co-writer Iker Compeán Leroux shrewdly frame the larger historical tragedy within Socorro’s individual plight — how the events shaped who she’s become and how her relationships continue to suffer from her single-mindedness.\n\n\tEach of Socorro’s human connections feels steeped in a shared history and lightly soaked in acidly comedic undertones, even if the supporting parts enjoy limited screentime. Sidarta acts as a sort of proxy for her real son, who she named after Coque (a nicknamed for those named Jorge), and whom she’s burdened with expectations (or at least that how he feels). And it’s in her motherly friendship with Lucia, especially during a drunken night, that glimmers of Socorro’s personality beyond rancor peak through. The version of herself who loved dancing and enjoyed many lovers hasn’t been completely buried.\n\n\tIn smoky rooms, reflected on a round mirror, or as feathers from imaginary, innocent doves fall around her — in disorienting episodes that stem from her deteriorating health — cinematographer César Gutiérrez Miranda’s camera caresses Huertas’ face like the irreplaceable asset that it is for the film. In both form and tone, Saint-Martin also pays homage to “Duck Season,” another black-and-white Mexican indie set in the Tlatelolco apartments — that one by his former screenwriter teacher and accomplished filmmaker Fernando Eimbcke. (A DVD of the 2004 coming-of-age movie makes a cameo.)\n\n\tIn making a film about the past set in the present, Saint-Martin formulates an indictment on his country’s unhealed wounds, which rather than cauterize with time, remain open since the festering corruption and abuse of power that obscured the truth around the students’ deaths, remains in place. When Socorro calls a judge she once knew to ask for a favor, she blackmails him with unsavory information. Just before hanging up, he reminds her that he’s no longer just a judge, but a magistrate. Not only was he never held accountable for his dubious dealings; on the contrary, he’d been promoted into a higher position in the “justice” system. That Socorro eventually enlists the help of the type of criminals she once swore never to defend, confirms her compromised status. No one here is a blameless “white dove,” but rather more common gray ones, marked by nuanced contradictions.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a sin to forget those we lost, and we have to do them justice,” Socorro solemnly says to Lucia, when the latter discusses her grandparents’ fate during the Argentine military dictatorship. But can Socorro ever come to accept that it’s as much of an offense to reduce one’s life to grief and fury, to squander it all for the promise of one day inflicting pain on the architects of our dejection? Saint-Martin rejects facile forgiveness, the kind that urges people to turn the other cheek and remain static in the face of transgressions. The path forward, he suggests, is not to absolve the perpetrators or deny the bleakness one has endured, but to keep memory unmovable with all its shades, including those etched in light. Enduring resistance can also look like surviving without succumbing to despair.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Steve Pink‘s “The Last Republican” debuted at 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, audiences and critics alike embraced the documentary about former U.S. Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger.\n\n\tKinzinger, a Republican, voted in favor of impeaching Donald Trump in 2021 and then served on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol with Democrats and fellow Republican Liz Cheney. The doc, which follows Kinzinger during his final year in office, could easily have been depressing or contentious, given that Pink is on the political left and Kinzinger is a Reagan-loving conservative. But instead, Pink, known for directing “Hot Tub Time Machine,” managed to do the impossible and made a riveting, humorous political documentary that demonstrates that in an age of political division, civil bipartisan discussion is possible.\n\t\n\n\tIn the lead-up to the 2024 Presidential election, the film was vital viewing at festivals like the Camden International Film Festival in Maine and the Chicago International Film Festival. But despite its powerful, hopeful message that Americans on both sides of the political aisle can engage in civil discourse even as sectarianism tears the nation apart, streamers steered clear of the film.\n\n\n\tSo, Pink did what most documentary filmmakers are doing these days and self-distributed the doc across all major digital platforms and streaming services. After a nationwide release on Oct. 29, “The Last Republican” became Apple TV’s number one documentary. With the backing of Meidas Studios, the film has earned mid-six-figure profits.\n\t\n\n\tVariety spoke to Pink and Kinzinger about Trump, Jeffrey Epstein and a possible GOP civil war.\n\n\tWhat are your hopes for the film being released now?\n\n\tKinzinger: Before the 2024 election, when the film was playing at film festivals, there was a certain feeling watching it. After the election, it takes on a completely different feeling and that different feeling is like a little bit of sadness and sickness. Like, ‘Oh my gosh. I can’t believe this is happening.’ But also being able to look at it and say, ‘Hey, it’s a reminder that this thing really happened and that we basically have a real fight to fight.’ So, I think the timing couldn’t be better. Hopefully, this movie can re-motivate people, to an extent, to stand up and do the right thing.\n\n\tPink: It seemed like the right amount of time had passed to look back and assess where we were and what had happened.\n\n\tAdam, since Trump’s re-election, you have been very vocal about what he has done wrong. Has he come after you?\n\n\tKinzinger: I’ll let you in on a little inside stuff. Every time I met with Trump, he was obsessed with me. I didn’t endorse him in 2016. I didn’t even vote for him. He knew that and he was mad about it. He told our state party chairman, ‘Tell Adam to go f himself.’ Then he won in 2016, and after that, in March, I went to the Oval Office, and I figured that he was going to chew me out. So, I go into the Oval Office and he just looks at me and says, ‘You are great on television.’ His attention was on me. Now, I’m not saying that to say, ‘I’m cool’ or to brag. He knew that I wasn’t fully in the tank for him and that obsessed him, because when you are a narcissist, you have to win everybody over. I equate it to when you’re a teenage boy asks a girl out on a date or to the prom and she says no. You want to go out with her even more. That’s how Donald Trump is. So, has he come after me? Yes. He attacks me verbally. Not much, but he does. They haven’t come after me on anything else, and if they do, I’ll double down and be even worse to them.\n\n\tTrump has been in office for close to a year. Do you see his MAGA base turning at all?Kinzinger: Those who are hardcore MAGA, I would love to see all of them wake up, find religion, and switch. Obviously, that is not going to happen. When we are dealing with a country that is so closely divided, if you can just move the margins a little bit, and that’s what we saw in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\n\tDo you think that the Jeffrey Epstein files being released will affect Trump’s presidency?Kinzinger: So things like the Epstein files, I mean, you can not with a straight face and on CIA truth serum, honestly, tell me that Donald Trump’s not in them. Now it’s clear he’s in them. So everybody in their own soul has to look in and go, ‘Am I going to protect a child sex trafficker or somebody associated with one?’ There are some people who can’t do that. Some people can. So, I think that continued economic hardship, things like $40 billion to bail out Argentina, that stuff compiles into people turning. I also think the second it becomes clear that Donald Trump is not running again, which he’s not, then you start to see a civil war in the (Republican) party in terms of who is going to take over after that.\n\t\n\n\tDo you think you will run for office again?\n\n\tKinzinger: Not in 2026, but I’m open to it. I don’t want people to think that me speaking out now is related to some desire to run again.  People tend to think that about politicians. But I still have that burning desire to do something, so I would definitely keep it open, but not as a Republican. That party is gone.\n\n\tPink: But if they restore themselves to the Mitt Romney level party?\n\n\tKinzinger: The tough thing about that is that you would be ultimately empowering people who empowered an autocrat and potentially a trafficker. I like the policies of a Mitt Romney. He’s a good guy, but ultimately, when you elect somebody for president, you are electing everything around that person. But the big question right now is, are Democrats willing to be a big tent? That doesn’t mean that Democrats have to become Republicans. For instance, I’m in Texas. You probably need somebody for a statewide office who is more conservative than most Democrats. But what does that get you? If you have, for instance, a Texas Democrat, let’s say that is pro Second Amendment, none of that matters. What matters is who they will vote for as leadership. So, that’s a big question for the Democrats. I think they are working through that right now.\n\n\tIn the doc you make fun of Steve for being so far left that he is “basically a Communist.” What are your thoughts now on Steve’s politics?\n\n\tI think Steve and I probably agree on a lot more than we let on. At this moment, I don’t care about people’s political beliefs in terms of issues. The only thing I care about is whether you are going to be in the trench with me defending democracy, and Steve is. What I’ve learned, I always knew this, but now I can put words to it, is that I enjoy being around people who are different than me and disagree more than I enjoy people say yes to everything I say. I mean, how fun is that to sit and have a beer with somebody that’s like, ‘I agree. I agree. I agree.’ It’s more fun to find someone with a different viewpoint and get to know them. Steve and I developed a truly genuine friendship.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for “The Man in the Glass,” the series finale of “Murdaugh: Death in the Family,” now streaming on Hulu.\n",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for “The Man in the Glass,” the series finale of “Murdaugh: Death in the Family,” now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tWhen it came time for Jason Clarke to finally play out the moment Alex Murdaugh gunned down his wife and son in “Murdaugh: Death in the Family,” he had already listened to and watched countless hours of trial recordings, interview tapes and archival footage of the man pulling the trigger. He had a handle on the animated, colorful man Murdaugh was always the loudest person in the room.\n\t\n\n\t“He’s got an element of Tony Soprano in him,” Clarke tells Variety. “He’s an entertainer. He’s not the sad clown, he’s the happy clown!”\n\n\n\tYet, even though Clarke embodied the showboat lawyer who saw his South Carolina hometown as his stage, with his neighbors as his audience, the moment Alex kills his wife Maggie (Patricia Arquette) and son Paul (Johnny Berchtold) is devoid of any such showy behavior. He’s subdued and calculated. Clarke worked to master that side of him as well.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Daniel Delgado Jr.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“That’s the lawyer in him going to close, going for the kill,” he says.\n\n\tThe scene originally plays out in Episode 6, without Alex in the picture. But as he lies in his prison cell in the finale, he thinks back to the night of the murders, and the scene retraces its own steps from Alex’s perspective. Before they shot the sequence, Clarke talked extensively with co-creators Michael D. Fuller and Erin Lee Carr, director Steven Piet and the crew on the ground in Atlanta about how the scene should unfold and be shot. They knew the beats they had to hit. The scene starts as a mundane set of chores. Maggie’s dog Bubba walks up with a dead chicken in its mouth, causing a conversation that Paul captured on a Snapchat video that placed Alex at the scene, and ultimately sealed his conviction. After that moment passes, Alex steps away to put on  the infamous blue raincoat, grabs two guns, walks up to Paul and shoots him point blank in the chest and then in the head. Then, Maggie comes running, and he shoots her in the leg, the chest and then ultimately twice in the head. It would have happened quickly, and Clarke didn’t want to spend more time in the moment than he needed to either. \n\t\n\n\t“I didn’t really want to do this all night,” he says of filming. “It is not nice pointing a gun at somebody, even another actor in a scene. And there was also the feeling that we get one shot at this, because that’s all he got. It’s messy in its own way, and it’s quick, and then it’s over. We got the feeling of what it was like, and what always struck me was the simplicity of it in the end. We didn’t have a desire to put anything on it that wasn’t really there.”\n\n\tBut it is important and powerful that it’s included in the series at all. After a flurry of documentaries on Netflix, HBO Max, CNN, ABC, NBC and even a two-part Lifetime movie, the tragedy of the Murdaughs, and the casualties they left in their wake, has been dissected relentlessly in the four years since the murders. Yet none of those reports could show, as viscerally as “Death in the Family” does, the murder scene: Alex actually killing his family. It is something that prosecutor Creighton Waters laid out in detail in Alex’s 2023 trial. But seeing it play out with no doubt of his role in it was paramount to Clarke.\n\n\t“That’s the whole point of doing it,” he says of the series. “That’s the point of picking it up. Waters broke it down in the trial in a legal sense. And then, we, as dramatists, broke it down on screen.”\n\n\tHe also had one request for how it should play out: “It was important to me that Paul and I got to lock eyes, because I think that would have happened, even for a second,” he says.\n\n\tThat moment of realization for Paul — something Arquette also has to play out when Maggie rushes up to see her husband standing over their son’s lifeless body — made the entire filming process a somber affair. “Paul seeing it coming with that second shot, and Maggie seeing her son on the ground and knowing the last person she saw was Alex, is horrible,” Carr says. “It was a very quiet night on set when we filmed that.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Wilford Harewood\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut for Fuller and Carr, there was also the question of when. When did Alex decide to kill Maggie and Paul? The show can’t answer that, because no one knows. Was it in days or weeks before? Or was it in the moment, as seen in Episode 6, when Maggie tells Alex she doesn’t trust anything he says, or later when he finds mother and son on the porch sharing a tender moment at his expense? \n\t\n\n\t“What we hope these episodes explain is that all these moments could have been when he chose to do it, and Jason plays it so beautifully where he doesn’t give it away,” Carr says.\n\n\tFor Carr, it was the moment when Maggie’s sister Marion (J. Smith Cameron) took the stand and spoke about the premeditation of the crimes that really solidified the timeline. So much so, they put her testimony into the finale.\n\n\t“The most revealing part in the real-life story was when Marion was on the stand, and said that Alex had told her, ‘I think whoever did this had been thinking about it a long time,’” Carr says. ”That struck her as very odd, and for us, as people who’ve studied it and then dramatized it, that’s what I truly believe.”\n\n\tThe series as a whole also had the mission to give more depth and humanity to Maggie and Paul, who, by the time the country knew about the Murdaughs’ many dark secrets, were already dead and couldn’t speak for themselves. Paul, specifically, was also known for crashing a boat while drunk in 2019 and killing teenager Mallory Beach, a legal situation that only exacerbated Alex’s financial and opiate addiction issues. Fuller, who is from South Carolina, fought to adapt reporter Mandy Matney’s “Murdaugh Murders Podcast” as source material, because he wanted to do right by his home state and the people involved in the story. He also wanted Maggie and Paul to be more than the victims in the photos endlessly circulated by the media, and plastered on posterboards in the courtroom, even if their stories are complicated by questions of complicity and wrongdoing.\n\n\t“What we wanted to depict with them is that there’s a complexity to them, and that includes the good things, especially in our version of them,” Fuller says. “The grace and guilt, and trying to search for answers.”\n\n\tOne way of doing that was a speculative scene in Episode 6, right before their deaths, which imagines them sharing a heart-to-heart about why it is not their job to save Alex from himself. Maggie had begun the process of leaving Alex, and only came back into town to support him at his request as his father’s health declined. Paul, meanwhile, had started to accept and process his guilt in Mallory’s death, turning toward his family and his future.\n\t\n\n\t“Here may be a path forward where they can really have that mother-son bond or maybe they wouldn’t have, but whatever it would have been, they were deprived of that opportunity,” Fuller says of the scene, which he co-wrote. “It’s a moment of growth. It’s not a full-blown breakthrough. It’s not a moment where everything makes sense now. But it was a chance to ask what could have been if they hadn’t been tragically killed.”\n\n\tEven though they did want to show the complexity of the Murdaughs’ stories, Carr is clear about how she sees Maggie and Paul.\n\n\t“From my point of view, they were victims of Alex Murdaugh,” Carr adds. “Whether people have feelings about her being a bad mother, or Paul doing what he did, they were murdered in cold blood.”\n\n\tIf anything about Clarke’s opinion of the case changed over the course of production, he says it is because of the show’s commitment to shedding more light on Alex’s victims.\n\n\t“I feel like I know the characters of Paul and Maggie more, and that community more,” he says, noting he quietly visited Hampton before filming began. “Two days after Maggie and Paul were killed, [attorney] Mark Tinsley rang Alex up and said that on behalf of the Beaches, they were going to drop the lawsuit against the family. They didn’t think it was right in lieu of what he was going through, and that really broke my heart. But I admire that as well. It is the human thing to do. It made it all more real, and I cared about everyone more.”\n\n\tClarke still talks in great detail about the case, the trial and his thoughts on the firestorm around the story. If you ask him, he will tell you what mistakes he thinks the defense made in the trial, what shouldn’t have been admitted in the case and what parts of Alex’s testimony on the stand he would have liked to play out in the show. It is clear he isn’t exaggerating when he says he did his homework. While he never wanted to mimic the man completely, he did want to give those who knew the case and felt like they knew Alex something recognizable to latch onto, especially in the finale when Alex takes the stand in his own defense.\n\n\t“We crafted that out to do exactly as he did because it was such a very particular kick off to his self defense,” Clarke says. “He did lean back at that moment, and smacked his lips at another. We tried to time out when he looked at Buster in the audience because he clocks Buster at a very strange time within that. But you come back to it because people have seen this trial and these videos so many times. I’m a big believer that if you hit certain stuff, people will lean more into the stuff we are taking a stab at, for lack of a better word.”\n\t\n\n\tHe took pride in hearing, directly from Matney herself, that someone who knew the real Alex thought they might have taken him out of prison to play himself because Clarke was doing such a good job. But one thing from that immersion in the world of the Murdaughs has stuck with him: The Murdaugh men’s practice of constantly calling everyone “bo” has seeped into the Australian’s own vocabulary since filming, much to the chagrin of people like his son.\n\n\t“My family came with me when we were shooting, and my son just said, ‘Daddy, can you stop saying that, please? I don’t like it.’ Clarke says with a laugh. “I’m out here in Australia right now, and the other day I called a guy ‘bo.’ It’s like ‘mate’ to us, but he just looked at me so confused. I still love that term, I really do.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLainey Wilson, Ella Langley and Riley Green each scored three honors at the 59th annual CMA Awards show Wednesday night, with Wilson taking away the most coveted prize, entertainer of the year. \n\n\tSurprises were in order in some of the categories considered long held by intractable repeat winners, Cody Johnson won for best male vocalist, finally moving Chris Stapleton out of that position, while the Red Clay Strays won vocal group of the year, supplanting the seemingly indomitable Old Dominion.\n\t\n\n\tWilson, the show’s host, won for album of the year — for “Whirlwind” — and female vocalist as well as entertainer of the year. \n\n\n\tLangley and Green were duet partners whose teaming on “You Look Like You Love Me” landed both of them wins single of the year, song of the year and music video of the year.\n\n\t“I was just so tickled to be hosting this thing tonight,” Wilson said upon winning the climactic award, assuring the crowd she would’ve been OK with a loss, given what a win her first solo hosting gig turned out to be. After giving her speech, she laughed upon remembering that it was her duty to provide closing remarks for the show, too. “I forgot I was hosting this thing,” she admitted. “Thank you for letting me run my mouth on this legendary stage and celebrate the best genre in the world, country dang music.”\n\n\t“Mama, daddy, look, check it out,” Wilson said while receiving an earlier award. “I wrote this during a time of my life that was constantly changing like a lot of y’all down here. And i just remember being that little 11-year-old girl who would come home from school and pick up my guitar and pour my heart and soul into that guitar, and that’s how I navigated and communicated. And that’s exactly what I did these last two years of my life, when I felt my life was changing but I still felt exactly the same.”\n\t\n\n\tElla Langley was an early leader with three wins out of her six nominations. She and duet partner Riley Green won two categories on the broadcast for their hit “You Look Like You Love Me” — single of the year and song of the year — on top of music video of the year, which was announced prior to the telecast. \n\n\t“This song is the gift that keeps on giving,” said Langley, picking up the song of the year trophy. “How cool is it that a song with talking verses won song of the year? That’s country music,” said Green.\n\n\tZach Top was another big winner early in the telecast, taking the highly contested trophy for best new artist — and in the process, denying Langley at least one prize. \n\n\tThe Red Clay Strays were a surprise winner for vocal group of the year, in the rock-oriented band’s first time being nominated, after a long reign by Old Dominion.\n\n\tCody Johnson also won for the first time in the male vocalist category. He expressed his appreciation for the mainstay in the category, saying “to be in a vocalist category with Chris Stapleton, who’s one of the greatest vocalists of all time in any genre, thanks for paving the way.”\n\n\tLangley, Lainey Wilson and Megan Moroney came in tied with six nominations each, closely followed by Top with five.\n\n\tBrooks & Dunn won vocal duo of the year for a 16th time. “I heard earlier in the night, ‘You ever get sick of this?’ Hell no!” exclaimed Kix Brooks.\n\n\tSteel guitar player Paul Franklin provided what felt like both an inevitability and an upset when he won his first award for musician of the year after being nominated a staggering 33 times since 1989.\n\n\tIn lieu of a comedic monologue, host Lainey Wilson sang a medley of modern country classics, approaching the originators of the songs in the audience — including Brooks & Dunn during a snippet of “Hillbilly Deluxe,” Langley during “You Look Like You Love Me,” Gretchen Wilson on “Redneck Woman,” Lady A on “Need You Now,” Shaboozey on “Tipsy.” When Lainey came up to Little Big Town, they surprised the audience by pulling out mics to take over their song “Girl Crush,” and back on stage, Keith Urban brought out his guitar to jam with Wilson on “Where the Blacktop Ends.”\n\n\tWilson is the sole host this year after co-hosting with Luke Bryan and Peyton Manning in 2024. She joked about receiving texts from both men, including Bryan supposedly cluelessly writing her: “Lainey, what night is the show?”\n\t\n\n\tLuke Combs and Megan Moroney gave the first two full performances of the telecast. Stephen Wilson Jr. got the night’s first standing ovation with a solo acoustic cover of the classic “Stand by Me.” Kenny Chesney also got the audience on its feet with a medley of two signature hits, “American Kids” and “When the Sun Goes Down.” Vince Gill was the subject of a tribute performance by two great voices from inside and outside the genre, Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless, who joined forces on a Gill song completely in the vein of the most classic country, “When I Call Your Name” (with instrumentalist winner Paul Franklin on pedal steel).\n\n\tHere is a full list of the 2025 nominations, with the winners’ names appearing in bold as the categories are announced:\n\n\tENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR• Luke Combs• Cody Johnson• Chris Stapleton• Morgan Wallen• Lainey Wilson\n\n\tSINGLE OF THE YEARAward goes to Artist(s), Producer(s) and Mix Engineer(s)• “4x4xU” – Lainey WilsonProducer: Jay JoyceMix Engineers: Jason Hall, Jay Joyce• “Ain’t No Love in Oklahoma” – Luke CombsProducers: Luke Combs, Chip Matthews, Jonathan SingletonMix Engineer: Chip Matthews• “Am I Okay?” – Megan MoroneyProducer: Kristian BushMix Engineer: Justin Niebank• “I Never Lie” – Zach TopProducer: Carson ChamberlainMix Engineer: Matt Rovey• “You Look Like You Love Me” – Ella Langley & Riley GreenProducer: Will BundyMix Engineer: Jim Cooley\n\n\tALBUM OF THE YEARAward goes to Artist, Producer(s) and Mix Engineer(s)• “Am I Okay?” – Megan MoroneyProducer: Kristian BushMix Engineer: Justin Niebank• “Cold Beer & Country Music” – Zach TopProducer: Carson ChamberlainMix Engineer: Matt Rovey• “F-1 Trillion” – Post MaloneProducers: Louis Bell, Charlie Handsome, HoskinsMix Engineer: Ryan Gore• “I’m the Problem” – Morgan WallenProducers: Jacob Durrett, Charlie Handsome, Joey MoiMix Engineers: Charlie Handsome, Joey Moi• “Whirlwind” – Lainey WilsonProducer: Jay JoyceMix Engineers: Jason Hall, Jay Joyce\n\n\tSONG OF THE YEARAward goes to Songwriter(s)• “4x4xU”Songwriters: Jon Decious, Aaron Raitiere, Lainey Wilson• “Am I Okay?”Songwriters: Jessie Jo Dillon, Luke Laird, Megan Moroney• “I Never Lie”Songwriters: Carson Chamberlain, Tim Nichols, Zach Top• “Texas”Songwriters: Johnny Clawson, Josh Dorr, Lalo Guzman, Kyle Sturrock• “You Look Like You Love Me”Songwriters: Riley Green, Ella Langley, Aaron Raitiere\n\t\n\n\tFEMALE VOCALIST OF THE YEAR• Kelsea Ballerini• Miranda Lambert• Ella Langley• Megan Moroney• Lainey Wilson\n\n\tMALE VOCALIST OF THE YEAR• Luke Combs• Cody Johnson• Chris Stapleton• Zach Top• Morgan Wallen\n\n\tVOCAL GROUP OF THE YEAR• Lady A• Little Big Town• Old Dominion• Rascal Flatts• The Red Clay Strays\n\n\tVOCAL DUO OF THE YEAR• Brooks & Dunn• Brothers Osborne• Dan + Shay• Maddie & Tae• The War and Treaty\n\n\tMUSICAL EVENT OF THE YEARAward goes to Artists and Producer(s)• “Don’t Mind if I Do” – Riley Green (featuring Ella Langley)Producers: Scott Borchetta, Jimmy Harnen, Dann Huff• “Hard Fought Hallelujah” – Brandon Lake with Jelly RollProducer: Micah Nichols• “I’m Gonna Love You” – Cody Johnson (with Carrie Underwood)Producer: Trent Willmon• “Pour Me a Drink” – Post Malone (feat.

In a new episode of the “Inside of You” podcast, Mack reunited with “Smallville” co-star Michael Rosenbaum to explain what happened following her arrest and prison time for her part in the NXIVM cult and enabling leader Keith Raniere.  \n\n\tMack, who told her full story for the first time on CBC podcast “Allison After NXIVM,” spoke openly with Rosenbaum; the two have known each other since 2001 as they both starred as Chloe Sullivan and Lex Luthor, respectively, in The WB (then The CW) drama. But during the interview, they didn’t speak about the show; instead, they detailed her 12 years in the NXIVM cult — and when things began to go south.\n\t\n\n\t“Stuff didn’t start to get really dysfunctional and illegal until the eighth or ninth year that I was involved,” she told Rosenbaum. “It was a very stereotypical, now that I look back at it, grooming process that happened over a period of time… it was a different form of an abusive relationship.”\n\n\n\tBut during her time, even when people began leaving, “there was always a justification” or an excuse that she was told, so she ignored things that were clear red flags. “It’s this insidious little community where everybody stays connected to each other, and everybody’s reinforcing the belief system that everybody has. And then you get in so deep.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAllison Mack, Michael Rosenbaum and Kristen Kreuk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter her 2018 arrest, Mack was placed on house arrest for three years, traveling back and forth to New York to participate in dozens of interviews with prosecutors and police. “It was walking through the gates of hell. It was horrible,” she said of the interviews. “It was difficult because I was still trying to figure out what happened… I just felt crazy.”\n\t\n\n\tShe leaned very much on her mom, sister and a few close friends during this time, because “90 percent of the people in my life stopped communicating with me,” Mack said. \n\n\tThe actress also had “moments of suicidal ideation,” she said. The first was when she was hiding in Mexico after Raniere’s arrest, staying alone in a penthouse apartment for two weeks. “I went out on the balcony and thought, ‘I could jump and this could be over.’ But then I wouldn’t know what happens next, and I want to know what happens next. And it will be different tomorrow, I need to just hang on through this.”\n\n\tThe next was during house arrest, trying to come to terms with what she’d done, work with the police, navigate the paparazzi and wonder whether she would be convicted of a sex crime. “All of these realities were so heavy and dark and painful,” she said. “I would have moments where I felt like, I don’t know that I can carry this anymore. And then I’d think, ‘If I kill myself, I’m gonna hurt my mom so bad. I can’t do that.’ So I didn’t.”\n\n\tMack stated that she’s not allowed to speak to any of the people involved in NXIVM, but everyone on trial received a letter from Raniere before the trial began. “I did not read it,” she said, adding that she doesn’t know what it says. “I’m not yet at a place where I’ve forgiven him because I haven’t fully comprehended what he did. I’m still working on that.”\n\n\tShe added, “It’s a really complicated thing to be both a victim and a perpetrator. I think I’m still working through that, and I think my feelings around Keith are enmeshed in all of that as well. He’s an evil man. And it’s good that he’s not around.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAllison Mack arrives at the United States Eastern District Court in 2018.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEverett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShe also discussed how unwell she was during her time in the cult, but knows that what she did was wrong.\n\n\t“I so deeply believed that what I was doing was righteous and good and powerful and transformational and profound. I was living on 500 calories a day. I was running 5 to 6 miles every morning because that’s what Keith wanted,” she said, “I was so sick. But I didn’t feel any of it because the fanaticism was so present.” \n\n\tRosenbaum noted that he knows she’s not doing many interviews, thanking her for coming on the “Inside of You” podcast. “It meant a lot when you reached out. You were one of the first people from my old life that reached out,” That’s the only reason I’m here,” she said before tearing up. “It meant more than you could know that you have been kind. I think that just speaks to your character.”\n",

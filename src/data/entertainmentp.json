    "body": "\n\tThe rapid rise of Korean drama in Europe is entering a new phase, shifting from streaming success toward local adaptation and co-development, executives said during a Mip London session examining the genre’s growing regional impact.\n\n\tSpeaking at “The Rise of K-Drama in Europe,” Jinhee Lee, marketing manager at CJ ENM, said Korean series have seen “a very clear rise, not just in global visibility, but in actual regional performance, as a strong and sustained engagement within individual markets as well.”\n\t\n\n\tJoining Lee on the panel were Diane Min, head of Europe sales at CJ ENM, and Claire Takami Siljedahl, development producer at Fifth Season U.K., the international studio jointly owned by Korea’s CJ ENM, Japan’s Toho Co. and U.S. investment firm Neuberger Berman.\n\n\n\tAs an example of the genre’s momentum, Lee cited CJ ENM drama “Bon Appetit, Your Majesty,” which ranked in Netflix’s Top 10 across more than 10 European territories and remained in the chart for up to seven consecutive weeks in countries including Portugal, Romania and Greece.\n\n\tMin said the global success of “Squid Game” in 2021 “literally changed everything,” helping make Korean dramas more accessible to audiences worldwide. She noted that a total of 210 Korean dramas from multiple broadcasters and studios have reached Netflix’s Top 10 chart over the past five years.\n\n\tEurope has become a key expansion territory, Min said, with more than 30 Korean drama titles now available on Prime Video in the U.K., while CJ ENM has also launched Korean series on major French broadcasters.\n\t\n\n\tSiljedahl said the appeal of Korean dramas lies in their originality and genre blending. “The concepts are so original… a lot of genre mashups, which is really exciting,” she said, noting that many story ideas feel unlike those typically developed in Western markets.\n\n\tShe also pointed to adaptation challenges, including cultural differences and tonal adjustments. Attitudes to sex, heightened emotional storytelling and culturally specific elements often require modification to resonate with U.K. audiences while preserving the original feel of the IP, she said.\n\n\tThe session highlighted titles gaining traction in Europe, including “Lovely Runner,” which has expanded on Prime Video into multiple territories, and the upcoming CJ ENM series “The Legend of Kitchen Soldier,” a military-set drama with a cooking twist that will premiere at Series Mania.\n\n\tPanelists said adaptation activity is accelerating as producers seek to translate Korean IP into English-language versions. Siljedahl noted that Fifth Season is currently developing multiple remakes and has selected the erotic revenge thriller “Eve” for adaptation in part because of its strong local and global performance.\n\n\tMin said CJ ENM’s strategy now extends beyond distribution toward producing Korean stories in multiple languages through partnerships with international companies.\n\n\tLooking ahead, panelists said the next stage of K-drama growth in Europe will be driven by closer collaboration between Korean producers and international companies. As Siljedahl said, “there are lots of exciting ways to work together,” including developing original concepts designed for global audiences from the outset.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHistorical drama “The King’s Warden” maintained the top position at the South Korean box office during the week of Feb. 16–22, which included the peak Lunar New Year holiday period. \n\n\tAccording to data from KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council, the film accounted for 73.76% of the revenue share during the three-day weekend portion of the holiday frame.\n\n\t“The King’s Warden” earned $9.5 million from 1,414,214 admissions over the weekend.

    "body": "\n\tDavid Ellison’s Paramount Skydance has a Monday deadline to submit its best and final offer for Warner Bros. Discovery — and Paramount is expected to come back with an offer above its previous $30/share bid for WBD, angling to outflank Netflix to win the deal.\n\n\tThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery, with the permission of Netflix, opened a seven-day window to talk with Paramount about an improved offer. That discussion period ends at 11:59 p.m. ET on Feb. 23, coming after teams from both companies worked over the weekend.\n\t\n\n\tParamount has declined to comment on its next move. Insiders tell Variety that Paramount’s revised offer for Warner Bros. Discovery will likely come in at $32/share.\n\n\n\tHow will Netflix respond? After Paramount submits a revised proposal, the streamer has four days to either come back with a matching offer — or exit the M&A drama.\n\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, in an interview Friday with Variety‘s Cynthia Littleton, declined to say how the streamer would respond to a higher offer from Paramount. But he did say that Netflix has a “rich history” of being “willing to walk away and let someone else overpay for things.”\n\n\t“The next move is up to somebody else. We have a signed deal with Warner Bros. Discovery,” Sarandos said in the Feb. 20 interview. “If someone wants to make a better deal, which the Warner Bros. Discovery board has said has not happened yet, then we’ll see what happens down the road. But let’s not get ahead of that process. And I certainly wouldn’t comment on the bidding strategy anyway. But the core of it is, you know, we’re super-disciplined buyers, as you probably know we have a reputation for such so that I’m willing to walk away and let someone else overpay for things. We have a rich history of that.”\n\t\n\n\tIf Warner Bros. Discovery agrees to accept Paramount Skydance’s higher offer, WBD will be on the hook to pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix. In its most recent proposed offer, Paramount has said it will foot the bill for that.\n\n\tOn Feb. 17, WBD said it was engaging in discussions with Paramount to “seek clarity” on its “best and final offer.” WBD wanted Paramount Skydance “to clarify your proposal, which we understand will include a WBD per share price higher than $31,” Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav and board chairman Samuel Di Piazza Jr. wrote in a letter sent to Paramount’s board.\n\n\tThe Warner Bros. Discovery board cited a communication from a “senior representative for PSKY” to an identified WBD board member that if the WBD board authorized M&A talks, Paramount “would agree to pay $31 per share and that the offer was not PSKY’s ‘best and final’ proposal.” In addition, WBD set March 20 for the special meeting of shareholders to vote on the Netflix deal — which the board at the time said it still recommended that investors vote for.\n\n\t“The question now becomes how high PSKY is willing to go — and whether Netflix will exercise its matching rights and increase its offer as well,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a Feb. 20 research note. “In short, we do expect PSKY to go to at least $32 per share to put the pressure back on NFLX to increase its bid likely to the $30 per share range.” He added that if Paramount Skydance “truly wants to win the bidding war with NFLX, we think it will take a bid in the range of $34 per share to avoid an ongoing debate over the value of Discovery’s Global Networks.”\n\n\tUnder Netflix’s current agreement with WBD, the streamer would buy Warner Bros.’s studios and streaming businesses for $27.75 per share. WBD shareholders would retain equity in Discovery Global, the company’s proposed spin-off entity house CNN, TBS and other linear networks.\n\n\tIf Netflix were to up its offer above $30/share, “we have difficulty making the accretion math work,” Fishman wrote. That’s factoring in incremental debt, “likely revenue cannibalization and necessary programming spend cuts needed.”\n\n\t“While we see the longer-term benefits of owning Warner Bros., HBO and HBO Max, we expect NFLX to walk away from the deal following a disciplined approach if PSKY pushes its bid well beyond $32 per share,” the MoffettNathanson analyst continued. “We think it will be difficult for PSKY to win the bidding war for WBD if it decides to take a less aggressive approach during this waiver period, giving NFLX the opportunity to match at a more modest increase from its current bid.”\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Donald Trump — after earlier this month saying he would not be involved in the review of the Netflix-WB pact — in a social media post Saturday demanded that Netflix “immediately fire” board member Susan Rice or else “pay the consequences.” Trump cited a tweet by far-right commentator Laura Loomer, who said Rice, who served as U.N. ambassador under Obama, was “threatening half of the country with weaponized government political retribution.” Loomer also bizarrely claimed that if Netflix is allowed to acquire Warner Bros., “positive messaging of the Democrats’ upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama and his anti-White racist wife Michelle would likely be blasted across all streaming services.”\n\n\tOn Monday, Sarandos addressed Trump’s comment. “He likes to do a lot of things on social media,” Sarandos said in a BBC Radio 4 interview. “This is a business deal. It’s not a political deal. This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the U.S. and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.”\n\n\tThe Justice Department in recent weeks has expanded its review of the proposed Netflix-WB agreement to examine whether the combined company would violate antitrust laws with respect to the market for entertainment programming. The DOJ’s Antitrust Division has sent inquiries to independent studios inquiring whether the Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. “may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act or Section 2 of the Sherman Act,” according to a copy of one of the letters reviewed by Variety.\n\n\tNetflix has argued that it does not have anything close to monopoly control over any market. In a statement to Bloomberg about the expanded DOJ probe, chief legal counsel David Hyman said, “Netflix operates in an extremely competitive market. Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolize, is unfounded. We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we’ll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.”\n\n\tOn Friday, Paramount said its proposed WBD takeover had cleared a milestone at the DOJ, after the expiration of the statutory waiting period following Paramount Skydance’s “certification of compliance” with the Justice Department’s second request for information under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act. Netflix’s Hyman accused Paramount of continuing to “mislead stockholders and distract from the facts,” saying that “routine HSR milestones do not signal DOJ approval nor that any decision has been made.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter winning the BAFTA Film Award for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer, “My Father’s Shadow” helmer Akinola Davies Jr. ended his speech by saying “free Palestine.” However, these words were then cut from his speech when the ceremony aired two hours later on the BBC.\n\n\tTowards the end of Davies Jr.’s speech during the taping of the awards — and in one of the only politically-charged moments of the show — he said: “To the economic migrant, the conflict migrant, those under occupation, dictatorship, persecution and those experiencing genocide, you matter and your stories matter more than ever. Your dreams are an act of resistance. To those watching at home, archive your loved ones, archive your stories yesterday, today and forever. For Nigeria, for London, Congo, Sudan, free Palestine. Thank you.”\n\t\n\n\tBut this part was entirely cut from the show’s broadcast on BBC One and iPlayer, with only the first section of Davies Jr.’s speech — in which he thanks his family and brother and co-screenwriter Wale Davies — making it to air. “My Father’s Shadow,” which was submitted as the U.K.’s official Oscar entry for best international feature, follows two brothers who attend a family reunion in Lagos during the 1993 Nigerian election and witness their father’s daily struggles.\n\n\n\tRepresentatives for the BBC and Davies Jr. did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\tThere are always cuts made to the BBC broadcast of the awards as the ceremony is edited from three hours down to two, but Davies Jr.’s “free Palestine” not airing sparked particular outrage as several outbursts during the taping — including the N-word — did. \n\t\n\n\tTourette’s advocate John Davidson — who inspired “I Swear,” which won star Robert Aramayo the best actor BAFTA — was in attendance at the ceremony, and the audience was warned of potential outbursts including strong language. However, when Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo took the stage to present the first award for special visual effects, he shouted the N-word, causing controversy.\n\n\tBAFTAs host Alan Cumming addressed this during the ceremony, saying: “You may have noticed some strong language in the background. This can be part of how Tourette’s syndrome shows up for some people as the film explores that experience. Thanks for your understanding and helping create a respectful space for everyone.”\n\n\tIn a second statement later on, Cumming added that “Tourette’s Syndrome is a disability and the tics you’ve heard tonight are involuntary, which means the person who has Tourette’s Syndrome has no control over their language. We apologize if you are offended tonight.”\n\n\tHowever, the moment — and the BBC’s decision to keep the N-word in the tape-delayed broadcast — resulted in widespread debate on social media, with disability advocates reminding viewers that Davidson has no control over the remarks, while others still deemed the airing of the racial slur unacceptable.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe BBC has apologized for not editing out a racial slur from the BAFTA Film Awards‘ tape-delayed broadcast and will now remove it from the version of the ceremony on iPlayer. \n\n\tThe outburst came from John Davidson, a Tourette syndrome campaigner who was seated in the audience during the ceremony and is himself the subject of the biopic “I Swear.” Davidson’s condition causes him to produce involuntary vocal tics, one of which — the N-word — occurred as actors Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo took the stage to hand out the prize for best visual effects, ultimately won by “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter pulling the BAFTA Film Awards from iPlayer early Monday afternoon, a BBC spokesperson said: “Some viewers may have heard strong and offensive language during the BAFTA Film Awards. This arose from involuntary verbal tics associated with Tourette syndrome, and as explained during the ceremony it was not intentional. We apologize that this was not edited out prior to broadcast and it will now be removed from the version on BBC iPlayer.”\n\n\n\tAlthough the remark was barely audible amid the noise of the ceremony, it was picked up in the BBC’s coverage. What drew particular scrutiny was the fact that the broadcast operated on a two-hour tape delay before airing on BBC One and iPlayer — a buffer that editors would ordinarily use to catch and remove exactly this kind of material.\n\n\tLast summer, the BBC faced a major controversy after airing a Glastonbury Festival performance by punk rap duo Bob Vylan, during which the band led the crowd in a “Death to the IDF” chant on a live iPlayer stream. The footage remained online for more than five hours before being pulled. The fallout prompted U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to demand answers from the BBC, and the corporation subsequently revised its livestreaming protocols in response.\n",

    "description": "\n\t“Sinners” production designer Hannah Beachler has said that Alan Cumming’s “throw away apology” over the N-word being shouted during the BAFTA Film ",
    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” production designer Hannah Beachler has said that Alan Cumming’s “throw away apology” over the N-word being shouted during the BAFTA Film Awards made the situation “worse.”\n\n\t“I keep trying to write about what happened at the BAFTAs, and I can’t find the words,” Beachler, who was nominated for an award, posted on X after the ceremony. “The situation is almost impossible, but it happened 3 times that night, and one of the three times was directed at myself on the way to dinner after the show.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued: “And a third time at a Black woman. I understand and deeply know why this is an impossible situation. I know we must handle this with grace and continue to push through. But what made the situation worse was the throw away apology of ‘if you were offended’ at the end of the show. Of course we were offended…but our frequency, our spiritual vibration is tuned to a higher level than what happened. I am not steal [sic], this did not bounce off of me, but I exist above it. It can’t take away from who I am as an artist.”\n\n\n\tBeachler was understood to be referring to a number of outbursts by Tourette’s campaigner John Davidson, whose life inspired the BAFTA-nominated biopic “I Swear.”\n\n\tAs well as shouting out the word “fuck” multiple times during speeches, including “shut the fuck up” during BAFTA chair Sara Putt’s introduction to the ceremony, he was also heard shouting the n-word when Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented “Avatar: Fire and Ash” with the award for best visual effects.\n\n\tBAFTAs host Alan Cumming made two statements about Davidson’s outburst during the ceremony, the first explaining that the “strong language in the background” can be a symptom of Tourette’s for some people and thanking the audience for their “understanding and helping create a respectful space for everyone.”\n\t\n\n\tHe later added: “Tourette’s Syndrome is a disability and the tics you’ve heard tonight are involuntary, which means the person who has Tourette’s Syndrome has no control over their language. We apologize if you are offended tonight.”\n\n\tDespite the ceremony airing with a two-hour delay on BBC One in the U.K. and E! in the U.S., the slur was not cut from the broadcast.\n\n\t“I Swear” went on to win a number of awards during the evening, including one for actor Robert Aramayo who beat out Jordan as well as Leonardo DiCaprio and Ethan Hawke to take home the leading man statue for his portrayal of Davidson, who was diagnosed with Tourette’s at the age of 25 after years of outbursts.\n\n\tBefore the ceremony began a floor manager, who addressed the audience to issue a number of notices regarding things such as fire safety protocol, flagged that Davidson was in the audience and that he has “Tourette’s Syndrome so please be aware you might hear some involuntary noises or movements during the ceremony.”\n\nI keep trying to write about what happened at the BAFTAs, and I can't find the words.  The situation is almost impossible, but it happened 3 times that night, and one of the three times was directed at myself on the way to dinner after the show.— HannahBeachler (@HannahEBeachler) February 23, 2026\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapan remains one of the world’s most insular television format markets, exporting globally successful unscripted hits while importing almost no foreign concepts, according to data presented by Virginia Mouseler, CEO of The WIT, during the “Fresh TV: Japan” session at Mip London.\n\n\tUsing the company’s real-time tracking database, Mouseler said Japan currently ranks as the world’s seventh-largest exporter of formats, “at the same level as South Korea,” even as it adapts very little international IP.\n\t\n\n\tWIT’s Top Formats tool showed Japanese-origin “Dragon’s Den” continuing to rank among the most widely adapted unscripted formats globally over the past year, alongside international hits including “The Floor,” “The A Talks” and “The Traitors.”\n\n\n\tAmong Japanese formats themselves, the most adapted unscripted titles over the past 12 months include “Dragon’s Den,” “LOL,” “Freeze” and the long-running game show “Run for Money,” highlighting the export strength of high-concept entertainment formats built around simple game mechanics.\n\n\tAt the same time, Japan remains highly resistant to importing foreign formats. According to WIT data, only two international formats were adapted locally over the past year, compared with none the year before.\n\n\tOne of those imports was the South Korean relationship competition “Wedding Wars,” based on CJ ENM’s “Wedding Fighters,” which premiered on streaming platform Abema in April. The other was a reboot of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” returning to Japanese television 26 years after its first local version.\n\t\n\n\tMouseler noted that Japan has “a long, long tradition of importing no formats,” with the country currently ranking 15th globally as a format importer.\n\n\tMuch local activity instead revolves around revivals and reinventions of homegrown IP, including the recent reboot of the classic game show “Challenges on Fire,” which returned three decades after its original run.\n\n\tThe presentation also highlighted a new generation of Japanese entertainment formats centered on visually driven physical mechanics and social-strategy gameplay, including hybrid deduction formats, endurance-based competition shows such as “Cash or Splash,” and Nippon TV’s rotating-stage challenge format “Turn” (“Mawase”), underscoring Japan’s continued focus on highly visual, easily exportable game concepts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis cannot be overstated: BAFTA and the BBC failed us all.\n\n\tDuring the 79th BAFTA Film Awards, host Alan Cumming paused the ceremony to thank the audience for its “understanding” after a series of audible outbursts from Tourette’s campaigner John Davidson interrupted the show.\n\n\tOne of those outbursts — heard while “Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were onstage — included the N-word.\n\n\n\tDavidson, who was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome at 25 and whose experiences inspired the BAFTA-nominated film “I Swear,” lives with tics that can include involuntary vocal outbursts. Addressing the room, Cumming said, “You may have noticed some strong language in the background there. This can be part of how Tourette syndrome shows up for some people, as the film explores that experience.”\n\t\n\n\tIf you felt uncomfortable watching it, you’re not alone. If you felt heartbroken, you’re not alone. If you felt angry, confused or unsure what to say, you’re not alone there, either.\n\n\tBut before declarations are made, before sides are chosen and hashtags are weaponized, a baseline point has to be stated plainly: The primary failure here rests with BAFTA and the BBC.\n\n\tThis was a tape-delayed broadcast. They still allowed the slur to air, unfiltered, and then let the moment circulate as a clip — stripped of context and primed for outrage. That decision poured gasoline on an already volatile situation.\n\n\tBut you know what they did manage to cut out of the broadcast? Akinola Davies Jr. saying “Free Palestine” during his speech for winning outstanding British debut for “My Father’s Shadow.”\n\t\n\n\tIn an Instagram clip shared by BBC News of Paul Thomas Anderson’s best director speech for “One Battle After Another,” he says “anyone that says movies aren’t any good anymore can just piss right off,” with “piss” bleeped out for social media. The clip that was shared on the BAFTA and BBC YouTube pages removed the sentence entirely.\n\n\tHow does that measure up? How can the N-word go out freely without consequence?\n\n\tA BBC spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News: “Some viewers may have heard strong and offensive language during the BAFTA Film Awards 2026. This arose from involuntary verbal tics associated with Tourette syndrome, and was not intentional. We apologize for any offense caused by the language heard.”\n\n\tNBC News also reported that the broadcast that aired in the U.S. on E! did not appear to bleep the slur out either.\n\n\tBBC, BAFTA and Versant have not immediately responded to Variety‘s requests for comment.\n\n\tAs a father raising a child with disabilities — a kid who can sometimes script language from videos he’s watched — what I saw unfold is the situation that parents like me fear most. We want our children included in spaces considered “normal,” especially when their lived experience is being honored on a stage like this — when a story that reflects them is nominated and celebrated. But when involuntary behavior is handled carelessly, it deepens isolation, the shame they feel and the sense of being othered.\n\n\tThis is where education matters.\n\n\tCoprolalia is an involuntary, tic-like outburst of obscene, taboo or socially inappropriate words and phrases. It affects a minority of individuals with Tourette syndrome. Estimates vary widely, but when it happens, it is not a conscious choice. It is not intentional — an ideology or an endorsement. It is a neurological event.\n\n\tPrior to the start of the ceremony, floor managers warned guests and attendees sitting around Davidson of his condition, without specifying what kinds of outbursts they might hear. According to multiple sources, none of the nominees or attendees were contacted by BAFTA or BBC ahead of the show with any such warnings.\n\n\tBut I’m not only a father. I’m also a Black and Puerto Rican man living in this world. The N-word is not merely “strong language.” It is a brutal slur tied to enslavement, violence and dehumanization, and it is still weaponized today. For Black artists — particularly the two Black actors standing on a global stage — hearing it in that setting, and then watching it be broadcast into homes, turned into a meme and shared on social media, carries a weight that does not disappear simply because the source lacked intent.\n\t\n\n\tBoth realities can coexist.\n\n\tThe world needs more understanding of Tourette’s and neurological differences. It needs compassion and patience. But accommodation does not mean the absence of guardrails. You can create space for people with disabilities while also building systems that protect them and everyone around them.\n\n\tThat’s where BAFTA and the BBC failed.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Davidson and Robert Aramayo from “I Swear.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAurore Marechal/Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe responsibility was not on Davidson. It was not on Jordan. It was not on Lindo. It was not on the audience that was left frozen in discomfort. And it’s not on the people on social media who watched the 11-second clip and came to a conclusion.\n\n\tIt is on the institutions that produced and broadcast the ceremony.\n\n\tWith a tape delay, this moment could have been handled differently. The audio could have been muted in the broadcast. The segment could have been edited. A producer could have made a real-time call that prioritized harm reduction. Instead, the slur went out. And now it lives online — free to be clipped, circulated, divorced from explanation and used as shorthand outrage. Or worse, it can be used to spread hate.\n\n\tThat decision harmed in multiple ways.\n\n\tIt disrespected Jordan and Lindo, who were forced to absorb the ugliest word in Black history in front of a crowd and cameras. It exposed Davidson — and, by extension, the Tourette’s community — to a tidal wave of backlash rooted in misunderstanding. It handed bad-faith actors a weapon to swing at both Black viewers and disabled people.\n\n\tThese institutions are supposed to anticipate this type of complexity. Awards shows employ producers and compliance teams because unpredictability is part of live television. When unpredictability intersects with race, disability and trauma, preparation is essential.\n\n\tWhat makes it especially painful is that “I Swear” exists, in part, to educate audiences about Tourette’s. The irony is crushing that a film intended to foster understanding is now tethered to a viral controversy. The painful moment that emerged on Sunday required more than a brief, gracious clarification from BAFTA host Cumming.\n\n\tAnd the public’s comments have revealed something else: People are speaking with certainty about conditions they do not understand. Disability advocacy demands empathy, and racial history demands reverence. These are not competing values, and we don’t have to choose one over another to exist. They are coexisting obligations.\n\t\n\n\tThe path forward is not for us to hunt for a villain. It’s to demand that our institutions do better. Edit responsibly, prepare thoughtfully, protect proactively and educate consistently. Michael B. Jordan, Delroy Lindo, John Davidson, the Tourette’s community and Black people deserved better.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTed Sarandos has brushed off Donald Trump‘s social media demand that Netflix fire board member Susan Rice, saying the streamer’s bid for Warner Bros. Discovery is a business matter and not a political one.\n\n\t“He likes to do a lot of things on social media,” the Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer told BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program Monday morning when host Amol Rajan asked him to respond to the president’s intervention. Sarandos added: “This is a business deal. It’s not a political deal. This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the U.S. and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.”\n\t\n\n\tThe remarks came after Trump on Saturday reshared a post by MAGA influencer Laura Loomer calling on him to kill the Netflix-Warner deal, adding that “Netflix should fire racist Trump deranged Susan Rice immediately, or pay the consequences.” Rice, a former Obama administration diplomat, currently sits on the Netflix board.\n\n\n\tSarandos was speaking in London the morning after the BAFTA Film Awards, which he attended, and ahead of a visit to the National Film and Television School, where Netflix is announcing a fresh donation. The streamer has around 320 million subscribers globally, with nearly 20 million in the U.K. alone.\n\n\tThe interview came at a pivotal moment in the contest for Warner Bros. Discovery. Netflix tabled an $83 billion bid for the company’s streaming assets on Dec. 5. Three days later, Paramount — led by David Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison — launched a hostile rival bid for the entire company at $108 billion. The Warner Bros. Discovery board has repeatedly stated its preference for the Netflix offer, but gave Paramount until later Monday to table a best and final bid.\n\t\n\n\tSarandos made the case for the Netflix deal in blunt terms. “Our deal is growth,” he said, noting the company has spent $6 billion on original programming in the U.K. since 2020 and created 50,000 jobs there. He characterized the Paramount approach as “the classic horizontal media mergers that are always bad for consumers, always bad for creators,” warning that if Paramount’s bid succeeded, Hollywood’s five major studios would be reduced to four. He also noted that Paramount has committed to cutting $6 billion from the business immediately after a deal closes, with an additional $16 billion in cuts needed to delever. “You look at that and think, ‘Wow, this industry will be much smaller under that ownership than it would be under Netflix ownership,'” he said.\n\n\tAsked by Rajan about the argument he made to Trump for the Netflix deal, Sarandos pointed to its growth credentials. “This is a vertical merger. We’re buying assets that we don’t currently have — a movie studio and a distribution entity,” he said, emphasizing that Netflix would be adding to the market rather than shrinking it.\n\n\tHe also weighed in on the role of sovereign wealth funds in the Paramount consortium, which previously included Jared Kushner. Asked whether it was wrong for foreign governments to hold a financial stake in news networks, Sarandos said: “I think it’s a bad idea, typically.” He noted that some of the Gulf states involved “are not very big on the First Amendment” and said the suggestion that they would exercise no editorial influence over CNN and CBS “seems very odd to me, with the level of investment that we’re talking about.”\n\n\tOn filmmaker James Cameron, who wrote to the chair of the Senate antitrust subcommittee warning that a Netflix acquisition would be “disastrous for the theatrical motion picture business,” Sarandos said he found the intervention “disingenuous.” He said he personally met with Cameron on Dec. 20 and discussed Netflix’s commitment to 45-day theatrical exclusivity for Warner Bros. films. “We spent five minutes of our conversation on that, and we talked mostly about these glasses that he’s developing for Meta to watch movies at home,” Sarandos said. He argued that the average Netflix member watches seven movies a month, compared with the average American’s two cinema visits a year. “If more people see movies, the better, deeper, richer relationship they have with movies,” he said. “I don’t lose any business to the movie theaters.”\n\t\n\n\tSarandos pushed back on claims that Netflix crowds out homegrown British television, noting the streamer currently has 59 productions under way in the U.K., of which only around 17 are non-British projects. Asked pointedly whether Netflix would ever have made ITV’s “Mr. Bates vs the Post Office,” he replied without hesitation: “I would have made it in a heartbeat. I’m shocked that people use that example.”\n\n\tOn a parliamentary committee proposal that major streamers contribute 5% of their U.K. subscriber revenue to a cultural fund for British-focused drama, Sarandos was skeptical. “Incentive works much better than obligation,” he said, arguing that the U.K. had benefited greatly from production incentives and that adding obligations could undermine those economic gains.\n\n\tSarandos identified YouTube as a major competitive force, noting the platform accounts for close to 9% of all television viewing time in the U.K., with 55% of YouTube watching now taking place on TV sets. “That’s a zero sum game — the time that you spend on a connected TV, if you’re watching one app, you’re not watching broadcast, you’re not watching BBC, you’re not watching ITV and you’re not watching any other streaming service, including Netflix,” he said, adding that studios and broadcasters continuing to supply YouTube with free programming while it grows at their expense struck him as counterproductive.\n\n\tOn podcasts, Sarandos described them as a natural evolution of the late-night chat show. “It’s the new generation of chat shows, where you don’t have to make one show that appeals to everybody,” he said, pointing to their lower production costs and more specialized audiences as part of a broader diversification of the entertainment landscape.\n\n\tListen to Sarandos’ full interview on BBC Radio 4’s “Today” here.\n",

The dangerous figure they’re still running from is a looming threat, however. A propulsive psychological thriller, exploring predatory male behaviour, family and the unbreakable bond between a mother and daughter, says All3Media. Two Brothers Pictures, behind “The Tourist” and now “Assassins,” produce the six-part series for Channel 4, created and co-directed by Haggard and also starring Tobias Menzies (“The Crown”), Harriet Walter (“Succession”) and Tom Courtenay (“Unforgotten”). \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCareless\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Careless” \n\n\tInterrogating power, intimacy, trust and generational divides, says All3Media, a character-driven thriller promising top-notch performances from stars Solly McLeod (“House of the Dragon”), Robyn Malcolm (“After the Party”) and Richard Roxburgh (“Rake”). McLeod plays a Scottish backpacker in Australia’s Sydney determining to become carer for bad boy rock’n’roll legend Mike. He gets the gig but may place Mike (Roxburgh) and wife Angela (Malcolm) in grave danger. Made for Australia’s Stan and the U.K’s Channel 4 and created by Helen Fitzgerald (“The Cry”) and Louise Fox (“Broadchurch”) for Easy Tiger Productions (“Colin From Accounts”) and “The Tattoo of Auschwitz” maker Synchronicity Films.\n\n\t“Counsels” \n\n\tFrom “Skins” co-creator Bryan Elsley and Gillian McCormack, a Glasgow-set BBC legal drama, part of the Beeb’s biggest recent single recent investment in drama in Scotland, catching young hotshot law students as they choose their different career paths, whether public prosectors, big business counsels or pro bono lawyers. “As they face their biggest professional challenges yet and their relationships are tested to destruction, now’s the time things are going to catch fire,” says All3Media Intl. A newer and younger-gen way into legal drama, from Balloon Ent., with ZDF on board as an early anchor co-production partner.    \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Morrissey in Gone\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Gone” \n\n\tThe latest from “Lupin” creator George Kay with a long prestige C.V., taking in Apple TV hit “Hijack.” When his wife disappears, the reputation of Michael Polly (David Morrissey), until then a highly respected headmaster of an elite high-school, begins to fall apart. As Detective Annie Cassidy (Eve Myles, “Keeping the Faith”) investigates, “Gone” lifts off as a high-stakes cat and mouse between the hard-charging Cassidy and Polly, who likes to keep his own counsel. Bound for ITV and ITVX for a March bow, a “story about privilege and prejudice,” says Kay. “The truth is tantalisingly close. Or at least, that’s what Annie thinks,” he teases. Kay’s Observatory Pictures, backed by All3Media, produces with New Pictures.  \n\t\n\n\t“Saviour”\n\n\tLed by Aidan Gillen (“Game of Thrones”), Anjli Mohindra (“Bodyguard”), and Shaun Parkes (“Mangrove”), Ben, a medical student gets into an altercation resulting in a man’s death.

Set in the new Cold War it has Arterton’s Kate Henderson racing against time to expose a top British politician who may have been turned by the Russians. Produced by Potboiler for ITV. Cast also includes Rafe Spall, Mark Stanley, Alex Kingston, Roger Allam, Amaka Okafur and Khalid Abdalla.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBabies.

Produced by Snowed-In Productions and The Money Men Studios, “Babies” “has everything we love about Stefan Golaszewski’s work – a tender, authentic, emotional and human look at couples navigating a time in their lives that is rarely covered on television,”  BBC Drama Director Lindsay Salt has said.  \n\n\tUnscripted Lineup \n\n\tAnnounced earlier in February, All3Media’s 50-hour of unscripted programming lineup is powered by celebrity-led headline docuseries on Taylor Swift and Michael Jackson. These are other highlights:   \n\n\t“Michael Jackson: The Trial”\n\t\n\n\tBowing on Channel 4 on Feb. 4 the four-episode story of Jackson’s 2005 trial for the alleged sexual molestation of a young boy, Gavin Arvizo. “Channel 4’s latest series triumphs in collating accounts from both sides, plus featuring unheard-before recordings of Jackson from 2000 and 2001,” The Guardian said in its four-star review, calling the doc-series “troubling.” “If you told me right now … ‘Michael, you could never see another child’ … I would kill myself,” Jackson says in one audio-clip. “Against the backdrop of the upcoming release of a biopic sponsored by the Jackson estate, the series ultimately asks: Can the King of Pop ever be cancelled?” All3Media Intl. asks.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Swift \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\timago images/UPI Photo\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Taylor Swift: A Love Story”\n\n\tPicking up in its title on one of Swift’s early breakout songs, “the story of the world’s biggest pop star through the loves that shaped her, her bold reinvention of pop stardom and the heartbreaks that fuelled an unprecedented cultural phenomenon” as she “transformed the diary of her life into the soundtrack of a generation”: All3Media Intl.’s take. An unseen one-hour special, brand new at the London TV Screenings and again from Lion TV.\n\n\t“2.6 Seconds”  \n\n\tA four-hour true crime series unspooling in Yuendumu in Australia’s central desert. Kumanjayi Walker, 18, from the Warlpiri Luritja people, is shot and killed by Zachary Rolfe, 27, a police officer. Three shots, less than three seconds apart. “Intimate, forensic and unflinching,” says All3Media, the series traces the collision of two lives, two families, and two profoundly different ideas of justice, it adds. Produced by Blackfella Films, written and produced by Darren Dale (“The Australian Wars,” “Meet the Neighbours”) and co-commissioned by SBS and NITV  with a major production investment from Screen Australia’s First Nations Department.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The Lost Kingdom of Arabia”\n\n\tFrom Lion TV, behind “Pompeii: The New Dig,” a doc-feature on one of history’s forgotten powers the story of Ghassan, a Christian-Arab kingdom and Roman Empire buffer state between Rome and emerging superpower Persia, its civilization peaking in the second half of the sixth century. Shot across sweeping locations with Lion TV’s trademark epic-toned storytelling, All3Media notes, the series depicts Ghassan’s cultural brilliance and sudden disappearance.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re excited to unveil an unmissable new unscripted slate. Celebrity driven documentaries of the highest caliber (‘Michael Jackson: The Trial’ and ‘Taylor Swift: A Love Story’) join sweeping historical epic ‘Lost Kingdom of Arabia’ and timely true crime series ‘2.6 Seconds.’ These are bold, premium titles designed to resonate with audiences worldwide,” said Pedersen. \n\n\t“These shows sit within a wider unscripted offering that spans high-impact true crime from leading producers including DSP, Lightbox and Candor, projects fronted by fast-rising talent such as Olivia Attwood, and series led by much-loved figures like the world’s favorite gardener Monty Don. And global reality phenomenon ‘The Traitors’ continues to find faithful partners and go from strength to strength.”\n\n\tIndeed, IDTV’s global format hit “The Traitors” has now hit a 40 territory commission milestone with Indonesia becoming the latest market to adapt the psychological reality competition.\n",

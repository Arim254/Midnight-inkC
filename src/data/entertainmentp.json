    "body": "\n\tSorry, Hellfire Club enthusiasts — Joseph Quinn‘s Eddie Munson won’t be coming back from the dead in “Stranger Things” Season 5. \n\n\tThe Duffer Brothers confirmed in a new interview with Empire that despite rumors swirling, Munson’s story ended in the show’s fourth season. The actor — who broke out in “Stranger Things” and went on to star in “Gladiator II” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” — played it coy at a recent fan convention in Belgium, saying “I do know, but I’m not telling you” (via ScreenRant) when asked if his character could make a return. \n\t\n\n\t“I love that Joe Quinn is toying with people! But no, he’s dead,” Matt Duffer told Empire. “Joe is so busy anyway, that everyone should know he’s not coming back. He’s shot like five movies since! When the hell has he got time to come and shoot ‘Stranger Things’? No, sadly, RIP. He’s fully under that ground.”\n\n\n\tHowever, the final season of “Stranger Things” will have some new Hawkins residents, including “Terminator” star Linda Hamilton, who plays a government agent hunting down Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown). \n\n\t“She’s hyper-intelligent and intimidating,” Matt Duffer said in the Empire interview. “She’s a scientist but if she needs to, she can get into a fight and shoot a gun.” \n\n\tThe Duffer Brothers recently teased the show’s epic finale in a wide-ranging cover story with Variety, with Matt saying: “We do every last remaining thing we wanted to do with the Demogorgons and Mind Flayer and Vecna and the Upside Down and Hawkins and these characters. This is a complete story. It’s done.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t Marco Giordani, CFO of Berlusconi family-backed MFE-MediaForEurope, has been appointed  new CEO of Germany’s ProSiebenSat.1, succeeding Bert Habets in a management shakeup at the German broadcasting giant.\n\n\tHabets, who is a former RTL Group CEO, had been named boss of ProSiebenSat.1 in 2022. He has now stepped down after MFE in September closed a takeover bid for ProSieben, securing a 75.1% stake in the Munich-based company in a deal worth € 1.8 billion ($2.11 billion).\n\t\n\n\t“Bert Habets is handing over his role as CEO to Marco Giordani in best mutual consent and will take on the role of senior advisor to ProSiebenSat.1 with a particular focus on a seamless transition period until the end of the year,” a ProSiebenSat.1 statement said.\n\n\n\tBob Rajan, a managing director at equity investment firm Alvarez & Marsal, is being appointed interim chief financial officer with Markus Breitenecker, a 30-year veteran of the company, stepping down as chief operating officer.\n\n\tAccording to research firm Enders Analysis, the Prosieben takeover is turning MFE into Europe’s biggest free-to-air broadcasting operator, with revenues of 6.8 billion euros ($7.92 billion). As well as its German business, ProSiebenSat.1 also operates in Austria and Switzerland, while MFE runs TV operations in Italy and Spain. \n\n\tThe management changes “underscore commitment to accelerate the strategic transformation of ProSiebenSat.1,” according to the statement. MFE is now implementing its plan to integrate the German media company into its existing business.\n\n\t“We warmly welcome Marco Giordani as CEO of ProSiebenSat.1,” said Maria Kyriacou, chairwoman of  ProSiebenSat.1’s supervisory board, in a statement. “His appointment reflects the ambition to further accelerate the strategic transformation with a clear focus on excellence and a leading market position in entertainment,” she added. \n\t\n\n\t“I would like to express our sincere gratitude to Bert Habets for his leadership and strong commitment during a decisive transformative period for ProSiebenSat.1. He has been the driving force behind our strategic shift towards entertainment,” Kyriacou went on to point out.\n\n\tGiordani has served as CFO of MFE since 2000, where he was played a key role in driving the Berlusconi family group’s expansion strategy. Prior to his role as MFE CFO Giordani held senior leadership roles at Berlusconi’s Mediaset. He will continue to serve as MFE CFO. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector Byun Sung-hyun‘s Netflix film “Good News,” a black comedy inspired by a real ’70s hijacking incident that spans Japan, South Korea and North Korea, marks the filmmaker’s fourth collaboration with acclaimed actor Sul Kyung-gu.\n\n\tThe film, produced by Star Platinum, dramatizes a 1970 incident in which a communist group hijacked a passenger plane and diverted it to Pyongyang. The story follows a mysterious fixer known only as “Nobody” (Sul) who orchestrates a covert operation to bring the plane to safety, working under Park Sang-hyeon (Ryoo Seung-bum), director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Hong Kyung stars as Seo Go-myung, an elite Air Force lieutenant unwittingly drawn into the mission to “double hijack” the plane from the ground. The ensemble cast also includes Takayuki Yamada, Kippei Shiina, Kim Seung-o, Show Kasamatsu and Nairu Yamamoto.\n\t\n\n\tFor Byun, the project represented a deliberate pivot after his 2023 Netflix action thriller “Kill Boksoon.” “I wanted to take on a black comedy, so I began looking into real-life incidents that might suit the genre,” the director tells Variety. “When I first came across this incident on a television program a few years ago, I assumed it would one day be adapted into a film — although I never imagined I would be the one to make it.”\n\n\n\tWhen crafting the story, the director decided to keep the known facts intact while fictionalizing the behind-the-scenes dynamics. “In my research, I was careful about the aspects of the case that are publicly known — the surface of the story,” he explains. “But the unknown internal dynamics, which also resonate with the theme of the film, is where I brought in fiction. In other words, while the outcome of the incident remains non-fiction, I fictionalized the course of events leading up to it.”\n\t\n\n\t“Good News” is structured into five distinct chapters. “As the tone shifts slightly throughout the story, I thought a chapter-based structure would be the best way to manage these changes,” Byun says. “Otherwise, the atmosphere of the film might have felt uneven.” \n\n\t“When I was working on the script, I didn’t finish the story first and then divide it into chapters — instead, I relied on a chapter structure from the very beginning,” the director notes. “I approached it from the start with the intention of giving each chapter its own distinct tone.”\n\n\tUnlike traditional hijacking thrillers that lean heavily on suspense, Byun chose to focus on human behavior under pressure. “I didn’t necessarily intend for the audience to take away any specific message from the film. It was more about my own ambition as a filmmaker to do something different,” he says.\n\n\tWorking with Sul for the fourth time after “The Merciless,” “Kingmaker” and “Kill Boksoon” presented a unique challenge for Byun. “After working with the same actor on three films in a row, you’ve inevitably made use of much of what he has to offer,” he admits. “So I kept thinking about what different aspects of him I could still explore.”\n\n\tThe solution came from revisiting Sul’s earlier work, particularly Lee Chang-dong’s 2002 masterpiece “Oasis.” “For Nobody, I wanted him to embody the idea of a man deliberately taking on the role of his character in Oasis, as if the character is acting,” Byun explains. “As a result, his performance feels a bit more theatrical and heightened than his usual tone. But at the same time, I tried to capture the fleeting, genuine moments that reveal the true side of Nobody.”\n\n\tThough set during a politically charged moment in Cold War history, Byun believes the film speaks to current geopolitical tensions. “I think the current situation is still more or less similar,” he says. “Even after 50 years, I felt that this story could still resonate today, because the core dynamics haven’t changed all that much.”\n\n\t“In a way, this film is similar to ‘Kingmaker,’ as I was tackling a genre that I had always wanted as a director,” Byun says. He distinguishes “Good News” from “Kill Boksoon,” which he took on primarily to work with star Jeon Do-yeon. “I don’t usually prefer action films — to be honest, I rarely even watch them,” he confesses.\n\t\n\n\t“Political noir is challenging, but I personally believe black comedy is an even more difficult genre to handle,” Byun adds. “It was quite a challenge, but I was determined to do justice to this film.”\n\n\tByun now plans to move on to different genres. “I probably won’t make another black comedy for at least 10 years because I’ve gained enough personal satisfaction from this one,” he says. “It feels like I’ve cleared a hurdle I set for myself, so I think I’ll explore a different genre in the future.” However, fans can expect his signature touch to remain. “I believe a certain kind of humor, especially the ironic kind, will always be present in my films, no matter the genre,” he adds.\n\n\t“Good News,” which premiered at the Busan International Film Festival, is streaming now on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe psycho thriller “Lex Julia” by Finland’s Laura Hyppönen (“Live East Die Young”) and fantasy drama “Dice-Ching-o-Mat” by Lithuania’s Kristijonas Vildžiūnas, who was selected for Cannes Un Certain Regard with “You Am I” have both been selected for the Works in Progress session of the Industry @Tallinn & Baltic Event.\n\n\tAlso among its buzzy titles is “Superbuhei,” the directorial debut of German production designer Josef Grandl who has worked with Wes Anderson and Steve Spielberg.\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s slate of 18 projects from 12 countries, split between the International Works in Progress, Baltic Event Works in Progress and Just Film Works in Progress, will be pitched Nov. 20 and 21 at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival’s Industry event.\n\n\n\tBeyond the solid Baltic lineup, Spanish-language projects will weigh in heavily via the festival’s Focus on Catalonia and growing submissions from Latin America. “We could almost have created a full Spanish-language works in progress lineup” claimed Trinn Tramberg, curator of the international section, who shortlisted eight titles out of 80 submissions and even re-directed a few Spanish-lingo picks to the Just Film section for kids and youth.\n\n\tTurning on the Catalan spotlight, Tramberg said she is particularly thrilled to welcome back high-profile producer Alba Sotorra whose earlier feature “Upon Entry” “first bowed in Tallinn in 2022 before making an international fest and distribution splash and securing three Independent Spirit Award nominations.\n\n\tSotorra’ new project “Wolf Grrrls””(“Salen las lobas”) is a realistic teen drama by newcomer Claudia Estrada Tarascó.\n\t\n\n\tTramberg also underscored the importance of including films from Ukraine – “Kira’s Dream” and “Crickets Sing in the Rye” – “to showcase their incredible resilience and to support filmmakers creating under extremely challenging circumstances.”\n\n\tGiven the large number of Latin American submissions, the international section curator said “it felt essential to include something from that region as well, and “Prince” really stood out. The remaining projects were chosen for the strength of their storytelling, their visual style and the unique voices they bring to the screen,” she told Variety.\n\n\tCommenting on the Baltic Event slate, curator Helen Räim said she was glad to see that seven of the 13 submitted projects from the Baltics and Finland were co-productions with Estonia. “It’s been a really busy year in all Baltic countries,” she observed.\n\n\tAmong the six selected titles, two of them -“Rahma “and “Lex Julia” were showcased at the Baltic Event’s Co-Production Markets 2023 and 2021 respectively, while Latvia’s “Kingpins,” by first-timer Kristians Riekstiņš, won Tallinn’s Script Pool competition 2024.\n\n\tRäim said that “Kingpins” and “Mo Hunt,” the latest pic by Eeva Mägi, both “embody the spirit of independent cinema, embracing the ongoing journey of finding one’s creative voice.” Another example of new Estonian talent to watch, Evar Anvelt, will pitch the thriller “Something Real” “which looks into the darker side of human existence.”\n\n\tWhile “Kingpins,””Something Real” and “Lex Julia” by Finland’s Laura Hyppönen “observe and investigate complex human relationships,” according to Räim, “Dice-Ching-O-Mat” by high-profile Lithuanian filmmaker Vildžiūnas will look deeper into a person’s mind “by raising universal questions such as how do we truly relate to those closest to us and could we do more?” The pic is produced by the heavyweight auteur-driven Studio Uljana Kim.\n\n\tIn a much lighter tone, the musical dramedy “Wedding Day,” by Latvia’s Marta Elīna Martinsone (“Lame-o’s”), will “blend raw realism with poetic musicality, a rare combination in the [Baltic] region,” according to Räim.\n\n\tAs for the four projects in the Just Film section for kids and youth, “Morten,” “Office of Magical Forces,””Tanit” and “Switzerland,” all are youth-oriented coming of age stories focusing on “young protagonists navigating extraordinary challenges in their own environments,” said curator Kärt Väinola.\n\t\n\n\tAt press time, the Just Film Works in Progress slate was still to be finalised.\n\n\tThe Baltic Event and International works in progress will vie for the €7,000 ($8,100) prize partly sponsored by Prague-based Studio Beep post-production banner, and the Just Film projects for the €1,000 ($1,100) Prize.\n\n\tFull rundown of International Works in Progress:\n\n\t“The Convulsions,” (“Les éclats,” David Gutiérrez, France/Spain)Produced by Imy Productions, Bapla Films, Auca Films, Cinètica Produccions, Timber FilmsA psychological drama starring Inès Fehner, Tom Weyn, Lizalou Weyn and Eïwa Roussel.

    "description": "\n\tIn much of the world, children’s cinema still struggles for recognition, too often dismissed as educational side programming rather than an artistic",
    "body": "\n\tIn much of the world, children’s cinema still struggles for recognition, too often dismissed as educational side programming rather than an artistic or commercial force. The Sharjah Intl. Children’s Film Festival, which recently closed its 12th edition (Oct. 6-12), makes a compelling counterargument. The festival has evolved from a regional showcase into a gathering point for a growing international movement, one that sees children not just as viewers, but as participants, critics, and creators.\n\t\n\n\tAcross a week of screenings, workshops, and cross-cultural exchanges, SIFF reaffirmed that youth storytelling isn’t a niche, but a laboratory for empathy, creativity and imagination.\n\n\n\tHere are five takeaways from this year’s festival.\n\n\tJunior Jurors: When Kids Become the CriticsSIFF’s junior jurors continue to embody the festival’s founding idea: that film education begins not only in classrooms, but in conversation. For many participants, the experience was transformative.\n\n\tFourteen-year-old Yukhti Sharma called the role “a privilege that makes you see how films actually work, from the pacing, to the angles, to the emotion.” Fellow juror Hawraa Yaser reflected that it taught her “young people can make a difference in how stories are told,” while Amal Abdulaziz Alabdouli observed that she now watches movies “for symbolism, rhythm, and how music changes mood.”\n\n\tTheir comments reflect how the program reframes spectatorship as authorship. By inviting children to deliberate, argue, and choose winners, SIFF is essentially teaching media literacy as a creative discipline, cultivating audiences who interpret film critically, not passively.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a form of empowerment: to trust children with taste, not just entertainment.\n\n\tGlobal Connect: Children’s Cinema Finds Its VoiceOne of the most striking through-lines at this year’s SIFF wasn’t on screen but in panel rooms like the Global Children and Youth Film Congress, where festival directors from around the world compared notes on the triumphs and challenges in sustaining children’s cinema.\n\n\tFrom Johannesburg, Firdoze Bulbulia, founder of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Film Festival, reminded peers “children are the most important investment any society can make. Their minds are open, curious, full of possibility –– not yet jaded by cynicism.” Too often, she noted, “the broader industry overlooks this space because it doesn’t promise immediate commercial returns. But the real value lies in shaping how young audiences see the world and each other.” Through initiatives like the Africa Charter on Children’s Broadcasting, Bulbulia has spent decades turning that conviction into policy: that children’s media is not charity or pedagogy but a civic right.\n\n\tRalm Lee, director of South Korea’s Busan Intl. Kids and Youth Film Festival, takes a scientific approach. BIKY partners with filmmakers, educators, scientists and local corporations to study how stories influence empathy and cognitive development. “Children’s cinema isn’t a side genre, it’s where the future of storytelling begins,” she explained. “Once people witness the impact, like a child making their first film, or an audience discussion that changes how adults see the world, it’s impossible to dismiss this field as ‘small.’”\n\n\tIndia’s Shruti Rai, who heads the Chinh India Kids Film Festival, echoes that belief through her Chinh Media Literacy program, which trains schoolchildren to make films of their own. Chinh was also the first festival in the world to introduce a pre-K jury, in which children aged three to seven evaluate films made for their age group, an audacious act of trust that redefines what “youth participation” could mean. “We’re not waiting for adults to make films for children,” Rai emphasized. “We’re teaching children to build their own cinematic universe. We’re sowing seeds that take years to grow, but they’re growing.”\n\t\n\n\tTogether, these directors and many others present at SIFF form an emerging network with shared goals, steeped in education, access and storytelling itself. Sharjah’s role is less about leading than connecting, bringing voices from across the globe into the same conversation about what children’s cinema can be.\n\n\tInfrastructure as Vision: Sharjah Builds a Creative EcosystemSIFF’s growth is part of a broader creative vision taking shape across the emirate of Sharjah. Sharjah Media City (also known as Shams), a key partner of the festival, has rolled out new production spaces, digital media programs, and talent incubators designed to turn cultural investment into long-term industry infrastructure. The synergy with SIFF isn’t structural, the two entities operate separately, but philosophical: both see youth and creativity as long-term infrastructure.\n\n\tSIFF director Sheikha Jawaher bint Abdullah Al Qasimi has often described the festival as a bridge between education and industry, a place where imagination becomes a professional pathway. With Shams expanding the technical side of that equation, Sharjah is effectively creating an ecosystem where storytelling and entrepreneurship reinforce each other.\n\n\tIn an era when “creative economy” has become a global buzzword, Sharjah’s approach feels unusually grounded. Its bet on culture isn’t a branding exercise, but a sustainable public and civic investment.\n\n\tInvesting Locally: Emirati Voices Step Into the SpotlightFor the young Emirati filmmakers premiering at or indeed returning to SIFF, that infrastructure can’t come soon enough. Fatimah Alshamsi described the current moment as one of possibility but also fragility. “Real support begins when the festival ends,” she explained. “We need labs, grants, and mentorship that let us grow between festivals and connect with patrons who believe in a homegrown scene.”\n\n\tHer film, “Wa’ad,” which was part of the Arabic Short Films section and warmly received by audiences, reminded her that the next phase of Emirati cinema begins with its youngest viewers. “The kids in my screening weren’t shy,” she recalled. “They gasped, laughed, and even scolded the characters. It showed me our stories don’t need external validation. They can grow from how our children see themselves.”\n\t\n\n\tFilmmaker Ali Fuad, who took home top honors in the Documentary section for “Guardians of the Mountains,” views storytelling as preservation. “Someone once told me we have nothing to show our children about our past,” he reflected. “That sense of responsibility drives me.” Fuad hopes to bring Emirati history to global audiences “in its authentic form, not as stereotype, but as memory.”\n\n\tTogether, these filmmakers embody Sharjah’s wager: that by investing in local creators early, the emirate can build a film culture that is both exportable and deeply rooted.\n\n\tDigital Futures: Expanding Access Through TechnologyIf SIFF’s soul lies in tradition, its gaze is firmly on the future. This year’s edition showcased AI-assisted editing, mobile filmmaking, and digital-post workshops, encouraging participants to write, shoot, and cut shorts right on their own devices.\n\n\tThe initiative is less about novelty than access. In a region where film schools remain scarce, smartphones have become entry-level studios, tools of both creation and inclusion.\n\n\tFestival director Sheikha Jawaher bint Abdullah Al Qasimi called it “a future where every child with a story and a smartphone can become a filmmaker.” That ethos reframes technology as a way to democratize creativity without diluting it.\n\n\tBy embracing mobile and AI tools, SIFF isn’t chasing trends but dismantling barriers, turning digital literacy into artistic agency. In a space where stories once required institutions, the next generation is learning to build its own.\n\n\tThe TakeawayAcross these threads and more, this year’s SIFF positioned children’s cinema not as an offshoot of the industry but as its conscience. In Sharjah, the future of filmmaking looks less like spectacle and more like stewardship. The youngest voices aren’t waiting to inherit the medium, they’re already reshaping it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDermot O’Leary’s bestselling children’s book series is leaping from page to stage in a new family production featuring puppetry and original songs.\n\n\tLittle Angel Theatre, Mercury Theatre Colchester and Mayflower Southampton have unveiled the world premiere stage adaptation of “Toto the Ninja Cat and the Great Snake Escape,” based on the popular children’s book by broadcaster Dermot O’Leary and illustrated by Nick East, published by Hachette Children’s Group.\n\t\n\n\tThe “Toto the Ninja Cat” series, based on O’Leary’s real-life pets, has sold more than half a million copies globally and been translated into 17 languages.\n\n\n\tThe story follows Toto, an almost completely blind cat with incredible ninja skills, who must use her courage and cunning to stop a deadly King Cobra that has escaped onto the streets of London, alongside her cheeky brother Silver.\n\n\tThe stage rights were acquired from Hachette Children’s Group in a deal negotiated between Sarah Lennon Galavan, head of licensing for Hachette Children’s Group, and Samantha Lane, artistic director of Little Angel Theatre, and Natasha Rickman, artistic director of Mercury Theatre.\n\n\tThe production will be adapted and directed by Lane, with music and lyrics by Barb Jungr. The duo previously collaborated on “The Smartest Giant in Town,” which received an Olivier nomination for Best Family Show in 2023.\n\n\tSet, costume and puppet design will be by Little Angel associate director Oliver Hyman, who recently won a special Fringe Theatre Award for exceptional services to puppetry. Lighting design is by Sherry Coenen.\n\t\n\n\tO’Leary, who currently co-presents ITV’s “This Morning” on Fridays, is best known for hosting “The X Factor” from 2007 to 2018. He also presents BBC Radio 2’s Saturday morning breakfast show.\n\n\t“I’m over the moon to see my book brought to life through puppetry,” said O’Leary. “Toto is currently fast asleep, blissfully unaware of all the attention, but speaking on her behalf, she’ll be thrilled to bits that her adventures are about to come to life, in theatres to audiences all around the country.”\n\n\tLane and Jungr added: “It’s such a joyful, funny, and heartwarming story, and we can’t wait to bring Toto’s world, full of courage, friendship, and adventure, to life on stage. Led by a stellar creative team, the production promises brilliant songs, imaginative puppetry, and an abundance of surprises for audiences of all ages.”\n\n\tThe musical will open at Mercury Theatre Colchester April 2-18, 2026, followed by runs at Little Angel Theatre London (May 16-July 19) and Mayflower Studios (July 23-26). Additional tour stops include Bristol Redgrave (July 28-30), Birmingham Town Hall (Aug. 15-16), Weymouth Pavilion (Aug. 18-19), Guildford Yvonne Arnaud (Aug. 20-23) and Capital Theatres (Oct. 23-25), with further dates to be announced.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBen Stiller is calling on comedians to keep pushing boundaries.\n\n\tDuring a recent interview with Radio Times, the “Severance” director said that comedy is facing unprecedented challenges in the current political climate. However, he urged those working in the genre to not back down in the face of external pressure.\n\n\t“We live in a world where taking chances with comedy is more challenging,” Stiller said. “You’re seeing that front and center in our country. But I think it’s important that comedians keep doing what they’re doing, speaking truth to power and being free to say what they want. That’s the most important thing.”\n\t\n\n\tFreedom of speech in comedy has been front of mind in Hollywood ever since Jimmy Kimmel was temporarily pulled off the air by ABC after the late-night host made on air comments about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Sept. 17, and the network returned the show to air on Sept. 22.\n\n\tStiller went on to cite another threat to comedy: social media. He fears the hyperactive nature of platforms like TikTok and Instagram have spoiled audience’s attentions spans and diluted the craft of comedians.\n\n\t“You have things that go out to huge audiences very quickly,” Stiller said. “I think we’ve reduced our attention spans down a little bit. I feel lucky to have grown up in the analogue world.”\n\n\tStiller is one of Hollywood’s most successful funnymen of the late ‘90s and early aughts, appearing in such films as “Happy Gilmore,” “Meet the Parents,” “Zoolander” “Anchorman,” “Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story” and “Tropic Thunder.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart went after Fox News for their wishy-washy reaction to Saturday’s No Kings protests.\n\n\tStewart opened the monologue with clips of House Speaker Mike Johnson calling the No Kings protests the “hate America rally,” and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent calling participants “the farthest left, the hardest core, the most unhinged in the Democratic party.”\n\n\n\t“Not the hardest core! I expected partial Marxism and hard core, but not full display hardest core ha-Marxism,” Stewart joked. “It was going to be like ‘Mad Max’ out there with Chuck Schumer on flaming guitar!”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “So, this weekend, we sat in our bunkers, doors locked, windows boarded, muskets and cyanide pills at the ready, prepared for whatever the hardest core had in store. Do your worst, display your Marxism to its fullest!”\n\n\tStewart then cut to CNN’s report, which claimed that about 7 million people participated in the nationwide demonstration, and that the protests were “largely peaceful” and “often joyful.”\n\n\t“It was kind of an incredible turnout that was somewhat inspiring. 7 million Americans, zero mass shootings?” Stewart said. “I look forward to Republicans apologizing sincerely for implying these Americans were… what’s the word I’m looking for? Deplorable!”\n\n\tBack on Fox News, anchors were calling participants, “silly” and “dumb.” One commentator said because of all the “absurdist costumes,” the protests “don’t look serious.”\n\n\t“Make up your mind, Fox,” Stewart said. “You complained it would be a terrifyingly ‘shit your pants’ protest, and now you are complaining about how boringly unpants-shitting it was? Although there was one nit you picked that really felt off brand.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart then targeted another Fox News complaint, which was the No Kings protests were comprised of mostly “old white people.”\n\n\t“Extra extra, this read all about it! ‘This country has too many angry old white people,’ says — hold on — Fox News,” Stewart joked. “Fox News says, ‘Why are old white people so angry?’ Fox News, mad that there are so many old white people in America.”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below.\n\n\n\n",

Katelynn -- who is a big Swiftie herself -- previously admitted she nearly named Lilah \"Willow\" after Taylor's song of the same name.\n      \n    \n          Turns out \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is all about performing miracles and not asking for any recognition in return ... though there's one family who certainly won't forget her generosity anytime soon.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Taylor Swift\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Kids\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

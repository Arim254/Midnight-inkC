    "body": "\n\tIdentifying one of the hot tickets at this year’s London TV Screenings,’ “Gone,” from George Kay, creator or writer of “Hijack,” “The Long Shadow” and “Lupin,” has scored bullish pre-sales across four continents led by a BritBox deal for the U.S. and Canada. \n\n\tOther pre-sales on the upcoming psychological thriller, starring David Morrissey (“Sherwood”) and Eve Myles (“Keeping Faith”), take in both top broadcast networks and streaming services in Australia, New Zealand, Asia and Europe. \n\t\n\n\tPartners include Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, and Australian streaming service Stan. SkyNew Zealand has also licensed “Gone,” set to air on Three and stream on ThreeNow.\n\n\n\tAcross Asia, A3Media International has struck a pre-sales deal with BBC Studios’ premium SVOD drama channel, BBC First, alongside its multi-genre SVOD platform, BBC Player.\n\n\tThe six-part series will be one of the centerpiece scripted titles at All3Media International‘s London Screenings showcase on Feb. 26. \n\n\tIn “Gone,” bound for ITV and ITVX for a March bow, Morrissey plays the headmaster of an elite English private school, whose wife suddenly vanishes. Enter Detective Annie Cassidy (Myles) who views Polly as the prime suspect and “Gone” lifts off as a high-stakes cat and mouse psychological drama-thriller between the hard-charging Cassidy and Polly, who keep his own counsel. \n\n\tThat comes with his caste and class. Released mid-Feb, a trailer for “Gone” begins not with Polly but his school, which looks to date back to Tudor times, its facade sporting an elegant nineteenth century Anglo-Italianate makeover. It goes on to catch Polly addressing students in the school’s main hall, its coat of arms behind him. Cut to Polly’s country house. \n\t\n\n\tThis is a man who is the voice of the British establishment, its moral arbiter whose ethics are not to be questioned lightly. Enter Myles Cassidy, caught in the trailer in a slightly larger than normal first close-up, who stares at Polly across a police interrogation room table with an air of not very dissimulated disbelief.\n\n\tThis is a “story about privilege and prejudice,” Kay said when “Gone” was announced. “The truth is tantalisingly close. Or at least, that’s what Annie thinks,” he teased. Kay’s Observatory Pictures, backed by All3Media, produces with New Pictures, in association with All3Media International.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Gone’   Eve Myles as Annie, David Morrissey as Michael   Copyright New Pictures, All3Media International\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGone Eve Myles as Annie, David Morrissey as Michael Copyright New Pictures, All3Media International\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Blending psychological mystery with a claustrophobic thriller and layered character drama, George Kay’s latest series has resonated strongly with international buyers as is evident through this impressive line-up of premium partners at pre-sale stage, including BritBox,” said Jennifer Askin, EVP Americas at All3Media International. \n\n\t“With its atmospheric setting, a stellar cast led by David Morrissey and Eve Myles and a tightly constructed cat-and-mouse narrative, “Gone” delivers sustained tension and broad audience appeal,” she added. “We look forward to unveiling further details to buyers at our upcoming upfronts event this week.”\n\n\t“Beyond the central mystery, ‘Gone’ digs into themes of trauma, trust and the long shadow cast by elite institutions, giving the drama a deeper emotional and social edge alongside its thriller elements,” All3Media International noted in a press statement on Wednesday. \n\n\tWritten and created by Kay, “Gone” is directed by BAFTA-winning Richard Laxton (“Mrs Wilson,” “The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe”). Cast also takes in Jennifer Macbeth, Arthur Hughes, Nicholas Nunn, Elliot Cowan, Billy Barratt, Rupert Evans, Jodie McNee, Oscar Batterham and Clare Higgins.\n\n\t“Gone” is produced by Mark Hedges (“Hanna,” “The Rising”). Kay, Laxton, Willow Grylls (“Des,” “The Missing”) and Matt Sandford (“The Long Shadow”) serve as executive producers.\n\t\n\n\t“Gone” is fiction, A3Media Intl. stresses It is partly inspired, however, by the book “To Hunt a Killer” and the real-world work of former Detective Superintendent Julie Mackay and ITV Crime Correspondent Robert Murphy, both of whom worked as consultants on the show.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“RRR” director S.S. Rajamouli has unveiled what is being billed as India’s most advanced motion capture facility, unveiling the A&M MoCap Lab at Hyderabad’s Annapurna Studios.\n\n\tThe facility is a joint venture between Akkineni Nagarjuna‘s Annapurna Studios and “Baahubali” producer Shobu Yarlagadda‘s Mihira Visual Labs, with Hollywood’s Animatrik Film Design – whose credits include “Avengers: Endgame,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and “RRR” – serving as the technology partner. During the unveiling, Rajamouli shared the first glimpse of the lab and confirmed that key sequences of “Varanasi,” which stars Mahesh Babu, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Prithviraj Sukumaran were captured there.\n\t\n\n\tFor Rajamouli, the facility closes a long-standing gap in Indian filmmaking infrastructure. “India has always had some of the world’s best technicians contributing to major global productions, but what we lacked was an advanced facility right here at home,” he said. “When I look back at some of my previous films like ‘Baahubali’ and ‘Eega,’ I reminisce how I could have made them even better if I had access to motion capture technology back then in India. With the introduction of A&M’s motion capture technology, that gap has finally been bridged. We utilized this facility in the making of crucial sequences in ‘Varanasi,’ and the results were simply fantastic.”\n\n\n\tNagarjuna framed the launch as a milestone for Indian cinema at large. “For decades, Indian filmmakers have aspired to tell large-scale stories that match global standards, but access to high-end technology was often a limitation,” he said. “With A&M, filmmakers can now bring everything from epic adventures to intricate science fiction dramas and animation films to life right here in Hyderabad.”\n\t\n\n\tYarlagadda, whose Mihira Visual Labs co-developed the facility, described it as part of a broader infrastructure-building effort. “For Indian cinema to truly compete on a global stage, it is essential to create advanced technology ecosystems within the country,” he said. “Seeing a filmmaker like S.S. Rajamouli utilize our A&M MoCap facility for ‘Varanasi’ reinforces our belief that the future of Indian storytelling will be driven by innovation built at home.”\n\n\tBrett Ineson, president and CTO of Animatrik Film Design, added: “We’re incredibly proud to see Animatrik’s motion capture technology powering this landmark facility at Annapurna Studios. Annapurna has long been a beacon of cinematic excellence, and partnering with them and Mihira Visual Labs to bring world-class performance capture capabilities to India is truly exciting. This collaboration represents a significant step in enabling filmmakers and creators to tell more immersive, emotionally rich stories with the highest global standards.”\n\n\tThe lab features a 60-by-40-by-30-foot capture volume equipped with Vicon Valkyrie VK26 cameras offering sub-millimeter optical tracking precision and real-time data streaming via Vicon Live. The setup integrates Unreal Engine for live virtual production previsualization and includes Stereo Head-Mounted Camera units for high-resolution facial performance capture. Notably, the facility is modular and expandable, allowing it to be disassembled and reassembled on location as productions require.\n\n\tC.V. Rao, CTO of Annapurna Studios, emphasized the facility’s utility as a pre-production tool. “Directors and cinematographers can experiment with camera blocking, lens choices, camera movements, and frame rates in a dynamic virtual environment, allowing critical creative decisions to be finalized during the motion capture stage, prior to principal photography,” he said, adding that the approach is designed to minimize costly trial-and-error during live shoots.\n\n\tThe launch comes as Annapurna Studios marks its 50th anniversary. The studio said it intends to open the facility to Indian and international filmmakers, game developers, and animation studios seeking a production partner in Asia. It is also not the first time Rajamouli has partnered with Annapurna on a technological milestone – he previously launched India’s first Dolby cinema processing facility at the same studio.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tS.S.

    "body": "\n\tPresident Trump touted his economic achievements and attacked immigrants and Democrats in a divisive State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\n\tTrump also criticized the Supreme Court, which struck down his emergency tariffs last week, and repeatedly castigated the Democratic side of the aisle for not applauding him.\n\n\t“These people are crazy,” he said. “Democrats are destroying our country, but we’ve stopped it in the nick of time.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump is facing the lowest approval ratings of his term, around 40%, with nearly 60% expressing disapproval. The White House has tried to move on from setbacks like the months-long Epstein controversy and pivot attention to affordability.\n\n\n\t“A short while ago, we were a dead country,” Trump said. “Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world. The hottest.”\n\n\tTrump also promoted his record of stopping illegal immigration and accused Somali immigrants of defrauding the government. At one point, he told the Democratic members of Congress that they should be “ashamed” for refusing to stand when he said that the government’s first duty “is to protect American citizens, not illegal immigrants.”\n\n\tRep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali immigrant from Minneapolis, shouted back at him: “You should be ashamed.”\n\n\tTrump said the Supreme Court’s tariff ruling was “very unfortunate” and “disappointing.” Four justices of the court — John Roberts, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — sat impassively with their hands folded while Trump rebuked the ruling.\n\n\tDavid Ellison, the CEO of Paramount Skydance, was among those in the audience, appearing as a guest of Sen. Lindsey Graham. The government is reviewing Netflix’s deal to acquire Warner Bros., while Paramount is angling to break up the deal with a competing bid.\n\t\n\n\tTrump also took several minutes of the speech to honor the U.S. men’s hockey team, which won gold at the Winter Olympics on Sunday, and to talk up the 2028 games in Los Angeles.\n\n\t“We’re going to do a good job in Los Angeles,” he said. “Los Angeles is going to be safe, just like Washington, D.C., is now one of the safest cities in the country.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Project Hail Mary” has been unveiled to members of the film press ahead of its March 20 release, and first reactions are calling Phil Lord and Christopher Miller’s sci-fi comedy a “must-see space odyssey” that may prove to be a “major awards player” come Oscar time next year.\n\n\tFilm critic Eric Marchen shared a glowing review on X, writing that “Project Hail Mary” is “the first great blockbuster of 2026.” \n\n\n\t“Phil Lord and Christopher Miller’s must-see space odyssey blasts off as the first great blockbuster of 2026,” Marchen wrote. “Out-of-this-world cinematography from Greig Fraser reaches for the stars while anchored by a stellar Ryan Gosling performance. This movie ROCKS!”\n\t\n\n\tCritic Adriano Caporusso also praised the film on X. He wrote, “‘PROJECT HAIL MARY’: Lord & Miller’s latest plays up a ‘Short Circuit’ bromance to an hysterical extreme while simultaneously delivering a pulse-pounding space epic that brings true humanity to the centrestage, but not without some jaw-dropping visuals alongside.”\n\n\tGlobe and Mail film writer Barry Hertz shared some reservations about the “Project Hail Mary” on X, but they weren’t enough to outshine Ryan Gosling’s “galaxy-sized charms.”\n\n\t“‘PROJECT HAIL MARY’: Not quite faster-than-light script with too many endings and one crucial plot point that evaporates, plus a seeming corporate obligation to Amazon’s ROCKY catalogue, cannot suppress the galaxy-sized charms of Ryan Gosling,” he wrote. “‘INTERSTELLAR’ without all the ~stuff~.”\n\n\tEntertainment journalist Scott Menzel called “Project Hail Mary” a “masterpiece” on X and predicted it will be “a major awards player across the board.”\n\t\n\n\t“‘Project Hail Mary’ is an epic cinematic achievement,” Menzel wrote. “Phil Lord and Chris Miller somehow manage to raise the bar once again, delivering what is not only their most ambitious film to date, but arguably their most accomplished.”\n\n\tTV host Jeff Conway echoed the praise, writing on X, “A successfully sophisticated blend of humor, sci-fi, drama and suspense. Ryan Gosling is the shining star of this compassionate story about connection and defying the odds, while Sandra Hüller is the tender heart of this beautiful film.”\n\n\tBased on the 2021 novel by Andy Weir, the film stars Gosling as brainy school teacher Ryland Grace, who wakes up alone on a spaceship light-years away from Earth with no recollection of how he got there. As his memory recovers, he pieces together an outlandish plot that sent him through the galaxy to stop a mysterious entity from blacking out the sun. Other cast members include Sandra Hüller, Milana Vayntrub, Ken Leung, Liz Kingsman and James Ortiz.\n\n\tAt Comic Con 2025, Gosling unveiled the first five minutes of “Project Hail Mary” alongside Miller, Lord and screenwriter Drew Goddard. Gosling said at the time that he related to Ryland’s situation of being an “ordinary person in an extraordinary situation.”\n\n\t“I connected to his reluctance,” he said. “Aside from the fact he has a doctorate in molecular biology, he’s an ordinary person in an extraordinary situation. He reacts to a lot of things the way I might or a lot of us might. He’s terrified appropriately of the task at hand. He’s somebody who gave up on himself on Earth, and he’s given an opportunity to believe in himself again. It’s inspiring to go through this journey with him because he somehow finds the courage to put one foot in front of the other and keep going.”\n\n\tCheck out more reactions below. \n\n#ProjectHailMary is perfect. Imagination unleashed even better than I pictured it on the page. How Gosling captivates throughout a largely one-man show is beyond me – your earliest Best Actor contender. & my sweet prince Rocky… tears flowed all third act. What a beautiful… pic.twitter.com/THQapWJYJ1— Liam (@LiamTCrowley) February 25, 2026\n\n\n\n#ProjectHailMary absolutely floored me. Lord and Miller deliver a space odyssey that is deeply human and heartwarming. Ryan Gosling is fantastic here and brings emotion and charm to this SciFi epic. Incredible visuals and a pulsing score. You wanna see this one in @IMAX. pic.twitter.com/C4jR86eZNe— Kevin Verma (@KevOnFilm) February 25, 2026\n\n\n\n#ProjectHailMary is pure joy. Hilarious, heartfelt, hugely moving, wildly exciting and absolutely beautiful. The 160 minutes go by in an instant as Lord and Miller keep Weir’s narrative moving like a rocket ship. Gosling is better than ever and the Rocky effect and mind blowing. pic.twitter.com/OLi6HR3Zxt— Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) February 25, 2026\n\n\nPhil Lord and Chris Miller’s #ProjectHailMary is the iconic duo’s finest hour. Their “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial”: a family-friendly, high-concept crowd-pleaser with real blockbuster upside. Ryan Gosling and Sandra Hüller are out of this world, owning every frame.

    "body": "\n\tThe Brazilian film “Gugu’s World” starts quite literally true to its title by showing the audience its lead character’s room, full of everything he loves. Director Allan Deberton crams much story and characterization in those opening frames. From Gugu’s soccer trophies to his colorful wardrobe to the glitter on his face, this 11-year-old is revealed fully and economically. A complete portrait in mere minutes. He’s shown dancing around and even wearing a cape. An endearing character to fall in love with instantly, thus setting up this charming film.\n\t\n\n\t“Gugu’s World,” which won the jury prize for the Generation section at the Berlinale, is a generous character study of a queer pre-teen. Gugu (Yuri Gomes)  lives with his grandmother Dilma (Teca Pereira), in a small house near the Araújo Lima reservoir. Their bond is strong as he lost his mother, Dilma’s daughter, when he was very young. She accepts him unconditionally and their time together is filled with playful joy. At school, he’s doing well and has two supportive girlfriends. He is also a star soccer player. Of course he has a nemesis: a boy named Francisco who’s not as good at soccer, and who keeps calling Gugu “a sissy” while goading him into confrontations. His father Batista (Lázaro Ramos) eyes him with disappointment and euphemistically calls him “a clown.”\n\n\n\tAndré Araújo’s screenplay manages to flesh out all these interrelationships with sensitivity and nuance. The film finds space to tell the story of Gugu and Dilma’s special bond in scenes that feel natural. A highlight is their love of Cyndi Lauper’s “Time After Time,” which was a favorite of Gugu’s mother. When Dilma starts becoming frail, Gugu goes to great lengths to take care of her while keeping others from invading their space. Though different, the same tenderness shows in the father and son relationship. There’s hurt and shame standing between them, but also love that might lead to genuine appreciation of each other at any point. \n\t\n\n\tHowever, above all Araújo splendidly comes up with an unforgettable cinema hero. In crafting Gugu he writes a wholly original character who also immediately feels familiar. The audience gets to know Gugu so well and fall in love with his courage, singularity and determination to protect his grandmother and their oasis of a life together. In Gomes, the filmmakers hit the jackpot. The young actor brings grit, grief and much exuberance to his performance. He is in almost every frame and holds the film together with a grounded and spontaneous performance that has none of the precociousness that mars many a young actor’s performance. Pereira matches him in warmth and their duet is a pleasure to watch. \n\n\tVisually the film is as colorful as Gugu’s personality. Deberton, working with production designer Dayse Barreto and costume designer Gabriella Marra, fills the frame with vibrant colors — deep pink and blue, purple and yellow, to show the beauty and vivaciousness of Gugu’s world. He might be worried about his grandmother, frustrated with his dad, sometimes uncomfortable among his peers, but it’s clear he likes himself and knows he will persevere. \n\n\tTherein lies the strength of this film. Not everything goes well, there’s tragedy and sadness but also a sense of infinite hope that permeates the proceedings. The first sentence the character utters at the beginning of the film is that “he’s going to save the world.” By the end of the film that seems entirely plausible, even believable. If Gugu doesn’t save the world, he will at least protect himself and his grandmother and make their life together as wonderful as can be. The film seems destined to play at many festivals, especially queer ones. However “Gugu’s World” is such a crowd pleaser that it deserves to be seen widely by audiences. They’ll be in for a real treat.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNeve Campbell recently told CBS Mornings that she “didn’t think I could live with myself” if she accepted the offer return for “Scream 6.”\n\n\t“When I made that decision, I just didn’t think I could live with myself walking on set,” Campbell said. “I just didn’t feel right. I just knew that my value to this franchise was bigger than what had been offered. For me, I needed to make that choice.”\n\n\n\tShe added, “When I said goodbye to it, I thought that was it. I knew that there was a good chance that would be it.”\n\t\n\n\tCampbell explained that although it was tough knowing that the “Scream 6” production team was “having their first day of shooting and I wasn’t there,” she ultimately knew she made the “right” decision to bow out of the film.\n\n\tShe added, “And when I spoke out about it, it wasn’t really to sort of rally everybody. It was really just my truth at the time, and the fact the people got behind me, I got lovely support, and that was nice. And I do feel that other people need to make those choices.”\n\n\tCampbell, the longtime face of the “Scream” franchise, told Variety in 2022 that she would not be returning for the sixth installment because she felt “the offer that was presented to me did not equate to the value I have brought to the franchise.”\n\n\t“Sadly, I won’t be making the next ‘Scream’ film,” Campbell said in a statement to Variety. “As a woman I have had to work extremely hard in my career to establish my value, especially when it comes to ‘Scream.’ I felt the offer that was presented to me did not equate to the value I have brought to the franchise. It’s been a very difficult decision to move on. To all my ‘Scream’ fans, I love you. You’ve always been so incredibly supportive to me. I’m forever grateful to you and to what this franchise has given me over the past 25 years.”\n\t\n\n\tCampbell will return for “Scream 7” after her salary dispute, joining fellow original cast members David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and Courteney Cox. Kevin Williamson, who wrote the first “Scream,” serves as director.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom the trifecta of prizes “Happy Birthday” earned during its Tribeca world premiere in 2025 to the multiple audience awards and other kudos it collected on the international festival circuit, plus, its selection as Egypt’s Oscar submission, the poignant drama is surely one of the best and most awarded foreign features still seeking U.S. distribution. Helmed and co-written by Sarah Goher, the first-ever Egyptian chosen as one of Variety’s 10 Directors to Watch, it illuminates disparities of wealth and class in contemporary Cairo through the affecting story of a resourceful 8-year-old maid whose devoted friendship with the daughter of the household she works for is frowned upon by her employers.\n\t\n\n\tGoher, a screenwriter and producer making her feature debut, proves herself to be a director-writer of uncommon sensitivity. She draws a performance of astonishing depth from Doha Ramadan as Toha, the illiterate but street-smart young domestic who doesn’t yet understand her position in Egypt’s complex social hierarchy.\n\n\n\tSmart, capable and quick-witted, Toha’s current joy comes from her relationship with Nelly (Khadija Ahmed), the spoiled granddaughter of her employer (Hanan Youssef), a tetchy, elderly diabetic. Toha helps to hide Nelly’s bed-wetting from her soon-to-be divorced mother Laila (Nelly Karim) and covers for her when she’s late or binging on ice cream. Meanwhile, Nelly enjoys having a friend of a similar age right in her own home and ignores her grandmother’s snide comments about Toha being a potential source of lice.\n\n\tNow that Nelly’s father has left, financial worries cause the women to prepare to leave their modern home in an affluent gated community. Nelly’s ninth birthday celebration looks to be a casualty of the situation until Toha comes up with a clever plan to get Nelly the party of her dreams. But as the day progresses, Toha, who has no idea of when she was born and has never heard of birthday wishes, finds herself learning some hard lessons that leave the audience quietly devastated.\n\t\n\n\tGoher’s carefully calibrated visuals in partnership with Seif El Din Khaled’s intimate cinematography perfectly establish the painful paradox of money and class. In the film’s opening moments, the two young girls in their pajamas and wildly curly hair play happily in a pink tent on the early morning of Nelly’s birthday. Sure, one has slightly darker skin and the other more delicate features, but they seem like equals. Then, after the adults come into the frame and Toha dresses in shapeless clothes and a headscarf, their social position and economic circumstances become much clearer. Nelly goes to school while Toha fetches and carries for the “Madames.”\n\n\tDespite her menial work, Toha feels lucky. She hates the subsistence fishing that she would have to do if she lived with her family. Although she might not have her own bedroom at Nelly’s house, merely a couch in a living room, at least she has drawers in which to store her things, many of them Nelly’s castoffs. In contrast, at her mother’s ramshackle house the kids sleep where they can and must share all their clothes. No wonder, in her innocence, Toha tells Laila that she hopes she can stay with Laila and Nelly forever.\n\n\t(Over)-confident in her ability to make things happen, Toha isn’t conscious of the class-prejudice her mismatched designer cast-offs and headscarf incite at the fancy boutique where she accompanies Laila. But the social boundaries she encounters there are also present in her employer’s household as well as at its very gates.\n\n\tUnbeknownst to Toha, her employer arranges for Toha’s sister (Jomana Ibrahim) to pick her up so that she can’t participate in Nelly’s party, even though Toha believes that Nelly wants her there. As the sisters leave the complex, the gate guard insists on rummaging through the bags of food and clothing Laila has given them, even calling the house to make sure they had the right to take them. Fatme feels humiliated, but Toha is too busy plotting how to return from her rundown village near the Nile.\n\n\tEver enterprising, Toha does eventually make her way back to the party, but there, the ultimate dawning of her place outside of Nelly’s circle is heartbreaking. The sheer joy Goher has captured Ramadan experiencing earlier is replaced by confusion, pain and tears. Goher and her charismatic young star understand how to use cinema as a powerful empathy generator. \n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance boss David Ellison will be in attendance at Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The news comes hours after his studio upped its bid for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery to $31 per share.\n\n\tSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina posted on X Tuesday afternoon that Ellison will be his guest at Trump’s address.\n\n\tReps for Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. \n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery said in a press release on Tuesday that the WBD board “had not made a determination” whether or not Paramount’s offer is “superior” to the deal currently in place with Netflix. If Paramount’s new bid is preferable, Netflix will “have four business days after such determination to negotiate with WBD and to propose any revisions to the Netflix transaction.”\n\n\tNetflix’s deal is around $83 billion for just Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max. Paramount wants all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its linear assets, for $112 billion. Since Netflix’s agreement is still in effect, the WBD board will continue to recommend the deal with the streaming giant, which will go to a shareholder vote on March 20.\n\n\tAlong with the increased purchasing power of $31 per share, Paramount’s latest offer also includes a ticking fee of 25 cents per quarter starting after Sept. 30, as well as a $7 billion breakup fee if the deal doesn’t clear regulatory scrutiny. Paramount also offered to pay the $2.8 billion fee for Warner Bros. if it terminates its merger with Netflix.\n\n\tNews of the new deal came at the end of a seven day negotiating window, during which Netflix allowed WBD to “seek clarity” on Paramount’s “best and final offer.”\n\t\n\n\tSome have interpreted Paramount as having the upper hand in the regulatory battle for Warner Bros. since Larry Ellison, David’s mega-billionaire father, is a longtime Trump supporter. However, in a Truth Social post in Dec. 2025, the president deflected this theory, saying of the Ellisons, “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\n\t“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that ’60 Minutes’ has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before,” Trump wrote. \n\n\tWhile Trump told NBC in early February that he thought he “shouldn’t be involved” with regulating the Warner Bros. deal, he appeared to backtrack on this stance on Feb. 21, when he demanded Netflix “immediately” fire board member Susan Rice or “pay the consequences.” \n\n\t“Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences,” Trump wrote. “She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT.”\n",

Based on the FBI's broad investigation ... they believe the man could have arrived on Nancy's doorstep January 11th -- weeks before the February 1st abduction -- but they are not certain. BTW, Kash Patel said weeks ago the photo was taken the morning of her disappearance -- that is incorrect.\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          Our sources say neither the still photo nor the video from February 1st has helped them identify the getaway car or the suspect.

In the video, Savannah acknowledges it would be a \"miracle\" if her mom was alive ... our sources say the FBI never told the family the chances Nancy was alive were slim ... it's something the family came to terms with on their own.\n      \n\n          The FBI's $100,000 reward is still on the table, in addition to the $1 million from the Guthrie family. The FBI wants the leads sent to 1800-CALL-FBI, but serious leads only.

The source believes someone involved in the kidnapping will brag about it or insinuate his/her involvement 4 or 5 months down the line, or someone who knows the identity of the kidnappers will either talk about it or go to authorities. This, the source says, is how they solve many of these crimes.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Savannah Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Kash Patel\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie Case\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

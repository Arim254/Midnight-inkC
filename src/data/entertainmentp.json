    "body": "\n\tFor Yeo Yann Yann, the journey to Anthony Chen‘s “We Are All Strangers” has been one of profound personal and artistic transformation. \n\n\tThe acclaimed actor’s performance as Lee Bee Hwa marks her third collaboration with the Singaporean filmmaker — an evolution that mirrors both their maturation as artists and the 13-year span of Chen’s “Growing Up” trilogy. Yeo won Golden Horse Awards for best actress for “Wet Season” (2019) and best supporting actress for “Ilo Ilo” (2013).\n\t\n\n\t“When I saw him again, he maintained that boyish smile, but he was way heavier on his shoulder, the way he discussed things,” Yeo reflects on reuniting with Chen for the Berlin competition entry. “I can feel this maturing, and I am maturing as a human too, after becoming a mother since ‘Ilo Ilo.'”\n\n\n\tThe drama, set in contemporary Singapore, explores themes of class, inequality and the fragile dynamics between inherited and chosen family. Yeo’s character, a beer supplier at a hawker centre, is an immigrant woman who arrives in the lives of a father and son, embodying the film’s central tension between belonging and estrangement.\n\n\t“She is a stranger amongst the family,” Yeo explains of her character’s late entry into the narrative. “She’s almost like a mystery that’s going to be revealed later.”\n\n\tDrawing from her own experience as someone from Malaysia who grew up immersed in Singaporean culture before moving to the city-state, Yeo found personal resonance in her character’s search for home. “When I moved to Singapore, I felt strange at times,” she says. “I felt like I am constantly looking for a sense of belonging and a sense of family.”\n\t\n\n\t“We Are All Strangers” marks the first Singaporean film to compete for the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. The film reunites Yeo with Koh Jia Ler, who first worked with Chen as an 11-year-old in “Ilo Ilo,” for which he earned a Golden Horse nomination, and returned for “Wet Season” in a Golden Horse-nominated supporting role.\n\n\tThroughout the trilogy, Yeo has watched co-star Koh grow from an 11-year-old discovery into a seasoned actor. “Jia Ler maintains that happy-go-lucky little child,” she says with evident affection. “And that was something that we will discuss, like, my God. How did he do that, he’s like a little child even now — we envy him.”\n\n\tThe actor describes her character’s pivotal decision to commit to a relationship as born from a moment of crisis, informed by her own experiences with work-permit uncertainty. “There is a sense of survival, there’s a sense of maybe a family,” she explains. “I think I experienced that before, when I was younger, like you have to just leave because you don’t belong here.”\n\n\tThe production itself proved challenging, with approximately 50 locations testing the cast and crew. “I hated shorts,” Yeo adds about the costume requirements. Yet she describes a familial atmosphere on set, with the production team living and working together in a house that served as both office and rehearsal space.\n\n\t“I remember one day Anthony was telling me that he couldn’t believe it’s already 13 years, that we were strangers before, and now we’re like family,” Yeo recalls. “It makes me want to cry actually thinking about that.”\n\n\tThe evolution of their working relationship has been marked by significant life changes. Chen was fresh out of film school for “Ilo Ilo,” which went on to win the Caméra d’Or at Cannes and several Golden Horse Awards among over 40 accolades. During filming, Yeo was pregnant and gained 30 kilograms. By “Wet Season,” Chen had become a father himself, bringing new depth to his directorial approach.\n\n\t“‘Wet Season’ was one of the toughest shoots for me,” Yeo admits, noting the technical challenges of filming in extreme weather conditions and the emotional toll of her deeply repressed character. “I couldn’t get out of the character for at least another half a year after the filming.”\n\t\n\n\tFor “We Are All Strangers,” Yeo notes Chen’s growth. “Anthony is really maturing into a collaborator, focusing even more on collaborating,” she says. “We discussed a lot about how this person’s journey, how are we going to present her in the most authentic way.”\n\n\tAs the film prepares for its world premiere at the Berlinale, Yeo hopes international audiences will connect with its universal themes despite its specific Singaporean context. “No matter where you are, there will still be people who work really hard and struggle with different subjects, different problems in their life,” she observes.\n\n\tAsked to identify the film’s central takeaway, Yeo doesn’t hesitate: “Even though these people are in a difficult situation, they never give up hoping. Every character works really hard to not giving up on hope.”\n\n\tThe film is presented by Giraffe Pictures in association with 127 Wall Prods. and Jasper Prods., with participation of Singapore Film Commission, and is in co-production with Red Sea Fund. International sales are handled by Paradise City Sales. Yeo is represented by Andrew Ooi at Echelon Talent Management.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFinance and sales outfit Global Constellation has boarded international sales on the upcoming live-action family feature “Emil and the Detectives.”\n\n\tThe film is a contemporary adaptation of Erich Kästner’s classic 1929 novel, which has been translated into more than 60 languages since its original publication and remains a cornerstone of children’s literature. The film is written by Antonia Scheurlen and directed by David Dietl.\n\t\n\n\tCurrently in post-production, the film is slated for a theatrical release across German-speaking territories next fall via Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\n\n\tThe story follows young Emil, whose money for his grandmother is stolen during his train trip to Berlin. Determined to get it back, he teams up with a fearless group of kids to outsmart a clever thief, uncover hidden clues across the city, and discover the true power of friendship and courage.\n\n\tThe film is a co-production of UFA Fiction, Warner Bros. Film Productions Germany and UFA Mitte. Producers are Sebastian Werninger, Tobias Timme and Katharina Rietz. Co-producers are Steffen Schier, Julia Hayungs and Maggie Mackuth. \n\n\tThe film is funded by Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg (MBB), Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung (MDM), FilmFernsehFonds Bayern (FFFB), Filmförderanstalt (FFA), Deutscher Filmförderfonds (DFFF) and Bayerische Staatskanzlei.\n\n\tKästner’s novel has been adapted for the screen multiple times since the 1930s, most recently in 2001. It has also been brought to the stage, with Carl Miller’s adaptation opening on the main Olivier stage at London’s National Theatre in 2013.\n\t\n\n\tSebastian Werninger, the film’s producer at UFA Fiction, said: “Reimagining Erich Kästner’s ‘Emil and the Detectives’ for today’s world unlocks tremendous potential for young audiences to connect with timeless, universal values such as friendship, courage and self-empowerment. We are very happy to continue our successful collaboration with Global Constellation on this project.”\n\n\t“We’re delighted to build on our longstanding relationship with UFA, bringing this new adaptation of an iconic piece of children’s literature to the market, inviting family audiences worldwide to fall in love with Emil’s wit, bravery and unstoppable sense of adventure,” said ​Ulrike Schroeder and Fabien Westerhoff of Global Constellation in a statement.\n\n\t“Emil and the Detectives” marks the latest family entertainment title to join the Global Constellation slate, following the recently announced CG-animated feature “Dragoons” by Shea Wageman. The company is also in the market with first footage from “Viva Carmen” by Sébastien Laudenbach, alongside a new clip from the upcoming CG-animated adventure “The Last Dinosaur” by Federico Milella.\n\n\tGlobal Constellation is part of Vuelta, a pan-European film studio with operations spanning production, distribution and sales.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Warner Bros. Discovery board is leaning toward re-engaging with Paramount Skydance on the revised terms of Paramount’s offer to acquire the entire company, which inked an $83 billion sale agreement with Netflix in December.\n\n\tBut Paramount Skydance’s latest offer — No. 9 since last year — includes a premium “ticking fee” for WBD shareholders of about $650 million for every quarter that the Paramount-WBD nuptials are not completed by Dec. 31, 2026. Paramount Skydance released its latest pitch to WBD and to investors on Feb. 10. Word of the WBD’s board’s inclinations was first reported Sunday by Bloomberg News.\n\t\n\n\tThe WBD board has been quick to issue a statement rejecting Paramount’s most recent overtures, calling them insufficient enough to derail the existing agreement with Netflix. But the sale process around the famed studio and HBO has drawn intense scrutiny from investors, media observers and corporate governance watchdogs. The WBD sale is virtually guaranteed to spark shareholder lawsuits, as is the case for most major transactions. If the WBD board goes back one more time with Paramount Skydance, it bolsters the case that the panel did their fiduciary duty to investigate all legitimate offers.\n\n\n\tWBD is expected to address the Paramount Skydance offer and set the date for its Q4 2025 earnings report early this week after Monday’s Presidents’ Day holiday. Investors are also awaiting the date of WBD’s planned special shareholders’ vote to approve the Netflix transaction. It’s unclear if Paramount’s revised offer will change WBD’s vote timetable. Netflix, as per the agreement that it reached in December, has the right to match any superior offer that comes in before it formally completes the acquisition.\n\t\n\n\tRepresentatives for Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance and Netflix declined to comment.\n\n\tA source close to the situation said the WBD board is likely focused on pushing Paramount Skydance to declare that it has reached the best and final offer stage. That would allow shareholders to make a considered choice, and it would allow WBD to push Netflix to match Paramount Skydance terms if they are deemed better than the existing agreement. The situation is complicated by the fact that Netflix’s offer is for Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Paramount Skydance aims to buy the entire WBD, including its large collection of cable channels, from CNN and TNT to Discovery, HGTV and Food Network.\n\n\tThe WBD-Netflix transaction is expected to face a tough regulatory review in Washington, D.C. process given Netflix’s market clout in streaming and the heightened political tension around media in the Trump era. WBD may also face more PR headaches from small but noisy investors who are questioning the Netflix agreement, as was the case with Ancora Capital last week.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Anke Blondé’s latest feature, two friends — middle-aged men in expensive suits — walk in step through offices and banquet halls for much of the first act. You might expect their strides to be scored by a power ballad or an upbeat hip-hop track, but “Dust” is a film of financial fraud brought to light, so it’s scored by morose and heavy strings, and the two men in question are set to be arrested in mere hours. There’s an absurdity and abstraction to the whole affair that affords us a peek into the minds and egos of those who run the modern world, not to mention some tongue-in-cheek disdain nestled within surprising sympathy. However, these flourishes don’t last, and the movie ends up petering out without all that much to say.\n\t\n\n\tIt begins with some dusty substance floating up through the frame, out of focus. It could be snow, or ash, or maybe even flakes of gold. It’s a fitting introduction to a film of innumerable possibilities, one that quickly switches gears to a blank computer screen, and narration about filling in one’s own story. The year is 1999. Handsome Belgian executive Geert (Arieh Worthalter) regales an enthusiastic crowd with a yarn, while his mousy tech head Luc (Jan Hammenecker) demonstrates to what might be the world’s first speech-to-text technology. It may seem rudimentary now, but it was a major breakthrough at the time, not unlike the way today’s tech companies are pushing numerous forms of A.I.\n\n\n\tWithout wasting time, the film begins dropping hints that something is amiss, as it cuts back and forth between Geert and Luc being summoned by angry board members over the weekend, and them being accosted by cocky journalist Aaron (Anthony Welsh) in a public bathroom, as they dance around the subject of his inquiry. Before they know it, their fate is sealed: Come 9 a.m. Monday morning, they’ll take the fall setting up empty shell companies, and be arrested for defrauding thousands of public investors. But where an exposé might climax with this revelation, here it’s the catalyst for the characters’ strange and introspective final 24 hours of freedom, rendered at first with intriguing flourishes.\n\t\n\n\tWritten by Angelo Tijssens, the story is loosely based on Belgian tech firm Lernout & Hauspie, but it has little in common with real events, and often plays like a fable half-remembered. Its gloomy, gas-lit palette and breathy musical hums imbue it with a ghostly quality, as though the Harvard hallways of “The Social Network,” David Fincher’s similarly amber tale of tech caution, were transformed into a haunted house. This eerie sensation is further enhanced by elliptical editing that seamlessly skips back and forth in time across the span of just a few days, creating a sense of fluidity across what should feel discontinuous. It’s enrapturing, and quite hilarious too, as the po-faced, bespectacled Luc — his thinning hair pointed upward like devil horns — pukes and pratfalls, and even does both at the same time.\n\n\tThe two men are separated for much of the runtime, but circle each other as they’re forced to consider absconding or blowing the whistle. However, the hours prior to their arraignment — marked by wall clocks in the background of most scenes — are also filled with moments of remorse, as they catch up with acquaintances and loved ones who will no doubt be affected by what’s to come. Luc consults his wife about how to proceed, while Geert hopes to spend his final few hours of freedom with his driver/boytoy Kenneth (Thibaud Dooms); he is, after all, a man of secrets, while Luc is likely more inclined to spill the beans.\n\n\tThis simmering tension over what they’ll choose to do, as they wander the rural landscape, is the film’s narrative core, and feels momentous during its many cross-cut scenes. However, as the story goes on, the editing becomes more functional and mechanical than poetic, as Blondé presents her scenes in an increasingly protracted, straightforward fashion that, unfortunately, gives the game away. Despite its many scenes of men panicking or silently reflecting on regret, there’s very little substance to “Dust” once you strip away its style; its characters, although vessels for a tale of broken camaraderie, seldom feel tethered to their immediate circumstances.\n\n\tThe film is incredibly, even magnificently, stylish, but beyond its initial presentation, there just isn’t very much guiding the story in any novel or exciting ways — beyond, perhaps, thematic echoes of how the less prim-and-proper tech bros of today might be pulling a fast one too. Both lead performers command the camera’s attention — the long, dimly-lit scenes of the second half would immediately die in the hands of lesser actors — but there are only so many dimensions each man can conjure when the story seldom appears headed toward anything meaningful. It culminates with neither catharsis nor irony, but instead treads a noncommittal middle ground of gonzo sentimentality that, fittingly, might make you look back on the film and wish things had turned out differently.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapan‘s premium video-on-demand sector achieved $7.2 billion in total revenue during 2025, marking a 15% year-over-year increase, according to a new report from Media Partners Asia. The growth reflects platforms’ increasing reliance on diversified revenue models, including ad-supported subscription options, alongside greater investment in domestic programming and live sports rights.\n\n\tThree services control half the market’s total revenue. Netflix holds the top revenue position with 22% of the category, while Prime Video leads in subscriber count with 19.3 million users, benefiting from cross-promotion within its broader retail and e-commerce operations. Local service U-Next commands 12% of revenue through an integrated content package that combines streaming video with manga, music and exclusive sports programming, creating competitive advantages against international rivals.\n\t\n\n\tSubscription video platforms collectively gained 4 million subscribers during 2025, pushing the total to 67.9 million when including YouTube Premium. Netflix drove the largest gains, powered by its partnership renewal with telecom major KDDI in November 2025 and strong performance from Japanese originals. Sports streamer DAZN also contributed meaningfully through its bundled inclusion in telecom player NTT Docomo’s ahamo Max mobile service, while the Disney+/Hulu Japan combined package expanded its reach.\n\n\n\tTotal viewing across premium VOD reached 8.1 billion hours in 2025. Broadcaster-backed free streaming service TVer captured the highest share of total watch time at 23%, though Netflix achieved superior per-subscriber engagement, with users averaging close to 20 hours monthly on the service.\n\t\n\n\tLocal productions continue to anchor viewer interest, accounting for 80% of all streaming hours. Animation proved particularly powerful, with “Spy x Family” ranking as the most-watched title in Q4 2025. Japanese live-action series and variety formats dominated TVer’s AVOD programming, while Netflix delivered “Last Samurai Standing” and Amazon contributed “The Golden Combi” and “Love Transit” as notable original productions. American content still reached a significant audience, with 28% of users watching U.S. series and films such as “Wicked,” “A Minecraft Movie” and Netflix’s “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tMajor platforms are now prioritizing live event programming. Netflix will enter the sports streaming arena by securing exclusive rights to the 2026 World Baseball Classic, TVer plans to carry selected competitions from the 2026 Winter Olympics, and U-Next is expanding its sports portfolio with upcoming coverage of women’s golf majors and English Premier League soccer through 2028.\n\n\t“Japan’s premium VOD market has reached a critical maturation point,” said Dhivya T, lead analyst and head of insights at MPA. “Growth is no longer just about net adds, but sophisticated monetization through ad-tier yields, telco bundling, and vertically integrated ecosystems. The entry of major players like Netflix into live sports and the continued dominance of local anime and drama suggest that the next phase of competition will hinge on event-driven engagement and premium local storytelling.”\n\n\tThe data comes from MPA’s Japan Online Video Consumer Insights & Analytics report, produced using AMPD, the company’s measurement platform that tracks viewing behavior across mobile devices and connected television.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” star Wunmi Mosaku recently told The Sunday Times that she hasn’t been able to enjoy her recent Oscar nomination for best supporting actress because of the deaths of Alex Pretti and Renée Good, two American citizens who were shot and killed by federal agents in Minnesota.\n\n\t“I’ve not been able to celebrate because of what’s going on right now, with the killings of Renée Good and Alex Pretti by ICE agents in Minnesota and the kidnapping of a five-year-old boy,” Mosaku said. “It’s difficult to hold both the nomination and the news because one feels beautiful and one is so dark and heavy; truly dystopian — how can I possibly go out and buy some drinks and enjoy the moment?”\n\t\n\n\tShe added, “[My husband] is not as shocked as I am at the news. There’s a very strange American psyche where terrible things happen and people still can go to work the next day, whereas I’m floored for a week and think, ‘How are people going to crowded places when this has just happened?’ I want a cocoon. My reaction reminds him that this is not normal.”\n\n\n\tMosaku isn’t the only one in Hollywood speaking out against ICE and Donald Trump‘s immigration crackdown. On Feb. 5, Jamie Lee Curtis told Variety that “the ICE situation is out of control.” She slammed the actions of federal agents in Minnesota and beyond as an “abhorrence.”\n\n\t“Every day I think I’m not going to be shocked anymore and then I’m shocked,” Curtis said. “It’s just inhuman. It is inhuman the way this administration is treating its citizens and its constituents and people in need. It’s an abhorrence what they’re doing. The ICE situation is out of control. It’s simply a distraction so that we don’t pay attention to the Epstein files.”\n\t\n\n\tWhoopi Goldberg got visibly emotional in a Jan. 26 episode of “The View,” during which she called out Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and border patrol commander Gregory Bovino over the death of Pretti.\n\n\t“Kristi Noem, you can’t justify this. Mr. Bovino, you can’t justify this,” she said. “You can’t justify either one, and we all see it and we see you for what you are. You all have blood on your hands.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSavannah Guthrie took to Instagram on Sunday afternoon to share another message with her mother’s kidnapper. She calmly told the perpetrator that it’s “never too late to do the right thing.”\n\n\t“It’s been two weeks since our mom was taken, and I just wanted to come on and say that we still have hope and we still believe,” she said. “And I wanted to say to whoever has her or knows where she is, that it’s never too late, and you’re not lost or alone, and it is never too late to do the right thing.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added, “We are here. We believe. And we believe in the essential goodness of every human being, and it’s never too late.”\n\n\n\n\tNancy Guthrie went missing on Feb. 1, and the following day, the Pima County Sheriff’s department declared her disappearance a crime after finding “concerning” evidence at her Arizona residence. On Friday night, authorities said that investigators were searching Nancy Guthrie’s home and the surrounding area for clues.\n\n\t On Thursday, the FBI announced it raised the reward from $50,000 to $100,000 for anyone with information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie. The agency also released identifying details about the suspect who was caught on camera trying to break into Nancy Guthrie’s home. The possible kidnapper was described as “a male, approximately 5’9” – 5’10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack.”\n\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department on Tuesday detained a person for questioning in connection with the case. Authorities told ABC News that they were preparing to search a location in connection with the detainee. The individual was later released.\n\t\n\n\tSavannah Guthrie has posted several videos on Instagram in hopes of rallying help for her mother. On Feb. 9, she posted a video pleading with her supporters to aid in the search.\n\n\t“We believe our mom is still out there,” Savannah Guthrie said in the video. “We need your help. Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home — trying to find her. She was taken and we don’t know where. And we need your help.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s early in 2026, but August Ponthier‘s full-length debut album, “Everywhere Isn’t Texas,” should still be remembered 11 or 12 months from now as one of the year’s best fresh starts. There are a number of ways in which the slightly country-tinged pop album does or doesn’t count as a beginning for Ponthier. It’s a coming-of-age record, but, at 29, Ponthier points out that it’s a queer coming-of-age record, reflecting the kind of experience that may come later for those who take some turns before fully finding themselves, as they did. \n\t\n\n\tThe “they” pronoun, incidentally, is one of several things that are new for Ponthier, who prior to this released three EPs with a “she” identity and distinctly feminine first name. Only during the mastering part of finishing the album did Ponthier decide to make the leap into coming out as non-binary, partly because of being too proud of the record to release it under a now-dead name that would have compromised the joy of putting out something so satisfyingly self-revelatory. Ponthier already had a lot of notoriety with the previous name — including a Q&A last year in Variety about a then-new single, “Karaoke Queen,” which reflected their experience of being dropped by Interscope in 2024 after three years. But nothing cements going indie like the independence that comes with dropping some baggage of one’s own, as they did in October with the announcement of these personal changes, to the surprise but not chagrin of fans who already knew Ponthier as a maverick spirit as well as gifted singer-songwriter.\n\n\n\tPreviously, some had referred to Ponthier as being like “a lesbian Sabrina Carpenter.” Do easy tags like that become any more complicated now that they are out as non-binary? It’s possible, but the songs — deeply personal, whether or not they were co-written with craftspeople like Amy Allen and Dan Wilson — should have the boundary-crossing appeal to connect with mainstream pop fans of all stripes. (Or fans of Texas music… Ponthier’s still at least a little bit country, they insist.) Variety caught up with Ponthier again recently, first at friend Brandi Carlile‘s Girls Just Wanna Weekend festival, then by phone from their native Texas, to discuss “Everywhere Isn’t Texas,” an album it’s easy to imagine impacting \n\t\n\n\tWhether in the flesh or on video, people have seen you duet with Brandi Carlile a lot. She has been a real champion of yours, and she sang duets with you when she had you open for her at Red Rocks, and last year and this year at her Girls Just Wanna Weekend festival. So it’s not unusual at this point for you to be on stage with Brandi.\n\n\tIt is unusual! It’s unusual in how I think back to a year that I was really going through a lot of difficult feelings about who I am or what I can do and what’s limiting or not limiting. And every time I would shower, I would sing “The Joke,” because it is a song that hits me the hardest when it comes to wanting to encourage myself. I had never met her before, so after a year of singing that song all the time, when she reached out to me after I got dropped by my major label, I remember my partner was like, “You manifested it by singing the song every day for like a year.” So when I’m up there singing with her, I think about that time. I also think about how when I sing with her, I feel present in a way that I’m not really used to. It is an adrenaline rush to be on stage, but for some reason when I sing with her, I feel completely calm and in my body, and she has that effect on me because I know that she really accepts me. Even though now I know her on more of a personal level, she is a hero, to not just me, but so many people in our community and in in the world. It’s surreal, and it will never get old. I could sing with her a hundred times and I doubt it would ever feel any less crazy.\n\n\tShe learned about you through Elton John, who was already championing you, right?\n\n\tYeah, I was playing a show at the Rooftop at P17 (in New York) opening up for the Japanese House, and I had found out the night before that I was getting dropped, which was devastating and my worst fear. I was lying on the floor of the green room being like, “I have no idea how I’m going to do this show.” And I checked my messages and she had messaged me just saying, “Hey, Elton showed me your music. It’s special and I hope to meet you in the future.” And even though she had no idea anything about my life or anything about me being dropped at all, it was exactly what I needed to hear in that moment. And ever since then, like when I play Red Rocks, I feel the spirit of a community behind me. It’s a huge honor to be recognized by people who not only make me want to be an artist, but made me wanna keep going and wanna keep being alive and wanna keep feeling like there was hope when it felt like there was almost nothing else.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAugust Ponthier ‘Everywhere Isn’t Texas’ cover art\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe song she keeps singing with you most often is “Everywhere Isn’t Texas,” which happens to be the title track of the new album that’s coming out. That one in particular really struck a chord with Brandi, as it does with many people who hear it.\n\n\tLast year when I was at Girls Just Wanna for the very first time, I had no idea she was going to come watch my set, but I really wanted her to hear that one, so I was over the moon that she just happened to watch the part of my set that “Everywhere Isn’t Texas” was in. And she gave me a standing ovation, which made me want to scream, cry and throw up, all combined. But I think the reason that that song connected with her is because she is an artist that makes protest music; her whole last record is protest music. And I also have that thing where if something resonates with me, I need to talk about it through the actual thing that I make.\n\n\tThat song is about how I grew up in Texas and I felt like I loved it, but it did not love me back. I felt like I was being pushed out, kind of like the way white blood cells will push out an infection, and I didn’t want to feel like I was diseased or wrong or made wrong. And because I can’t stop thinking about home and all the things that happen there, because Texas is a leader in politics, it became the title of the album. It is the most complicated and deep love of my life. And the fact that it resonated with Brandi, and she’s not someone that’s afraid to talk about politics or to stand up for what she believes in, it means a lot that a major artist would be so brave and talk about a state that is really polarizing and sing alongside me.\n\n\tI was opening up for Maren Morris a year and some change ago. We both went to the same college, at different times, but we’re both from a similar area in Texas. And when when I performed the song on her tour for the first time, she was like, “It takes a lot of guts to sing a song about a state that people love to love and love to hate at the same time.” I weirdly had never even considered that, because I always have just spoken my mind, but it’s not lost on me how grateful I should be and how important it is that other people from Texas or artists that are involved in country music, specifically, can appreciate the song and can discuss things we love in a nuanced way. We can love something and be critical of it at the same time and want better for it. And we are in an era where I think protest music is important, and I hope that a lot more artists would follow suit and make music that doesn’t just allude to the things that they care about, but does specifically talk about the things that keep them up at night and the people that they love.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tLet’s talk about your journey and how it did or didn’t coincide with the making of this album. You had previously been very out as lesbian, but in October, you came out as non-binary, with a new first name and identity. How much did that overlap with the final stages of your album?\n\n\tThe music was fully done. The last step was just mastering a few of the songs. So it was all written before I had even really told myself confidently who I was. I mean, this journey started when I was really young, but me being conscious and awake and aware of it, to the point where I was ready to say it out loud or to want to change my name, was this past year. It’s something that, in my mind, I thought I could repress forever, and then all of a sudden I couldn’t do it anymore. It was making me miserable and making me feel so disconnected from myself. I felt like I was aging rapidly in a body and identity that I didn’t understand. And then I just said the truth out loud, and now I feel like there’s a million doors that could open. I feel, like, 20 years younger. Weirdly, I just feel a totally different sense of hope that I didn’t have before. And this album is a series of songs that kind of feel like clues, in order to figure out maybe what was gonna happen with me coming out as non-binary. But also, I’m so proud of these songsthat I couldn’t stand not putting the name that I know now as mine on it. I didn’t want to wake up a year or five years from now and regret not saying that August made that album. So, thankfully, the album was actually a good pressure cooker for being like, “I need to do what is right.” And I’m so glad because now that I’m August, every day is better. Colors are brighter. I am excited when people say my name. I want to introduce myself to people. And that’s just not how I felt before.\n\n\tYou had experienced a lot of acceptance as a very out lesbian singer, but did it feel bolder to go what may be an extra step for people?\n\n\tI’d come out as a lesbian and I was like, “OK, amazing. I am a pro at this!” But no, it’s totally different. I think gender is something that’s so deeply personal for people and it just hits a completely different nerve … So I would say across the board, for queer people and straight people, the reactions have been varied. Gender is a very personal place that hits people in a different part of their heart. And I’m very lucky that I have an amazing support system. I think if I did this like any sooner, I wouldn’t have been ready for it, which is why it happened when it happened. I think a lot of people don’t fully understand how to talk to me, or people have never heard of a non-binary person before, or people think non-binary people have to be super masculine, or there are signs or qualifications. And I’m happy to share my thoughts when I feel comfortable, like I’m doing right now. But no, it’s been difficult — but 100% worth it. If someone chooses not to see me for who I am, that’s a completely different feeling than if I’m fully repressing myself, because now I can say “Well, you just don’t know me well” or “There’s something wrong with how you treat people,” instead of me saying that there’s something deeply made wrong within me, which I don’t believe anymore.\n\t\n\n\tSome people might have been surprised just because they assume that non-binary equates with butch or something, and that has not been your imagery at all.\n\n\tThere’s like lots of different people who have different genders who realize that non-binary is the right and most true gender for them. I never wanted to feel like I was compensating for being feminine, because there are things about femininity that I appreciate. In the same way, there’s things about masculinity that I really appreciate. There’s no one type of non-binary person. And really, even when people ask me like, “Oh, so you’re, like, outside of gender — you don’t like gender” or something, I’m like, “No, non-binary is my own thing. It’s my own gender that is mine. I love who I am and just because it’s not replicated somewhere else doesn’t mean that it’s not real and what I feel is absolutely me.” I will say there was a period, especially last year at Girls Just Wanna, where I was growing my hair out the longest I could ever grow it out, because I thought I would like it and could get used to it. I was wearing a lot of dresses. … Do I want to cut all my hair off now? No, because the shag is what feels good about me. It’s really about doing what feels right and letting myself be my own North Star, which is a permission that a lot of people are not good at giving themselves. So it has been a personal growth journey in every single area of my life. There’s not one thing it hasn’t touched, because it really just is about believing yourself. It’s very weirdly spiritual in a way that I haven’t exercised in a long time.\n\n\tI did just take new press images because I did want it to reflect how I feel. I still feel like there’s no one look for non-binary people. But I’m happy that I get to put my best foot forward, which just happens to be in a shoe attached to a suit.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAugust Ponthier\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTanner Abel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHow does it work when you have like a bunch of releases out there under your old name? Are you trying to get those credits changed? And do you object to people using your dead name to refer to your old work?\n\n\tIf people have my records or T-shirts or things like that, I’m OK with them wearing it around. I’m OK with people having things that have my old name on them, because those are things I’m proud of making. But I don’t like it when people use my old name in conversation. It’s just so important to me that people respect the boundary of like, this is my first name, when they’re talking to me or about me. And then also my pronouns are big for me. So I really appreciate when people make the effort to do that because it’s so early for me that it just shows that they really do see me and understand and care no matter what I look like or no matter if they knew me before. I love my name. My dead name — my old name, I call it “redacted” — I’m glad that she carried me up until this point, but it’s kind of only for my memories and my family’s memories, not something that I really wanna carry with me.\n\t\n\n\tI’m so glad that I got to change my name on pretty much everything. The biggest one for me was the Lord Huron song that I’m on (“I Lied”). I didn’t know if it was possible to change my name. And so when I called Ben (Schneider) and I was like, “Hi, I’m changing my name, I’m coming out — what do we think? Is it gonna be really annoying to change this?,” he was so supportive and immediately was like, “I’m on it. I’ll talk to Spotify, Apple Music, everyone, immediately,” and he has been a huge support to me. So that was a dream come true, to know that we could change that. It’s interesting to be a public figure already by the time that I wanted to make those changes. I looked it up, and not a lot of people have made the first-name change mid-career. It was a lot of “Let’s see what we can even do and what’s even possible.” There’s still some platforms and some things that the name hasn’t switched over yet, but honestly, the price of just having people call me by the new name is 100% worth it. But it was kind of uncharted territory.\n\n\tThere’s just so many links to my past already that I don’t want to say that it never happened, because that was my name for a long time. But I think just for public consciousness, it’s important to me that people don’t view me as August-with-an-asterisk. I would say to anybody who’s thinking about it, it is worth it. At the end of the day, people change their names all the time, whether it’s a stage name or a new group or for whatever reason. And there is nothing better than not only being called August, but feeling like August. That not only comes with time, but people saying it a lot and really seeing me.  I used to think, “Oh, well, if 90% of the time people are referring to me incorrectly or don’t understand my whole deal, it’ll never be worth it for that 10%,” but I was completely wrong. The 10% of being affirmed or the 10% people completely getting it up, it is 100% worth it, because it accesses a part of my brain and accesses a part of my joy that I have genuinely never felt before. It’s overwhelming, and it’s just a sense of brightness that I never got to experience socially with anybody.\n\n\n\n\n\tDo you feel like this album is primarily for the queer community? A lot of the songs are more universal. And probably the dirty secret of most people who are hardcore music fans is that they feel like outsiders, which would make some of these songs speak to them, even if they’re not outsiders in the same way you have been.\n\t\n\n\tAbsolutely. Obviously, the queer community is like my heartbeat, but I think a lot of people can relate. I feel like people who are like just simply neurodivergent or feel like they’re wired differently can relate. People who just grew up in a way where it took time and understanding for them to be a part of their own advocacy, standing up for what they want and being their own cheerleader, I think that’s kind of my community. So I really appreciate a fan who it took work for them to stand up and say, “Hi, this is who I am.” I think that through line between all the people I care about is that even though it was hard to get there, they’re so proud and can’t help but be themselves. And that’s the type of person that I want to speak to.\n\n\tThe cowboy and alien imagery has been part of all the projects you’ve put out, not just the new album.\n\n\tThe cowboy side is my Texan side, my side that loves comfort and sameness and community and feeling at home. Then the alien side is me feeling like I didn’t get the rule book that everyone got where everyone kind of understands how things are supposed to be. It’s also the side of me that feels like I crave something else out there that is bigger than what’s around me. Those two sides have always been at war with each other. They’ve also held hands at times, and helped me make a record like this. So it felt right to bring them back.\n\n\tYou deal with an interesting range of subject matter, from family issues to dealing with the desire for fame.\n\n\tIt is a coming-of-age album. I’m obviously not a teenager, but it’s a a queer coming-of-age, which happens later in life. And it’s also me examining how I feel about where I grew up. I want it to be something that can be really fun, and I want it to be something that can be really devastating. I want it to feel like something that’s kind of steeped in the tradition of country music or folk music, but I also want it to feel like something that can be fresh and looking forward.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAugust Ponthier\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTanner Abel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGenre-wise, people may think country, because of the cowboy gear, and you’re unabashed in your love for the Chicks and things like that. But it’s not a country album. It’s a pretty pop album.\n\n\tIt’s not a full, straight-ahead country album, but I think the storytelling of country music, the instrumentation of country music, and even the singing quality of country music is present on it. I don’t think it would be a fully me debut album if it wasn’t a combination of things. But one day I would love to make a true, straight-ahead country album. But for this, it is that cowboy and alien dichotomy. It is country music and pop music; it’s country and rock.\n\t\n\n\tIn the songs “Angry Man” and “Bloodline,” which are probably sequenced back-to-back on the album for a reason, you appear to be alluding to some rough family stuff that you’re wondering whether you have to take forward with you in your life. That’s not the stuff everybody in the world writes about. Was that hard for you to get into that territory?\n\n\tYes, I’m very private about my childhood. I’m very private about the struggles that I faced growing up, because it’s from such a deep and painful place that it feels sacred in a way. I also never wanted to feel like I was ungrateful or that it was a betrayal for me to talk about my truth. But, all in all, this has been an album of me telling the truth, even if the truths are complicated and nuanced. And I don’t think I could tell an accurate picture of what it was like growing up in Texas without talking about those things. I’m very aware that the ingredients of who I am as a person make someone that struggles with mental health, and make someone who struggles to feel stable and secure and loved. It’s something I think about all the time, and I pour so much energy into trying to find a new normal. For me to not write about that would be really disingenuous to how much space that’s taken up in my brain over so many years. But yeah, I’m terrified. Those two songs are the scariest things I’ve ever released. And I’m still scared. I mean, even talking about it now, it’s just hard to tell the truth about things, people, places that you really, really love.\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the lighter side, you have the song “Handsome,” which points — humorously — toward your non-binary identity, even though you weren’t there yet when you wrote it. You sing, “Handsome, handsome boy, the world loves you / Don’t know if I wanna be with you or be you.” One verse says, “How are you human? / Painted nails on gentle males / A winning combination / It’s painful and it’s shameful / I’m a poor imitation.” But you’ve said some people misunderstood the song, when you first released it a while ago or were playing it live… they saw it as you possibly really crushing on guys.\n\n\tYeah, the people that get it get it, I guess. I think that “Handsome” was me kind of dipping my toe into the water of: Can anyone believe that I have something more complex going on than what they assume or what they see? And when the answer was kind of mixed — a lot of people thought that the song was about something that it wasn’t — I think that it really just illustrated for me that I need to be explicit about my truth and my identity… Songs can change your life, but the way that “Handsome” changed my life was, it put a lot of pieces together for me. And I think that that is more important than approval from other people.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tIn the spoken bridge, you put some celebrity names in there: “Timothée Chalamet, Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac… There’s a new ‘It-Boy’ in town, and she’s a lesbian!”\n\n\tI tried a few different ones in different cities. Basically what happened is, I went on tour with an artist named Niki at the end of 2024, and that was when I started performing “Handsome” for the first time. There was a bit of an instrumental section in the song and, live, it was kind of a bit of dead space. So I would just make jokes on stage, and then it turned into this thing where I would just list It-Boys — specifically, It-Boys who partake in pretty feminine fashion… And it just turned into something that I said at every show, and then it turned into something I had to put on the record, because I loved it so much and I thought it was so fun. There’s some serious tear-jerk stuff on the album, but I also think the highs are really high as well. And I wanted a bit of my sense of humor to also be present on the album, because that’s how I got through all of the hard stuff.\n\n\tLet’s go back to the song “Everywhere Isn’t Texas.” I don’t know if you’re speaking to yourself or actually literally speaking to an audience when you sing, “You don’t have to to stay in Texas.” But at the end it feels like you have a heart for people who are not able to move to New York like you did.\n\n\tI was definitely speaking to myself when I wrote the song. As time has gone on, I think as artists we have to have some kind of responsibility for putting out songs that advise people what to do or or offer other pathways. My fear with the song was that people would think that I thought that leaving is the one solution that fixes every problem, and that’s not how I feel at all. I think that leaving is something that only a few people can do. I think also leaving is something that has its own pros and cons. Leaving didn’t fix every problem for me. At the time, it was what was right because opportunity arose. And I felt like I needed to distance myself from home for a lot of reasons that didn’t even just have to do with politics or identity. But I think that’s why it’s really important that I put the reprise on the album, because “Everywhere Isn’t Texas” is the first thing that I wrote for this album, and the reprise is the last thing that I wrote. The reprise is about the people that stay and the people that survive, and what makes Texans true Texans. To me, that’s the people that fight through adversity and make it a more diverse and interesting place. I wanted to have both on the album, because I think it would’ve been irresponsible to just say, “If something is hard, leave.” But I think for some people, namely the parents of trans children who can leave, or people who have experienced violence that have the opportunity to leave, I do think that’s a message that they shouldn’t feel ashamed for taking. We all have to make choices about our own safety, and for some people that is appropriate.\n\t\n\n\tI will say this: I’m in Texas right now. I’ve gone back to Texas and I’ve been more involved in Texas than I have ever been able to, and that’s not a coincidence… I have worked for the last two-ish years with an organization called TENT (Transgender Education Network of Texas), and they’re constantly at the capitol…\n\n\tWhen I’m telling people, “Leave, if that’s what feels safe. And if you stay, I still wanna make it a better place,” I really believe that. Texas is not something that’s in my rear view. It’s actually all I think about, and it’s why the album is about it. It’s why I keep returning and it’s why I keep speaking out politically, even though, to many people, that may not be advantageous to their careers. I care about it really deeply, and I think the album is about holding nuance — two truths — loving something and criticizing it at the same time.\n\n\n\n",

Saxon sued Kanye, claiming he was hired in September 2021 as project manager, caretaker and 24/7 security for Kanye's Malibu property. In the lawsuit, Saxon alleges he worked brutal 16 hour days and was forced to sleep on the floor using a coat as makeshift bedding while overseeing the remodel.\n      \n    \n          Saxon claims things spiraled in November 2021 when Kanye allegedly demanded he remove all the home's windows and electricity. According to the suit, Saxon raised safety concerns, warning the moves posed \"extreme danger,\" especially after Kanye allegedly insisted on bringing large generators inside something Saxon feared could spark a fire hazard.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He also claims Kanye threatened him, saying he'd be considered \"an enemy\" if he didn't comply, and told him, \"If you don't do what I say, you're not going to work for me.\" Saxon says he refused and was fired on the spot.\n      \n    \n          Tony's suing for unpaid wages and labor code violations and potentially dragging Bianca into the courtroom drama.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Kanye has denied all allegations. In a November 2023 filing, his attorney argued that even if Saxon suffered damages -- which Kanye does not admit -- they were caused by other parties, not Kanye, and any liability should be reduced accordingly. Kanye also claimed Saxon performed work without his knowledge and asked the court to toss the lawsuit entirely.\n      \n    \n          Stay tuned ...\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

I think it's really good for him, and I think they bring out the best in each other.\"\n      \n    \n          Jason and Jessica were together for just over a year.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jason Oppenheim\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Breakups\n              \n                          \n                Selling Sunset\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

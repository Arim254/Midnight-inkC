    "description": "\n\tIndia’s Kerala government has directed organizers of the 30th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) to proceed with all scheduled screenings,",
    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Kerala government has directed organizers of the 30th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) to proceed with all scheduled screenings, escalating a standoff with New Delhi after the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting denied censor exemption clearance to 19 selected films.\n\n\tThe decision follows days of disruption at the state-backed international festival, which opened this year at Kerala state capital Thiruvananthapuram with a consciously political tone reflected in its programming choices and opening-night events, and has triggered widespread criticism from political leaders and film figures who argue the intervention cuts directly across the festival’s curatorial intent. The disruption also sparked protests from festival attendees. \n\t\n\n\tKerala culture minister Saji Cherian, a senior leader of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) coalition led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), in an Instagram post described the Center’s denial of exemptions as an unjustified intrusion into the state’s cultural sphere.\n\n\n\t“The denial of ‘Censor Exemption’ by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to 19 films selected for screening at the 30th International Film Festival of Kerala is an unnecessary intrusion into Kerala’s cultural sphere. This anti-democratic approach cannot be accepted,” Cherian wrote.\n\n\tHe said IFFK, now three decades old, is among the country’s most important film festivals and warned that the state would not allow any attempt to undermine its legacy or progressive character.\n\t\n\n\t“The Kerala government will continue to take a strong stand against such narrow-minded and anti-democratic positions directed at artistic expression,” Cherian said, adding that the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy had been instructed to take immediate steps to ensure that all films are screened as originally scheduled, without disruption.\n\n\tCongress MP Shashi Tharoor, who represents Thiruvananthapuram and whose party also sits in opposition at the Center, said the denial of exemptions had created an “unprecedented crisis” for the festival and exposed deep inconsistencies in India’s film censorship regime.\n\n\t“The unprecedented crisis facing 30th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), because of the denial of the mandatory ‘Censor Exemption’ to 19 selected films, has forced the cancellation of screenings and sparked widespread criticism regarding the consistency and logic of film censorship in India,” Tharoor wrote on X.\n\n\tTharoor said the denied titles ranged across contemporary political cinema, historical classics and retrospective selections. They included several Palestinian films, among them “All That’s Left of You,” “Palestine 36,” “Once Upon a Time in Gaza,” “Wajib” and “Eagles of the Republic,” as well as Sergei Eisenstein’s 1925 Soviet silent classic “Battleship Potemkin,” retrospective works by Mauritanian filmmaker Abderrahmane Sissako such as “Timbuktu” and “Bamako,” and titles including “The Hour of the Furnaces,” “Red Rain” and the Spanish film “Beef.”\n\n\tThe controversy has been sharpened by the fact that “Palestine 36” had already screened as the festival’s opening film, underscoring how central Palestinian cinema was to this year’s programming rather than a peripheral sidebar. Other titles were subsequently halted or delayed as the exemption process stalled.\n\n\tTharoor pointed to what he described as glaring inconsistencies, noting that several of the denied films had previously been screened — and even awarded — at Indian festivals.\n\n\t“‘Wajib’ (2017) is not new to India. In fact, it won the Golden Crow Pheasant (Suvarna Chakoram), at the 22nd IFFK in 2017. Its denial in 2025, at the very same festival where it was once celebrated, suggests arbitrary & inconsistent decision-making,” he wrote.\n\t\n\n\tHe added that “Timbuktu” was screened in the International Competition section at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) Goa in 2014, a festival organized by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting itself, while “Battleship Potemkin,” now approaching its centenary, has been shown for decades at Indian film institutes, societies and festivals.\n\n\t“To deny clearance to a classic like ‘Battleship Potemkin’ … suggests cinematic illiteracy,” Tharoor wrote, arguing that the rejection of titles such as “Beef” and the anti-colonial “The Hour of the Furnaces” reflected a “lack of application of mind.”\n\n\tUnder existing rules, international film festivals are granted a special censor exemption to screen foreign films without certification, with the Ministry of External Affairs consulted on diplomatic sensitivities. Tharoor suggested that concerns linked to Palestinian-themed titles may have influenced the decision, a rationale he questioned sharply.\n\n\t“Our relations with Israel are hardly likely to be damaged by a film screening.” he wrote.\n\n\tThe controversy has also touched Indian cinema. “Santosh,” the U.K.’s India-set submission for the Academy Awards, was among the titles affected by the certification impasse. The film, which was due an Indian theatrical release several months ago, is yet to receive certification. Its director, Sandhya Suri, is serving on the IFFK international competition jury. \n\n\tTharoor said he personally intervened with Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw at the request of festival chair Resul Pookutty, Oscar winner for “Slumdog Millionaire,” resulting in some clearances being granted, while the remaining films are awaiting approval from the Ministry of External Affairs.\n\n\t“In short, the denials defy logic, are disheartening to all who seek to promote India on the world stage, and diminish our cultural standing both abroad and at home,” Tharoor wrote.\n",

    "description": "\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos made a surprise appearance at Canal+‘s The Original+ showcase in Paris on Tuesday, seeking to calm French industry fears",
    "body": "\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos made a surprise appearance at Canal+‘s The Original+ showcase in Paris on Tuesday, seeking to calm French industry fears about the streaming giant’s $83 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. by pledging to maintain the studio’s traditional theatrical distribution model.\n\n\tSpeaking with Maxime Saada, chair and CEO of Canal+, Sarandos sought to reassure the French market about Netflix’s intentions following the bombshell deal that sent shockwaves through the exhibition sector.\n\t\n\n\t“Our intentions when we buy Warner Brothers will be to continue to release Warner Brothers studio movies in theaters with the traditional windows,” Sarandos said during the conversation. “Then those movies would flow through the Canal+ output deal. That’s very exciting for us.”\n\n\n\tThe comments mark a significant shift in messaging for Netflix, which has long clashed with theatrical exhibitors over its preference for simultaneous or shortened theatrical windows. Sarandos emphasized that Netflix never previously engaged in traditional theatrical distribution “because we just never owned the actual distribution mechanism before.”\n\n\t“We were monetizing the movies through our own subscription, because that’s how we were growing the business the fastest,” he explained. “We started looking at this company, you see things like the television studio that produces for other people, the studio that puts out movies in theaters – first, all those things, those are very good businesses. They’re very healthy businesses, and we didn’t want to do anything that would harm the value of those businesses.”\n\t\n\n\tSarandos stressed that Warner Bros. Studios will continue to operate independently under Netflix ownership, releasing movies traditionally in cinema. “I know it’s very important to the people in France and around the world that people have the opportunity to see the films in cinema, and we intend to support it fully,” he said.\n\n\tThe appearance comes as French exhibitors have raised alarm about the acquisition’s potential impact on the country’s theatrical ecosystem. Richard Patry, president of France’s National Exhibitors Association, told Variety last week that the guild “will fight back” and called for antitrust regulators to scrutinize the deal carefully.\n\n\tFrance represents a particularly complex market for Netflix, where stringent windowing regulations require the streamer to wait 15 months after theatrical releases before offering films on its platform. The country’s regulatory environment has been a source of ongoing tension, leading Netflix to abandon the Cannes Film Festival competition after 2017.\n\n\tDuring the Canal+ conversation, Saada acknowledged the partnership’s evolution, noting that Netflix and Canal+ have maintained a relationship that has been “80% partners and maybe 20% competitors.” He questioned whether the balance might shift as Netflix expands into live programming and sports.\n\n\tSarandos downplayed competitive concerns, emphasizing that Netflix’s sports strategy focuses on “eventized and specialized” content like boxing matches and holiday football games rather than full league rights. “Our primary mission is film and television and increasing the games, but I don’t see us being flipping from 80 to 20 or 20 to 80,” he said.\n\n\tSaada credited Netflix with expanding France’s paid television market, noting that the streamer’s arrival helped increase market penetration from 30% to 75%. “You basically doubled the market size in France,” he told Sarandos.\n\n\tOn the Warner Bros. acquisition specifically, Saada expressed surprise given Netflix’s historical stance as “more builders than buyers.” Sarandos explained that the deal addresses gaps in Netflix’s relatively young library and production capabilities.\n\n\t“We’ve only been doing original programming about 12 years, and we’ve been moving very fast,” Sarandos said. “So building a library as fast as we can, building out IP as fast as we can. Our library only extends back a decade, where Warner Brothers extends back 100 years. They know a lot about things that we haven’t ever done, like theatrical distribution.”\n\t\n\n\tHe noted that Warner Bros. possesses valuable knowledge in areas Netflix has not explored, including the television studio’s third-party production business and traditional theatrical distribution infrastructure.\n\n\tDespite France’s challenging regulatory environment for streamers, Sarandos offered a nuanced view of operating in the market during the upfronts conversation. “I would say that France is a very complicated place to work, but love is complicated,” he said. “We love France.”\n\n\tIn a separate conversation with Variety on Monday night at the red carpet premiere of “Emily in Paris” Season 5, Sarandos expressed his affection for France despite the country’s stringent regulations on streaming platforms.\n\n\tSarandos also addressed the streaming landscape’s evolving competition during the upfronts, acknowledging that platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram are vying for the same screen time as traditional television and film. “What we’re doing constantly is trying to fight for attention. We’re trying to fight for joy. We’re trying to create joy with people so picking the program and executing it perfectly for them, so that they love it and want to come back for more,” Sarandos said. \n\n\t“We’re competing against all kinds of things that are ending up on that screen now, including YouTube. I think that if you look at YouTube and TikTok and Instagram and all the different things that you could do on a screen, I love that people of all ages still very much enjoy professional films and television, but we have to continue to fight against all the competitors that are coming at us from all different directions and all different business models.” \n\n\tHe added that this competitive landscape explains Netflix’s continued commitment to video games, citing audience demand for interactive content that provides user agency.\n\n\tThe Warner Bros. acquisition faces regulatory approval in both the U.S. and Europe, with French exhibitors among the stakeholders calling for careful antitrust scrutiny. The deal, if approved, would mark one of the largest media consolidations in recent years and fundamentally reshape Netflix’s business model to include traditional theatrical distribution for the first time in the company’s history.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Music Group has promoted Eric Wong to executive vice president of  recorded music, along side his posts as president of East West Records U.S. and president of Warner Music Canada. In this newly elevated role, Wong will spearhead flagship global marketing campaigns and lead global A&R, working closely with WMG’s labels, artists, and their teams. He will remain based in New York, reporting directly to WMG CEO Robert Kyncl.\n\n\tKyncl said: “Since joining WMG’s senior management team five years ago, Eric has been a driving force behind our mission to forge closer collaboration across our recorded music labels and territories around the world. His understanding of the international marketplace, combined with his deep marketing and A&R experience along with key relationships across the industry, makes him ideally suited to take on this expanded role as we continue to elevate our talent on the global stage.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the announcement, in his capacity leading East West Records U.S. over the last year, Wong has expanded the creative bridge across WMG’s global ecosystem — helping align markets, upstream local successes, and guide artists toward broader international opportunities. The label has supported global breakthrough acts, including Punjabi superstar Karan Aujla, whose album P-Pop Culture debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Canadian Albums chart. Since taking over Warner Music Canada in September, Wong has helped strengthen the connection between the US and Canadian markets, appointing new leadership to focus local efforts.\n\n\n\tWong previously served as chief marketing officer of Warner Music’s Recorded Music division, leading its global marketing efforts and strengthening collaboration across more than 70 markets.

    "body": "\n\tHere’s a stat that might shock anyone who isn’t the parent of a Gen Alpha kid: As of October 2025, online gaming platform Roblox boasted more than 151 million global daily active users.\n\n\tFor perspective, that’s more than the number of people with a Disney+ subscription, more than those with an HBO Max subscription, and roughly half the number of Netflix’s global customers.\n\n\tWhile Hollywood giants aren’t necessarily looking for Roblox users to stop spending Robux and instead use their parents’ money to start signing up for streaming subscriptions, they are taking note of these staggering numbers and recognizing the value in collaborating with Roblox and online gaming powerhouse Fortnite (currently averaging between 30 million and 40 million daily users).\n\t\n\n\tTo date, for example, Netflix has unleashed “Squid Game,” “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Stranger Things” in Roblox and Fortnite. Mattel’s Barbie is currently lounging in multiple digital iterations of dream house in Roblox. And everyone’s favorite toon family, The Simpsons, were recently battling their way through Fortnite, a massive collab that stems from Disney’s ties to the game through a $1.5 billion stake made in Fortnite owner Epic Games in 2024.\n\n\n\tDespite the risks involved, most entertainment companies are trying something on these platforms, for better or worse, and seeing what sticks.\n\n\t“It’s a huge, huge opportunity,” Rahul Gautam, EY’s global technology, media and entertainment and telecommunications consulting leader, told Variety. Roblox and Epic Game’s Fortnite in particular “have set a foundation that is eye-opening for IP holders in a way that they both can’t avoid it but also see enormous opportunity for brand extension, for brand engagement, for the development of new IP that may be shoulder IP or adjacent IP that can exist in those worlds. And then, just obviously, from an interesting exposure standpoint, there are few platforms more effective than these online multiplayer environments that are just ubiquitous across generations and geographies.”\n\t\n\n\tAshray Urs, head of live streaming and content creation software company Streamlabs, says the value here is difficult to measure by current standards.\n\n\t“When you think about the kinds of engagement metrics that people traditionally look at, you’re thinking about things like clicks,” Urs says. “How do you weigh that against someone spending 30 minutes exploring your branded world, where every aspect of that is something that you’ve defined, from the music to the visual aesthetic to the actual mechanics and the things you’re interacting with there?”\n\n\tImmersive game platforms, Urs says, opens up “a very deep level of connection, and that’s why brands have been quick to embrace it.” \n\n\t“As brands at the same time are figuring out how to work with creators, and they’re figuring out how to explore this space as well, we’re going to see this very interesting convergence,” he says. “And we already see it with some of the top Fortnite streamers really opening up their own studios that are able to build these experiences, both directly for themselves, to create experiences for players, but also partnering with brands to build their worlds. And I think when we look at the amount of revenue that’s being generated by some of these platforms — Roblox just sharing that it paid creators a billion dollars in revenue this year, and Fortnite is probably approaching a billion dollars in total since they kicked things off — there’s serious money that’s being moved across these platforms.”\n\n\tThe issue entertainment brands have in navigating Roblox and Fortnite is not very different from the problem they had cracking YouTube 15 years ago, according to a source who works with Hollywood studios and consumer brands developing content for the UGC platforms. “Brands saw YouTube, they didn’t know how to approach YouTube, but they knew that they need to be there,” the source says, adding: “It’s the same now. Unless you are AARP, your brand needs to be on Roblox.”\n\n\tSecuring fans of the brands (a.k.a. future customers) on these platforms is essential, even as security itself is a key concern. Notably, a number of recent lawsuits filed against Roblox have accused the platform of facilitating predatory behavior and the company is also the target of one wrongful death suit. There have also been mounting petitions and protests led by parent groups advocating for child safety.\n\t\n\n\tBut the risk is one Gautam says IP holders are willing to take. “Eyes wide open, they are still moving into that space because they’re hoping for, and I think in many respects, they’re feeling like they’re making some progress in having productive dialog around what those guardrails need to be, and what the art of the possible is if, in fact, they can get to a place where both sides agree on those guardrails,” he says.\n\n\tThis month, Roblox began enforcing its rollout of facial age checks as a requirement for all users who want to access communication features in select markets, including Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The gaming platform has also implemented age-based chats to limit communication between minors and adults. The requirements are set to expand to the U.S. and other remaining markets where Roblox’s chat rooms are available by early January 2026.\n\n\tBut some say it’s not enough. \n\n\t“They landed on age verification, because that’s basically saying, ‘Hey, we’re not responsible in case they’re mature enough, old enough,’ and that’s something that they’re trying to do here,” says Ron Kerbs, CEO at Kidas, an AI-powered platform focused on child online safety. “And in some sense, for older gamers, unless it’s a scam, older gamers can deal with those situations by themselves. And the issue is basically the ability of younger players to cheat those systems — to pretend to be older, to use the older siblings, to use facial identity to get into those systems. And we know that it’s happening on TikTok, we know that it’s happening on gaming platforms on Roblox. Platforms are trying to block kids, and kids are going to find ways to open it up.”\n\n\tThe increased safety push, which Roblox has said has been in the works for some time and is not in direct response to recent lawsuits about past incidents, comes as Roblox has opened up its licensing management platform to brands beyond public launch partners Netflix, Lionsgate, Sega and Japanese publishing giant Kodansha. (The offering is meant to streamline the process for IP rights holders to partner with Roblox creators, giving companies control over — and revenue tied to — what was previously often unauthorized user-generated content.) And brands that partner with Roblox right now know they are doing so amid criticism from some consumers, and promises from Roblox that things have changed.\n\t\n\n\t“My kids are still on Roblox, and grow up through Roblox. My 8-year-old son is an avid fan of the Roblox platform, and so I’m invested in making sure that safety is both paramount to us and paramount to Roblox,” Marcus Liassides, Mattel’s senior VP and global head of digital, told Variety in October when the toy brand announced new partnerships with Roblox and Fortnite. \n\n\tMattel has “an 80-year history in protecting children and safety for our fans, and so that will translate into these creative platforms and everything that we do in a digital sense,” says Liassides. “So we spend a lot of time with the Roblox team. We spent time understanding their plans, both things they’ve announced, and things that they’re working on, and whilst we respect and understand the concerns there, we feel that they’re taking it very seriously. They’re being proactive and that won’t let up. It’s a very important endeavor for both them and us to make sure that all of our fans and other players on the platforms are safe, and we feel confident that they’re on the right track to do that.”\n\n\tThe source who works closely with studios to create content for UGC platforms notes that the safety issues Roblox is dealing with are more of an “internet problem,” faced by YouTube, TikTok and more large-scale platforms with social community components. \n\n\t“Roblox, Fortnite, even though we categorize them as gaming, because that’s what you go in and do, they’re in reality, more community than gaming,” the source says. “They are community and social media and interaction. You are there as yourself. You’re engaging with a lot of people, and the activity that you perform is gaming, but it’s not gaming as it used to be known typically, where I’m going to go play a little ‘Call of Duty’ and then I go back to doing my homework. And when you get 150 million people together, there’s going to be bad actors. Now, I’m not saying this to justify that Roblox should not be doing more, but YouTube should be doing more, too, and TikTok should, everyone should be doing more. And none of these companies do more out of their own kind hearts. They need to be pushed into doing more.”\n\n\tA spokesperson for Roblox tells Variety the company engages “regularly with our partners to provide visibility into platform-wide updates and ongoing investments in safety advancements.” The company rep adds: “We have rigorous safety measures in place from advanced AI models to an expertly trained team of thousands moderating our platform 24/7 for inappropriate content.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile the younger-skewing Roblox is both the bigger priority for brands and the bigger safety concern, according to multiple sources Variety spoke with, breaking through on the Disney-backed Fortnite is also a top goal for Hollywood players (most recently filmmaker Quentin Tarantino).\n\n\tOver the past few years, Fortnite has executed collaborations with Warner Bros. for “Superman,” as well as “Scooby-Doo” for its Fortnitemares in-game event, NBCUniversal and Blumhouse for “Black Phone 2,” AMC’s “The Walking Dead,” Netflix for “Stranger Things” and “Wednesday,” Legendary for “Dune,” “Godzilla” and “Kong,” Lionsgate for “Kill Bill” and “John Wick,” and Sony Pictures for “Spiderman No Way Home.”\n\n\t“We work closely with our partners to shape experiences that feel genuine to players,” Epic Games senior VP of global partnerships and monetization Nate Nanzer says. “These collaborations bring their IP, music, and stories into the game, making Fortnite an extension of their world that players can step inside.”\n\n\tLike Roblox, Fortnite also has a growing IP licensing program that allows Fortnite developers to (legally) make their own in-game content with brands including Lego, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” “Squid Game,” “The Walking Dead” and “KPop Demon Hunters,” and forthcoming offerings tied to “Avatar: The Last Air Bender” and Star Wars. Warner Bros. is a big example of a studio who has taken to partnering with Fortnite creators to launch their films, including “Sinners’ in 2024, and this year’s “Weapons” and “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\tWhile many of these studios and streamers are experimenting on both platforms, for Disney, Fortnite is the only option and it’s making good use of the deal: According to Epic Games, the recent “The Simpsons” in-game collaboration brought in more new and returning Fortnite players in 48 hours than the game’s holiday season last year, the Fortnite-Simpsons animated short rose to No. 1 on Disney+’s daily top 10 list, and more than 53 million players dropped into Fortnite’s Springfield in the first two weeks of the Fortnite event.\n\n\tDespite the popularity of Roblox in comparison to Fortnite and regardless of the fact much of Disney’s IP is targeted at the Roblox-aged demo, Variety has confirmed Disney does not have a formal presence on Roblox and is not partnered in any official capacity with Roblox for games or IP licensing. Sources have told Variety this is not just because of Disney’s revenue tied to Epic, but because Disney does not think Roblox is a safe platform at this time.\n\t\n\n\tBut it is Roblox’s desire to appeal to as many brands as possible that could force the safety issue to its furthest point.\n\n\t“By partnering with the brands, that’s gonna get them to a more open, transparent place,” Kidas’ Kerbs says. “A lot of those brands don’t want to be associated with platforms that have scammers, online predators, people who are harassing other players on their platforms. They don’t want to be associated with that. So they are strictly going to tell them, unless you take those people off the platform, we are not going to partner with you.”\n\n\tOf course holding strong on that line will tough, as brands know they need to be on these platforms — if only they can figure out exactly how to be there in a way that seems natural and organic. An age-old problem for marketers that’s only getting more difficult when dealing with Gen Z and Gen Alpha’s life-long access to tech.\n\n\t“I think it’s part of a trend of authenticity. It’s a trend of being in contact with that community that values authenticity,” Incode Technologies CEO and founder Ricardo Amper says. “And of course, it’s also the popularity. But I think as we go forward, there’s some questions of, how should they allow people to have different identities? Should they allow people to have very human looking avatars or changing your name, and should actual agents be part of it? And I think that’s a question that, in some cases, is going to expand their business, and in some other cases will dilute the business. And in order for a platform to be authentic, there has to be a way without breaking privacy and while respecting people’s consents, to be able to make sure that there’s no gaming around the usage of that, which there’s always been.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Oscars have announced the shortlists in 12 categories for the upcoming 98th ceremony.\n\n\tMembers from various branches of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences participated in preliminary voting across multiple categories, including animated short film, documentary feature, documentary short, international feature, live action short, makeup and hairstyling, original score, original song, sound and visual effects. This year also marks the debut of shortlists for achievement in casting and best cinematography, both included for the first time.\n\t\n\n\tThere are three 2025 Student Academy Award-winning films shortlisted: “The Shyness of Trees” (animated short), “Butcher’s Stain” (live action short) and “Dad’s Not Home” (live action short).\n\n\n\tAll designated nominees are still to be determined in some of the shortlisted categories.\n\n\tOscar voting to determine the nominees in all 24 categories opens on Monday, Jan. 12, and concludes on Friday, Jan. 16. Nominations will be announced on Thursday, Jan. 22.\n\n\tConan O’Brien will be returning to host the Oscars ceremony, which will take place on March 15.\n\n\tThe complete list of films on the shortlist is below.\n\n\tMore to come…\n\n\tCasting\n\n\n“Frankenstein” (Netflix) — Robin D. Cook\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Nina Gold\n“Marty Supreme” (A24) — Jennifer Venditti\n“One Battle after Another” (Warner Bros.) — Cassandra Kulukundis\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Gabriel Domingues\n“Sentimental Value” (Neon) — Yngvill Kolset Haga and Avy Kaufman\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Francine Maisler\n“Sirât” (Neon) — Nadia Acimi, Luis Bertolo and Erika Boulic\n“Weapons” (Warner Bros.) — Allison Jones\n“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures) — Tiffany Little Canfield and Bernard Telsey\n\n\n\n\tMarking the first year of the Oscars’ newest category, pundits and studio strategists had little precedent to help project where the Casting Directors Branch might lean. Notably, nine of the 10 films shortlisted feature a female casting director — a remarkable achievement for the category’s debut.\n\n\tOn paper, the lineup includes what many presume to be six of the top contenders for best picture: “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “One Battle After Another,” “Sentimental Value” and “Sinners.” Alongside those are more eclectic and inspired selections, including two international feature entries — Brazil’s “The Secret Agent” and Spain’s “Sirât” — as well as the summer horror hit “Weapons.”\n\n\tAmong the notable omissions are “Bugonia” (another collaboration from Jennifer Venditti), “Jay Kelly” (a Nina Gold and Douglas Aibel pairing) and “Nouvelle Vague.”\n\n\tTen films will advance in the casting category for the 98th Academy Awards. Members of the Casting Directors Branch vote to determine both the shortlist and the final nominees. Academy members will be invited to view excerpts from the shortlisted films and pre-recorded interviews with the casting directors on Friday, Jan. 9, 2026, in Los Angeles and London, and on Saturday, Jan. 10, 2026, in New York.\n\n\n\tCinematography\n\t\n\n\n“Ballad of a Small Player” (Netflix) — James Friend\n“Bugonia” (Focus Features) — Robbie Ryan\n“Die My Love” (Mubi) — Seamus McGarvey\n“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.) — Claudio Miranda\n“Frankenstein” (Netflix) — Dan Laustsen\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Łukasz Żal\n“Marty Supreme” (A24) — Darius Khondji\n“Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix) — David Chambille\n“One Battle after Another” (Warner Bros.) — Michael Bauman\n“Sentimental Value” (Neon) — Kasper Tuxen\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Autumn Durald Arkapaw\n“Sirât” (Neon) — Mauro Herce\n“Song Sung Blue” (Focus Features) — Amy Vincent\n“Sound of Falling” (Mubi) — Fabian Gamper\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Adolpho Veloso\n“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures) — Alice Brooks\n\n\n\n\tWe have an inspired list of legends and up and coming faces among the finalists for best cinematography. Marking the first year for the shortlist, the preliminary voting was able to produce between 10 and 20 motion pictures. They opted for 16, which will be whittled down to five in the final nominations. \n\n\tFor a category that has yet to produce a female winner, we have three in the running for nominations — Alice Brooks for “Wicked: For Good,” coming one year after nabbing her first ASC nom, a surprise inclusion of Amy Vincent for “Song Sung Blue” and Autumn Durald Arkapaw, who many deem as the early frontrunner for “Sinners.”\n\n\tMany of the other usual suspects are among the tally such as “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “One Battle After Another” and the spectacularly shot “Train Dreams.”\n\n\tSome of the other surprises along with “Song Sung Blue” was the Jennifer Lawrence starring-vehicle “Die My Love” with its legendary DP Seamus McGarvey, and the absolutely thrilling “Sirât.” And even though Variety predicted it, it’s exciting to see \n\n\n\tDocumentary Feature\n\n\n“The Alabama Solution” (HBO Documentary Films)\n“Apocalypse in the Tropics” (Netflix)\n“Coexistence, My Ass!” (mTuckman Media)\n“Come See Me in the Good Light” (Apple Original Films)\n“Cover-Up” (Netflix)\n“Cutting through Rocks” (Madman Entertainment)\n“Folktales” (Magnolia Pictures)\n“Holding Liat” (Self-Distributed)\n“Mr. Nobody against Putin” (Bantam Film)\n“Mistress Dispeller” (Oscilloscope Laboratories)\n“My Undesirable Friends: Part 1 – Last Air in Moscow” (Argot Pictures)\n“The Perfect Neighbor” (Netflix)\n“Seeds” (Interior Films)\n“2000 Meters to Andriivka” (PBS)\n“Yanuni” (Self-Distributed)\n\n\n\n\tFifteen films will advance to the next round out of the 201 that were eligible in the category.

The Academy defines an international feature film as a feature-length picture (more than 40 minutes) produced outside the U.S. with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.\n\n\tAcademy members from all branches were invited to participate in the preliminary round of voting. To be eligible, members were required to meet a minimum viewing requirement. In the nominations round, members from all branches may opt in to participate but must view all 15 shortlisted films to vote. A shortlist of 15 titles will be announced Dec. 16.\n\n\n\tMakeup and Hairstyling\n\n\n“The Alto Knights”“Frankenstein”“Kokuho”“Marty Supreme”“Nuremberg”“One Battle after Another”“Sinners”“The Smashing Machine”“The Ugly Stepsister”“Wicked: For Good”\n\n\n\n\tTen films will advance in the makeup and hairstyling category for the 98th Academy Awards.

    "body": "\n\t“The Probability of Miracles” has scored a series order from Amazon MGM Studios. The Wendy Wunder novel will be adapted into an eight-episode YA romance show on Prime Video.\n\n\tKatie Lovejoy, who wrote the third “To All the Boys” film adaptation and Netflix’s “Love at First Sight,” will serve as showrunner, writer and executive producer of “The Probability of Miracles.” It will also be produced by Alloy Entertainment in association with Warner Bros. Television and Amazon MGM Studios, with Alloy’s Leslie Morgenstein also executive producing.\n\t\n\n\tBefore landing under the Amazon umbrella, the project was previously in development with Lovejoy and Alloy at HBO Max.\n\n\n\t“The Probability of Miracles” follows Campbell Cooper, a sharp-tongued teenager dying of cancer who, after receiving a terminal diagnosis, moves with her Mom and sister to a town called Promise, where miracles are said to happen. Cam does not believe in miracles, but, according to the logline, “as she spends her summer in this quirky, mystical town, she discovers that miracles — and falling in love — are still possible, no matter how improbable they may seem.”\n\n\t“I fell in love with Wendy Wunder’s beautiful novel in 2011, one year into my fledgling screenwriting career,” Lovejoy said. “The fact that now, 14 years later, I get to bring Cam’s journey to life onscreen is nothing short of a miracle. I’m so grateful to my partners at Alloy, Warner Bros. Television, and Amazon for believing in this story as much as I do.”  \n\n\t“Wendy wrote an incredibly moving, funny and bold novel that Alloy was privileged to be a part of bringing to life,” said Morgenstein, Alloy’s president and chief creative officer. “In Katie’s hands it will be a deeply romantic, funny, and moving series.”\n\t\n\n\tPeter Friedlander, Amazon MGM’s global head of television, added, “Katie brings a rare combination of emotional depth, sharp humor. ‘The Probability of Miracles’ is a beautiful and uplifting story about love, resilience, and the magic that can emerge even in life’s most challenging moments. We’re thrilled to partner with Warner Bros. Television and Alloy Entertainment to bring Wendy Wunder’s beloved YA novel to our global Prime Video audience.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor Courtney B. Vance, it’s always been about the craft. And his stacked portfolio proves it.\n\n\tHe has earned a Tony for his work in the 2013 Broadway show “Lucky Guy” and two Emmys, one for playing Johnnie Cochran in “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story” and another for his role as George Freeman in HBO’s “Lovecraft Country.” \n\n\tHis prolific career across film and television has led to dozens of nominations, including a Grammy, a Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards (now the Actor Awards), among other prestigious honors. However, amassing critical acclaim and widespread recognition has never been the priority for the decorated actor.\n\t\n\n\tReceiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a full-circle moment for Vance, who has dedicated four decades of his life to mastering his craft.\n\n\n\t“If you’re in the business long enough, there are certain things that you look toward,” Vance tells Variety. “But [awards] is not something that I work for and toward, because the work is primary for me, my family, doing right and living life the way that I would want my parents and our children to be proud of.”\n\n\tVance’s Walk of Fame ceremony will take place on Dec. 16. However, it’s not his first time participating. Nearly 20 years ago, he stood on the Hollywood sidewalk beside his wife, Angela Bassett, as she received her star on the sacred ground in 2008.\n\n\n\tAlthough Vance doesn’t remember much from that moment, as he was busy taking care of their young children, he acknowledges the significance of sharing his name on the sidewalk with his wife, an occasion that isn’t common for many actors, let alone spouses.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a big deal,” Vance says. “A part of me can’t take it in. To think back to the way I started, not knowing anything, and to be here is big.”\n\n\tVance’s journey into acting wasn’t a straight shot. In fact, it hadn’t even crossed his mind as an option, let alone a career. The Detroit-native hadn’t been introduced to acting until his sophomore year at Harvard University, where he studied history.\n\n\tUnsure of whether to take a traditional career path, Vance took a leap of faith to pursue a passion that he hadn’t realized he had until he performed in his first school play.\n\n\t“That was the wrong choice at a time when arts weren’t a big deal like they are now,” he says. “It’s especially meaningful for me to know that I’m the poster child for following your heart. I wasn’t going to settle for anything unless it made me happy. Our generation, parents and grandparents and great grandparents suffered so that I could make that decision and that choice.”\n\n\tVance’s first encounter with acting started with the play, “Paul Sills’ Story Theatre,” and he credits his aunt for encouraging him to take acting seriously.\n\n\t“My auntie saw the show and said, ‘Court, you’re good at this. You should do this.’ And that was it,” he recalls. “Acting was a way to meet people and to figure out what I wanted to do. I had no idea that acting was what I would want to end up doing. It was an opportunity that allowed me to figure it out.”\n\n\tVance’s early experiences began with school plays and performances at the Boston Shakespeare Company as an undergraduate at Harvard. He continued his training and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at the Yale School of Drama in 1986.\n\n\tWhile at Yale in 1985, Vance starred as Cory Maxson in the debut production of August Wilson’s award-winning play, “Fences.” Lloyd Richards, the director and former dean of Yale Drama, established a system in which the play toured regional theaters in Chicago and San Francisco before its Broadway run in New York.\n\n\tTwo years later, Vance reprised this role on Broadway opposite James Earl Jones, who played his father. “Fences” became a pivotal point in Vance’s journey, jumpstarting his Broadway career.\n\n\t“They brought me along until I was ready, and we were all ready together,” he says. “James Earl Jones was my father. I would go up to upstate New York, where he lived, and I would just sit with him. I did the same with Lloyd Richards. They gave me my career. I owed them everything.”\n\t\n\n\tWorking with Jones, Wilson and Richards was a crash course or, as Vance calls it, “a PhD in acting.”\n\n\t“You have to trust that the play will take you there every night,” he says, explaining how Broadway shaped his approach to acting. “I stopped trying and let myself be. I was blessed to have three and a half years on and off to figure it out. Nobody will ever have that opportunity with that show to find their way to that, but that was the blessing of being with Lloyd, James and August during that time period.”\n\n\tVance went on to star in a slew of plays like Athol Fugard’s “My Children! My Africa!,” John Guare’s “Six Degrees of Separation,” Nora Ephron’s “Lucky Guy,” and more, with the latter earning him a Tony for the role of Hap Hairston. His knack for captivating audiences translated into film and television.\n\n\tTransitioning into acting on screen put him on the radar of other major filmmakers. In the years that followed his 1987 debut in the American war film, “Hamburger Hill,” he appeared in films from Penny Marshall’s “The Preacher’s Wife,” Robert Altman’s “Cookie’s Fortune,” Clint Eastwood’s “Space Cowboys” and narrated Wes Anderson’s “Isle of Dogs,” to name a few.\n\n\tHe’s also guest starred on numerous TV series, including recurring appearances in “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “ER,” “FlashForward” and “Genius: Aretha,” among many others. In recent years, he’s starred in “Percy Jackson and the Olympians,” “Grotesquerie,” “61st Street” on top of his award-winning roles in “Lovecraft Country” and “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.”\n\n\tWith an impressive resume under his belt, it’s not lost on Vance that his journey has involved several people in his corner, including his wife of nearly 30 years.\n\n\tThe two actors met as graduate students at the Yale School of Drama in the ‘80s before reconnecting years later. The pair remain each other’s support systems, all while raising two children, collaborating on projects and running their company, Bassett Vance Productions, together.\n\n\t“I’m her biggest cheerleader, and she’s mine,” Vance says. “I had to realize that God is first. She’s second. The children are third. My work is fourth. I’m fifth. I understand that I’m here to support her. She sees me doing all the things I’m doing for her. Then we start competing to do things for each other.”\n\t\n\n\tAs Vance enters the next phase of his life, he’s excited to pour into the next generation of emerging artists. Just as he had mentors to help him navigate the industry, he desires to be a guiding light for others.\n\n\t“I’m looking forward to helping mentor people the way that people mentored and took care of me when I didn’t know who I was,” he says. “I want to let young folks know it’s OK. Just start.”\n",

Chavez admitted to selling ketamine to Dr. Salvador Plasencia, which was then sold to Perry weeks before the actor's fatal overdose.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Prosecutors said Chavez obtained the ketamine fraudulently by submitting a prescription in the name of a patient without the patient's knowledge or consent.\n      \n    \n          Earlier this month, Plasencia was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to 4 counts of distributing ketamine.\n      \n\n          In a text discussion over how much to charge Perry for the drugs, Plasencia wrote to Chavez, \"I wonder how much this moron will pay.\"\n      \n    \n          The text was highlighted in a victim impact letter written to the judge by Perry's stepfather, Keith Morrison.\n      \n    \n          He wrote, \"This doctor conspired to break his most important vows, repeatedly, sneaked through the night to meet his victim in secret. For what, a few thousand dollars? So he could feed on the vulnerability of our son…and crow, as he did so, with that revealing question: 'I wonder how much this moron will pay. Let’s find out.'\"\n      \n    \n          As you know ... Perry overdosed on ketamine and drowned in his hot tub back in 2023.\n      \n    \n          Perry's live-in assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, drug dealer Erik Fleming, and the so-called \"Ketamine Queen\" Jasveen Sangha are expected to be sentenced in the coming weeks.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Matthew Perry\n              \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Death\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tAmanda Seyfried told Who What Wear on her press tour for “The Testament of Ann Lee” that she refuses to apologize for calling Charlie Kirk “hateful” after the Turning Point USA co-founder was shot and killed earlier this year. \n\n\t“I’m not fucking apologizing for that,” Seyfried said. “I mean, for fuck’s sake, I commented on one thing. I said something that was based on actual reality and actual footage and actual quotes. What I said was pretty damn factual, and I’m free to have an opinion, of course. Thank God for Instagram. I was able to give some clarity, and it was about getting my voice back because I felt like it had been stolen and recontextualized—which is what people do, of course.”\n\t\n\n\tKirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist, was fatally shot in the neck on Sept. 10 during a college speaking event in Utah. Seyfried originally commented on Kirk’s death by writing: “He was hateful.” The statement ignited accusations from some conservatives online that Seyfried was implying Kirk’s death was justified. Quite the contrary. She responded to the backlash in a standalone Instagram post.\n\n\n\t“I don’t want to add fuel to a fire. I just want to be able to give clarity to something so irresponsibly (but understandably) taken out of context. Spirited discourse – isn’t that what we should be having?” Seyfried wrote in the post’s caption.\n\n\t“We’re forgetting the nuance of humanity,” she went on to explain. “I can get angry about misogyny and racist rhetoric and ALSO very much agree that Charlie Kirk’s murder was absolutely disturbing and deplorable in every way imaginable. No one should have to experience this level of violence. This country is grieving too many senseless and violent deaths and shootings. Can we agree on that at least?”\n\t\n\n\tSeyfried was one of many Hollywood figures in September who both condemned Kirk’s shooting death while also publicly disagreeing with his politics. Jamie Lee Curtis fought back tears on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast when discussing Kirk.\n\n\t“I disagreed with him on almost every point I ever heard him say, but I believe he was a man of faith, and I hope in that moment when he died, that he felt connected with his faith,” Curtis said\n\n\tHead over to Who What Wear’s website to read Seyfried’s interview in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA third “28 Years Later” movie is moving forward at Sony. Sony Pictures has decided to proceed with the film following positive fan reactions to early screenings of the trilogy’s second installment, “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” according to sources familiar with the development. Series screenwriter Alex Garland is writing the script for the film and Cillian Murphy is in talks to reprise his role as protagonist Jim from “28 Days Later” and “The Bone Temple.”\n\t\n\n\tThe zombie horror franchise began in 2001 with Fox Searchlight’s release of “28 Days Later,” directed by Danny Boyle. The influential and intense film grossed over $72 million at the worldwide box office on a reported $8 million budget. Fox Atomic— a short-lived Fox subsidiary— released an initial sequel, “28 Weeks Later” in 2007. The sequel had an entirely new cast and neither Boyle nor Garland were involved. \n\n\tEarlier this summer, “28 Years Later” returned to form with Garland and Boyle returning to write and direct the film. The duo envisioned “28 Years” as a trilogy, Sony made the first two films, “28 Years Later” and “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” back to back before greenlighting the third. \n\n\n\t“28 Years Later” performed well at the box office, opening to $30 million on June 20 and cumulatively grossing $151 million worldwide. “The Bone Temple” is directed by Nia DaCosta and releases in theaters on Jan. 16, but early screenings have evidently given Sony the confidence to complete the trilogy.\n\n\tAlfie Williams, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, Jack O’Connell and Ralph Fiennes all starred in the first “28 Years Later.” All but Comer will return in “The Bone Temple,” alongside franchise newcomers Erin Kellyman and Chi Lewis-Parry and Murphy, reprising his role from “28 Days Later” for the first time since the initial film’s release.\n\t\n\n\tThough Murphy is in talks to come back again in the the third installment, no official announcement has been made regarding the cast. Boyle has expressed interest in directing the third installment in previous statements, but there has been no confirmation.\n\n\tThe news was first reported by Deadline.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift revealed two of her favorite songs from her own catalog during a Wednesday night appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”\n\n\tColbert initially asked Swift for her top five, a question he previously asked Dolly Parton, Elton John, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen. However, the 14-time Grammy winner told the late-night host that her rankings are “constantly changing,” and that she would need “a little time” to get back to him on all five.\n\t\n\n\t“I think number one is ‘All Too Well,’ the 10-minute version,” Swift said. “I’m really obsessed with ‘The Life of a Showgirl,’ the whole album.”\n\n\n\tShe continued, “I can’t really do any of the others, except I will say somewhere in the list, I think, is going to be a song called ‘Mirrorball,’ from the ‘Folklore’ album. You know, it came on the other day. A friend sent it to me, and she was talking about it, and I put it on, and then you asked me this question, so I said it.”\n\n\tSwift assured that at some point, she would give Colbert an “update” after she had sat down and deeply considered her definitive top five favorites.\n\n\tAt the beginning of November, Swift’s latest album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” logged its fourth week in a row at No.1 on the Billboard 200. One of Swift’s most popular songs from the record, “The Fate of Ophelia,” also logged four weeks on the Hot 100 last month, making Swift the only artist to debut at No. 1 on both charts simultaneously and hold the spots for a month straight.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are expected to reprise their roles as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark in “The Hunger Games” prequel, “Sunrise on the Reaping.”\n\n\tThe Lionsgate movie is based on the latest novel by Suzanne Collins and follows the events of the 50th Hunger Games, 24 years before Katniss and Peeta first entered the killing field as the tributes for District 12 with Haymitch Abernathy as their mentor. The story centers on Haymitch’s experience in the games when he was 16; Joseph Zada assumes the role of the young man, played by Woody Harrelson in the original film series. \n\t\n\n\tThe nature of Lawrence and Hutcherson’s cameo is being kept under wraps, but as book readers will know, their beloved characters appear alongside Haymitch in the epilogue, which indicates some sort of flash-forward. \n\n\n\t“Sunrise on the Reaping” is slated for release on Nov. 20. Francis Lawrence, who has helmed every installment of the franchise since 2012’s “Catching Fire,” directs from a screenplay written by Billy Ray, with Brad Simpson and Nina Jacobson returning as producers. The five films in the franchise so far have taken in over $3.3 billion at the box office.\n\n\tWhile the original “The Hunger Games” movies made megastars out of Lawrence, Hutcherson and their co-star Liam Hemsworth more than a decade ago, the pair have been plenty busy of late, too. On Monday, Lawrence earned her seventh Golden Globe nomination for her latest film “Die My Love,” adding to her award-winning pedigree that includes an Oscar for best actress. Meanwhile, Hutcherson is relishing the successful launches of “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” and the HBO series “I Love L.A.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a recent interview with Variety, Hutcherson hinted at a possible return to the franchise.  “I would love to be back on set with Francis, with Jen, with Liam, with Woody [Harrelson],” he said. “It would not take any convincing at all. I’d be there in a heartbeat.”\n\n\tThen, when asked more directly about whether that film would include the coda scene, Hutcherson played it cool. “That would be a dream come true,” he replied, holding interviewer Adam B. Vary’s gaze. “Do dreams come true? Sometimes. Sometimes not. Sometimes, yeah.”\n\n\t“Sunrise on the Reaping” also stars Elle Fanning as a younger version of Effie Trinket (originally played by Elizabeth Banks); Ralph Fiennes plays President Coriolanus Snow (preivously played by Donald Sutherland in the original films and Tom Blyth in the “Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” prequel); Kieran Culkin is TV host Caesar Flickerman (previously played by Stanley Tucci); and Jesse Plemons is Plutarch Heavensbee (previously played by Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Kelvin Harrison Jr., Glenn Close, Maya Hawke, Mckenna Grace, Billy Porter, Whitney Peak, Ben Wang, Molly McCann, Iona Bell and Percy Daggs IV round out the all-star cast. \n\n\tA representative for the studio did not respond to a request for comment. Lawrence is represented by LBI Entertainment and Hutcherson is repped by the Gersh Agency and TFC Management.\n\n\tTheir involvement in the film was first reported by The Insneider.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “South Park” Season 28 finale brought Christmas cheer to the small Rocky Mountain town and saw Donald Trump and Satan’s baby meet an untimely demise.\n\n\tAt the episode’s climax, Trump, JD Vance, Peter Thiel and Pete Hegseth prepared for a showdown in the hospital against Stan, the Christmas Critters and Jesus over the fate of Satan’s unborn child. However, just as the battle was about to commence, a doctor rushed in with some bad news.\n\t\n\n\t“We looked at the ultrasound, and it appears that at some point when nobody was watching, the baby hung itself and took its own life,” the doctor said. Pulling out his phone, he added, “I’m afraid you can see it all in the video. The baby got hold of some bedsheets. There are a couple of minutes missing from the ultrasound, but it’s definitely a suicide.”\n\n\n\tThe anticlimactic punchline is most likely a reference to the death of convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In 2019, while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges, Epstein hung himself in his cell at New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center. However, the surveillance recording is missing the part when he actually committed the act of suicide, leading some to speculate about the circumstances of his death.\n\n\tAt the end of the episode, Trump throws a lavish party in celebration of his baby’s death, while Satan, completely dejected, packs up his things and leaves the White House.\n\n\t“South Park” Seasons 27 and 28 have been some of the most exposive in recent memory, revolving mostly around the Trump administration and the president’s tumultuous relationship with Satan. Highlights from Season 27 and 28 include Trump running through the desert naked, Kristi Noem’s ICE raiding a production of “Dora the Explorer Live” and Cartman vomiting all over Palantir co-founder Thiel. From start to finish, “South Park” received backlash from the White House and from members of the Trump administration, but never from the president himself.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump, who has inserted himself into the U.S. government’s review of a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery, said it is “imperative” that CNN be sold as part of any deal Warner Bros. Discovery enters into — so that the news network is no longer under the current management team.\n\n\tTrump’s comments signal that he may be opposed to Netflix’s blockbuster deal with Warner Bros. and in favor of Paramount Skydance’s rival offer.\n\t\n\n\tUnder Netflix’s $82.7 billion deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, the streaming giant would acquire WB’s studios and HBO Max — but not any of WBD’s TV networks, which would be spun off into a new entity (dubbed Discovery Global) to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. Paramount Skydance, headed by David Ellison, launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, including CNN and WBD’s other cable networks.\n\n\n\tTrump, speaking Wednesday at a White House meeting, told reporters that as part of “any deal” for Warner Bros. Discovery, it “should be guaranteed and certain that CNN is part of it or sold separately.” The president said, “I think I think CNN should be sold because I think the people that are running CNN right now” are “either corrupt or incompetent.” Trump said he didn’t want the current CNN management to be rewarded by being allowed to continue running the network “with money” from a deal.\n\n\t“I don’t think the people that are running that company right now and running CNN, which is a very dishonest group of people, I don’t think that should be allowed to continue,” Trump said. “I think CNN should be sold along with everything else.”\n\t\n\n\t“I think the people that have run CNN for the last, long period of time are a disgrace,” Trump said. “I think it’s imperative that CNN be sold, because you certainly wouldn’t want to put people, just leave those people with some money, good money, and CNN, so that they can spend even more money spreading poison, because it’s lies. It’s a disgrace.”\n\n\tA CNN spokesperson declined to comment on Trump’s remarks. Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\tDuring Trump’s first term, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner on antitrust grounds. A federal judge ruled in favor of the companies and in February 2019 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision. The DOJ lawsuit was reportedly motivated by Trump’s dislike of CNN. \n\n\tTrump, at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C., Sunday said he would be “involved” in the review of the Netflix-WB deal. Historically, U.S. presidents have not been officially part of any regulatory review process of an M&A transaction.\n\n\tTrump, asked Monday at a White House briefing with reporters if he was in favor of Paramount’s rival bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, he responded, “I don’t know enough about it,” saying he has to look at how each proposed deal would impact Netflix and Paramount Skydance’s market share. Trump added, “I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right.” Trump was asked if the involvement of Affinity Partners, the investment firm of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, in backing the Paramount bid would influence the his opinion; Trump responded, “I’ve never spoken with him” about Paramount’s WBD bid.\n\n\tIn the past, Trump has boasted about his friendship with David Ellison and his father, the ultrawealthy tech mogul Larry Ellison. But on Monday, he lashed out at the Ellisons over a “60 Minutes” interview on CBS with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), the one-time Trump supporter who has recently criticized the president on a range of issues. Trump complained in a Truth Social post that since the Ellisons bought Paramount, “60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew Europe Film Sales has acquired “How to Divorce During the War,” the third feature by Lithuanian director Andrius Blaževičius, ahead of its world premiere in the Sundance Film Festival’s World Cinema Dramatic Competition.\n\n\tNew Europe described the film as “a sharp, emotionally resonant drama laced with irony.” It is “a portrait of a Europe caught between fear and denial, solidarity and fatigue, ideals and comfort.”\n\t\n\n\tSet in Vilnius in 2022, it’s a story of a high-flying executive Marija, who chooses the worst possible moment for an honest conversation with her husband Vytas about divorcing – just one day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine goes into full scale. Now the couple must navigate the process of separation as it collides with a refugee and mid-life crisis.\n\n\n\tThe film works both as a relationship drama and a war film and shows an ironic duality of the couple’s mid-life crisis and the life of the Ukrainian refugees in Vilnius. Everyday domestic situations carry an undercurrent of frustration and hidden violence, moments of chaos and absurdity coexist with heartbreak. The tension between Marija, Vytas, and their daughter Dovilė quietly reveals the aftershocks of both divorce and war.\n\n\tThe film’s creative team includes DP Narvydas Naujalis, editor Anna Johnson Ryndová, production designer Greta Vileikytė and composer Jakub Rataj. It is produced by Marija Razgute of M-Films (Lithuania), with co-producers Red Lion (Luxembourg), Feline Films (Ireland), and Bionaut (Czech Rep.).\n\n\tThe project participated in the New Nordic Films Co-Production Market and the Berlinale Co-Production Market.\n\t\n\n\tBlaževičius previously gained international recognition with “The Saint” (Warsaw and Busan film festivals) and “Runner” (Karlovy Vary Film Festival).\n\n\tNew Europe’s head of acquisitions, Marcin Luczaj, said in a statement: “We’ve been struck and impressed with Andrius’ vision and the universe, which resonated with us closely. The film is blending an intimate relationship drama with the tension of a society under pressure, and strikes a rare tonal balance: emotionally raw yet sharply observant, contemporary yet universally relatable, tragic yet often darkly comedic.”\n\n\tNew Europe’s slate includes Dara van Dusen’s upcoming “A Prayer for the Dying,” starring Johnny Flynn and John C. Reilly, Jeremiah Zagar’s “The Painted Bride,” starring Jeremy Allen White, as well as two competitors for the international feature film Oscar – Hlynur Pálmason’s “The Love That Remains” (Iceland) and Laszlo Nemes’ “Orphan” (Hungary).\n",

    "body": "\n\tJulia Louis-Dreyfus revealed on Amy Poehler’s “Good Hang” podcast that she felt “backed into a corner” when she publicly disclosed her breast cancer diagnosis in 2017. At the time, HBO’s “Veep” was preparing for its seventh and final season, but production was delayed while Louis-Dreyfus underwent chemotherapy.\n\n\tOn the Dec. 9 episode of the “Good Hang” podcast, host Poehler praised Louis-Dreyfus for being open about her diagnosis, saying the disclosure was “very helpful for a lot of people.” But Louis-Dreyfus explained that going public wasn’t entirely her choice.\n\t\n\n\t“I was kind of backed into a corner on that one because we had to shut our show down,” the “Veep” star said. “It’s funny how that worked out, because normally I would not have done that. I’m very private.”\n\n\n\tLouis-Dreyfus played Selina Meyer on “Veep” from 2012 to 2019, earning six consecutive Emmys for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series.\n\n\tAccording to Louis-Dreyfus, who also served as an executive producer, production on the final season of the HBO series had to shut down “for a year” so she could undergo chemotherapy. “Two hundred fifty people weren’t going to be working,” she added, “so I had to make a public thing about it.”\n\n\tEven though she had reservations, Louis-Dreyfus said she’s ultimately glad she shared her diagnosis because it allowed her to connect with others who were also battling cancer.\n\n\t“The good thing about doing that was that I did have this incredible experience of people reaching out to me asking me for, you know, asking me about my experience going through breast cancer, for advice,” she said. “And I was able to help and there was something unbelievably comforting about being able to do that on the other side of this trauma.”\n\t\n\n\tLouis-Dreyfus was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2017. She announced the news on Twitter (now X), writing, “1 in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I’m the one.”\n\n\t“The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends,” she added. “The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let’s fight all cancers and make universal health care a reality.”\n\n\tWatch Louis-Dreyfus’ full interview on the “Good Hang” podcast below. \n\n\n\n",

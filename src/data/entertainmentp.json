    "body": "\n\tMetFilm Sales has acquired international sales rights to Biljana Tutorov and Petar Glomazić’s feature documentary “To Hold a Mountain,” which recently received its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, where it was awarded the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize.\n\n\tMFS will present the title to international buyers for the first time at the EFM in Berlin, and co-reps the title alongside Submarine Entertainment.\n\n\n\tSet in the remote highlands of Montenegro, the film tells the story of a shepherd mother and her daughter who proudly defend their ancestral mountain from the threat of becoming a NATO military training ground, stirring memories of past violence that once shattered their family.\n\t\n\n\tIn his Variety review, Murtada Elfadl wrote, “Reveals itself as an emotionally shattering meditation on grief and perseverance. Gorgeously shot with a quiet, deliberate rhythm, it’s the kind of film that entrances its audience without them noticing. Only at the end does the audience fully grasp the magnitude of the story it chronicles and the natural beauty of the images they have been witnessing all along.”\n\n\tThe director of photography is Eva Kraljević and the editor is George Cragg, with additional editing by Catherine Rascon. The original score is by Draško Adzić. \n\n\tThe producers are Tutorov, Glomazić, Quentin Laurent and Rok Biček. It is executive produced by Megan Gelstein, Andrea Meditch, Bianca Oana, Jean Tsien and Petra Costa. The executive producers for Points North Institute are Sean Flynn, Ben Fowlie and Lucila Moctezuma, and Chandra Jessee and Rebecca Lichtenfeld for InMaat. The executive producers for Doc Society are Megha Agrawal Sood and Shanida Scotland. Meadow Fund also exec produces.\n\t\n\n\t“To Hold a Mountain” is a Wake Up Films Production in co-production with Les Films de l’Oeil Sauvage, Ardor Films and Cvinger Film.\n\n\tMFS’s current slate includes Ross McElwee’s “Remake,” which won the Golden Globe Impact Prize for Documentary at the Venice Film Festival, and Brydie O’Connor’s “Barbara Forever,” which recently premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, winning the Jonathan Oppenheim Editing Prize.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount chair and CEO David Ellison has outlined specific commitments for the creative community in an open letter addressing the studio’s pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, pledging that the combined entity would produce at least 30 theatrical features annually while maintaining a competitive marketplace structure.\n\n\tIn the letter addressed to “the British creative community, fellow film lovers and television fans, the industry at large,” Ellison emphasized that audiences “are best served by greater choice – not less – and by a marketplace that encourages the full spectrum of filmmaking, content creation, and theatrical exhibition, not one that eliminates meaningful competition by creating a monopolistic or dominant entity.”\n\t\n\n\tShould the acquisition succeed, Ellison committed that Paramount Studios and Warner Bros. Studios would each produce a minimum of 15 high-quality feature films per year. Paramount has already increased its output from eight to 15 films since closing the Paramount-Skydance transaction in August.\n\n\n\tAdditional commitments include maintaining HBO as an independent operation, ensuring every film receives a full theatrical release with a minimum 45-day global window before paid video-on-demand availability, and preserving the home video window following theatrical runs. Ellison indicated the studio would aim for 60-90 days or more for the most successful releases.\n\n\tBoth studios will continue to support a vibrant third-party ecosystem by licensing their films and shows across their own and third-party platforms, while remaining active buyers of content from third-party studios and independent producers, according to the letter.\n\t\n\n\tPositioning the deal in contrast to Netflix‘s market approach, Ellison stated the proposed combination is “intended to strengthen competition by creating a more capable and effective rival to the dominant platforms.”\n\n\tThe letter comes as Paramount has launched a tender offer for WBD and is soliciting proxies against a proposed merger between WBD and Netflix announced in December. According to SEC filings referenced in the letter’s legal disclaimers, Paramount filed a preliminary proxy statement on Jan. 22 in connection with its opposition to the Netflix-WBD transaction.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hong Kong International Film Festival Society has unveiled the second slate of projects selected for the 24th Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum, spotlighting 12 work-in-progress titles that bring together Asian cinema heavyweights and promising new voices.\n\n\tSet to be presented March 17-19 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre as part of the HKIFF Industry Project Market, the WIP lineup features established stars including Nick Cheung Ka-fai, Chung Suet-ying, Dian Sastrowardoyo, Christine Hakim, Reza Rahadian and Anjali Patil. Veteran producer Mabel Cheung Yuen-ting is among the notable names backing the projects, which carry budgets of up to $2.2 million each.\n\t\n\n\tSeven of the 12 titles mark directorial debuts, with first-time filmmakers including Arvin Belarmino, Shu Hui and Chahat Mansingka stepping behind the camera. The projects, mostly in post-production, will be pitched alongside FilMart, now in its 30th edition.\n\n\n\tCheung and Chung topline “Good Trip,” a comedy-drama directed by Norris Wong Yee-lam and Wong Hoi about a film production assistant who embarks on an unexpected journey with her dying father to fulfill his final wishes. Cheung Yuen-ting, whose credits include “Echoes of the Rainbow,” winner of the 2010 Berlinale Generation’s Crystal Bear, produces the Hong Kong project.\n\n\tIndonesian stars Rahadian and Sastrowardoyo lead “The Sea Speaks His Name” (Laut Bercerita), a political drama tracking a student activist whose 1990s disappearance leaves his family searching for answers. Yosep Anggi Noen directs from a script produced by Gita Fara, whose “Pangku” (On Your Lap), directed by Rahadian, won at Busan in 2025.\n\t\n\n\tHakim portrays a mother desperate to reconnect with her daughter on death row in Saudi Arabia in “My Mother,” directed by Eddie Cahyono, whose “Siti” claimed Indonesia’s Citra Award for Best Film in 2015. The Indonesia-Japan-Hong Kong co-production is produced by Tika Bravani and Isabelle Glachant.\n\n\tAmong the debut features, Belarmino’s “Ria” follows a hotel housekeeper leading her punk community against displacement while caring for her foster mother. The Philippines-Norway-Netherlands-Saudi Arabia co-production is produced by Kristine De Leon and Alemberg Ang. Belarmino’s short “Agapito” competed at Cannes in 2025.\n\n\tTaiwan’s Chin Chia-Hua, whose “Trouble Girl” won at the 2024 Golden Horse Awards, directs supernatural drama “A Ghost in the Market” about a murdered housewife who returns in her decaying body to continue her daily routine. The project previously participated in HAF Film Lab in 2023 before advancing to the in-development section.\n\n\tOther titles include Zhang Tao’s “Farewell My Blue Bird,” exploring China’s rural youth through a woman who relocates to the city after her construction worker husband is injured; Lu Po-Shun’s “Will You Still Be My Friend,” a Taiwan-Singapore co-production about two 13-year-old boys whose friendship faces pressure from their feuding families; and Ken Yang’s directing debut “A Vampire, Probably,” a horror fantasy about a teenage murderer learning body reconstruction at a funeral home.\n\n\tMansingka’s “Like a Feather in the Wind,” set in Kolkata’s fading Chinatown, centers on a lonely woman who begins seeing her late husband after her children leave home. Sailesh Rathnakumar, a sound engineer making his directorial debut, helms “Selvi,” with Patil starring as a migrant home care nurse whose exhausting work schedule blurs boundaries.\n\n\tAlso in the lineup is “A Thousand Stars in the Galactic Night,” directed by former editor Shu Hui. The sci-fi suspense film stars Huang Yao and Bate’er Liu as an odd-job laborer who uncovers hidden truths following her boyfriend’s disappearance. Shu’s short “Walking with Her Into the Night” competed in Cannes Critics’ Week in 2023.\n\n\tIndonesian producer Meiske Taurisia, whose “Sleep No More,” directed by Edwin, screens in Berlinale Specials this year, backs Ariani Darmawan’s debut “Jani Be Good,” a drama about a 13-year-old Chinese Indonesian girl caught between her controlling mother and runaway sister.\n\t\n\n\tThe WIP projects will be pitched March 17 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre’s Starlight Theatre, with teams presenting 10-minute first looks to industry attendees including distributors, producers, investors, festival programmers and funding representatives.\n\n\tHKIFFS previously revealed 17 in-development projects for HAF24 and will unveil selected animation and genre projects next week.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFinneas took to Instagram Threads on Wednesday to defend his superstar sister and songwriting partner, Billie Eilish, from “very powerful old white men” who are “outraged” about her Grammys acceptance speech.\n\n\t“Seeing a lot of very powerful old white men outraged about what my 24-year-old sister said during her acceptance speech,” he wrote. “We can literally see your names in the Epstein files.”\n\n\n\tAfter her track “Wildflower” won song of the year at the 2026 Grammys, Eilish declared “fuck ICE” in her acceptance speech. Finneas joined Eilish on stage while she accepted the award.\n\t\n\n\t“I feel so honored every time I get to be in this room,” she said. “As grateful as I feel, I honestly don’t feel like I need to say anything but that no one is illegal on stolen land. And, yeah, it’s just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now, and I feel really hopeful in this room, and I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter, and fuck ICE. That’s all I’m going to say. Sorry. Thank you so much.”\n\n\tEilish was among the many artists to use their Grammys platform to promote social and political reform. The most commanding example was Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, who said “ICE out” to resounding applause after winning best música urbana album with “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS.”\n\n\t“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans. Also, I will say to people, I know it’s tough to know not to hate on these days and I was thinking sometimes, we get contaminados [contaminated], I don’t know how to say that in English. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. We don’t hate them. We love our people. We love our family, and that’s the way to do it. With love. Don’t forget that please. Thank you.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA24‘s Oscar-nominated drama “Marty Supreme,” starring four-time Academy Award nominee Timothée Chalamet, will receive a theatrical release in China through China Film Group with promotional support from Wanda Film. \n\n\tThe film, directed by Josh Safdie, has emerged as a major awards contender with nine Oscar nominations, including nods for best picture, director and actor. The sports drama has been widely praised by critics and audiences, with Chalamet’s performance drawing particular acclaim.\n\t\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” has already established itself as a commercial powerhouse, becoming A24’s highest-grossing release domestically. The film is on track to become the indie studio’s biggest global success to date.\n\n\n\tThe actor, who also produced the film alongside Safdie, Ronald Bronstein, Eli Bush and Anthony Katagas, has cultivated a solid relationship with Chinese moviegoers through previous releases. His biggest success in the territory came with “Dune: Part Two,” which grossed $49 million in China when Wanda Film released it in March 2024. \n\n\t“Producing ‘Marty Supreme’ has been a deeply meaningful experience for me, and I’m genuinely thrilled to be working with Wanda Film to bring the film to audiences in China,” Chalamet said in a statement. “I can’t wait for Chinese audiences to experience ‘Marty Supreme’ and to be part of its continued journey around the world.”\n\n\tThe nine Oscar nominations for “Marty Supreme” include recognition for cinematography, editing, production design, casting, costume design and original screenplay. The film’s China release marks the latest step in its worldwide theatrical rollout. \n\t\n\n\tWhile a theatrical release date has not been revealed, A24 has unveiled a poster for the China bow.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Group raised its outlook for the current fiscal year ending in March, as the Tokyo-based tech and entertainment company beat expectations with a 22% increase in operating income for the September-December 2025 quarter.\n\n\tFor the three months ended Dec. 31, its third quarter of fiscal 2025, Sony reported total sales of JPY3.713 trillion ($24.1 billion), up a slight 1%, as operating income came in at JPY515.0 billion ($3.3 billion), up 22%. One reason for the higher income was a JPY43.9 billion in realized gains on land transferred by Sony Group to Sony Life Insurance Co. in connection with the latter’s spin-off in the quarter. Net income rose 11% to JPY377.3 billion ($2.5 billion).\n\t\n\n\tThe company raised its forecast for full-year fiscal 2025 operating profit to rise to JPY1.54 trillion, up 8% from its previous guidance, and upped its annual revenue projection by 3% to JPY12.3 trillion. Sony maintained its estimated losses from U.S. tariffs at JPY50 billion.\n\n\n\tFor the December 2025 quarter, Sony Pictures Entertainment posted revenue of JPY353.3 billion ($2.32 billion), down 11%, and operating income was JPY30.9 billion ($197 million), a decrease of 9%. The company said the drop was because the year-earlier period benefited from the contribution of the blockbuster film “Venom: The Last Dance” and licensing revenue from other theatrically released films.\n\n\tRevenue in Sony’s music segment was JPY542.4 billion ($3.5 billion), up 13%, and operating income was JPY106.4 billion ($690 million), an increase of 9%. The company said streaming revenue year-on-year growth rates on a U.S. dollar basis were +5% for recorded music and +13% for music publishing. The music segment comprises Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Music Publishing and Sony Music Entertainment (Japan).\n\t\n\n\tSony’s PlayStation games and network services segment saw revenue of JPY1.613 trillion ($10.5 billion), down 4% compared with the year-earlier quarter. The segment’s operating income rose 19% to JPY140.8 billion ($91 million), which the company attributed to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, increase in sales from networks services and higher sales of first-party games titles. Gaming user engagement trended well in the period, with monthly active users in December 2025 reaching a record 132 million accounts and total gameplay hours increasing year-on-year.\n\n\tThe company’s Entertainment, Technology & Services Segment (ET&S Segment) saw revenue fall 7% in the December quarter, to JPY658.1 billion ($4.3 billion), driven by a decrease in unit sales of displays. Segment operating income dropped 23% to JPY59.4 billion ($39 million).\n\n\tSony’s Imaging & Sensing Solutions Segment sales increased 21% to JPY604.3 billion ($3.9 billion) on higher sales of image sensors for mobile products, and operating income kicked up 35% to JPY132.0 billion ($857 million).\n\n\tThe U.S. dollar figures are calculated based on an average rate of $1 to 154.0 yen.\n\n\tAs previously announced, Kenichiro Yoshida will retire as CEO of Sony Group as of April 1, and will become executive chairman. Current president Hiroki Totoki is assuming the role of of CEO.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos will return to “Chicago P.D.” for the upcoming three-part crossover with “Chicago Fire” and “Chicago Med,” set to air on March 4 on NBC.\n\n\tPer an official description, Spiridakos’ character Hailey Upton “returns to her former stomping grounds, but this time on the federal level as a Special Agent of the FBI. She joins her former P.D. allies after a drug enforcement task force case out of her Detroit field office leads her back to Chicago.” Jay Halstead  (Soffer) has “been deep undercover, leading him on a path to the same case that Upton is investigating.”\n\t\n\n\tSoffer last appeared in an October 2022 episode, exiting three episodes into Season 10 as his character decided to join an Army group to bring down the Cartel in Bolivia. Spiridakos, for her part, last appeared in May 2024, exiting at the end of Season 11. Hailey — who was married to Halstead before he moved away — decided to start over and chose to leave Chicago.\n\n\n\tAt the time of their respective exits, both expressed that they’d love to pop back in — something pretty common in the One Chicago universe. Soffer has been back to direct, but this will be both of their first times back on screen in the roles.\n\n\t“I like to think — and I hope the fans think this too — that he’s just in another country right now, doing what he does best and making the world a safer place. In a family, sometimes somebody moves away or goes to college somewhere else,” Soffer previously told Variety about keeping the door open to returning. “I still love it. I still love the fans. And I still love Halstead. Halstead’s always going to be in my blood. That’s never going to change.” \n\t\n\n\tPer the logline for the crossover event, “Firehouse 51 is called to an airfield when a passenger jet suddenly goes silent mid-air, triggering a high-stakes emergency. Their discovery cracks open a bigger and deadlier mystery — one with consequences that could ripple far beyond the runway and put countless lives in jeopardy.”\n\n\tThe night will switch up the usual order of shows, beginning with “Chicago Fire” at 8 p.m. followed by “Chicago Med” at 9 p.m. and “Chicago P.D.” at 10 p.m.\n\n\tUniversal Television produces One Chicago in association with Wolf Entertainment. “Chicago P.D.” is executive produced by Dick Wolf, Peter Jankowski, Gwen Sigan, Chad Saxton, Gavin Harris and Jason Beghe.\n\n\tWatch the promo below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday announced to TruthSocial that he’s directed all federal law enforcement to help search for Savannah Guthrie’s 84-year-old mother, Nancy, who went missing in a suspected kidnapping last weekend. \n\n\t“I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family’s, and Local Law Enforcement’s, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY,” he wrote. “We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely. The prayers of our Nation are with her and her family. GOD BLESS AND PROTECT NANCY! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump previously told reporters that he would provide more resources to the Guthrie family if needed. This new announcement represents an urgent and more explicit delivery of that promise.\n\n\n\tNancy Guthrie went missing in Tucson, Ariz. over the weekend, and on Monday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Office announced that her disappearance was being treated like a crime. Authorities said they found “very concerning” evidence at her house.\n\n\t“I believe she was abducted, yes,” Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS News. “She didn’t walk from there. She didn’t go willingly.”\n\n\tOn Wednesday evening, Savannah Guthrie posted an emotional video to her Instagram, in which she and her two siblings, Annie and Camron, shared a message to their mother’s kidnapper.\n\n\t“She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, and she needs it not to suffer,” Savannah Guthrie said. “We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 14, Episode 5 of “The Masked Singer,” “Red, White and Clue,” which aired Feb. 4 on Fox.\n\n\tFor Teddi Mellencamp, appearing on “The Masked Singer” “got me out of a pretty dark place, and I am forever grateful.” Mellencamp ended her run as Calla Lily, after performing “Jack and Diane,” the No. 1 hit made famous by her father (back when he was still performing as John Cougar). She had previously performed “Fight Song,” by Rachel Platten.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the panelists, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg got it right with Teddi Mellencamp. Ken Jeong thought it was Christina Applegate, Rita Ora guessed Selma Blair, and Robin Thicke went with Danielle Fishel.\n\n\n\t“I’m not a singer by trade, clearly, and so that part was challenging for me,” Mellencamp said. “Also, a big part of my memory has been askew since my brain surgery. So I was a little bit nervous, but I was excited to push myself out of my comfort zone and try something new, and it felt like it gave me a little bit of life.”\n\n\tMellencamp said she decided to appear on “The Masked Singer” because she watches it with her children, who immediately identified her after her first performance this season. She had also informed her father, whom she asked singing advice.\n\n\t“He’s like, ‘just sing loud and proud. And you know, if you sing something off key, it doesn’t matter.’” Had she continued on the show, Mellencamp was hoping to perform “Before He Cheats,’ by Carrie Underwood.\n\n\tMellencamp has recently made headlines for battling Stage 4 cancer — particularly when her father, John Mellencamp, told podcast host Joe Rogan that his daughter “is really sick” and “suffering right now.”\n\t\n\n\tOn another podcast, Teddi Mellencamp said she’s in immunotherapy and still considered Stage 4, although there’s currently no trace of cancer. And she seemed in good spirits Wednesday as she discussed being the latest notable to be revealed on “The Masked Singer’s” “Red, White and Clue Night.”\n\n\tIn an earlier clue package on the show, Mellencamp — as Calla Lily — alluded to her health: “I was recently reminded how precious it all is. The doctors didn’t catch it at first, but I knew something was wrong. I pushed back and needed answers. When they told me the diagnosis, my world stopped. But then I thought about my children. I chose to face my fears and fight. And it seems to be working. I still have good days and bad ones. But when this opportunity popped up, I jumped at it. I’m nervous but I’m present.”\n\n\tHigh Voltage, Owl, Pangolin and Eggplant join Galaxy Girl, Stingray, Cat Witch, Pugcasso, Snow Cone and Crane in moving on to the next round.\n\n\tTeddi Mellencamp (Calla Lily) joins Claudia Oshry (Queen Corgi), Taraji P. Henson (Scarab), Tone Loc (Handyman), Tiffany Haddish (Le Who Who), Todd and Julie Chrisley (Croissants) and David “Big Papi” Ortiz (Googly Eyes) as the celebrities unmasked so far on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\n\tBack for Season 14 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists McCarthy Wahlberg, Jeong, Ora and Thicke. Thicke opened this episode by singing James Brown’s “Living in America.”\n\n\tNew this season is “America’s Insider,” in which singer, dancer and social media personality Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues for viewers. The twist: Cantrall is in costume as Cat Witch, but will only unmask for viewers — so the audience knows who she is, but the panelists don’t.\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\t\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\n\tHere were the performances on Wednesday’s episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Cannon and High Voltage, “The Masked Singer.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHigh Voltage\t\n\n\tSong: “Miles On It,” Kane Brown and Marshmello\n\n\tPrevious song: “Everybody Wants to Rule the World,” by Tears for Fears\n\n\tClue: Guitar. “I’ve had this by my side since I was 13. It reminds me the greatest comes from finding your rhythm and sticking with it.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Jimmy Fallon, Conan O’Brien, John Stamos\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Conan O’Brien, Julian Edelman\n\n\tHigh Voltage voiceover: “You know what makes America so special? Me. Just kidding. It’s the American dream. My dad immigrated to America with a passion for science. He met my mom, a poet, and the rest is history. Growing up, I lived the full American experience. Slurpees in the summer, Van Halen on repeat, MTV on full blast. And then boom, we’re in the back yard spit roasting a goat. America is called the melting pot for a reason. Who could have guessed, I’d go on to become an American icon. I suppose that’s my version of the American dream. Family, friends, culture coming together and a whole lot of goat.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCalla Lily, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSong: “Jack and Diane,” by John Mellencamp\n\n\tPrevious song: “Fight Song,” by Rachel Platten\n\n\tClue: Diamond key. “This has unlocked countless doors for me and reminds me to step boldly into what comes next.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Danielle Fishel, Selma Blair, Teddi Mellencamp\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Selma Blair, Christina Applegate\n\n\tCalla Lily voiceover: “I can’t celebrate America and not mention an American legend. He’s an icon, but to me, he’s so much more. His main focus was to make my life normal. But man, he was strict. Once, he even grounded me for being late to dinner. At the table, in front of Madonna and Sean Penn. Talk about a mortifying way to find a life lesson. For a while, I resented him for not making my life easy. And there were years that we were distant. When I stopped asking him for his handouts and instead asked him for his wisdom, our relationship flourished. Now, I’m thankful for all he’s done for me. It made me tough, strong and always on time for dinner.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOwl, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOwl\t\n\n\tSong: “Ain’t No Sunshine,” by Bill Withers\n\n\tPrevious song: “Wild Thing,” by the Troggs\n\n\tClue: Super bowl. “I was super-excited when I got to play a part in one of America’s biggest events. Millions of eyes glued to my every move.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Matthew McConaughey, Kurt Russell, Jeff Daniels\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Matthew McConaughey, Billy Bob Thornton\n\n\tOwl voiceover: “I love America’s favorite pastime as much as anyone. But I’m no pro.  Back in the day, I was a scrappy, right-handed slugger. Then one day, my heart was telling me something. This was not my path. So I turned in my glove. I knew there were other fields for me to play in. And guess what? I soared to success. Now that’s a lesson I try to teach my kids. Follow your heart and no matter the field, you’ll always hit a grand slam.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEggplant, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEggplant\t\n\n\tSong: “American Woman,” by Lenny Kravitz\n\n\tPrevious song: “Rocket Man,” by Elton John\n\n\tClue: Hot sauce. “Some say my career has been hot, hot, hot. And I think this bottle says it best.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Billy Joel, Daryl Hall, Kenny Loggins\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Martin Short, Nathan Lane\n\n\tEggplant voiceover: “Life comes at you fast. Especially in the land of opportunity. Like the time I crashed the most iconic event in pop history: The recording of ‘We Are the World.’ I got the private invite from Quincy Jones. Suddenly, I’m hanging with 45 of the biggest legends in music. Now, I topped the charts myself, but I was starstruck. Springsteen. Turner. Dylan. Then along comes MJ, and he tells me, ‘I loved your album. And your voice. Keep doing your thing.’ I was so inspired. And now here’s something I love more than America, an American woman.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPangolin, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWild Card: Pangolin\t\n\n\tSong: “Ironic,” by Alanis Morrisette\n\n\tClue: Winner. “My first big win was more than a dream come true. It was proof that passion and hard work can pay off.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Sara Bareilles, Christina Perri, Katy Perry\n\n\tPangolin voiceover: “Where I’m from is rich with American history. And we all speak the same language: Sports. My family was way into it. My dad would quiz me on Sunday’s starting lineup. And I’d always get it right. I was pretty obsessed. Fast forward to high school. I was at a game with my boyfriend, and after watching the half time show, I was struck, I wanted to do that. He laughed and told me it would never happened. I stared at him and said, I’m going to prove you so wrong. And I did. Right after I dumped him. I became the halftime queen. Turns out, my sports obsessed roots fueled my competitive fire. And to that silly high school boy who said I’d never make it, pretty ironic, don’t you think?.”\n\t\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment. Rosie Seitchik, Craig Plestis and Cannon are executive producers, while Seitchik serves as showrunner. The series is based on the South Korean format created by Mun Hwa Broadcasting Corp.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump says he will not be personally involved in the Justice Department’s pending antitrust review of Netflix‘s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\tTrump told NBC News anchor Tom Llamas that he made the decision to leave the process to the Justice Department during a pre-recorded interview that will air Sunday in advance of NBC and Peacock’s telecast of the Super Bowl. In December, days after Netflix and WBD sealed an $83 billion merger agreement, Trump told reporters “I’ll be involved in that decision.”\n\t\n\n\tBut this week, Trump told Llamas that he’s changed his mind, even though he’s been contacted by “both sides” in the transaction.\n\n\n\t“I haven’t been involved,” Trump told the “NBC Nightly News” anchor in a clip aired by NBC News as a preview for the full sit-down set to run before the big game on Sunday. The pre-Super Bowl presidential interview with an anchor from the host network has been a tradition on the NFL’s big day since President George W. Bush first did so in 2004.\n\n\t“I must say, I guess I’m considered to be a very strong president. I’ve been called by both sides. It’s the two sides, but I’ve decided I shouldn’t be involved. The Justice Department will handle it,” Trump said, per an NBC News transcript.\n\n\tTrump acknowledged that Netflix’s proposed deal to acquire Warner Bros. is complex and the antitrust concerns about its long-term impact on the streaming TV marketplace are significant. He also nodded to the ongoing skirmish between Netflix and Paramount Skydance as the latter keeps up its campaign to snare WBD away from Netflix.\n\t\n\n\t“There’s a theory that one of the companies is too big and it shouldn’t be allowed to do it, and the other company is saying something else,” he said. “They’re beating the hell out of each other — and there’ll be a winner.”\n",

'cause moments after the first event of the Winter Olympics got underway -- the curling venue was forced to pause the action due to a power outage.\n      \n    \n          It all went down at the Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium on Wednesday.

Not long after ... the power came back on -- much to the delight of fans.\n      \n\n          No word yet as to what caused the lights to go dark, but officials at the venue are working to get to the bottom of it.\n      \n    \n          Of course, curling is far from the only sport to have experienced power problems over the years. One of the most famous power outages occurred when the San Francisco 49ers took on the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl 47, which lasted 34 minutes.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Curling got underway a few days before the Olympics officially kick off, with the opening ceremony set for Friday.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Team USA will hit the curling ice on Thursday when they take on Norway in the Mixed Doubles round-robin sheet C and Switzerland in Sheet A.\n      \n    \n          Here's hoping they can keep the lights on for the remainder of the Games.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Olympics\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Super Bowl\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Speculation intensified days later after a “Goodbye Horses” post featured a woman from behind fans believed was SZA.\n      \n    \n          In November 2025, both artists separately attended the GQ Men of the Year event around the same time, further fueling the rumors.\n      \n    \n          But our sources are clear ... there was no romance then, and there isn't one now.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to reps for SZA and Shaboozey ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Shaboozey\n              \n                          \n                sza\n              \n                          \n                Hip Hop\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

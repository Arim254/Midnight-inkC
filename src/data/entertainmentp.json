    "body": "\n\tPrime Video is marking the Indian women’s cricket team World Cup triumph with a special episode of its unscripted series “Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle,” featuring championship-winning players Jemimah Rodrigues and Shafali Verma.\n\n\tHosted by Bollywood actor Kajol and author Twinkle Khanna, the installment will explore the team’s journey to the title, focusing on the athletes’ experiences representing India on the global stage.\n\n\n\t“Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle,” a Banijay Asia production, has become Prime Video’s most-watched unscripted original series in India. \n\t\n\n\t“Team India’s World Cup victory is a landmark moment and a source of immense national pride that will propel women’s cricket in India, inspiring generations of aspiring sportswomen,” said Nikhil Madhok, director and head of originals at Prime Video India. “At Prime Video, we take pride in celebrating real-life stories that move and inspire. It’s a privilege to host Jemimah Rodrigues and Shafali Verma from the World Cup winning team on ‘Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle’ for a candid, heartfelt conversation that celebrates their unwavering spirit and the historic win that captured the entire nation’s heart.”\n\n\tMrinalini Jain, group chief development officer at Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India, described the World Cup victory as “not just a sporting milestone — it’s an emotional, cultural and landmark moment for India that will be etched in history forever.”\n\n\tKajol emphasized the cultural significance of the team’s achievement. “When India won the 2025 Women’s Cricket World Cup, history was made in a way that went far beyond the sport,” she said. “After playing the match of their lives for every woman who’s ever been told to stay in her lane, these girls look like they’re in no mood to hold back — not in their words, and definitely not in their shots.”\n\t\n\n\tCo-host Twinkle Khanna added that the cricketers’ World Cup performance demonstrates how they “break the glass ceiling and every barrier of convention, charting a path for other women in their tow.”\n\n\tThe special episode extends the series’ run as Prime Video continues expanding its unscripted programming slate in India. The streamer’s original content library includes scripted series such as “Panchayat,” “Mirzapur,” “The Family Man” and “Citadel: Honey Bunny,” alongside unscripted formats and post-theatrical film releases.\n\n\tBanijay Asia, launched in 2018 as a joint venture between Banijay Group and Deepak Dhar, produces both scripted and unscripted content for Indian platforms. The company’s unscripted portfolio includes “Temptation Island,” “MTV Roadies,” “The Voice” and “Into the Wild with Bear Grylls.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Egypt Film Commission aims to increase foreign shoots in Egypt, in the wake of recent high-profile productions, including Guy Ritchie’s “Fountain of Youth,” shot at the Giza Pyramids, Neil Burger’s espionage thriller “Inheritance,” shot in Cairo, Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked: For Good,” and Mr Beast’s online video, “I Spent 100 Hours Inside the Pyramids.”\n\n\tLine production in Egypt for these projects was handled by ASAP Productions, Hama Film Productions, Misr International Films and Filmedia LLC, respectively.\n\t\n\n\tASAP Productions also serviced part of season one of the Paramount series “The Agency,” which filmed in Cairo in 2024, and the company’s executive producer, Amin El Masr, says he is actively seeking new productions.\n\n\n\tFilmedia serviced “Wicked: For Good,” with a four-day shoot in Egypt’s White Desert National Park and previously line produced part of the prologue for Colin Trevorrow’s “Jurassic World: Dominion” in 2020, overseen by VFX supervisor, Pablo Helman.\n\n\t“We’re immensely grateful to Universal for their continued trust and support,” says Ahmed Kardous, Filmedia’s CEO and co-founder, adding that he is currently in discussions on several international projects.\n\n\tThe EFC secured special access to the Giza Pyramids for Mr Beast’s 21-minute internet show, which clocked up 43 million views in its first 24 hours and generated over 200 million views on YouTube.\n\n\tSince its launch in 2019, the EFC has assisted over 90 international productions. “This momentum reflects the country’s unparalleled historical landscapes, diverse urban backdrops, and highly capable production services,” says Ahmed Badawi, EFC’s managing director.\n\t\n\n\t“A growing number of production companies from the United States, as well as leading studios and independent producers from Italy, India, China, Kuwait, and other countries across Europe, Asia, and the Gulf region, have expressed strong interest in filming here. This reflects Egypt’s unique combination of cinematic landscapes, world-renowned heritage sites, experienced local crews, and our competitive facilitation environment.”\n\n\tThe EFC’s activity is set against a broader government strategy to augment international awareness of Egypt’s cultural assets, encompassing recent initatives such as the opening of the $1 billion megaproject, the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\n\tThe EFC is a subsidiary of the Egyptian Media Production City, which was founded 25 years ago, and covers an area of 2 million square meters (12.5 million square feet). It is considered to be the largest media and production entity in the Middle East, including sound studios and extensive backlots.\n\n\tThe EMPC offers a 30% cashback scheme for eligible on-site expenditure in its facilities and services. Badawi says that the EFC is currently in active discussion with relevant government authorities to introduce new broader production incentives for off-site and location-based spending in the country.\n\n\tThe EFC positions itself as a one-stop shop for filming in Egypt, including facilitating shooting permits and liaising with local line producers.\n\n\tOther recent international shoots include Barbara Schulz’s “Treasure Hunters: On the Tracks of Khufu,” part of the climate change documentary “Groundswell,” and part of the Belgian eight-episode crime caper series “The Big Fuck-Up,” starring Willem De Schryver and directed by Wim Geudens.\n\n\tTo reeinforce collaboration with Asian and African film markets the EFC recently signed Memorandums of Understandings with China’s Ory Group and the African Film Finance Forum, with the stated goal of strengthening Egypt’s positioning as a central hub for regional co-productions. The EFC also met with India’s Joint secretary minister of information, and United Media Services in March 2025, to discuss how to enhance media and film collaboration between Egypt and India.\n\n\tRecent productions from Asia include Korean TV show “Hit and Miss Tour 3,” and Chinese film “Welcome to Dragon Restaurant,” by Wen Muye (“Dying to Survive”).\n\t\n\n\tAs part of its campaign to attract foreign productions, in Cannes this year the EFC teamed up with Cairo Intl. Film Festival and El Gouna Film Festival to present a unified Egyptian Pavilion, and went on to win the Best Pavilion Design Award.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for Osgood Perkins‘ “Keeper,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tDirector Osgood Perkins has given us not one, but two twisted horror movies this year that are vastly different but equally chilling: “The Monkey,” a gory Stephen King adaptation that dropped in February, and “Keeper,” a haunted cabin thriller releasing in theaters this weekend.\n\n\n\tMuch like Perkins’ past horror movies “Longlegs” and “The Blackcoat’s Daughter,” there’s more going on in “Keeper” than just a couple camping out in a creepy cabin in the woods. The nature getaway soon takes a terrifying turn for Liz (Tatiana Maslany) and and her boyfriend Malcolm (Rossif Sutherland), as Liz begins seeing visions of undead spirits and Malcolm’s true intentions are revealed.\n\t\n\n\tNear the end of “Keeper,” it’s revealed that Malcolm isn’t actually a hard-working doctor, he’s really an immortal manipulator who lures women to his cabin to sacrifice them in order to prolong his life. In a flashback 200 years ago, a young Malcolm and his cousin capture a mysterious pregnant woman who was trespassing on their land. She turns out to be some kind of witch who gives birth to a horde of monsters. In the years that follow, the creatures grant Malcolm and his cousin eternal life in exchange for the lives of women they bring to the cabin for them to feast on. That explains why Liz sees the visions of undead ghouls roaming the property, like a woman with a bloody bag over her head, a long-necked spirit and a white-faced monster spewing gunk from its mouth.\n\n\tBut Liz doesn’t succumb to Malcolm’s evil plans for her. After revealing his true intentions, he locks her in the basement, where the monsters actually embrace Liz and don’t tear her apart. In a twist, the pregnant woman 200 years earlier looked exactly like Liz, so the creatures view her as their mother. The monster with the bag over her head reveals her creepy face, which has multiple eyes and mouths, and calls herself Liz’s child. \n\t\n\n\tWhen Malcolm wakes up the next morning, he suddenly has aged decades overnight. Liz, with the power of her spooky brood behind her, flips the script and captures him. She ties him upside-down and hangs him by his feet from a tree to dunk his head into a pot of honey. In the final shot, we see Liz’s face, which has the same jet-black eyes as her newfound monster children. In the end, it wasn’t the grotesque ghouls causing harm, it was actually the people inside the cabin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe cable outlet known until Saturday morning as MSNBC has long been known for newsy hot takes. Now it’s putting some emphasis on reporters’ news breaks.\n\n\tYes, that was MSNBC in September touting a dispatch from reporters Carol Leonnig and Ken Dilanian, who found the FBI in 2024 allegedly recorded current White House border czar Tom Homan accepting a paper bag containing $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as business executives. After President Trump took office, however, the probe was shut down, they reported. Suddenly, MSNBC had kicked off a news cycle, instead of just weighing in on it later in the evening.\n\t\n\n\tThe network, which just changed its name to MS NOW as it splits from NBC News and NBCUniversal, has gained some notice recently, but not necessarily always tied to the latest rhetorical zingers from Lawrence O’Donnell, insights from Rachel Maddow or inside-the-government analysis from Jen Psaki or Nicolle Wallace. Where the network once relied entirely on the journalism apparatus of NBC News to inform its programming, it now has dozens of its own journalists trying to break stories about the White House, the Department of Justice, heck, maybe even Taylor Swift if it’s something about which viewers might care. The network was first to secure Senator Alex Padilla in June for a live interview after he was forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security press conference. The network has even landed appearances by newsmakers who might not typically come on MSNBC, including U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\t\n\n\tThere are ambitious plans in place for a newly built journalism team. “We are planning to have our reporters talking to individuals in communities to understand their view, what America looks like now, and it will be, you know, it will be honest,” says Joey Cole, who has joined MS NOW as vice president of planning after working as a producer for NBC News. “We’re going to be raw.”\n\n\tCould the infusion of home-grown journalism dim some of MS NOW’s blue leanings? Facts, after all, can sometimes get in the way of a good primetime soliloquy. And what if some of the findings of MS NOW’s news staff clash with what the network’s primetime partisan die-hards want to hear?\n\n\t“I think it’s important to note that we are a news department. And in our jobs the news and the facts will take us to whatever conclusion — the facts take us to in the story. And that is what we are here to do, what we focus on,’[says Scott Matthews, senior vice president of newsgathering for MS NOW. “We never really worry at all about, you know, who is going to like the story and who is going to not like the story,” he adds. There is an expectation that the work of his staff will appear on both MS NOW’s opinion program as well as its daytime news hours, and across TV and digital as well.\n\n\tUnder Rebecca Kutler, named president in February, the network has touted new editorial hires like David Rohde, Jacob Soboroff and Leonnig and Dilanian, as well as newsgathering alliances with AccuWeather and Sky News. It has also parted ways with some of its more vociferous left-leaning personalities, including Joy Reid and Katie Phang.\n\n\tStill, no one managing MS NOW, at least, sees a purple tinge. “ I think our hosts are just as aggressive in their thoughts of what they think about the news as they have ever been,” says Kutler. “I am incredibly proud of the lineup we have.”\n\n\tThere is good reason for MS NOW to seek a jolt from the headlines. While the network lures more audience overall than CNN, it lags both CNN and Fox News Channel among the viewers advertisers want most in news programming, people between 25 and 54. In the third quarter of 2025, MS NOW’s viewership among that demographic was down 59% across the programming day, while CNN’s fell 45% and Fox News’ slipped 26%.\n\t\n\n\tCNN has already begun to play up its daily newsgathering. The Warner Bros. Discovery outlet recently launched a new “All Access” subscription streaming service that burnishes feet-on-the-ground reportage from around the world. MS NOW, which aims to give its viewers news of the world along with opinion, will need to compete.\n\n\tBesides, MS NOW is one of the biggest assets in the portfolio of its new corporate parent, Versant, which is being spun off from Comcast and NBC over the next several weeks. The new company faces ongoing declines in its main lines of revenue, according to a recent research note from Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson.\n\n\t Affiliate fees tied to Versant’s networks fell 6.6% in 2024, according to research from the analyst, while ad revenue slipped 7.2%. MS NOW is projected to see ad sales fall by 11% in 2025, to $653.9 million, according to Kagan, a market-research unit of S&P Global Intelligence.\n\n\tBut an uptick is forecast for MS NOW in 2026, when the network will gear up for a long run to pivotal national midterm elections. There are already signs viewers have new interest. On Election Night, with Democrats winning pivotal seats in an off-year election cycle. MSNBC’s coverage drew an audience nearly on par with that of Fox News Channel, which typically dominates the cable-news audience.\n\n\tThe newly convened newsgathering staff aims to get inside the Beltway and out, with Sudeep Reddy, the network’s new Washington Bureau chief, organizing teams devoted to the White House, Congress, national security, legal affairs and more. Meanwhile, other parts of the team want to dig in to scenes across the nation to demonstrate the effects of national policy. During the government shutdown, some reporters were sent to talk to people on line at food pantries,  showing what the end of SNAP benefits meant to citizens who depend on them  “We are taking all of these things that are being decided in Washington, and we’re showing the real world impact,” says Erin Zimmerman, vice president of newsgathering ”And it’s not just our linear viewer, but it’s our digital viewers. We’re doing a lot of digital packages, a lot of TikTok’s, trying to cover the whole realm.”\n\n\tThey are doing it all without much time for idle thought. The bulk of the team has been assembled over the last several months, with many coming over from NBC News. And while MS-Old and MS-New are naturally driven by the news cycle, more headlines in days to come will be generated by a team that continues to coalesce. No pressure, folks!\n",

    "body": "\n\tJon Voight has called upon President Trump to “terminate” New York City’s mayoral election of Zohran Mamdani. The 86-year-old Oscar-winner, who was appointed the newly invented title of special ambassador to Hollywood by Trump in the first days of his second term, elected to go public with his plea to the president, posting a two-minute speech on social media with an American flag in the background.\n\n\t“We the people have put our trust in the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. He, and only he, can stop this horror, as this mayor, Mamdani, will try to destroy New York’s wealth and turn it into a socialist crap city,” Voight said in the video. “Let this be a warning to the people and may God bless.”\n\t\n\n\tVoight, whose primary residence is in Beverly Hills, Calif., centered his speech on Islamophobic rhetoric, claiming that New York would “turn into a virtual refugee shelter for the radical Muslim ideology” and that the days after Mamdani’s election have been “the most dangerous time for our citizens.” He also erroneously deemed the 34-year-old Mamdani a “communist” — a characterization that the mayor-elect has refuted, describing himself as a “democratic socialist.”\n\n\n\tNotably, the office of the president does not have legal authority to directly remove a New York City mayor from office.\n\n\t“This mayor will destroy this city. We are obligated to demand our rights for our private sanctuary, our businesses, our property that we all have worked so hard for. And this 35-year-old mayor has no right dictating the rules of socialism for a city built on our highest principles with brick and stone by hard-working Americans,” Voight continued. “This must be stopped and his mayoralty should be terminated immediately. You — the people of the greatest city, New York — are in danger of losing your city to this communist fool.”\n\t\n\n\tMamdani won the mayoral election in New York with a majority of the vote, beating former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an Independent after first losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary. Mamdani will take office on Jan. 1. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAirbags are fine. But when it comes to high falls, sometimes all you need to land safely is a stack of cardboard boxes.\n\n\tThat was one of the takeaways from the Round Top Film Festival’s “From the Jump: Film and TV Stunt Designers in Conversation” panel in Round Top, Texas on Nov. 9, which featured veteran stunt coordinators and second unit directors Chris O’Hara, recipient of the fest’s Maverick Stunt Award, and Vic Armstrong, who was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\t\n\n\t“You can tuck a cardboard box into the little corner over there [if] he’s coming off that deck and landing in the alleyway,” said Armstrong. “You get an airbag, you can’t fit it in there.”\n\n\t“If you hit the edge of an airbag, it’s not good. … You’re going to roll right off to the ground,” added O’Hara. “You can hit the edge of boxes, if you set them up correctly, and it will still kind of slow your fall down and do what it’s supposed to. … The general rule of thumb is one two-foot-by-two-foot box is good for 10 feet [of height].”\n\n\tThe panel also featured Nate Boyer (former Army Green Beret and NFL player turned filmmaker), Shane Habberstad (stunt person, stunt coordinator and second unit director), Crystal Hooks (motorsports expert and precision driver), Noelle Therese Mulligan (stunt person) and Tom Struthers (stunt coordinator and second unit director). It was moderated by Variety editor Todd Longwell.\n\n\tPrior to the panel, O’Hara was honored with the Maverick Stunt Award, presented by Variety. A 25-year industry vet, he earned a Taurus World Stunt Award for best second unit director/stunt coordinator for his work on 2024’s “The Fall Guy,” an action-comedy about a stunt man (Ryan Gosling) who goes in search of a missing movie star.  The presentation was made by last year’s Maverick Stunt Award recipient, RJ Casey (“Inception,” “Dunkirk,” “Extraction 2”).\n\t\n\n\t“‘The Fall Guy’ just crushed it,” enthused Casey. “It’s one of those movies that you just can’t turn off because you can’t wait to see the next sequence, the next stunt. … Everything about that movie was magical.” \n\n\tHe went on to praise O’Hara for his efforts to establish a new Academy Award for stunt design, which will debut in 2028: “A lot of generations of stunt people that have made it possible to get stunts into the Oscars finally, and here’s one of the last guys to get that ball into the end zone.”\n\n\tOn “The Fall Guy,” O’Hara and his stunt team broke a Guinness World Record with an eight-and-a-half-turn car roll, executed by stunt driver Logan Holladay, doubling for Gosling. It bested the previous mark of seven rolls set by Adam Kirley in “Casino Royale.”\n\n\t“I personally didn’t get into this business to break world records. That’s not my goal,” said O’Hara, noting that the number of rolls was written into the script. “I said, ‘If we can achieve it, that would be amazing.’ But I think that on Bond it had the terrain to help it out, to give the rolls. It was downhill so it created more energy for it to keep going. We had to do ours on a beach on flat [ground], so I wasn’t sure if it’d be able to be achieved. … We tested two times on the beach, we shot it once. It didn’t go according to plan. Everybody was safe, but it wasn’t the effect that we were looking for and we had a chance to do another one. So that last one that you see on film was everything coming together.”\n\n\tThe stunt was a “cannon roll,” which uses a pyrotechnic or, in this case, pneumatic device mounted under the chassis, usually near the rear axle. When triggered, it fires into the ground, flipping the vehicle. According to O’Hara, the beach setting for the stunt was a subtle nod to the first on-screen cannon roll, performed by driver Gary McClarty in a climactic beach chase sequence in the 1974 detective movie “McQ,” starring John Wayne.\n\n\tThe cannon roll was developed for “McQ” by stunt coordinator Hal Needham (who went on to direct the first meta stunt movie, 1978’s “Hooper,” starring Burt Reynolds) and stuntman Ronnie Rondell. It was an improvement on the less spectacular ramp flip, in which a vehicle is driven on to hidden, angled ramp and rolled – a technique used since the earliest days of film.\n\t\n\n\tLifetime Achievement Award honoree Armstrong is a 60-year stunt veteran whose credits include doubling Christopher Reeve in “Superman” (1978) and Harrison Ford in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), along with second unit director gigs on a long list of films, including a trio of James Bond movies, “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997), “The World Is Not Enough” (1999) and “Die Another Day” (2002). He’s also responsible for an advancement in stunt technology, earning an Academy Award for technical achievement in 1986 for his Fan Descender, a device that uses air resistance to control a stunt performer’s high fall descent speed. \n\n\tIn recent years, much of the new technology used in the stunt realm has come courtesy of visual effects artists, who employ CGI to erase safety wires, composite in dangerous elements like fireballs and, at times, build action sequences almost completely from the whole digital cloth.\n\n\t“I have this love-hate relationship with visual effects,” said Armstrong. “I always equate it to morphine. Morphine in the right dose for the right ailment is an absolute godsend. Used and abused, it’s a killer. And I feel the same way with visual effects. Used in the right way, it’s terrific.”\n\n\tStruthers concurred, but noted that while at times he’s fought against using too much CGI, there are a few stunts where he would’ve been wise to ask for more help from the visual effect department, most notably an aerial sequence in 2012’s ‘The Dark Knight Rises’” in which he had stunt men entering and exiting a plane flying at 6,500 feet.\n\n\t“If I was given that opportunity again, I’d probably do a lot of that digital because of the element of danger of four people [jumping] out the back of a C-130 aircraft at 120 knots,” he said. “I don’t think I would want to have the same heart attack that I had then.”\n\n\tIt’s impossible to have an entertainment industry discussion in 2025 without talking about AI. While many regard it as a digital bogeyman that will usher in he end of times, when the subject was broached during the stunt panel, the reaction was surprisingly sanguine.\n\n\t“At a certain point, there’s not going to be a reason to hit a guy with a car,” said Habberstad, a second-generation stunt pro whose bio notes that he was conceived on a movie set. “There already [are] very few reasons. It has to be a very specific thing to do certain stunts where people can get hurt. And I think at a certain point if the computer can do it better and I don’t have to ask my friend to stand in front of a car, then we’re not going to.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety moderated this conversation in partnership with Round Top Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLive on stage at BravoCon in Las Vegas Friday night, “Real Housewives” executive producer Andy Cohen offered Vicki Gunvalson her old job back for the upcoming 20th season of “The Real Housewives of Orange County.” During a taping of “The Bravos” — BravoCon’s biennial awards show, which will air on Nov. 16 — Cohen told Gunvalson he wants her as a full-time cast member on the show for its historic Season 20. “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” which premiered on Bravo on March 21, 2006, was the inaugural series in the franchise that would change Bravo, and popular culture writ large.\n\t\n\n\tGunvalson, seemingly surprised when Cohen handed her the show’s symbolic orange, immediately said yes to the offer.\n\n\n\tGunvalson — who in her Season 10 tagline iconically declared, “I’m the OG of the OC, and everyone else is just a copy” — helped create the template for “Real Housewives” cast members. As the owner of a successful insursance company in Orange County, she’s a professional woman with two kids and an incredibly messy personal life. \n\n\tSeason 19 of “The Real Housewives of Orange County” is set to conclude on Nov. 20, with the third of its reunion episodes. As the first of the “Real Housewives” shows to reach a 20th season, a rarely achieved milestone for any television show, Bravo is expected to plan celebrations around this landmark. After an inwardly focused 19th season — during which the cast argued excessively about off-screen events, such as illicit conversations with Bravo “bloggers” — “RHOC” is expected to have a shake-up of its lineup.\n\t\n\n\tEnter, Vicki Gunvalson. At the start of “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” Gunvalson was married to Donn Gunvalson (her second husband), but after she told him that her “love tank was empty” (due to his lack of romantic gestures) they split, and divorced in 2014.\n\n\tGunvalson’s divorce set the stage for one of the best seasons in “Real Housewives” history: Season 10 of “RHOC,” which showed that the series could go from being a docusoap about women’s lives to being a riveting true crime thriller. Brooks Ayers, Gunvalson’s boyfriend, faked a cancer diagnosis, and it took a village of women to expose Brooks, led by Detective Meghan King, with assists from Officers Shannon Beador, Tamra Judge and Vicki’s own daughter, Briana Culberson (who hated Brooks most of all).\n\n\tRarely has there been a more satisfying mystery on television, as the truth about his faked diagnosis of stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma — including him forging medical records and bills — unfolded as the season came to a head. Gunvalson never broke, though, and never spilled exactly what she knew, and when she knew it. As another real-life “Dirty John” narrative, Brooks-faking-cancer forever expanded the pleasures of what “Real Housewives” can do.\n\n\tGunvalson was a fulltime cast member through Season 13, but was demoted to “friend” status the next season, after Cohen said they wanted to “freshen” the show. She’s appeared occasionally since, since she and Beador remain close (though the erstwhile “tres amigas” — Beador, Judge and Gunvalson are no more).\n\n\tBravoCon, the fourth edition of the NBCUniversal network’s fan convention, is taking place in Las Vegas from Nov. 14-16.\n",

    "body": "\n\tESPN, ABC and other Disney TV networks are coming back to YouTube TV. \n\n\tGoogle and Disney finally ended their standoff, announcing a multiyear agreement Friday on pricing and terms for a renewed carriage deal for YouTube TV. Disney’s nets went dark on the internet TV service just before midnight ET on Thursday, Oct. 30, after the two sides remained far apart on a deal before the expiration of the previous contract.\n\n\n\tUnder the new agreement, ESPN’s full lineup of sports — including content from ESPN Unlimited — will be made available on YouTube TV to base-plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026. In addition, access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited will be available inside YouTube TV.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal also lets YouTube include the Disney+ and Hulu bundle as part of “select YouTube offerings.” According to Disney, “select networks” will be included in various genre-specific packages that YouTube TV expects to launch in the future. \n\n\t“This new agreement reflects our continued commitment to delivering exceptional entertainment and evolving with how audiences choose to watch,’’ Disney Entertainment co-chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in a joint statement. “It recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice. We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football.”\n\n\tIn a statement, a YouTube spokesperson said Friday, “We’re happy to share that we’ve reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers. Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf. ”\n\t\n\n\tThe deal supersedes their prior distribution agreement, inked in December 2021 after a two-day blackout.\n\n\tOn Sunday (Nov. 9) YouTube began issuing one-time $20 credits to YouTube TV customers for the loss of Disney’s programming, in the hopes it would help stave off user cancelations.\n\n\tMany YouTube TV subscribers dropped the service in frustration. According to a survey fielded last week, 24% of YouTube TV users said they had canceled or intended to cancel their accounts over the Disney blackout. A YouTube rep said that “while subscriber churn is always regrettable, it’s been manageable and does not align with the findings of this survey.” Disney took a hit, too, losing more than $4 million per day during the blackout, according to an estimate by Morgan Stanley analysts.\n\n\tGoogle had said Disney was asking for an unprecedented fee increase for the full suite of ESPN channels, ABC local stations, FX, Disney Channel, Freeform, Nat Geo and more — while Disney claimed the tech giant was “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.” According to Google, Disney was trying to “reset” the market pricing for its programming (so it could charge similarly higher rates in upcoming renewals with other pay-TV distributors) and that Disney was insisting YouTube TV take the Mouse House’s full lineup of networks. The negotiating teams were led by Disney Platform Distribution EVP Sean Breen and YouTube chief business officer Mary Ellen Coe.\n\n\tThe removal of Disney’s networks from YouTube TV came a day before a busy Nov. 1 Saturday slate for college football as major marquee teams face pivotal contests, many of them aired on ESPN and ABC. In light of the blackout, ESPN made its “College GameDay” football pregame show available free to watch via a livestream on X. YouTube TV customers also missed two airings of “Monday Night Football” on ABC and ESPN. (YouTube pointed out to users they could catch all of ESPN’s programming on the ESPN Unlimited subscription service.)\n\n\tAlong with Disney’s live channels, YouTube TV customers’ DVR recordings of the media conglomerate’s programming were removed, as is standard in such disputes. With the deal renewal, YouTube TV subscribers will regain access to recordings that were previously in their library, according to YouTube.\n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday, Disney CEO Bob Iger told analysts that the company had been “working tirelessly to close this deal” but said, “It’s also imperative that we make sure that we agree to a deal that reflects the value that we deliver, which both YouTube, by the way, and Alphabet, have told us, is greater than the value of any other provider.”\n\n\tDisney Entertainment’s Walden and Bergman and ESPN’s Pitaro had previously addressed the impasse in several memos to staffers. “YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,” the execs wrote in an Oct. 31 email. “Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, ahead of this year’s Election Night (Nov. 4), Disney asked Google to restore ABC on YouTube TV for one day to serve the “public interest.” Google declined — and instead suggested that Disney allow YouTube TV to make ABC and ESPN available while the two sides continued talks because those are “the channels that people want.” Disney didn’t go for the idea.\n\n\tThe Disney-Google clash became public Oct. 23, when Disney began alerting viewers that its networks could be removed from YouTube TV.\n\n\tDisney has faced other tough negotiations with distributors amid the transition to ESPN Unlimited — the standalone streaming service launched in August that includes everything on the sports programmer’s lineup — and its continued investment in Disney+ and Hulu.\n\n\tIn 2023, Disney’s networks had a 10-day blackout on Charter Communications cable systems in a similar fight over price. To settle the Charter deal, Disney allowed Charter’s high-tier TV subscribers to access Disney+ and the ESPN+ streaming app. In 2024, ESPN and other Disney nets went dark on DirecTV for nearly two weeks before they reached a new deal. In October, Disney and Comcast quietly reached a carriage renewal deal.\n\n\tGoogle has encountered no small amount of friction in deal-renewal talks this year for YouTube TV. Other programmers that have fought with the internet company include Paramount Global (now Paramount Skydance), Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal — each of which reached a new deal without a blackout. At the end of September, YouTube TV dropped Univision, with Google alleging the price increases sought by parent company TelevisaUnivision were drastically out of line with viewership on the platform.\n\t\n\n\tYouTube TV is the biggest internet-TV service in the U.S., estimated to have more than 10 million subscribers. Next is Disney, which last week closed a deal to merge its Hulu + Live TV business with Fubo; together, those have almost 6 million subs in North America. Google had asserted Disney’s hardball tactics over a YouTube TV deal was “benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmong this year’s CMA Awards nominees, there are a few slightly outside-the-box contenders that may leave the casual listener and maybe even a genre aficionado wondering: “Wait, are they an outlier, or are they really an in-lier?” That isn’t truer of anybody than Stephen Wilson Jr., a best new artist candidate whose two-year-old Big Loud Records debut still has him on the ascent. On the one hand, he just followed that debut up with an EP of grunge-rock covers, which would indicate a left-of-center lean… and on the other, he insists he’s a hardcore Opry lover who desires nothing greater than to become a staple of country radio.\n\t\n\n\tWilson came up for considerable discussion when Variety engaged Big Loud toppers Seth England, Joey Moi and Craig Wiseman for an extended interview going deep into their history on the occasion of the label’s 10-year anniversary. While plenty of that conversation was devoted to the imprint’s rise — and, inevitably, to Morgan Wallen — it drifted almost that inevitably to Wilson and what he might represent as part of Big Loud’s (and the genre’s) future. In this sidebar, we take a more detailed look at what Wilson and the label might mean to one another.\n\n\n\tThe fact that Big Loud is not just open to rock ‘n’ roll sounds but has an actual sub-label called Big Loud Rock was appealing to Wilson, when he was considering different labels as a place to land “Son of Dad,” a 22-song debut that he recorded on his own. But it was by no means the main reason he was attracted to them.\n\n\tSays Wilson: “It’s obvious there is a rock contingent within our sound — it’s undeniable — and them having a rock label and having artists like Hardy that had successfully pivoted between country and rock ‘n’ roll made it even more like an obvious fit. You know, I’m not some obvious genre artistm and they tend to adopt those kind of, genre rejects of Nashville and really kind of nurture them, and know how to kind of cross all the genres. \n\t\n\n\t“But a big reason why I went with Big Loud was because they are a country label. There’s a lot of rock and Americana labels out there that are just not country labels at all. And I really wanted to start with country first — knowing that the path of most resistance for me (commercially) might be country. I wanted to start there, because I knew this is going to be the hardest mountain for me to climb, and perhaps the other ones will be a little bit more achievable. Just from a challenge standpoint, this genre was my goal. \n\n\t“And I truly believe I am a country artist,” he continues. “I write country songs, whether I sound country enough, which is entirely subjective. What I don’t think is subjective is that I write country songs. I argue that I am a country person and always have been, always will be. I very much grew up in that life — yet my paintbrush has always been a little bit more Seattle than Nashville. In how I paint the songs, it has a little bit more of that edge, mixed with kind of Appalachia bluegrass from where I come from. The sound of the Pacific Northwest somehow really fused into what I like, because I played in an indie rock band, where I was a lead guitar player. A lot of the songs that I would write were always kind of too country. I’d have to write real abstractly for that kind of music, which I always loved, too — it was a fun exercise. But I really always truly wanted to write story songs, but paint them in a kind of indie-rock kind of style of music. \n\n\t“And so that’s why I kind of call it Death Cab for Country, jokingly,” Wilson says, “because that’s the best way I can kind of put what I do. But if I’m Death Cab for Country, I’m definitely a country artist and therefore I need to work within a country label that actually knows how to work country artists, because I see myself on country radio. I know a lot of people probably don’t, but I do, and Big Loud does too as well. I love that they’ve always been willing to shake things up and move the goalposts around the field and stretch the membrane of what is possible in this genre. So I like being just another perhaps experiment of theirs, to see if we can do this. And I think they’re fully equipped, and I think we are fully equipped on our side, and I don’t think we could have a better army of, people trying to accomplish what we’re actually trying to accomplish.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStephen Wilson Jr.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAcacia Evans\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat Wilson may cite as a Seattle influence on classic country, others may hear as something that echoes the sound or style of, say, early Steve Earle at his loudest. Wherever it came from, it’s working, and Wilson just sold out, for instance, the Wiltern in Los Angeles, playing to what he said was his biggest audience as a headliner to date, though he won’t take long to top that when he goes back out in 2026.\n\n\tBig Loud has high hopes for the further exposure Wilson will get during CMAs week, starting with the ABC telecast itself, where the singer is getting two performance slots — one to sing his cover of Ben E. Lee’s classic “Stand by Me,” the other to join Shaboozey for “Took a Walk,” their theme song from the recent Stephen King-based film “The Long Walk.” Neither one of those is his actual new single, “Gary,” from a sophomore album that will come out next year, but many viewers will catch a broadcast premiere of that tune on late night TV the night before.\n\n\tSays England, “We have big hopes and (are engaging) marketing, promotion and digital and havuing many conversations internally about trying to turn that awards week into Stephen Wilson week. We’ve got two performances on the show, and the night before, he debuts his new single on Kimmel. So we’ve pre-requested that our young digital team is gonna work between 1 and 3 a.m. and hopefully you’re waking up and can’t escape Stephen Wilson that week.”\n\n\tNotes Moi: “Stephen is having an incredibly special moment. I remember when Craig played me the very first Stephen Wilson Jr. demo I ever heard years ago, back when I first started coming to Nashville, and we were all obsessed with his voice back then, when he was just a songwriter figuring stuff out. So, when our new A&R guy, Nate Yetton, came on and he had revealed that Stephen had gone and made a 22-song record, we were just like, ‘Wait, what? He’s an artist now? This is incredible.’ So to see the record take off and do what it’s doing is pretty magical. He is one of the sweetest guys we’ve ever met; he’s insanely humble. Anytime you start talking to him about his career, he kind of wilts into a little shell and he gets so uncomfortable when you talk about how awesome he’s doing, and that makes it even more fun. So we all keep doubling down and complimenting him. But you’re seeing an insanely organic fan base kind of come in and stay. You know, I think he’s got like Dave Matthews potential — he can go on and just release music and be huge forever.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStephen Wilson Jr., signing photo with Big Loud Records\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Loud\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWiseman points out how long many of them have known Wilson, even though he didn’t evidence any aspirations at the time to do anything beyond being a songwriter. “I’ve been writing with Stephen probably since about 2015, 2016. Such a genuine talent, such a great writer and such a great voice. What’s really cool about him, he’s not the sexy Morgan Wallen type guy or whatever who just easily kind of fits that thing, he’s his own guy. And for everybody to start getting that, that makes it so special.”\n\n\tAlthough Wiseman describes Wilson as being a bit of a shrinking violet when too many compliments come his way, he is hardly the shy type when it comes to standing up for his vision of what his own music should be, as opposed to the hundreds of songs he co-wrote for hire. But the “Son of Dad” project was beyond personal to him, so there would be no compromising that when he went label-shopping. The album title gets at — but really just barely begins to get at — how personal the project was for him.\n\n\t“My dad died and he left me this $3,333.33 life insurance check. It’s the only thing I got from him, and a necklace. And I spent every penny recording the first three songs, and then one of those songs blew up online, called ‘Year to Be Young ’94.’ And then I used the money from that, which was seeded from the original life insurance check, to record 19 more songs, and that’s what “Son of Dad” was. It was not about some hit record or getting bops or getting streams or getting playlists. I really just didn’t care about any of that, and I was very vocal about it, even though I wanted it to succeed, because the songs really helped me, as they were.\n\n\t“When my. dad died, it was colossal. It was devastating, to the point where I didn’t even know if I wanted to live anymore. It was completely destructive. And as a scientist — I used to be a scientist in my former life (for a food manufacturer) — I just kind of went into research mode and kind of went to work it. Either that or I’d just wither up and die. So I was going around town showing these people this 22-song record that was seeded by my dad’s death. And I don’t think anybody really got that but Big Loud.\n\n\t“Seth England has been a friend of mine because I had quit my job as a scientist to be a staff writer, and he was hearing a lot of my demos and hearing my voice a lot. He’s familiar with what I do. But when my dad died, everything changed. I think he could see that switch, that there was like a true transformation within me, and I think he recognized it instantly. For Nate Yetton, I was the first artist he signed there, and I was the first artist he brought to them. That meant a lot too, because he saw something very special. He was like, ‘No, this is my flagship artist,’ and I didn’t really have a lot of A&R people doing that with me. I was just maybe this cool artist that they wanted to maybe chat about on the side that definitely wasn’t the ‘Hey, I want to go to war with this guy’ kind of artist. I was just kind of maybe a novelty piece to them, and to Big Loud, I wasn’t a novelty piece. They saw like how important this was to me — it was bigger than me and bigger than Spotify metrics. It was rooted in something very, very, very real. So that’s what sold me on Big Loud. \n\t\n\n\t“There really wasn’t a lot to debate. It was like, no, they truly get it and they want to support that, and that’s what exactly what they did. The story itself and the songs were enough, and what it needed was a good support system to nurture it — not alter it, not make it more consumable. It was already what it was. And everybody else’s mind (at other labels), there was so much to change… short story long.”\n\n\tHe might as well have been signed to the label, he’d already spent so much time there. “I was pitching a lot of songs to their artists, and I think I was in that Big Loud building at least one day a week 52 weeks a year.  It was almost like a second home for me. I knew everybody in that building. So when I walked in there as an artist to be potentially signed, it was almost like you’re coming to a place that is extremely familiar, almost home. And Seth and Joey and Craig have all been big fans of my artistry long before I even knew my artistry existed. It just kind of took time for the whole thing to make sense for them to get behind it. That’s because I had to do my part — I had to take my chance.\n\n\t“I think once they saw that it was more than just a pipe dream or more than just like this guy doing a novelty songwriter record — because that happens all the time where songwriters do a little record, and it does things, but it’s really kind of a vanity piece…  I think they quickly identified, ‘He’s not trying to do that. He’s actually going for it.’ And that’s when I think things started getting very serious.\n\n\t“I’d written probably 30, 40 songs with Craig Wiseman as a staff writer… and this was (starting in) 2016. I did not want to be an artist. It wasn’t even on the table. It’s not that I was anti- being an artist, it just wasn’t even a conversation that was … yeah, it was a non-conversation. … You know, writing with Craig is  its own experience. It’s not like any other writing room. And he truly is a one of a kind and  I’ve learned so much from writing with him. We actually wrote a song on ‘Son of Dad’ called ‘Holler from the Holler’ together, so he got a cut on the record too, I guess you would say. \n\n\t“I kind of went to songwriting school with Craig, because he has his own process. He runs words through a mill in his mind. And I’ve worked with so many other Hall of Fame songwriters and saw how their processes work. So he was just one chapter of the songwriting class that I got for the first five or six years. Craig and I were just trying to get cuts on Blake Shelton or Kenny Chesney. We weren’t trying to get cuts on my record because my artistry didn’t exist. But from day one, literally when I walked in the room, he’d go, ‘All right, man, you’re the artist in the room.’ And I would always be like, ‘What do you mean by that?’ And he’s like, ‘You’re the artist’ — that means we’re gonna write a song and he’s not gonna sing it, I’m gonna sing it. And he sang plenty of demos and he’s great at doing it. But he designates the artist in the room. So I remember when he said that to me; it’s almost like he just planted a seed from day one, and I didn’t even know he did it. It’s like he did it behind my back. And then, you know, 30 songs later of me being the artist in the room, suddenly you start sounding like an artist outside of the room. That’s what Craig did for me.”\n\t\n\n\tOf his nomination for best new artist at the CMAs, Wilson says, “That’s mind blowing in itself, and it’s a testament to the reason why I went the way I went” — signing with Big Loud, that is — “because these are the kinds of lanes that I was trying to get into.” He elaborates. “My grandparents, back to my great-grandparents, my whole family are big Grand Ole Opry people. That stuff is like crazy important to me, the legacy that is country music. And for me to have any kind of impact on that story, from my hometown or my upbringing, and having that generation spoken for in country music, would be a real honor.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen you’ve only lived for a decade, the next one stretches ahead of you like an apparent eternity. To the elders raising you, it goes by in the blink of an eye. Docmakers Itab Azzam and Jack MacInnes maintain both those perspectives in their film “One in a Million,” charting changes at once vast and disorientingly swift in the life of a young Syrian refugee estranged from her past and unsure of her future — and in the present, growing up faster than her similarly unmoored parents can process. First encountering their 11-year-old protagonist Israa in 2015, when she and her family have been newly displaced from their home in Aleppo, Azzam and MacInnes spend ten full years following her through several stages of cultural alienation and adaptation, alongside the more universal trials of adolesecence.\n\t\n\n\tThe resulting film is both a stirring addition to the veritable library of documentaries on the European migrant crisis that has built up in the last ten years, and an unusual, high-stakes example of a time-lapse coming-of-age study — that fascinating subgenre that covers the likes of Michael Apted’s “7 Up” series in nonfiction and Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” in narrative cinema — as its young human subject steadily and turbulently grows up before our eyes. Despite the jagged circumstances under scrutiny, this is a highly polished, emotionally accessible production, sure to connect with substantial TV audiences when it airs on PBS’ Frontline and the BBC’s Storyville strands following its Sundance competition premiere.\n\n\n\t“One in a Million” opens near the end of Israa’s journey, as the 21-year-old returns in 2025 to Syria following the fall of the Assad regime, gaping in astonishment at the bombed-out skeleton streetscapes of Aleppo — a place of which she only has sheltered childhood memories, further burnished by ten years of absence. It’s a cathartic return, though it’s ambiguous whether it’s a homecoming or not: After years of living as a refugee in Europe, Israa finds it’s possible to feel like a foreigner on one’s native soil. We rewind to the filmmakers’ first encounter with Israa and her family, on the sidewalks of Izmir, Turkey in 2015, shortly after their initial flight from Syria. Selling cigarettes on the street to buy food for her siblings, the pre-teen is indefatigably upbeat, eagerly anticipating an imminent passage to Germany.\n\t\n\n\tHer middle-aged father Tarek, meanwhile, is rather more circumspect. “I’m gambling with the lives of my children,” he admits to the filmmakers, who appear to gain the family’s full trust and candor early on in proceedings — to the point that Israa, on seeing her parents fighting, immediately reports to the camera crew in the hope of breaking up the conflict. There’s more tension than initially meets the eye in the marriage between Tarek and Israa’s mother Nisreen, a camera-shy presence in the first years of filming, who feels significantly more empowered to speak for herself as she settles into a European way of life. \n\n\tUpon their arrival in Germany, these family dynamics further shift and sour: Nisreen and Israa soon embrace the independence that women are afforded in their new environment, while Tarek retreats into a mindset of resentfully conservative patriarchy. As anyone who has raised a teenager might expect, however, Israa’s arc of change isn’t a smooth curve, as she pivots between brazenly westernized rebellion and a more demure embrace of her Islamic roots — particularly when an older boyfriend, fellow Syrian refugee Mohammed, enters the scene. \n\n\tAs she approaches adulthood, Israa assertively distances herself from Tarek, revealing him to be a volatile abuser, but more passively drifts from the influence of her liberated mother, who’s loath to romanticize any aspect of her Syrian past. Nisreen understands her daughter’s homesickness but refuses to share in it. “She didn’t go through what I went through,” she says curtly, in one of the film’s later talking-head interviews — all of which are exactingly shot, lit and styled to mark the participants’ changing appearances and outlooks. (The Nisreen we see at the film’s close, perfectly made up in a turquoise hijab that sets off her pale blue contact lenses, is a pointedly different presence from the modest, retiring figure she cuts at the outset.)\n\n\tAzzam and MacInnes, a married couple from Syria and the U.K. respectively, are well-placed to address these intricate cultural confrontations with tact and empathy, though they maintain a largely observational stance over the course of filming — “One in a Million” is one of those close-quarters character-study docs filmed with such intimate fluidity that you almost forget the complexities of inserting a camera in this fraught domestic space. (Simon Russell’s lushly emotive score gives some scenes the heightened sweep of teary fiction.) Early on in proceedings, Israa embraces the gaze of the lens, wondering if fame awaits her; by 21, with her life still at a crossroads, she seems ready to figure it out in private. In following her to this point, however, this long-game project gives remarkable dimension and particularity to the kind of migrant story often only told in journalistic generalities — showing, year on year, how time heals some wounds, opens others, and creates plenty of its own.\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tChris Pratt led the domestic box office on Friday with the only major newcomer of the weekend: Amazon MGM’s “Mercy.” The sci-fi thriller threatens to end the winning streak of “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which has topped the North American charts for the past five weekends.\n\n\t“Mercy” earned $5 million domestically on its opening day from 3,468 locations. The film is projected to gross $12.6 million by Sunday.\n\n\n\tPratt leads “Mercy” as Chris Raven, a detective from the not-so-distant future who is on trial for the murder of his wife, played by Annabelle Wallis. An AI judge, played by Rebecca Ferguson, gives him 90 minutes to prove his innocence or face immediate execution. Timur Bekmambetov, a familiar face in the screenlife subgenre, directs the film with a script from Marco van Belle.\n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” added $1.7 million on its sixth Friday at the domestic box office. James Cameron’s sci-fi threequel should pull in an estimated $7.1 million over the weekend, bringing its North American total to $378 million.\n\n\tUnless the tides shift, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will relinquish its box office crown before the end of its sixth weekend in theaters. The first “Avatar” and its sequel, “The Way of Water,” both remained No. 1 through seven weeks and grossed well over $2 billion.\n\n\tLionsgate’s domestic thriller “The Housemaid” grossed $1.48 million on Friday for a third-place finish. Its domestic total should reach $115 million by the end of the weekend. The adaptation of Freida McFadden’s twisty novel became a sleeper hit through the holidays and beyond, powering well past its $35 million pricetag. Naturally, a sequel is in the works, with star Sydney Sweeney and director Paul Feig returning. \n\t\n\n\tRounding out the Friday top five were Disney’s box office juggernaut “Zootopia 2” and Sony’s zombie thriller, “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple.” \n\n\tAt No. 4 was “Zootopia 2,” which earned $1.4 million on its ninth Friday in North American theaters. The animated sequel should gross an estimated $5.9 million through the weekend, pushing its domestic total to a mighty $401 million. \n\n\t“28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” came in last place with just $1.2 million domestic on its second Friday in theaters. Sony’s horror thriller opened soft last weekend with $13 million against projections of $20 million to $22 million through the Martin Luther King Jr. Day frame. “The Bone Temple,” which carries a $63 million price tag, looks to add $4.2 million by Sunday (a 68% drop), for a domestic total of $21 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSam Raimi, who helmed Sony’s “Spider-Man” film franchise from 2002 to 2007, recently told ScreenRant that his versions of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, played by Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, “have gone elsewhere” with little hope of returning to the big screen.\n\n\t“Stan Lee’s great character — that a bullpen of writers in New York at Marvel had come up with stories for — he created the character, but so many people contributed, so many artists, that for a brief time I was handed the torch to carry on after 40 years of ‘Spider-Man’ comics,” Raimi said. “And then after my three movies, I handed the torch off to someone else. And I think they’ve got to keep running with the storyline and the audience that is now following the torchbearer.”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Evil Dead” director explained that a new generation of superhero fans is “really into” the new “Spider-Man” era led by Tom Holland. He added that it wouldn’t “be right for me to go back and try and resurrect my version of this story” after making way for another group of filmmakers to step in. \n\n\n\tRaimi’s first “Spider-Man” debuted in 2002 and was followed by two sequels in 2004 and 2007, respectively. In 2012, Marc Webb took over the franchise with “The Amazing Spider-Man,” which saw Andrew Garfield step into the titular role. Webb’s sequel, “The Amazing Spider-Man 2,” followed in 2014.\n\n\tMarvel Studios reclaimed Spider-Man in 2016, inserting Tom Holland into the role with the release of “Captain America: Civil War.” Holland got his first standalone film in 2017 with “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” followed by 2019’s “Spider-Man: Far from Home” and 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home.”\n\t\n\n\tThe latest “Spider-Man” film, “Brand New Day,” which recently wrapped production, swings into theaters on July 31. “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” director Destin Daniel Cretton helms the film. Supporting cast members include Zendaya, Jon Bernthal, Sadie Sink, Mark Ruffalo, Tramell Tillman, Michael Mando and Jacob Batalon.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“King,” the keenly anticipated next project from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, has locked its 2026 release date. \n\n\t“King” reunites Khan with his “Pathaan” director Siddharth Anand, marking the superstar’s first theatrical release in three years. The cast also includes Khan’s daughter Suhana Khan, Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Arshad Warsi and Rani Mukerji.\n\n\n\tWriters on the action thriller include include Sujoy Ghosh, Anand, Suresh Nair, Sagar Pandya and Abbas Tyrewala. The film is produced by Gauri Khan, Siddharth Anand and Mamta Anand for Red Chillies Entertainment and Marflix Pictures.\n\t\n\n\t“King” is due a Dec. 24 release. \n\n\tKhan, often referred to by his initials SRK, has been a dominant force in Bollywood since his breakthrough role in the 1993 thriller “Baazigar.” His charisma and versatility quickly established him as a leading man, with romantic comedies like “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (1995) cementing his status as Bollywood’s “King of Romance.”\n\n\tThroughout the ’90s and early 2000s, Khan’s star power seemed unstoppable. He delivered a string of box office hits, including “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” (1998), “Devdas” (2002), and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003). These films not only dominated the domestic market but also found significant audiences in the Indian diaspora, helping to expand Bollywood’s global footprint. Notably, his 1998 film “Dil Se” became the first Indian film to break into the U.K. box office top 10, signaling Bollywood’s growing international appeal.However, Khan’s career hasn’t been without its challenges. The mid-2010s saw a series of commercial disappointments, including “Fan” (2016), “Zero” (2018) and “Jab Harry Met Sejal” (2017). These setbacks led to speculation about whether the actor’s reign at the top was coming to an end.\n\t\n\n\tYet, true to form, Khan has demonstrated resilience. The year 2023 marked a triumphant return after a four-year hiatus with three major releases: “Pathaan,” “Jawan,” and “Dunki.” Both “Pathaan” and “Jawan” have joined the ranks of India’s all-time highest-grossing films, reaffirming Khan’s enduring appeal and his ability to evolve with changing audience tastes.\n\n\tIn 2024, Khan was accorded a career achievement award at the Locarno Film Festival. \n\n\t“King” is IMDb’s most anticipated Indian film of 2026. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRory Kennedy touched down at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival as the director of the upcoming documentary “Queen of Chess.” The film chronicles the 15-year success of Hungarian chess prodigy Judit Polgár as she overcomes champion Garry Kasparov and her controlling father over 15 years.\n\n\t“I did a deep dive in researching and I was just stunned by what I read,” Kennedy said at the Variety Studio presented by Audible about what compelled her to tackle Polgár as a doc subject. “She had been the number one female chess player for 26 years. She was the youngest grand master. She beat Bobby Fisher’s record. She’s the only woman to break through the top 10 chess players in the world and that’s still true to this day. I was amazed that I had never heard of her story.”\n\t\n\n\tAs a member of the Kennedy family, Rory continues to find her lineage at the center of headlines. Her late cousin, John F. Kennedy Jr., is soon getting the Ryan Murphy treatment with FX’s limited series “American Love Story.” The show follows the relationship between Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. The couple was on their way to Rory’s wedding when they were killed in a plane crash.\n\n\t“I am not sure that I will watch it,” Rory Kennedy said about the series. “I was quite close to John and continue to miss him every day. It’s been a great loss for our family and a great loss to the country. They are people we feel very close to and saddened by their loss. But there are opportunities for younger people who did not know their story to learn about it. Depending on how the show is done, it could also be a wonderful thing to their character, their personality, their contribution to society. We will see.”\n\t\n\n\tRory Kennedy also touched upon the recent loss of her first cousin Tatiana Schlossberg, John F. Kennedy’s granddaughter. Schlossberg died in December at 35 years old, soon after chronicling her blood cancer battle in a devastating New Yorker column in which she also championed greater access to healthcare.\n\n\t“She was very brave and courageous,” Rory said. “That article in the New Yorker reached so many hearts and minds and helped people understand who she was. It was so beautiful to me because she was an extraordinary person. The loss there is … she was 35 years old. The world is a little less good without her around.”\n\n\tWhen asked about Schlossberg’s essay and some of her final public words being about championing healthcare, Rory responded: “There is an urgency around what’s happening with healthcare in our country and around the world. There are a lot of doctors and scientists coming together, alerting us that what is happening right now is endangering the health of this country. We really need to pay attention to the scientists and the doctors.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following review contains mild spoilers.\n\n\tFor decades, the Motion Picture Association’s film ratings system — devised by the American studios to advise parents and avoid censorship — offered clear guidelines on whether the material contained in any given Hollywood release was appropriate for children. The organization was mostly concerned about sex and violence, though it also cautioned audiences about something vaguely described as “adult situations,” which young viewers might find overwhelming or otherwise difficult to process.\n\t\n\n\tThe standout of this year’s Sundance Film Festival competition, in terms of both audacity of subject and maturity of execution, “Josephine” is a movie in which the eponymous child (vulnerably embodied by newcomer Mason Reeves) is prematurely forced to deal with adult situations. Inspired by traumatic events in writer-director Beth de Araújo’s own childhood, it’s the story of an 8-year-old girl who witnesses something no child should see — a sexual assault between two strangers — and her ensuing struggle to make sense of a crime she can’t begin to comprehend.\n\n\n\tEarly one Sunday morning, while running through Golden Gate Park with her father (Channing Tatum), Josephine takes a wrong turn. From her spot on a hill, she happens to observe a strange man following a female jogger into one of the public bathrooms. Then come the screams. When the woman exits, her assailant throws her to the ground, rips off her clothes and overpowers her. Even (or perhaps especially) seen from a distance, the attack is disturbing to watch, and though the culprit is swiftly apprehended, thanks to the quick action of Josephine’s athletic dad, the damage is done.\n\t\n\n\t“Josephine” eventually builds to a big courtroom scene where its title character courageously agrees to testify, but de Araújo seems less concerned with the verdict (which the movie withholds) than she is with recognizing how the experience impacts Josephine, reshaping how she views the world going forward. Developed through the Sundance Labs, de Araújo’s second feature (following 2022’s stunning single-shot thriller “Soft & Quiet,” about white supremacists hiding in plain sight) fits the dominant theme of this year’s festival — coping with trauma — but does so in a sensitive, psychologically complex way.\n\n\tAs Josephine’s mom Claire (Gemma Chan) eventually tells her daughter, there’s no way to go through life without bad things happening: “It is your responsibility for you to fix your own pain.” Meanwhile, her dad Damien thinks of everything in terms of sports, speaking like a coach when he suggests that pain makes people stronger. No wonder Josephine often hears the adults around her arguing. They can’t agree on a way forward, and the film allows them to be imperfect — especially the hard-headed Damien, whose temper escalates quickly. For his part, Tatum gives a complex performance the likes of which he’s never been asked before, enriched by his own status as a parent. Between this, “Roofman” and the underrated “Dog,” audiences are discovering a different side of the star.\n\n\tIt may sound strange to use the word “subtle” to describe a film that opens with a brutal assault, and yet, de Araújo excels in constructing a universal human experience out of incredibly specific details (whether drawn from memory, research or her imagination). The moments immediately following the crime are especially powerful, as the filmmaker puts us in Josephine’s place. “Don’t move!” Damien orders — which also happens to be the title of de Araújo’s autobiographical segment for The Moth — before dashing after the perp.\n\n\tLeft behind with a police officer, Josephine must have felt like she was the one being punished, as he locked her in the back of his squad car with the survivor (Syra McCarthy). The moment stretches into a kind of eternity, marked by tactile details: searching for a seatbelt, wanting to console this crying woman, identifying with a bug trapped against the window. In a telling moment, Josephine seems to feel helpful when asked to find the woman’s hair tie among the weeds. And then there’s the long moment, which will haunt her for the rest of the film, in which she locks eyes with the suspect (Philip Ettinger).\n\t\n\n\tRaised in a household that never discussed sex, Josephine has no way of understanding what she’d seen. (Watching the scene a second time, it’s admirable to recognize how de Araújo protected her child star from the truth of what she was playing. Even more impressive is how much Reeves conveys without fully knowing.) As the girl’s ignorance begets further consequences, from acting out at school to the way she looks at unfamiliar men from then on, the filmmaker’s skill comes in embracing a certain ambiguity.\n\n\tInstead of forcing an interpretation upon her audience, de Araújo trusts us to make sense of her characters’ contradictory, if not downright counterproductive mindsets. For example, no one here has the slightest idea how to handle Josephine after the incident. When she asks her dad, “What was that man doing?” he immediately changes the subject, acting like nothing happened. At home, Claire acknowledges the family’s tradition of avoiding tough subjects, describing it as the reason she never goes to her own mother for help as an adult. And yet, she’s helpless to discuss what happened with her daughter, who’s clearly desperate for an explanation.\n\n\tOverhearing an unfamiliar word (but not knowing how to spell it), Josephine types R-A-I-P into the search engine, researching the concept “of rape” on her own — which anyone can agree is the wrong way to learn. Her mom suggests they bring Josephine to a psychologist (a response a child might misconstrue as some kind of penalty), while her adversity-makes-us-stronger dad enrolls Josephine in self-defense classes. From here on, one of the movie’s more nuanced developments is how the girl gravitates toward — or else rejects — each of her parents at different stages. Arguably the film’s most moving scene occurs between Josephine and her mother in the car, when the child bluntly asks, “Were you ever raped?” and the truth comes indirectly, contradicting her answer, through a single tear.\n\n\t“Josephine” serves up multiple reasons for audiences to cry, nearly all of which come from expressions of solidarity. (The director dealt with her own trauma by volunteering for a crisis hotline, and that experience clearly informs her screenplay.) In her testimonial for “The Moth,” de Araújo describes never getting closure with the survivor of the assault she was privy to as a child. As if to rectify that, she gives Josephine her moment in court, where the girl is cross-examined by a skeptical female lawyer (Dana Millican), as well as a symbolic reunion near the end of the film. In real life, de Araújo’s father warned, “You’re not a welcome memory for her.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile some might find it triggering, “Josephine” dares to confront the life-shattering intersection of sex and violence in our culture, facing the toughest of “adult situations” with clear eyes.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn 2018, Iliza Shlesinger wrote down, “what if high school came back to bite you in the ass?” \n\n\tOver many, many rewrites, as well as several false starts and stops, that germ of an idea culminated in “Chasing Summer,” a comedy about a 40-something woman who returns to the Texas hometown she fled decades ago only to find herself embracing a summer of parties, menial jobs and carefree romance. That may sound like the premise of an Apatow-ian exercise in arrested development, but Shlesinger wasn’t interested in just landing punchlines.\n\t\n\n\t“I knew what I wanted,” Shlesinger said during a Zoom interview a week before “Chasing Summer’s” Sundance premiere. “I wanted to make a film. I wanted to make art. I thought it’s time to make something beautiful, not just a straightforward comedy, because this very easily could have been that, and I wanted it elevated.”\n\n\n\tTo realize her vision, Shlesinger turned to Josephine Decker, an indie filmmaker best known for moody thrillers and dramas such as “Shirley” and “Butter on the Latch.” It was an unconventional match, but there was something about Decker’s style that Shlesinger thought would be perfect for “Chasing Summer.” \n\n\t“This is the kind of movie that always speaks to me and that I want to be directing,” Decker said. “Instead, the things that get sent to me are like, serial killer movies. For some reason, the only things I ever get submitted are like this woman is murdered in the first three minutes.”\n\n\tShlesinger, who is a popular stand-up and sketch comic, wasn’t worried about delivering laughs. Working with Decker, she re-examined her script to make sure that the humor didn’t come at expense of exploring her character’s wounded heart. It helped that Decker, like Shlesinger, is also from Texas and had an innate understanding of the region, its idiom and its rhythm of life. When it came to casting the picture, they sought out people who could believably hail from the Lone Star state, such as Megan Mullally, an Oklahoma native who plays Shlesinger’s mom, and Garrett Wareing, the Texas-born “Ransom Canyon” star who plays her younger lover. \n\t\n\n\tIn “Chasing Summer,” Shlesinger’s character Jamie, is a humanitarian aid worker who is constantly jetting off to disaster areas around the world. But after she endures a messy breakup, she returns to her parent’s house to recover, spending her days working as a maintenance person at her sister’s skating rink. She also meets Colby (Wareing) at a keg party, sparking a steamy affair.\n\n\t“What I wrote in the script is, like, ‘Jamie and Colby kiss and they fall out of frame,’ and I show up to set and Josephine is like, ‘okay, he’s going down on you and then the camera is going to pan over you both from behind,” Shlesinger jokes. \n\n\tThere is indeed a lot of sex in “Chasing Summer,” but Shlesinger and Decker were intent on staging the hookups in a way that would be sexy to women, as well as men. That meant making sure that the cinematography was beautiful, as well as sensual, instead of replicating what Shlesinger dismisses as “full ’90s Michael Douglas, Skinemax.”\n\n\t“Josephine, was putting this through a female gaze and thinking about, what do we want to see as women?” Shlesinger said. “What’s the kind of intimacy that we want? How do we want to feel? We wanted this to be beautiful for women to enjoy it. She could just stand there for six seconds and a guy’s gonna enjoy it.”\n\n\tThat meant having the scenes last longer than they might in a more conventional romance, something that divided audiences down gender lines during a recent test screening. \n\n\t“I made them so long,” Decker says. “We did a screening for 30 or 40, people to just see how everything was landing in early December. And it was so funny, because some guy was like, ‘I don’t know, these sex scenes feel a little long.’ And literally, all of the women there rose up and were like, ‘sit down! They’re perfect!”\n\n\tDecker and Shlesinger also relied on intimacy coordinators. \n\n\t“The coordinator created an emotional safety net and worked so closely with the actors who are going to be having sex scenes to talk about consent and comfort,” Decker said. “It’s kind of like having a fight coordinator who makes your action scene cooler and more interesting. It just deepened the storytelling.” \n\n\t“Chasing Summer” is one of many films at Sundance looking for distribution, and though the filmmakers insist they just want it to find a good home, you get the sense they’d prefer for it to be seen with as big a crowd as possible. \n\t\n\n\t“I mean the best way to answer that is we want to make a lot of money, and we want a lot of people to see this,” Shlesinger said. “Hopefully people feel the same way when they watch it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains details about “The Beauty” Episode 3, now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tAmelia Gray, the 24-year old model and daughter of Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin, isn’t surprised she’s making her acting debut in a Ryan Murphy project, “The Beauty.”\n\n\t“My household was a real Ryan Murphy household,” Gray tells me. “Growing up between ‘Glee’ and ‘American Horror Story,’ it was like every Tuesday night, everybody gets in my parents’ bed and we’re watching one of the Ryan Murphy shows. So it was just really crazy to have that be my first experience. It’s not only a Ryan Murphy show, but a Ryan Murphy show that he was directing.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile her appearance on “The Beauty” lasts just a few minutes, it’s an explosive performance – literally.\n\n\n\tGray plays a model having lunch in the Conde Nast cafeteria when she suddenly starts throwing up and violently attacking people (including characters played by Ben Platt and Megan Trainor) before she eventually explodes. She’s another victim of The Beauty, a sexually transmitted fountain-of-youth treatment that also can produce lethal side effects.\n\n\tGray almost didn’t audition for the role. When her mom told her that she had an email from producers asking for a self-tape, Amelia was in Paris working despite being sick with a fever. “I was not down to do anything other than what I had to do, which was to get up and walk a runway that day,” she recalls.\n\n\tBut then she read the email. “The description said, ‘Supermodel, extremely ill, but still looks good,’” Gray says, laughing. “I was like, ‘Oh, fuck, I gotta do that. I don’t know if I look good, but I’m definitely sick as fuck.’ I’d never shot a self-tape before in my life, did not know how to do it, but it was one of those things where I was like, ‘You know what universe, if it’s meant to be, it’s gonna be.’ I set my iPad up in my Parisian hotel room, so sick, and just read the lines. I did one take sent it in and forgot about it.”\n\t\n\n\tShe was offered the part four months later. Gray says her acting agent told her not to taking acting lessons. “He said that they wanted me,” she explains, before adding she will enroll in acting classes if more substantial work comes along. “I’ve been talking to Kaia Gerber every time I see her at Pilates because she went from modeling to acting. The amount of respect that I have for actors, people don’t understand. It took me 16 hours and two plus days to shoot a three-minute scene. Babe, it takes me one day to shoot a whole campaign, you know? So I don’t know. I’m very grateful for my job, and I have a lot of respect for actors. I’m just not sure it’s my life yet.”\n\n\tGray did her own stunts, except for one – when she had to throw Trainor’s character out of a building through a window: “I had the Met Gala two days later, and I show up to set, and there’s like, real glass,” she says. “They’re like, ‘The glass might get all over you.’ I was just like, ‘Ah, no, I’m gonna go.’”\n\n\t“The Beauty” hadn’t even premiered yet and it was already sparking conversations about beauty standards and the lengths people will go to achieve so-called perfection with the series quickly being compared to “The Substance,” the Oscar-nominated thriller about an aging actress (played by Demi Moore) who abuses a youth serum after she is fired from hosting her aerobics television show.\n\n\tGray has had her own experiences with cosmetic surgery and treatments. On speculation that she uses lip filler, she explains, “I’ve always had these lips,” and has never used fillers. “I’m doing this thing right now called SkinVive, which is a moisturizer injection, not a filler.”\n\n\tShe’s been open about having had a nose job as well as a medically necessary breast reduction to prevent a case of sepsis from an infection caused by a nipple ring. She also tells me that she got breast implants later on, but the procedure went horribly wrong. “I was dating somebody who was older than me when I was younger, and I sort of allowed his beauty perception to affect my choices, and I decided to get another breast augmentation because I wasn’t necessarily happy with the scarring that I was left with from the reduction,” Gray says. “I woke up in a state that I didn’t agree to. We can just say that.”\n\t\n\n\tBut then she continues, “That also turned into a medical emergency surgery, because my breasts literally could not handle what were put in me. It got to the point where I couldn’t even pump soap because the implants were pushing on the nerves. I ended up having to get a 14-hour reconstruction surgery.”\n\n\tWhile Gray may seem like an open book, she says she has no desire to return to reality TV after first appearing one her parents’ reality series “Harry Loves Lisa” on TV Land in 2010 and then with her mom on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” “It’s never happening,” Gray says. “You can tell people to stop approaching me about them. I’ve had enough.”\n\n\tShe also wouldn’t follow her mom with a turn on “The Traitors.” “It’s fun when there’s a game to be played, but I also saw what that also does to a human being…having to lie and deceive for however many weeks or months,” Gray says. “That does something to your brain.”\n\n\tI ask if Rinna was different when she returned from the reality competition show. “She needed some healing time, for sure,” Gray says. “But that’s her own journey to explore and tell when she’s ready.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSir Rod Stewart once counted himself a friend of President Donald J. Trump, but that is being pushed even further back into the past now that the pop superstar has slammed him as a “draft dodger” in a video statement condemning the president’s disparaging remarks about the courage of NATO troops.\n\n\tIn the Instagram clip, Stewart adds his voice to the chorus of Brits expressing outrage at Trump for “unbearable” and “disgraceful” remarks about NATO troops, in which the president suggested that European allies held back from being on the front lines during the Afghanistan conflict, leaving the true bravery to American troops. And he calls on the U.K.’s leaders to demand an apology from Trump for what he considers an insult to fallen soldiers.\n\t\n\n\t“Hi there. I may just be a humble rock star. I’m also a knight of the realm, and I have my opinions,” Stewart begins, standing in formal dress in a stately living room. “I was born just after the war [World War II], and have great respect for our armed forces that fought and gave us our freedom. So, it hurts me badly, deeply, when I read that the draft dodger Trump has criticized our troops in Afghanistan for not being on the front line.”\n\n\n\tStewart continues, “We lost over 400 of our guys. Think of their parents. Think about it! And Trump calls ’em almost like cowards. It’s unbearable. So I’m calling on you, Prime Minister [Keir] Starmer and [Reform UK leader Nigel] Farage. Please, make the draft dodger Trump apologize, please.” \n\n\tWith that, the singer then gives the camera a salute before walking off-camera. In Stewart’s final moments on-screen, messages are flashed on the screen, including “We shall never forget,” “So disrespectful,” “Honor them,” “Disgraceful,” “Take a stand” and “Thank you.”\n\t\n\n\n\tThe fury directed at Trump and other Brits is in response to an interview Trump gave to Fox News in Davos on Thursday, where his seemingly offhand remarks generated shocked international headlines. In the Fox interview, the president said of NATO: “We’ve never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them… You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did ‚ they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.”\n\n\tIn Afghanistan, 457 British troops were killed, second only to the U.S. soldiers who fell.\n\n\tPrime Minister Starmer has been among those speaking out against Trump’s disparagement of the allies’ contributions. “I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “There were many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries. I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling, and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\n\tWhile he did not quite fulfill Stewart’s demand that the U.K. formally request an apology from Trump — a president who famously does not do apologies — the prime minister made it clear he thought one was in order. “If I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologize,” Starmer said, in response to a question about whether the U.S. president should be penitent about the insult.\n\n\tPrince Harry — who did two tours of duty in Afghanistan as an Army Air Corps co-pilot gunner — also responded to Trump, while not referring to the president by name.\n\n\t“In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first — and only — time in history,” said Harry. “It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call. I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there. The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace.”\n\n\tAnger about Trump’s remarks crossed party lines in Britain. Reform U.K. leader Nigel Farage, the Trump ally who was among those Stewart said should demand an apology, said on social media: “Donald Trump is wrong.” Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch had stronger words, calling Trump’s knocking of NATO troops’ efforts “flat-out nonsense… British, Canadian, and NATO troops fought and died alongside the US for 20 years. This is a fact, not opinion. Their sacrifice deserves respect, not denigration.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart had been critical of Trump’s seeming lack of support for the allies before, saying in June 2024 that he “has moved away from Europe, as America were our strongest allies.” But referring to him twice as a “draft dodger” signaled a new level to the rocker’s upset with his neighbor and former friend.\n\n\tStewart is not exactly known as an arch left-winger. Last year, he spoke encouragingly of Trump’s ally in the U.K., saying to The Times, “We’re fed up with the Tories. We’ve got to give Farage a chance. He’s coming across well. What options have we got? I know some of his family. I know his brother, and I quite like him.”\n\n\tAs for his past relationship with the president, Stewart said last year, ““’m not a great fan of Trump. I knew him very, very well. I used to go to his house. I live literally half a mile away (in Florida)… We’re both on the beach. I used to go to his Christmas parties. He’s always been a bit of a man’s man. I liked him for that. But he didn’t, as far as I’m concerned, treat women very well. But since he became President, he became another guy. Somebody I didn’t know.”\n\n\tStewart has been critical in recent times of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, calling the actions against Palestinians in Gaza “annihilation,” and supportive of Ukraine, flying that nation’s flag during performances during the song “Rhythm of My Heart.”\n",

Among the holes -- the mother of the 2 child actors accusing Busfield of sexual abuse allegedly said she would have Busfield's ass if her kids were fired, the father is a fraudster who was convicted in a federal trial and resigned in disgrace from his State Bar, the 2 kids both told cops Busfield did nothing inappropriate, Warner Brothers did an investigation with an outside law firm that concluded there was no evidence to corroborate the claims, witnesses say Busfield was never left alone with the kids on the set, and he passed a polygraph.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          They also point to the 180-degree swing from the first hearing, where the judge relied on prosecutors who argued Busfield should be held without bail because he was a danger to the community, to the second hearing, where the judge released Busfield without any bail at all.\n      \n    \n          Check out the \"2 Angry Men\" podcast ... the 2 dudes are legit angry!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Timothy Busfield\n              \n                          \n                Mark Geragos\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Podcasts\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

TMZ has confirmed.\n      \n    \n          The 4-year NFL veteran was arrested at the New York City airport Friday morning and booked on 2 counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and 1 count of criminal possession of a firearm.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He appeared in Queens County Criminal Court and has been released on his own recognizance ... no bail necessary.\n      \n    \n          Walker's attorney, Arthur L.

However, Aidala explains because he's only licensed to carry in Wisconsin, the Port Authority had to facilitate an arrest. Aidala adds he's confident the charges against his client will eventually be dropped.\n      \n    \n          According to the New York Post -- citing a criminal complaint -- a firearm and 36 rounds of ammo were found in the lockbox when it was searched. They were first to report the news.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The Packers selected Walker with one of the last picks of the 2022 NFL Draft ... but, he's gone from afterthought to mainstay on the GB offensive line in the last few years.\n      \n    \n          Walker's played in all 51 regular-season games over the last three years, as well as all 4 of the Packers' playoff games during that stretch. It's unclear if he will face any NFL discipline due to the arrest.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Weapons & Guns\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

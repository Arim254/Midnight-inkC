    "description": "\n\tVicente Canales’ Film Factory Entertainment has boarded international sales on Daniel Sánchez Arévalo’s “Caza mayor,” a Movistar Plus+ Original feat",
    "body": "\n\tVicente Canales’ Film Factory Entertainment has boarded international sales on Daniel Sánchez Arévalo’s “Caza mayor,” a Movistar Plus+ Original feature that has just begun shooting in Spain’s Extremadura region.\n\n\tA theatrical release is set for 2027 through Warner Bros. Pictures Spain.\n\n\tLed by Antonio de la Torre (“The Endless Trench,” “The Realm”) and co-starring Mariló Márquez Villa and Julián Villagrán (“Grupo 7,” “The Department of Time”), “Caza mayor” is positioned as a rural thriller with flashes of black comedy.\n\t\n\n\tPenned by María Ballesteros and José Antonio de Pascual, the script kicks off with a jolt: In the middle of the night, José Luis, an Extremadura pig herder played by De la Torre, comes home covered in blood, insisting he has seen a tiger. \n\n\n\tIs he telling the truth – or improvising an outlandish alibi to hide that he was stealing three Iberian pigs? \n\n\tFrom there, the story builds on the uncertainty, rocking the somnolence of a small town in the province of Badajoz, and forcing a community to choose between disbelief and the need to prove what can’t be seen.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Spain’s leading paybox Movistar Plus+, tax vehicle La película del Tigre A.I.E., Félix Tusell’s Estela Films, Carmela Martínez Oliart’s Tenampa Films; Cut One, part of Mediawan’s Boomerang TV, a recently launched outfit headed by Rafa Taboada; Arturo Valls’ Pólvora Films and Sánchez Arévalo’s company Tinnitus, with the participation of  Atresmedia and the collaboration of Atresmedia Cine. \n\t\n\n\tSánchez Arévalo has framed the film as a deliberate genre blend — thriller, drama, black comedy and Western — emphasizing that its resistance to easy labelling was central to the appeal. \n\n\tElsewhere, he signalled in a statement that the project’s resistance to pigeon-holing with regard to its tone is part of its design: “It’s difficult for me to find references. And I suppose that inability to categorize it is what attracted me most to the idea and what I pursue most,” he said.\n\n\tRooted in contemporary rural Spain, to protect that grounding, Sánchez Arévalo is surrounding de la Torre with non-professional actors drawn from the Extremadura town of Fregenal de la Sierra after an extensive local casting process. \n\n\tThe aim is a naturalistic feel and immersion in a distinctive Extremaduran accent, a register the filmmaker notes has been little exploited on screen.\n\n\tThe project adds a market-facing layer to Movistar Plus+’s film slate at a time when the platform continues to operate as a key driving force behind Spain’s film and TV production, using originals to scale local ambition and feed a production landscape that increasingly thinks in theatrical-plus-platform terms.\n\n\t“From the moment we read the first versions of the script for ‘Caza mayor,’ we were hooked by the project’s strength — a very personal blend of thriller and dark comedy, with emotional beats and a carousel of memorable characters,” said Guillermo Farré, Movistar Plus+ head of original films and Spanish cinema. \n\n\t“It’s a look at today’s rural world that we believe will really draw attention, and it fits perfectly with Movistar Plus+’s commitment to backing projects with a unique viewpoint — projects that surprise audiences and have the ambition to reach a wide public,” he added.\n\n\t“Caza mayor” adapts the fiction podcast “El Tigre,” written by Ballesteros and De Pascual, that won the 2025 Ondas Award for best fiction podcast.\n\n\tThe film’s start of production coincides with Sánchez Arévalo seeing box office traction from his latest release: the Bambú and StudioCanal-produced “Rondallas,” opened by Beta Fiction, has scored by Feb. 1 €1.77 million ($2.11 million) after five weeks at the Spanish box office, a performance that underlines Sánchez Arévalo’s standing as one of Spain’s foremost crossover filmmakers.\n\t\n\n\t“Caza mayor” is financed with support from Spain’s ICAA film institute and regional backing from the Junta de Extremadura and the Comunidad de Madrid.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCatherine O’Hara’s cause of death has been revealed to be a pulmonary embolism, with rectal cancer as an underlying condition, according to TMZ, which obtained her death certificate Monday.\n\n\tShe died on Friday, Jan. 30, at her Los Angeles home after being hospitalized early that morning with an illness. Paramedics had been called to her home at 4:48 a.m. that morning, according to Page Six. Her agency CAA said that O’Hara died after dealing with a “brief illness.”\n\t\n\n\tHer career spanned more than 50 years, beginning on the Canadian sketch show “Second City Television,” for which she won the first Emmy of her career for writing. She went on to star as Delia Deetz, the mother of Winona Ryder’s Lydia, in Tim Burton’s classic horror film “Beetlejuice” in 1988. She reprised the role in Burton’s 2024 sequel, “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.” O’Hara rose to fame by playing another famous mother, Kate McCallister, in two “Home Alone” movies opposite Macaulay Culkin. She and Culkin, who starred as her son Kevin, stayed close throughout her life, and she honored him at his Walk of Fame ceremony in 2023.\n\n\n\t“Mama. I thought we had time,” Culkin wrote on social media. “I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you but I had so much more to say. I love you. I’ll see you later.”\n\n\tO’Hara reunited with Burton on his animated movie “The Nightmare Before Christmas” by voicing Sally, a singing rag doll who falls for Jack Skellington, and in “Frankenweenie.” She had a late career resurgence thanks to “Schitt’s Creek,” in which she starred as the riches-to-rags housewife Moira Rose with Dan and Eugene Levy and Annie Murphy. She won an Emmy for the role in 2020 and received two other nominations. O’Hara also appeared in “The Last of Us” and “The Studio,” nabbing two Emmy nominations in 2025.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Hill” typically focuses on policy and politics in Washington. But last week, some of its editorial and business executives made a point of putting a spotlight on New York.\n\n\tIn a meeting held with ad agencies and potential sponsors,  Bill Sammon, a senior vice president of Washington content for The Hill and NewsNation; Cherie Grzech, president of news and politics at The Hill and NewsNation; and Adam VerCammen, senior vice president of revenue for The Hill, discussed coverage that is likely to come in the weeks ahead, when the 2026 midterm election cycle will grow more frenetic. They were joined by journalists including Chris Stirewalt, Amie Parnes, Blake Burman, and Sylvan Lane. Nexstar Media, the large TV station owner, operates both The Hill and the cable-news outlet NewsNation.\n\t\n\n\tThe goal was to remind New York agencies that work with so-called “advocacy” clients, or people who want to sway decision makers to support or reject a particular cause or issue, about “The Hill,” which VerCammen says is “non partisan and brand safe,” two attributes advertisers seek when aligning themselves with news properties. In years past, advocacy advertising has been supervised by people in Washington, says VerCammen, but more of the New York agency offices have been getting involved.\n\n\n\tExecutives emphasized the publication’s coverage of Congress and the White House, but also its focus on healthcare, finance and technology, says Sammon. They also pointed to an uptick in web traffic. “The Hill” notched 1.24 billion page views across 2025, according to data from ComScore, a rise of 7% compared to 2024.\n\t\n\n\t“We hope to keep it going,” says Sammon.\n\n\tOne way to do that will be an annual event that executives hope will draw more attention. A “Hill Nation Summit” is “our nerd Super Bowl,” says Sammon. “We bring Democrats and Republicans in the same venue adn ask them, ‘What is your plan to fix America?'” Some invitees break news that resonates far beyond the immediate meeting, he says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWriter and producer Eric Randall has signed with Paradigm for representation, Variety has learned exclusively. Randall continues to be repped by Rain and Jackoway Austen. \n\n\tRandall is perhaps best known for writing the 2025 film “A Nice Indian Boy,” which was based on the novel of the same name by Madhuri Shekar. \n\n\tThe film tells the story of a gay Indian man who falls in love with a white man who was adopted and raised by Indian parents. It starred Karan Soni, Jonathan Groff, Sunita Mani, Zarna Garg, and Harish Patel. It originally premiered at SXSW in 2024 before being released in theaters in 2025. The film received strong critical acclaim upon its release, holding a 95% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \n\t\n\n\tRandall is currently a co-executive producer on the hit CBS series “Elsbeth,” a spinoff of “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” starring Carrie Preston and hailing from celebrated creators Robert and Michelle King, who also created “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight.” It was one of 10 shows that CBS renewed back in January, bringing “Elsbeth” to its fourth season. \n\n\n\t He also wrote for the show “In the Dark” at The CW, which was produced by Ben Stiller’s Red Hour Films. Randall began his career as a writer on the popular Fox procedural “Bones,” for which he wrote the penultimate episode of the series as it wrapped up its 12-season run at the network back in 2017. Randall is additionally known for his 2021 Black List script, “American Girl.” \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” is now a part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood.\n\n\tThe new exhibit featuring costumes for Smoke and Stack (MIchael B. Jordan), Sammie (Miles Caton) and Annie (Wunmi Mosaku) are all on display. Set elements, props and prosthetics are also on display and will allow guests to step into the world of Clarkesville and Club Juke.\n\n\tCostume designer Ruth E. Carter previously spoke with Variety about her approach to her work. She focused on the Mississippi Delta and how “people turn their pain into joy. That rang so clear for me to depict.” Migration patterns were also taken into consideration in her work. “I started thinking about the plantation system and how blues [musicians] were rotated around to different plantations in the South.” Reds and blues were key to the film’s palette.\n\t\n\n\tThe exhibit opens the Studio Tour’s “Stage 48: Script to Screen” section, and runs through March 31. \n\n\n\tSuits worn by Jordan, which are on display, were made from wool. In the film, the twins return from Chicago in the early 1930s, which inspired Carter to turn to photos of Chicago gangsters from the era. “Wool was the constant fabric in suits.”\n\n\tAs for Sammie, for Carter, he represented the sharecropper, but he also represented hope. Carter explained, “His color palette was not in the red and blues of the rest of the cast; he was more organic and down to earth.” Sammie’s clothes showed wear and tear and were rooted in the brown and gold tones. “His clothes were a little bit more weathered,” she added. “His costume had a lot of character built into it. That was wonderful because it showed this boy whose guitar strap wore his vest down, and who wanted to look like Stack by getting a fedora.”\n\t\n\n\tAlso on display is the 1932 Dobro Cyclops resonator guitar which Sammie plays in the film, and composer Ludwig Göransson used to perfom the score on.\n\n\tTours run daily from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Ticket details can be found at http://www.wbstudiotour.com — including a special, limited-time discount for Southern California residents.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tModern gym culture and self-obsession is getting the horror treatment in the newly announced feature “Shredded.”\n\n\tThe picture, produced by Michael Bay‘s Platinum Dunes (“A Quiet Place, “The Purge”), is being written and directed by Josh Lawson, the actor/director who starred as Kano in “Mortal Kombat” and was Oscar nominated for the live-action short “The Eleven O’Clock.”\n\n\tProtagonist Pictures will be handling international sales with newly-announced Logical Pictures International co-repping alongside them and UTA will represent U.S. rights. Logical also provides full financing for the film.\n\t\n\n\t“Shredded” is described as offering an “unflinching look at the darker side of modern fitness culture and self-obsession,” and as a “propulsive thrill ride that pushes toxic gym culture to terrifying extremes.”\n\n\n\tThe film follows Eileen who, reeling from a breakup, enrols in an intense gym class run by a charismatic but deranged coach. When she quits the program, he abducts her and imprisons her in his sadistic training compound, forcing her — and other captives — through punishing, often lethal workouts. As the physical toll mounts, Eileen must outwit the coach’s vicious regimen and turn his obsession with control and perfection against him before it’s too late.\n\n\t“Josh has crafted a deeply personal story that brings the horror directly into the audience’s lives. He’s the kind of filmmaker Platinum Dunes is built around — a writer/director with a clear point of view and a sharp instinct for delivering a twisted, crowd-pleasing ride,” said Platinum Dune. “After Shredded, audiences won’t look at gym equipment — or those wall-length mirrors — the same way again. We’re beyond excited to support him in bringing it to life with Protagonist and Logical as partners.”\n\t\n\n\tMichael Bay, Brad Fuller and Alex Ginno produce for Platinum Dunes, and Jeff Golenberg for Strand Entertainment (“John Leguizamo’s Ghetto Klown,” “Katt Williams Presents: Katthouse Comedy”). Executive Producers include Frédéric Fiore, Ryan Wickers and Andrei Kamarowsky for Logical Pictures Group, alongside Dave Bishop, James Pugh and George Hamilton for Protagonist Pictures, and Troy Lum.\n\n\t“Platinum Dunes has an extraordinary track record of creating iconic horror, and we’re thrilled to be joining ‘Shredded’ and collaborating with our partners at Protagonist on this exciting new project” said Kamarowsky, head of international at Logical Pictures Group.\n\n\t“’Shredded’ is a high concept horror as brutal and unapologetically intense as the ultimate workout from hell,” added Protagonist CEO Bishop. “We’re thrilled to be partnering with Platinum Dunes on this bold and timely white-knuckle ride. Tapping directly into contemporary anxieties around control, self-obsession and self-improvement, ‘Shredded’ is set to put worldwide theatrical audiences through their paces.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Blue Film,” a sexually charged drama about a fetish camboy who spends the night with an anonymous client, has been acquired by Obscured Releasing. The film received strong reviews, but was considered to be so controversial that several major festivals, including Sundance and SXSW, passed on the opportunity to have it in their lineups. Eventually it had its world premiere at the 2025 Edinburgh International Film Festival and later debuted in North America at Newfest this past fall.\n\t\n\n\tObscured is a new distribution company launched by RJ Millard, a veteran indie publicist, and Bill Guentzler, a former acquisitions executive at Gravitas. “Blue Film” was written and directed by Elliot Tuttle. It will be released in theaters this May.\n\n\n\t“I’m thrilled to be partnering with Obscured Releasing on our theatrical rollout of ‘Blue Film.’ Their passion and commitment to a long life for our film made this an easy choice,” said Tuttle. “A lot of people were scared, but Obscured wasn’t.”\n\n\tKieron Moore (“Boots”) stars as Aaron Eagle, a camboy who discovers an older client (Reed Birney of “The Menu”) has a disturbing tie to his past. The film went on to play at OUTShine Film Festival, Philadelphia International Film Festival, Montclair Film Festival and more. “Blue Film” was produced by Bijan Kazerooni, Will Youmans, Adam Kersh and Waylon Sall, with Mark Duplass as consulting producer, and Birney and Eric Kohn as executive producers.\n\n\t“What Elliot accomplishes in telling the story of how two men’s sexuality and their connection shaped their futures is simultaneously humane and shocking,” said Millard and Guentzler in a statement. “He is asking questions no American filmmaker has dared to ask in decades and we’re thrilled to be launching ‘Blue Film’ in theaters.”\n\t\n\n\tThe deal was negotiated by Matt Burke of Submarine Entertainment on behalf of the filmmakers, and O’Brien Kelley of The Kelley Firm on behalf of Obscured Releasing.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“S.W.A.T. Exiles,” the upcoming 10-episode spinoff of “S.W.A.T.” led by star and exec producer Shemar Moore, is rounding out its cast roster. Added to the list of guest stars: Selma Blair (“Cruel Intentions”) and Jerry O’Connell (“Billions”). Plus, Lenora Crichlow (“Bel-Air”) has joined the show in a recurring role. \n\n\tAlso, another original “S.W.A.T.” member has signed on to stop by: David Lim, who played “Officer III Victor Tan” throughout the show’s eight seasons. Tan is set to join Moore and another “S.W.A.T.” alum, Jay Harrington (as “Sergeant David ‘Deacon’ Kay”), in the first season’s penultimate episode. Speaking of Harrington, he has also been confirmed to direct an episode.\n\t\n\n\tAs previously announced, Harrington and Patrick St. Esprit (who played “Commander Robert Hicks”) will show up in the premiere episode.\n\n\n\tBesides Moore, the new series stars Lucy Barrett (“Deep Water”), Adain Bradley (“Warfare”), Zyra Gorecki (“La Brea”), Freddy Miyares (“When They See Us”) and Ronen Rubinstein (“9-1-1: Lone Star”). Jason Ning is showrunner and executive producer; other EPs include Moore, Original Film’s Neal H. Moritz and Pavun Shetty, James Scura and Jon Cowan. Sony Pictures TV is the producer and global distributor of the new show.\n\n\t“S.W.A.T. Exiles” arose from the ashes of CBS’ “S.W.A.T.” last spring after the Eye network opted not to renew the show for a Season 9 — even though the network had previously canceled, then uncanceled, “S.W.A.T.” several previous times. But this time, with the show still an international hit, Sony Pictures TV decided to strike out on its own and pick up a 10-episode spinoff even before it had secured distribution, which it announced last year at L.A. Screenings.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the studio, “S.W.A.T.”  has reached “nearly 2 billion hours watched globally and has been a top 10 series in 47 countries including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Mexico, and Australia.” \n\n\tSony has not yet announced any distribution deals for “S.W.A.T. Exiles.” Currently, “S.W.A.T.” can be found on Netflix, Hulu, Pluto TV and Paramount+, as well as cablers Sundance TV and WEtv.Here’s the logline to the new show: “In this spin-off from Sony’s iconic ‘S.W.A.T.’ IP, which has spawned multiple series and films, after a high-profile mission goes sideways, Daniel ‘Hondo’ Harrelson (Moore) is pulled out of forced retirement to lead a last-chance experimental SWAT unit made up of untested, unpredictable young recruits. Hondo must bridge a generational divide, navigate clashing personalities, and turn a squad of outsiders into a team capable of protecting the city and saving the program that made him who he is. ‘S.W.A.T.” promises to deliver the same high-stakes drama and intense action sequences that fans have come to know and love. ​​\n\n\tBlair is repped by Berlandi Nussbaum & Reitzas and Oren Segal Representative. O’Connell is repped by CAA, 3 Arts Entertainment, and Ziffren Brittenham LLP. Crichlow is repped by CAA, BWH Agency and Authentic Talent and Literary Management. Lim is repped by Innovative Artists and Entertainment 360. Harrington is repped by UTA, A Management Company, and Brecheen Feldman Breimer Silver Thompson.\n",

    "body": "\n\tResearch the ratings history of “Wuthering Heights” via the Motion Picture Academy, and you’ll see a progression in how Emily Brontë’s novel has been treated on-screen, evolving from tame to tawdry. The 1970 movie starring Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff earned an all-audiences-friendly G rating. Twenty-two years later, when Ralph Fiennes stepped into the role, the 1992 adaptation was rated PG. The made-for-MTV 2003 version, featuring a young cast in a high school setting (clearly influenced by “Clueless”), landed a slightly edgier PG-13. And now comes Emerald Fennell’s carnal reinvention, which merits a full-blown R.\n\t\n\n\tLiterary purists may object, but Fennell seizes on something passionate in the material that was always there but never made explicit, amplifying what has gone largely unrequited all these years: the physical desire, of course, but also the mind games by which power shifts between Catherine Earnshaw (“Barbie” star Margot Robbie) and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi, fresh off “Frankenstein”). Evoking elements of bondage, the movie opens with the creaking of rope and what sounds like orgasmic gasping, and though Fennell plays a trick — the image doesn’t necessarily match what you imagine — she’s essentially planted an erotic suggestion from the start.\n\n\n\tOught this scene to be read as foreplay or foreboding? Why not both? If you studied “Wuthering Heights” back in high school, this is not the sort of film adaptation your 10th-grade teacher would have felt comfortable sharing in class. Fennell’s take is bold and engaging, which are qualities sure to inspire budding young readers, though the “Saltburn” director has her way with the iconic characters, as anyone might expect such a flashy director to do.\n\t\n\n\tTo situate it in terms of Emily Brontë’s sister Charlotte, Fennell’s approach feels more “Wide Sargasso Sea” than “Jane Eyre”: sophisticated fan fiction that revels in heaving bosoms, damp flesh and kinky sex (just not between Catherine and Heathcliff). There have been more than enough polite, repressive tellings of the classic Romantic novel, which centers on a young woman raised on the Yorkshire moors who betrays her heart — fearing ruin, she chooses the financial stability of a comfortable marriage over her wild-willed soulmate — and suffers for it in the long run.\n\n\tIn Fennell’s hands, the Earnshaw estate, which gives the work its title, looks like something Tim Burton might have dreamed up — an ominous black farmhouse set against a backdrop of jagged rocks, blasted by wind and storms — whereas Thrushcross Grange (where Catherine’s suitor, Edgar Linton, lives) could have been decorated by the “American Horror Story” crew, with its flesh-colored walls and blood-red floors. One’s a morgue, the other a bordello.\n\n\tTaking Heathcliff out of the equation for a moment, Catherine has no choice but to marry Linton (Shazad Latif, so decent as to appear dull), lest she wither and die in the home her crapulent father (Martin Clunes) has all but lost to gambling debts. Many years earlier, in a fit of “charity,” Mr. Earnshaw brought home a dirty, illiterate street urchin to serve as his daughter’s “pet.” ’Twas young Catherine (Charlotte Mellington) who named him Heathcliff (Owen Cooper).\n\n\tThe girl is clearly spoiled, but also fiercely independent, seeing that quality (plus unyielding loyalty) reflected in Heathcliff — to the point that she eventually admits, “He’s more myself than I am.” Too bad the only part of that confession Heathcliff overhears (while eavesdropping on a private exchange between Catherine and her housekeeper, Nelly, played by Hong Chau) is the part where she says, “It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now.”\n\n\tOf all the visual flourishes Fennell allows herself, Heathcliff’s departure is the most striking: She frames Elordi, bearded and betrayed, in silhouette against a deep crimson sky. He appears at once shattered and defiant, like Scarlett O’Hara just before intermission in “Gone With the Wind.” It’s ridiculously overripe, but exquisite, the sort of indulgence that sets some viewers vibrating and others rolling their eyes. It’s also the clearest clue yet to Fennell’s operatic interpretation of the material, which finds its musical equivalent in Anthony Willis’ score and a handful of tortured-love songs from Charli xcx (of which “Chains of Love” most closely nails the film’s sadomasochistic subtext).\n\t\n\n\tRatcheted up to such heights, “Wuthering” risks smothering those whom “Saltburn” struck as too much. And yet, this is what a generation of moviegoers thrilled by the stylistic excess of A24 and Neon movies want from the big-screen experience. As in the scene where Nelly tightens Catherine’s corset till it nearly snaps her ribs, the movie is meant to evoke extreme sensations. For nearly two centuries, Brontë’s book has been a romantic fantasy for readers. Fennell treats it as an erotic one as well, leaning into all that is sensual: a bed full of broken eggs, a stable tryst involving whips and bridles, Catherine pleasuring herself en plein air. The list goes on.\n\n\tFennell ditches the back half of the book (pretty much everything that happens after a key character’s death), while reading a great deal of unspoken desire between the lines. The ultimate bad boy of Victorian literature, Heathcliff comes across less devilish here than he does in Brontë’s book, though there’s a deliciously naughty streak to the way he seeks revenge on Catherine, asking consent from Linton’s sister Isabella (Alison Oliver) to use her for this very purpose. It’s fascinating to see Elordi play this monstrous brute so soon after embodying Frankenstein’s creation, and surprising that there’s less flesh on display here, but no fewer scars.\n\n\tHeathcliff needs no redeeming — his roguishness is half the appeal — and yet, Robbie’s emboldened Catherine assumes more responsibility for the couple’s unhappiness … and also more complicity in exploring what might have been. The trouble with letting these two to satisfy their lust is that it defuses the very dynamic that has gone so long unrequited.\n\n\tAfter “Saltburn,” which climaxed with one character scandalously making love to another’s grave, Fennell had to shock us somehow. Instead of repeating herself (or earlier adaptations), the director cuts short the pair’s pleasure. But not ours.\n",

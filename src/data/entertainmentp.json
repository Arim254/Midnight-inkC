    "body": "\n\tBefore Sunday’s Golden Globes ceremony, Hollywood will officially enter the “playoff” stage — or wildcard — stage of Oscar season. By Friday afternoon, the Directors Guild of America, Producers Guild of America, American Society of Cinematographers and BAFTA will roll out nominations and longlists that will dramatically narrow the field for more than two dozen films vying for Academy Awards attention (Variety’s SAG predictions for Wednesday are here)\n\t\n\n\tHistorically, this stretch becomes one of the highest-pressure tests for campaigns. With Oscar nomination voting starting on Monday, Jan. 12, it doesn’t leave a lot of room for pivots and campaign strategy changes. Momentum hardens, vulnerabilities are exposed and the gap between contenders and pretenders is out in the open.\n\n\n\tAt the DGA, the best director race is expected to align closely with the top contenders for best picture. The likeliest nominees include Paul Thomas Anderson (“One Battle After Another“), Ryan Coogler (“Sinners“) and Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”). Anderson and Coogler currently lead in director wins for the season.\n\n\tThe two remaining spots represent a competitive dash between beloved veteran Guillermo Del Toro (“Frankenstein“) and American mainstay Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”), alongside four internationally known and acclaimed figures: Joachim Trier (“Sentimental Value”), Jafar Panahi (“It Was Just an Accident”), Kleber Mendonça Filho (“The Secret Agent”) and Yorgos Lanthimos (“Bugonia”).\n\n\tThe DGA’s first-time feature category will be one to watch. The category honoring first-time narrative filmmakers puts Eva Victor (“Sorry, Baby”) and Harry Lighton (“Pillion”) at the forefront, with room for actors-turned-directors like Kristen Stewart (“The Chronology of Water”) and Embeth Davidtz (“Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight”) in the running.\n\t\n\n\tAt the PGA nominations, which drops on Friday, the guild is coming off overlapping eight of 10 with the Oscars’ best picture category last year, and the year prior achieving a historic 10-for-10 match. That feat isn’t expected to repeat this year given the landscape.\n\n\tThe predicted PGA lineup features Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” Coogler’s “Sinners” and Zhao’s “Hamnet” as likely locks, joined by Del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” Safdie’s “Marty Supreme” and Trier’s “Sentimental Value.” Also expected to contend are Clint Bentley’s indie drama “Train Dreams,” along with populist favorites such as Joseph Kosinski’s “F1” and Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked: For Good.” We could see James Cameron’s billion-dollar earner “Avatar: Fire and Ash” also pop up.\n\n\tThe ASC race will likely shake things up in the race for cinematography. Autumn Durald Arkapaw (“Sinners”) is likely to join a short list of four women who have been nominated by the guild: Rachel Morrison for “Mudbound” (2017), Ari Wegner for “The Power of the Dog” (2021) and the only winner, Mandy Walker, for “Elvis” (2022). Alice Brooks earned a nom for “Wicked” (2024) last year and is in the conversation again with the sequel, “Wicked: For Good,” which made the cinematography Oscar shortlist.\n\n\tAlso in contention are Adolpho Veloso (“Train Dreams”), Michael Bauman (“One Battle After Another”), Łukasz Żal (“Hamnet”) and Dan Laustsen (“Frankenstein”) along with former ASC nominees Claudio Miranda (“F1”), Darius Khondji (“Marty Supreme”) and Robbie Ryan (“Bugonia”).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t4238_D033_00469_R\nDirector of photography Lukasz Zal, director Chloé Zhao and actors Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal on the set of their film HAMNET, a Focus Features release.\nCredit: Agata Grzybowska / © 2025 FOCUS FEATURES LLC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgata Grzybowska\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd then there’s the BAFTA longlist.\n\n\tAlso announcing on Friday, the organization from across the pond are expected to highlight both American studio films and international cinema. Unlike nominations, which will be announced after Oscar nomination voting has closed, these longlists will mostly feature 10 titles in most categories and 15 in Outstanding British Film (all categories are listed alphabetically below).\n\n\tDel Toro’s “Frankenstein” is projected to lead the longlists with 12 mentions including best film and two acting mentions for its stars Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi. We’re expecting that Zhao’s “Hamnet” and Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” to follow closely with 10 apiece.\n\t\n\n\tThis will be a real test for the genre film “Sinners” as we’ve yet to see how international voters will take to the film, and given’s BAFTA history with failing to recognize Black talent (i.e., Denzel Washington has still never receive an acting nom from the group), we’re betting a lot that the group will shortlist, at minimum, Michael B. Jordan and Wunmi Mosaku. They are among the 10 projections for the film.\n\n\tThere are a few healthy tallies for other movies such as “Marty Supreme” (nine), “Bugonia” and “Sentimental Value” (eight), “Wicked: For Good” (seven) and “F1,” “Nuremberg,” “The Secret Agent” and “Train Dreams” with six each.\n\n\tIn the best film category, these 10 films are determined by all BAFTA voters using ranked voting, with points applied based on preference order. We’re expecting some of the usual suspects already mentioned but are looking out for the film or two that gets on the list as a “red herring” in the group (i.e., “All of Us Strangers” and “The Mauritanian” in previous years which all failed to garner a single Oscar nom).\n\n\tThe director longlist could feature up to 11 filmmakers under BAFTA’s gender parity intervention, which ensures equal representation of women and men directors. The Directing chapter votes for their top 10, with the system designed to balance the longlist. With non-binary multi-hyphenate Eva Victor heavily in the discussion, we’re likely to see the full 11 executed this year. Predictions include Anderson, Kathryn Bigelow (“A House of Dynamite”), Mary Bronstein (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Coogler, Del Toro, Kaouther Ben Hania (“The Voice of Hind Rajab”), Panahi, Lynne Ramsay (“Die My Love”), Trier, Victor and Zhao.\n\n\tIn the performance categories, BAFTA’s unique longlisting process has the Acting chapter vote determine the first seven places, while a jury selects the final three from those ranked eight through 13 in the chapter vote. When published, no distinction is made between chapter-selected and jury-selected performances.\n\n\tOne important eligibility reminder as BAFTA longlists are unveiled: despite its strong visibility in the animated feature conversation, Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters” is ineligible for BAFTA consideration. \n\n\tBy the end of the week, the awards-season map will look far less abstract. The next few days will determine whether they are still in the race — or should pack it up.\n\t\n\n\tThe full list of predictions are below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(L to r) DELROY LINDO, MICHAEL B.

    "body": "\n\tDreamWorks Animation (DWA) remote workers across the United States, feature production workers at Netflix Animation Studios and production workers on the show “Ted” have officially voted to unionize with the Animation Guild (IATSE Local 839) and the Editors Guild (IATSE Local 700), in an effort to ensure fair pay and treatment for all animation workers.\n\n\tThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ballot count for DWA remote workers resulted in a majority “yes” vote in favor of union representation with the Animation Guild. DreamWorks Animation studio will formally recognize the remote bargaining unit under TAG and begin the process of negotiating a contract.\n\t\n\n\tThe newly-recognized unit represents remote workers living throughout the U.S. who contribute to LA–based DWA animation projects across both feature and television. These workers perform work already covered under TAG’s Master Agreement when done onsite on campus in LA County, and include roles such as story artists, animators, character effects artists, technical directors, lighters, visual development artists, modelers and production coordinators, among others.\n\n\n\tRemote workers organized to address longstanding inequities between remote and on-campusemployees. Union recognition establishes a path forward for collective bargaining aimed at securingequal treatment and sustainable working conditions for remote employees.\n\n\tTAG’s business representative, Steve Kaplan, said, “These units overwhelmingly voted in favor ofTAG representation after facing the degrading process of being forced into an NLRB election and theunnecessary delay of the government shutdown.” He added, “We are continuing to expand our jurisdiction both inside and outside the scope of our Master Agreement as we continue to look forward toprotecting the rights of all animation workers regardless of zip code.”\n\t\n\n\tAnthony Holden, a remote story artist and organizing committee member based in Washington State, said: “I’ve valued the opportunity to help unite our voices in seeking equality with our on-campus counterparts in terms of workers’ rights, fair pay, access to healthcare and retirement benefits, among other issues. We look forward to negotiating with the company to secure a fair agreement that will foster a workplace environment which is equitable to remote employees and will contribute to DreamWorks’ commercial and artistic success.”\n\n\tFeature production workers at Netflix Animation Studios and production workers on the “Ted” show are also celebrating their own NLRB victories to unionize with TAG and the Editors Guild. The elections took place on Dec. 23rd and Dec. 30th, respectively.\n\n\t“During my five years at NAS, my amazing production colleagues have shown up each day with diligence, passion and a breadth of skills and experience, both creative and strategic,” said production coordinator Erin Sullivan. “As a part of TAG, I’m excited for the opportunity we now have to represent ourselves as a unit, and I’m encouraged by the other production management teams in our industry who have set the bar.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBéla Fleck is the latest to join the growing list of artists who have withdrawn from performing at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in the wake of Donald Trump adding his name to the venue.\n\n\tThe banjo player was set to perform with the National Symphony Orchestra on February 19, 21 and 22 for the world premiere of “American Mosaic,” described on the Center’s website as “a true celebration of American music.” But Fleck took to social media on Tuesday to explain that the political implications of appearing at the venue have taken precedence over the music itself.\n\t\n\n\t“I have withdrawn from my upcoming performance with the NSO at The Kennedy Center,” wrote Fleck. “Performing there has become charged and political, at an institution where the focus should be on the music. I look forward to playing with the NSO another time in the future when we can together share and celebrate art.”\n\n\n\n\tThe Center updated the listing for the concerts with a note acknowledging Fleck’s decision not to perform. “Due to personal issues Béla Fleck regrettably has to withdraw from his performances with the National Symphony Orchestra,” reads the note, which adds that “American Mosaic” will now feature NSO Principal Clarinet Ling Ma performing Aaron Copland’s Clarinet Concerto.\n\n\tFleck is one of many artists who have recently canceled their appearance at the Center, including some who withdrew after Trump’s name was added alongside John F. Kennedy’s at the venue. Last week, songwriter Stephen Schwartz said he would not take part in a program spotlighting him at the Center, stating, “It no longer represents the apolitical place for free artistic expression it was founded to be” and that “there’s no way I would set foot in it now.” At the end of 2025, two more acts — veteran jazz septet the Cookers and dance troupe Dog Varone and Dancers — canceled their performances.\n",

    "body": "\n\tElle Fanning recently spoke to W Magazine for the publication’s Great Performances issue and remembered her infamous fainting incident at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where the actor was in attendance as a member of the competition jury. Fanning collapsed while seated at the Chopard Trophee dinner and said Colin Firth immediately came to her aid.\n\n\t“Yes, my dress was too tight,” Fanning said. “My sister was sitting at another table, and she saw my chair just completely fall back. It’s kind of hilarious—very dramatic. Colin Firth was there, and he rushed to my side. It was the talk of the festival. But I’m known to faint. In school, I would faint a lot. I grew, like, seven inches in one year, and I guess my body was growing so much that I got altitude sickness.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety was on the scene in 2019 when Fanning fainted. Festival director Thierry Fremaux had just introduced actor Francois Civil onstage when Fanning collapsed and fell off her chair while seated at a dinner table. She was seated at a table next to her sister Dakota Fanning, who helped the actress to her feet before security whisked them away. Fanning later posted about the incident on her Instagram, saying she was “all good” and that her dress was simply “too tight.”\n\n\tFanning served on the Cannes competition jury in 2019 alongside directors such as Yorgos Lanthimos, Kelly Reichardt, Paweł Pawlikowski and Alice Rohrwacher, among others. “Birdman” and “The Revenant” director Alejandro González Iñárritu served as jury president. The group made history by awarding the Palme d’Or to Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” which became the first South Korean film to take Cannes’ top prize. “Parasite” went on to win the Oscar for best picture. Other notable Cannes winners included Antonio Banderas, who won best actor for “Pain and Glory.”\n\t\n\n\tCannes has screened several Fanning-starring films over the years. Just last year, Fanning was in attendance with Joachim Trier’s Grand Prix-winning “Sentimental Value.” She also starred in Sofia Coppola’s “The Beguiled,” which won best director honors at the 2017 festival. Coppola was the second woman to win best director in Cannes’ history. Fanning was also the star of Nicolas Winding Refn’s “The Neon Demon,” which was one of the most divisive entries at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and prompted both cheers and walkouts during its premiere.\n\n\tFanning has been on the awards circuit this season with “Sentimental Value,” which immediately launched to Oscar buzz in Cannes. The film is Norway’s submission for the international feature Oscar. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSpeaking to an audience of her fellow SAG-AFTRA actors, Hannah Einbinder admitted it was “spooky” to watch Stephen Colbert’s cancellation mirror a plot line from her hit series “Hacks.” Einbinder made her national television debut doing a stand-up set in March 2020 on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and has returned as a guest over the years.Einbinder, who recently won an Emmy Award for supporting actress in a comedy series, discussed how the fourth season was a love letter to late-night television, with Jean Smart’s Deborah Vance finally launching her own show. But the joy is short-lived as Deborah and her head writer Ava (Einbinder) soon find themselves compromising their integrity in different ways due to the network’s demands. Things come to a head in the May 22 episode “A Slippery Slope,” when Deborah is ordered to fire Ava. Rather than comply, Deborah shocks everyone by telling the audience the truth and loses her show.Two months later, it was announced that CBS would not be renewing “The Late Show,” with speculation widespread that the choice was due to the host’s outspoken criticism of President Donald Trump. Two months later, fellow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s show was abruptly suspended after he addressed the shooting of Charlie Kirk in his monologue. FCC chair Brendan Carr had threatened to pull ABC affiliate broadcast licenses and soon station groups Nexstar and Sinclair announced they would not air the show. Kimmel returned to the air days later, due in part to a massive public outcry.\n\n\n\tThe “Hacks” scenes were filmed at least a half year prior to the Colbert announcement, and Einbinder does say it was strange to see it unfold. “I think it was like, holy shit, this is really crazy and also spooky that it was specifically late night and specifically that type of censorship,” she noted. “It’s so bizarre.”However, she added, in some ways, it was not unexpected. “Kind of observing the way that things have been going for quite some time, I didn’t find what happened to Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel to be a shock at all because of all the censorship that we’ve seen. Academics, journalists, students, have been fired or expelled, or, in some cases locked up for expressing their speech. So, watching that transpire in was in no way a surprise to me, unfortunately.”\n\t\n\n\tEinbinder went on to praise show creators Paul W. Downs, Lucia Aniello and Jen Statsky for how the story was addressed and worked into the show organically. “I’m really proud of Paul, Lucia and Jen for handling that issue and for speaking on that and for doing it in a way that is beautiful and also earned within the narrative,” she revealed. “It’s not like forcing anything down anybody’s throat. It’s really justified and grounded in reality, as we know.”\n\n\tEinbinder also hinted that in the upcoming season they are “similarly facing certain issues of the day, and it just makes me really proud.”\n\t\n\n\tEinbinder also discussed how “Hacks” was her first acting job after started her career as a stand-up. She reiterated her love for the medium, but did admit there were some bumpy times. “I’ve felt pain, I have done it all,” she said. “I have been booed at a fucking saloon in rural Washington during a goddamn pool tournament. I’ve been at a goddamn motherfucking Holiday Inn Express in Laramie, Wyo., on Valentine’s Day, just fucking looking at the cottage cheese ceiling being like, ‘I should go back to my barista job. This is a mistake.’”\n\n\tBut when told stand-up comedy takes bravery, she responded, “I don’t know if it’s brave. I think it is a desperate act for desperate people — but I love it. I love the art form. It is so awesome and so pure and there. There’s nothing like being in a room with people and like sharing that.”\n\n\tWatch Einbinder’s SAG-AFTRA Foundation Conversation below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSadie Sink appeared on “The Tonight Show” several days after the “Stranger Things” finale dropped and shared with host Jimmy Fallon her belief that the Netflix show ended with Millie Bobby Brown’s Eleven dead and gone. The show left Eleven’s fate purposefully ambiguous.\n\n\t“What do I think? I think she’s dead,” Sink said. “Is that a hot take or something? Mike’s story is just one last story, and then they say goodbye to childhood. That’s one final tale, and that’s it. It’s just a coping thing. It’s stronger [that way], right?”\n\t\n\n\tDuring one of the finale’s most climactic moments, Eleven sacrifices herself as the Upside Down is being destroyed in order to thwart the military’s continued efforts to weaponize her by using her blood to create new super-powered infants (and thus risk giving rise to a new Henry Creel/Vecna). However, Finn Wolfhard’s Mike has a different take on what happened. In the final moments of the finale, Mike tells his friends a story in which Eleven survived as footage plays of the character seeking refuge in a remote part of the world.\n\n\n\tGaten Matarazzo, who starred on “Stranger Things” as Dustin, told Variety that he has his own interpretation of Eleven’s fate that he does not intend to share publicly.\n\n\t“I want to keep that private,” he said. “I don’t know if others will [say], but I think that whatever works for you and makes the show wrap up better for you is correct. You have the right to debate it, but whatever you want it to be for you is great. I think they teeter that line very well, because I’ve already noticed a kind of 50/50 split amongst fans about whether they believe.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, Matarazzo did have this to say about Eleven’s ending: “What’s so tragic about the end of Eleven’s story is normalcy would never be guaranteed for the people that she loves if she was there. She didn’t see it as fair, and I think it was a beautiful choice to end her story the way that they did.”\n\n\t“Stranger Things” co-creator previously told Variety there was no version of the show’s ending where “Eleven was never going to be there” with her friends at the end.\n\n\t“It was very early on in the writing process of this season that we figured out exactly how to tell that story and landed on the ‘I believe’ moment,'” referring to one of the show’s final moments where the main characters choose to believe Mike’s story about Eleven’s survival. “Once we landed on ‘I believe,’ then that sort of cracked it wide open. That was in those first few weeks of the writers’ room, because we started at the end, at that basement scene, and wanted to make sure that we got it to a place where we felt was the right ending for the show. And then we built the season to that moment.”\n\n\tWatch Sink’s full interview on “The Tonight Show” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe red carpet for the 83rd Golden Globe Awards will be down one high(-flying) fashion star as “Wicked” lead Cynthia Erivo will miss the ceremony due to her upcoming production of “Dracula” on the West End.\n\n\tErivo, already a Tony winner for “The Color Purple,” stars in the highly anticipated one-woman stage adaptation of the Gothic horror story, playing 23 characters, including Dracula. The play, from adaptor and director Kip Williams, goes into previews on February 4. With the team currently deep into production in London, producers are unable to free her to attend the ceremony in Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Wicked: For Good,” Erivo delivers a soaring performance as the green-skinned young witch, garnering a fifth Golden Globe nomination. She was previously recognized for “Harriet,” a double nominee for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman and for best original song; “Genius: Aretha,” where she portrayed Aretha Franklin; and the first “Wicked” film. With the nod, Erivo also made history as the first Black woman nominated twice in the lead actress (comedy or musical) category. \n\n\n\t“I hope there are many more to come, not just for me, but for other Black women. I hope it’s just the beginning,” Erivo told Variety on the morning nominations were announced in December. (She dialed in from London, where she’d begun rehearsals for “Dracula.”) “What a wonderful thing to do that and be a part of changing history a little bit and hopefully open up doors for someone else too.”\n\n\tRounding out her category are Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”), Amanda Seyfried (“The Testament of Ann Lee”) and Emma Stone (“Bugonia”).\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is in the running for five prizes at Sunday’s Golden Globes, including cinematic and box office achievement (the film has grossed over $500 million worldwide), best actress in a musical or comedy (Erivo), best supporting actress (Ariana Grande), plus two nominations in the best original song category (Stephen Schwartz). The “Wicked” awards train continues to roll along as the new movie follows in the path of the first film, which received 10 Oscar nominations for the 97th Academy Awards, and Grande and Erivo (who is just an Oscar shy of the coveted EGOT) continue to rake in nominations. \n\n\tVariety parent company PMC owns Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Hamnet” and “The Testament of Ann Lee” screened during this year’s Palm Springs International Film Festival, and following each of the films, directors Chloé Zhao and Mona Fastvold, as well as “Ann Lee” star Amanda Seyfried, discussed the feminine energy that fueled their work on-screen and behind the scenes.\n\n\tOnstage, Zhao confirmed rumors that when she first received the call from producer Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment to adapt Maggie O’Farrell’s emotional novel about William and Agnes Shakespeare, she initially replied, “I’m not sure.”\n\t\n\n\tZhao partially credits her reticence to the hectic nature of the call, which came through during her spottily serviced drive to the Telluride Film Festival a few years ago. Once she arrived at the festival, though, she was asked to meet with actor Paul Mescal. It was a moment of kismet.\n\n\t“Just looking at him, I saw a young Shakespeare. He had an earring,” Zhao told Variety’s Angelique Jackson, who moderated both conversations. “I just said to him, ‘Have you ever thought about playing young William Shakespeare?’ and he said, ‘Well, if you’re talking about “Hamnet…” Because I love the book. You have to read the book. It is perfect for you. It’s not what you think it is.’”\n\n\tZhao took Mescal’s advice and read O’Farrell’s 2020 novel, which tells a mostly fictional story about how the death of William and Agnes’ son Hamnet inspired the Bard to write “Hamlet.” When Zhao read it, she immediately thought of Jesse Buckley for Agnes. “All I saw was Jesse,” the filmmaker recalled. “It was very tunnel vision.”\n\t\n\n\tCasting Buckley proved fruitful not just for her committed performance but for her contributions to the production as a whole. Zhao explained that the actress helped her and O’Farrell rewrite the ending. While the novel ends with the emphatic line “Remember me,” and the initial script concluded with Hamlet dying on stage during the play’s debut performance at the Globe Theatre, the film added an emotional final scene of Agnes and the Globe’s crowd reaching out towards the actor in a moment of collective grief and empathy.\n\n\t“Jesse sent me Max Richter’s ‘This Bitter Earth,’ which is a lyrics version of ‘On the Nature of Daylight,’” Zhao recalled. “I was listening to the song in the car, and I started to cry. I felt tightness in my heart, but also opening. And then I started reaching out to the window. I was trying to touch the rain outside.” Zhao was going through a personal loss at the time, she explained. “But this gesture, I realized, I was trying to reach for something bigger that I could be a part of, so that I would have the strength to let go. And then I realized that’s what Hamlet needed.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Hamnet” filmmaker Chloé Zhao poses with Kering Americas president Ewa Abrams at the 37th annual Palm Springs International Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVivien Killilea/Getty Images for Palm Springs International Film Society\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThat collaborative spirit and emotional intuition are indicative of why Amblin wanted Zhao to direct “Hamnet” in the first place. Zhao jokes that empathy has always been a part of her nature, and that she can now prove to her parents that the “oversensitive child had a purpose.”\n\n\tMore sincerely, though, she said, “Sometimes we’re made to be ashamed of the part of ourselves that seeks connection and relatedness and love as if it’s less important, not productive or weak, but that is the life force. That is the force that binds. That is the creative energy that crosses everything together, that sustains and fosters growth and enhances everything in life. So as vulnerable as it feels, I would try to create from that place and seek that connection.”\n\n\tMona Fastvold is no stranger to leading from a feminine lens, either. As a director, her filmography consists of “The Sleepwalker,” “The World to Come” and now, “The Testament of Ann Lee” — all of which focus on powerful female characters. Only recently, however, has she come to embrace the label of a “female director.”\n\t\n\n\tShe associates some of that empathetic approach to “female leadership,” which she suggests, “doesn’t just mean women. It means the feminine consciousness in all people is drawing strength from interdependence, not dominance. It’s drawing strengths from intuition, relationships, community and interdependence.” \n\n\tRegarding being just one of nine women out of 111 directors who helmed 2025’s 100 top-grossing films, Zhao says the data indicates that a more feminine approach “doesn’t fit into the current model that we exist in, the container we exist in. It’s difficult to come through, and I feel very lucky that I had people in power that trusted that this way of leading is needed for this story.”\n\n\t“I used to resent being called that, and now I love it,” Fastvold told Variety, seated next to the film’s star, Amanda Seyfried. “I will take it. I will be a ‘female director,’ and tell feminist stories about women. I’m very proud of it.”\n\n\tSeyfried plays the titular heroine, a real-world figure who lived in the 18th century and founded the Shakers, a religious movement that championed gender equality and communal living, and whose followers expressed faith through dance. As chronicled through the film, Lee’s followers began to see her as a female messiah while others marked her for persecution. \n\n\t“The Shakers worship through ecstatic song and dance,” Fastvold explained. “There was something about this idea of expressing faith through movement and song in such a free and intense and guttural way that was very exciting to me and scary.”\n\n\tAccordingly, the film is a historical musical. Fastvold initially expressed trepidation towards directing her first musical, but saw the genre as unavoidable given the subject matter. \n\n\t“Making a musical is scary, even though it’s a different kind of musical,” the director reflected. “I’d never made a musical before. My background is in dance, but I knew that I had to approach it in a different way and that I couldn’t really look to other projects as inspiration for this. So it was kind of terrifying. But the short answer is it had to be a musical because that’s how they worshipped. They kind of lived their life in that way.”\n\n\tThe director cast Seyfried partially because of her singing and dancing capabilities, as showcased in her roles in “Mamma Mia” and “Les Misérables.” Even so, embodying Lee and choreographing her intense movements proved to be demanding for the seasoned actress. \n\t\n\n\t“As challenging as it was for me to memorize those moves, once I got there, I felt closer to Ann Lee and once we were all moving in unison, it just takes you to another place,” Seyfried said. “You just had to feel like it was part of you. It was an extension of your body, and then it becomes real for that moment in time.”\n\n\tPart of the challenge came from the fact that the Shakers’ choreographies are buried in history. Seyfried worked with choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall to create and execute dances that were “based on these paintings and drawings and descriptions” of events that took place over two centuries ago.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Testament of Ann Lee” star Amanda Seyfried and director Mona Fastvold in conversation with Variety’s Angelique Jackson at the 37th annual Palm Springs International Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPresley Ann/Getty Images for Palm Springs International Film Society\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSeyfried credits the artisans and practitioners across all departments for their thorough research in recreating Lee’s story and the Shaker movement, and she expresses profound esteem for Fastvold, whom the production affectionately referred to as “Mother Mona” on set.\n\n\t“She is very nurturing,” Seyfried said of Fastvold. “Her job as the director is mothering. The leadership comes from this beautiful, nurturing, female, empowered artist. The nurturing quality of her really impacts how we felt on set and I think it went a long way.”\n\n\tSimilarly, Fastvold shared how the opportunity to tell a story about a woman whose historical impact had been unsung fueled her sense of purpose while making the film. \n\n\t“There are so many wonderful, exciting, important female historical figures that are overlooked,” she said. “I feel very lucky that I found Ann Lee.”\n",

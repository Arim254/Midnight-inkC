    "body": "\n\tJapan’s anime industry reached an all-time high in 2024, climbing to JPY3.84 trillion ($25.25 billion) in total market value, according to data presented by the Association of Japanese Animations (AJA) at TIFFCOM, the market arm of the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe session, which also featured presentations by “Godzilla” studio Toho Global on its international strategy, the “Gundam” franchise, and Annecy-winning feature “ChaO” — which is also screening at the Tokyo festival — underscored how anime continues to drive Japan’s expanding global content economy.\n\t\n\n\tOverseas revenues surged 26% year-on-year to JPY2.17 trillion ($14.27 billion), while local earnings rose 2.8% to JPY1.67 trillion ($10.98 billion). This marks the second-highest annual growth rate on record after 2019’s 15.3% increase.\n\n\n\tAJA chair Kazuko Ishikawa, who is also president of Nippon Animation, said anime has become a core pillar of Japan’s cultural and economic exports. She added that the association aims to further improve industry conditions so that creators and studios can continue producing high-quality works that resonate with audiences worldwide.\n\n\tThe upcoming Anime Industry Report 2025, set for publication in December, divides the market into two key sectors: the broad “anime industry market,” which estimates total consumer spending across anime-related goods and licensing, and the narrower “anime production market,” which tracks studio revenues.\n\n\tThe production-side market also set a record in 2024, rising 9.1% year-on-year to JPY466.2 billion ($3.06 billion). Overseas business contributed JPY118.8 billion ($781 million) — still a smaller share overall, but growing steadily year by year.\n\t\n\n\t“The overseas market now far exceeds local revenues, and the gap will only widen,” said Masahiko Hasegawa, editor-in-chief of the AJA report. “Growth today includes bundled contracts that span theatrical, streaming, merchandising, and event rights — not just content distribution.”\n\n\tAJA data indicates that overseas anime revenues overtook domestic earnings in 2023 for the first time since the pandemic, and that the gap widened dramatically in 2024. The International Otaku Events Association now lists 136 anime-related events in 51 countries and regions, reinforcing the genre’s global momentum.\n\n\tJapan’s government continues to position anime and related media — including film, games, manga, and music — as a strategic core industry. Under its revised Cool Japan initiative, the national goal is to triple overseas content sales to JPY20 trillion ($131.4 billion) by 2033, from approximately JPY5.8 trillion ($38 billion) in 2024.\n\n\tAJA forecasts that future growth will not only come from distribution and theatrical revenues but from exporting Japan’s entire anime ecosystem, including merchandise tie-ins, retail campaigns, and cross-media collaborations.\n\n\t“Anime is no longer just storytelling,” said Hasegawa. “It’s a full cultural economy — and that economy is rapidly going global.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBased on the popular book series by Andrzej Sapkowski and adapted for television by Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, “The Witcher” has returned to Netflix for its fourth and penultimate season. This time, Liam Hemsworth is stepping into Henry Cavill’s shoes to portray the silver-haired monster-slaying witcher, Geralt of Rivia — Cavill left the series in 2022 after Season 3, an announcement that was made simultaneous to Hemsworth taking over the role.. In a much sharper and less convoluted season than the previous one, “The Witcher” Season 4 is action-packed and full of dazzling characters both old and new. It acts as a reset, ironing out the confusing conflicts and plot points that have long plagued the series. \n\t\n\n\t“The Witcher” Season 4 opens with an old man reading the story of The Butcher of Blaviken. A century in the future of the show’s chronology, the man tells a group of eager young children about the legend of Geralt of Rivia. This opening sequence recaps the events of the first three seasons and grounds the audience in the epic’s current timeline. Separated from his lover, Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) and his adoptive daughter, Ciri (Freya Allan), Geralt has been severely injured by the evil mage Vilgefortz (Mahesh Jadu). Still struggling to walk on his battered knee, he, along with his best friend, Jaskier the bard (Joey Batey) and the legendary archer Milva (Meng’er Zhang), are embarking on their quest to find Ciri before Vilgefortz or Emhyr (Bart Edwards), the emperor of Nilfgaard, gets a hold of her. During this adventure, Geralt eventually becomes allies with a crew that “Witcher” book lovers will recognize as the Hanza. On the opposite side of the war-torn Continent, Yennefer has begun recruiting her fellow mages, including Philippa (Cassie Claire), Francesca (Mecia Simson), and Fringilla (Mimî M. Khayisa), to Aretuza in an effort to begin crafting plans to try and take down the increasingly powerful Vilgefortz. \n\t\n\n\tFor her part, Ciri, now in her twenties, is exhausted by her legacy. Her powerful Elder blood and Nilfgaard lineage have made her a coveted commodity for some of the most powerful people on the Continent. As a result, she has shed her identity and powers. She has found refuge among a ragtag band of thieves — the Rats — under the new identity, Falka. As young people tend to do, viewers see Ciri trying to define herself outside her parents’ shadows. Still, she struggles to understand and adhere to the Rats’ precarious moral code. Without Geralt and Yennefer’s direct guidance, Ciri tries to define her future for herself. Yet, what she comes to understand is that no matter how far she tries to run from her past, destiny has a way of catching up to her. \n\n\tMost fans of the show have likely been bracing themselves to see how Hemsworth takes on a character Cavill has long mastered. Although the voice isn’t quite the same, as the episodes move forward and given the season’s straightforward structure, which zeros in on Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri separately, the transition is mostly seamless. Moreover, as the stoic monster hunter has become increasingly attuned to his own emotions, the distinct difference between the two actors makes even more sense, given Geralt’s slightly more emotive nature in the story’s current timeframe. \n\n\tIn addition, the gorgeously shot action sequences, full of magic, sword-wielding, beheadings and, of course, an array of monsters, are complemented by several new characters who also make their distinct mark on this robust, fully rendered universe. Over the eight-episode season, fans are introduced to Regis (Laurence Fishburne), a mysterious herbalist who aids Geralt and his gang during a desperate time of need. Additionally, there is Zoltan (Danny Woodburn), the fan-favorite dwarf with some rather thrilling skills, and several others to round out the already expansive cast. \n\n\tOverall, even as a brand-new lead takes the charge, “The Witcher” Season 4 has mostly reclaimed its magic. Though Episode 5, “The Joy of Cooking,” acts as a filler chapter rather than an actual narrative, the rest of the season is well-paced, tonally on point and offers ample screen time to the leading trio, interweaving the immense fable in a way that is accessible and interesting instead of overstuffed and exhausting. Though Season 4 is not the final chapter of “The Witcher,” it’s an essential building block for what is to be a fifth and final swing at this extravagantly told medieval tale. “The Witcher” is coming to a close, but in many ways, this feels like the beginning.\n\t\n\n\t“The Witcher” Season 4 is now available to stream on Netflix. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTetsu Fujimura’s keynote talk The Future of Japanese Intellectual Property in Global Adaptations offered TIFFCOM attendees a convincing argument that Japanese IP is quickly becoming one of the country’s core industries, rivalling even its mighty car manufacturers.\n\n\tTIFFCOM is the market arm of the Tokyo International Film Festival. \n\n\tThe founder and CEO of consulting firm Filosophia, as well as the founder of major distributor Gaga Corporation, Fujimura began the talk with a brisk run through of his rise to a leading producer of Japan-generated content for a world audience, including the hit Netflix live-action “One Piece” series.\n\t\n\n\tKey to his success, he explained, were connections with top-tier Hollywood producers, beginning with Marvel Studio founder Avi Arad, with whom he produced the 2017 live-action sci-fi “Ghost in the Shell,” and TV producer Marty Adelstein, who became his partner in making “One Piece.”\n\n\n\tBut his individual achievements, as he illustrated with a blizzard of meticulously researched facts and figures, form only one wave of growing tsunami of Japanese IP, from manga and anime to movies and games, that is advancing into the global marketplace.\n\n\tThis tsunami has been a long time in building, from the 1990s when only about 10 or 20% of the top 30 films at the global box office were based on existing IP, to approaching 90 percent in the current decade.\n\n\tOf the top 20 titles in the most current IP revenue rankings, compiled in 2021, ten are Japanese, including ‘Pokemon,’ ‘Hello Kitty,’ ‘Anpanman,’ ‘Super Mario,’ ‘Shonen Jump,’ ‘Gundam,’ ‘Dragon Ball,’ ‘Fist of the North Star,’ ‘One Piece’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!.’ “In these kinds of global rankings, Japanese works inevitably appear in large numbers,” Fujimura commented. “So I think you understand that Japan occupies a significant presence in the world in many ways.”\n\t\n\n\tWhat makes Japanese IP so strong? Fujimura listed three reasons: Japan’s massive appetite for manga and anime, fueled by major publishers, TV broadcasters and animation studio; the global distribution of anime, with Netflix and Amazon leading the way; and Japan’s rank as one of the world’s leading gaming powers, with Sony (“Uncharted,” “Gran Turismo”) and Nintendo (“Sonic the Hedgehog,” “Super Mario”) not only leading the pack but generating hit films from their games.\n\n\t“Among game originals adapted into Hollywood live-action films Japanese IPs are currently the most numerous,” Fujimura said. “I believe they will attract even more attention going forward.”\n\n\tOne example is the 2023 “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” which grossed $1.361 billion worldwide making it the fifth highest earning animation of all time. “Disney has produced countless animated films, and this outranks all of them but ‘Frozen 2,’” Fujimura said. “What it’s achieved is incredible and really shows just how powerful Japanese animation is.”\n\n\tHis conclusion: “Japan’s representative IP genres – manga, anime, and games – possess extremely high growth potential that I believe will continue to be a source of pride. It’s a testament to Japan’s strength, proving that Japanese IPs can succeed in Hollywood.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKate Hudson, Sydney Sweeney, Wanda Sykes, Nicole Scherzinger and Jamie Lee Curtis were at the center of the star-studded Variety Power of Women presented by Lifetime event in Los Angeles Wednesday night.\n\n\tHosted by Iliza Shlesinger at the Beverly Hills Hotel, the event centered on the accomplishments of Variety‘s five honorees, among many other women throughout media and entertainment over the past year. But more often than not, those women turned the spotlight towards other industries. That was the case when Curtis took the stage to talk about the cause she was supporting, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and the threat that ICE raids pose to the hospital’s patients.\n\t\n\n\t“The team at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. The power of women is in every single woman who works at that hospital,” Curtis said. “Every nurse, every child-life specialist, every doctor, every mother of every patient who shows up to try to help these children — that’s the power of women. We see it every day. Children’s Hospital Los Angeles is in desperate need right now. The cuts that have been made are awful, and because of the situation in the government, so much of their funding has been lost. People are afraid to go to the hospital because they’re afraid they’re going to be picked up by ICE agents, so they won’t go that hospital.”\n\n\tPrior to Curtis’ speech, which was the night’s big closer, Variety Power of Women opened with some zingers from Shlesinger, followed by remarks from Variety co-editors-in-chief Cynthia Littleton and Ramin Setoodeh (now co-president, alongside publisher Dea Lawrence), and outgoing publisher Michelle Sobrino-Stearns. The first honoree of the night was Kate Hudson, who was introduced by her friend Octavia Spencer.\n\t\n\n\t“As a mother of three, I feel this every day. My daughter Roni is seven,” Hudson said. “She is fearless and funny and completely unaware of how powerful she already is. When I watch her, I think of all the children like her, full of imagination who do not have a chance to grow into who they are meant to be. And I know that if I have reached and have any power at all, I must do what I can to help. We work in a business that gives us opportunity to reflect these truths through storytelling. We stoke the curiosity of what it means to be human. We make people feel seen. We can remind them they are not alone. But the work cannot stop when the cameras turn off. It must continue purposefully and practically because at the end of the day, it’s not the applause or the achievements we remember. It’s the faces, the laughter, the people who remind us that goodness exists. And this is the good kind of power.”\n\n\tNext up was Sydney Sweeney, who was introduced by Sharon Stone. Sweeney focused her speech on boxing champ Christy Martin, whom she is playing in the upcoming film “Christy.”\n\n\t“I’m not a fighter in the ring, but I recognized something of myself in Christy,” Sweeney said. “I know what it feels like to be underestimated, to have people define you before you’ve had a chance to define yourself. I know what it feels like to have to prove that you deserve to be here, to be seen, to be taken seriously. Every one of us has our own fight. And Christy reminds us all that strength doesn’t always look loud; sometimes it’s just getting back up, again and again, no matter who’s watching. Playing her taught me that surviving isn’t the end of the story, it’s the beginning of reclaiming it.”\n\n\tAlso during the evening, Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman was honored with the Variety Courage Award presented by Purina. “Standing up here, I’m thinking about the millions who suffer in abusive relationships in silence, afraid for their lives,” said Raisman, who was introduced by teammate Jordan Chiles. “I’m thinking about those who’ve never been told they matter; that their voices matter; that their bodies are their own. I’m thinking about those who don’t feel safe at home, and who feel there’s nowhere to go.”\n\n\tHonoree Wanda Sykes was cued up by Jane Fonda, and used her acceptance speech to call out the pending expiration of SNAP benefits amid the government shutdown and the effect that could have on single mothers.\n\t\n\n\t“When women thrive, the community thrives. We make everyone around us better, we do,” Sykes said. “When you get women, when we win, everybody wins. When men win, sometimes they get a younger wife. … We’re at a moment in time where, with everything that’s going on the government, where we need to create projects where life imitates art. Look at what’s happening with cutting SNAP benefits. That’s going to affect single mothers. And so I want to do things that speak to them and uplift them.”\n\n\tEva Longoria presented Nicole Scherzinger with her honors, which Scherzinger used to support her work with the Special Olympics.\n\n\t“I’ve performed at the openings and closings of ceremonies surrounded by these athletes whose determination and spirit could move mountains,” Scherzinger said. “I’ve watched them redefine what’s possible, not just for themselves, but for all of us. They remind me that courage isn’t measured by medals or applause, but by the bold willingness to show up with your whole heart. Power of women is not just about success or recognition — it’s about how we use our voices, our platforms and our influence to lift others. True power is shared and ignites others.”\n\n\tCurtis closed out the night with her speech, which was introduced by Suzanne Yankovic, by quoting a tile that hangs in her kitchen: “To live is to learn. To learn is to know. To know is to grow. To grow is to give. To give is to live.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThailand has transformed from a scenic backdrop into one of Asia’s most competitive production hubs, backed by enhanced film incentives and robust infrastructure, according to  Apinat Obb Siricharoenjit, partner and line producer at Living Films, who presented at the MPA seminar at the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\tSpeaking at the event, the “Alien: Earth” line producer detailed Thailand’s journey from hosting location shoots to becoming a full-service production destination trusted by studios and filmmakers worldwide. The country has successfully increased its film incentive to 30% on local spend without any cap, up from the initial 15% when first introduced in 2017, with an uplift to 20% before the recent increase at the end of last year.\n\t\n\n\t“What you just saw is actually evidence that Thailand is no longer just a backdrop of any film. It’s rather now developed into one of Asia’s most competitive production hub trusted by studios and filmmakers all over the world,” Siricharoenjit said, following a video showcase of films produced in the country.\n\n\n\tThe production manager, whose company Living Films has put at least 15 films through Thailand’s incentive program and was among the first to utilize it, emphasized that the country’s appeal extends beyond financial incentives. “It’s also the infrastructure, the crew and the creativity of the local people,” he explained.\n\n\tThailand’s success stems from collaboration between government agencies and the private sector. The Ministry of Culture’s Department of Cultural Development and the Department of Tourism work alongside Thailand’s film office and private companies, with industry professionals sitting on advisory boards to guide policy development. “Our government recognizes that film is not just art. It is an industry and a bridge to soft power,” Siricharoenjit noted, adding that stable government policies and competitive incentives have been crucial to attracting international productions.\n\t\n\n\tThe scale of production activity has created substantial economic impact. “Alien: Earth” alone generated 24,000 jobs across the country, with 1,600 local crew members on weekly payroll and a construction crew of 450 people. The production bought out hotels in Krabi in southern Thailand and chartered planes for the shoot.\n\n\tSiricharoenjit emphasized the importance of crew pipeline development, noting that local departments have grown from small units to global-scale teams. “Crew became bilingual, trained by working side by side with the best people in Hollywood, Europe, Korea, Japan,” he said. However, he acknowledged challenges when multiple major productions overlap. During “Alien: Earth” production, at least 70% of Thailand’s crew base was employed, and the situation became more strained when “Jurassic World” arrived, bringing 400 crew members to service their shoot and competing for locations.\n\n\t“Alien: Earth” presented unique challenges that expanded Thailand’s capabilities. “There are departments and sections that we never done in Thailand before, like, for example, we never had a creature department,” Siricharoenjit revealed, explaining how collaboration with international teams helped develop new skills. The elaborate creature eggs featured in the production were crafted by Thai artisans.\n\n\tFilm production continues to drive tourism long after cameras stop rolling. Maya Bay, featured in “The Beach” (2000) starring Leonardo DiCaprio, remains a popular destination despite being “just only a small bay. Actually. It’s really tiny.” The Lebua hotel, which featured in “The Hangover Part II” (2011), still offers a Hangover Suite as one of its best-selling accommodations and serves a Hangover cocktail among its top sellers. More recently, “White Lotus” shot at a property in Koh Samui saw occupancy rates surge after the first two episodes aired, demonstrating “the economic impact of international films.”\n\n\tThe influx of international productions has catalyzed infrastructure development. “The ecosystem starts, and it’s followed with all the vendors, sound stages, rental houses, equipment, base. It’s all growing because of all these international productions that came in, and that’s the demand for it,” Siricharoenjit explained. \n\n\tThe combination of global expertise and local craftsmanship distinguishes Thailand’s offerings. “Art directors with infused local textures, costume teams that understand fabric traditions, crafts people, construction team who built sets. This mix of global skills and local artistry is what makes Thailand truly different,” he said. “Every production leaves more than images on the screen, and film is more than production. It is identity, influence and memory.”\n\t\n\n\tTo maintain its super hub status, Siricharoenjit stressed the need for continued evolution. “We must keep incentives competitive and predictable. Speed of approval, transparency of audit, and you must keep improving on the incentive,” he said, adding that the country must continue connecting film to culture. “We must continue trying film to culture, not just action films in Bangkok or epics in jungles, but dramas in historic towns, stories that showcase our creative cities, our crowds and our music. A super hub is not only a service platform, it is also a cultural part.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney is bracing herself for how emotional it will be to finish filming “Euphoria” Season 3.  \n\n\tThe Cassie Howard actress was honored Wednesday night at Variety’s 2025 Power of Women ceremony in L.A. as one of the cover stars. She shares that she’s going back for her last two days of shooting “Euphoria” Season 3 on Thursday and Sunday.\n\n\t“It’s gonna be a really bittersweet moment,” Sweeney told Variety’s Angelique Jackson about wrapping the season on the Power of Women red carpet. “I’m kind of terrified for how emotional it’s gonna be. It’s been such a journey. It’s been my entire twenties. They’ve been my family and friends for so long. I’ve been forever grateful for all of them.”\n\t\n\n\tSweeney, now 28, told Variety’s Marc Malkin this week that “I was 20 when I did the pilot, so being able to see a lot of the same people, it feels very comforting.”\n\n\tNot much is known about Season 3, other than it will release in spring 2026 and feature lots of returning cast members and new faces, like Trisha Paytas, Natasha Lyonne, Danielle Deadwyler and Eli Roth.\n\n\tSweeney’s co-star Jacob Elordi said that “Euphoria” creator Sam Levinson “constructed something that’s incredibly clever and cinematic.” \n\n\t“It was incredibly liberating,” Elordi said. “I got to play something so sort of far out from what I’ve done before.”\n\n\tNext up, Sweeney is starring in the boxing biopic “Christy” as real-life champion Christy Martin, who accompanied her to Power of Women. She’s also starring in and executive producing a “Barbarella” remake for Sony. Jane Fonda, who starred in the original 1968 sci-fi movie, also attended Power of Women on Wednesday. Sweeney said on the red carpet that she wanted to pick Fonda’s brain for her remake.\n\t\n\n\t“If you see us in a corner the entire time, just know I’m asking absolutely everything,” she said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRamsey Naito is exiting her post as president of Paramount Animation.\n\n\t“I want to share with you that I am leaving the company and closing this very special chapter with all of you,” she wrote on Wednesday night in a note to staff. “Leading this incredible team of talented storytellers, artists and dreamers, and watching the magic that you’ve spun from your imagination and dedication, has been one of the great joys of my career.”\n\t\n\n\tHer departure follows the studio’s recent merger with Skydance, which has resulted in several significant executive shuffles. David Ellison, the company’s new chairman and CEO, announced he’s undertaking a series of staffing cuts that are expected to eliminate approximately 2,000 jobs in the U.S. with additional layoffs taking place internationally.\n\n\n\t“We want to be as open and direct as possible about the reasons behind these changes,” Ellison wrote in memo earlier in the day about the companywide cuts. “In some areas, we are addressing redundancies that have emerged across the organization. In others, we are phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth. Ultimately, these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success.”\n\n\tAn Oscar-nominated producer of 2017’s “Boss Baby,” Naito started her career at Nickelodeon and returned in 2018 before she was promoted to president of the animation division in 2021. Since then, Naito was responsible for breathing new life into broadly appealing franchises at the film studio such as “Smurfs,” “Transformers,” “PAW Patrol,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “SpongeBob SquarePants.” \n\t\n\n\tIn her previous role overseeing Nickelodeon Animation, Naito led animated content across all formats and platforms, spanning linear, digital, TV movies, theatrical motion pictures. This included the day-to-day operations of Nickelodeon’s franchises, including “SpongeBob SquarePants” and its spinoffs like “The Patrick Star Show” and “Kamp Koral” as well as a new “Dora the Explorer” series.\n\n\t“I am so proud of the work the animation teams and I have done for the last 8+ years. I am honored to have given new life and love to the beloved characters and stories within the vast Paramount and Nickelodeon libraries — from ‘SpongeBob’ to ‘PAW Patrol’ to ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ — and the birth of a whole new slate of originals for today’s generation,” Naito’s note continued. “Not only am I endlessly proud of what we’ve built, but even more so the spirit behind it — the collaboration, creativity, and kindness that define this team. Though I’m moving on, I’ll always be cheering you on (and singing along to the ‘PAW Patrol’ theme or humming the ‘TMNT’ riff when I see your work lighting up screens everywhere).”\n\n\tShe concluded, “Thank you to Josh, Dana and the fantastic leadership team who I know will keep propelling our animation business to great heights.”\n\n\tShe’s referring to Paramount Pictures co-chairs Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, who called Naito an “incredible partner and leader.”\n\n\t“We’re so appreciative of Ramsey’s creativity, dedication, and lasting influence on our animation slate,”  Goldberg and Greenstein said in a statement. “She’s been an incredible partner and leader, and her work has left a lasting mark on our studio as we look toward the future.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGymnast Aly Raisman is no stranger to accepting awards. She’s earned six Olympic medals, five World Championship medals, and now, the Variety Courage Award, presented by Purina. She accepted the honor at Variety‘s L.A. Power of Women event Wednesday in Beverly Hills. After an introduction from her fellow Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, Raisman took the stage, delivering a speech that stressed the importance of coming together to create avenues for change, because “Hope grows when communities show up.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile Raisman’s accomplishments on the mat are legendary, she is being honored with the Courage Award for her work as an advocate, ally and activist. She testified before the Senate in 2018 about the sexual abuse allocations against USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar and continues to speak up against sexual abuse. She’s championed mental health awareness, advocated for pet-friendly shelters for survivors of domestic violence, and authored the 2024 children’s book “From My Head to My Toes,” which teaches kids about consent.\n\n\tChiles introduced her, saying, “Tonight, we’re not here to celebrate what Aly did on a four-inch beam or on the floor. We’re here to celebrate something that requires even more courage — what she’s done with her voice.”\n\n\tAccordingly, Raisman used her speech as an opportunity to speak up for people who are still enduring domestic abuse. “Violence is their daily reality,” she said, “For too many, home is the least safe place.” At the same time, she acknowledged that “Leaving isn’t simple. So many factors can keep a person in harm’s way: children, finances, threats, lack of resources and support, uncertainty, fear, even pets.”\n\t\n\n\tFocusing on the importance of keeping people and their pets together, she showed gratitude for Purina’s Purple Leash Project, stating, “I want to acknowledge the people and organizations working to remove these barriers by creating safe options, including pet-friendly shelters. Initiatives like the Purple Leash Project are critical so no one has to choose between safety and a family member.” She then spoke about how her own dog, Mylo, helps her enjoy day-to-day life and maintain her mental health. \n\n\tIn a call to action, Raisman added that “We need to acknowledge the prevalence of abuse before becoming part of the solution” and encouraged the audience to “never underestimate the power of your belief and action in someone’s experience.”\n\n\t“Keep reaching out until someone listens and provides you with the validation you deserve and stands with you,” she implored the audience, “I promise you there are people out there who will believe and help you. Sometimes it may just take time to find that person or organization. But please don’t give up until you find someone.”\n\n\tShe concluded her speech with a hopeful message, saying, “Your body is your own. It is a basic human right to be safe and have a safe place to call home. If it feels dark right now, you won’t feel like this forever. There is help. There is community. There is a future.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSharon Stone was on hand for Variety’s Power of Women LA event on Wednesday, set to present honors to Sydney Sweeney as one of the evening’s honorees. The two actresses have been working on “Euphoria” Season 3 for several months now, including after Sweeney faced controversy for featuring in an American Eagle ad campaign in July. The commercials centered on the slogan “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,” a pun on “great genes”; it drew backlash from critics who alleged the ads glorified Sweeney’s white heritage and physique.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s okay to use what mama gave you. It’s really fine,” Stone told Variety senior entertainment writer Angelique Jackson on the carpet, voicing her support for Sweeney. “It’s hard to be hot, and I think we all know that. It’s really okay to use every bit of hotness you have — right here, right now — and go for whatever that is. Everybody has their own certain kind of hotness, their own certain thing, and you’re supposed to go for that. Because who are you not to be beautiful? You know, who you are isn’t an accident.”\n\n\tStone recounted a conversation that she had with Sweeney as the “great jeans” controversy was taking hold, as the two actresses continued production on “Euphoria.”\n\n\t“Because I was co-godparents with Jane Goodall, I said, ‘When Jane was on the cover of Life Magazine for her work with gorillas, she was in her safari shorts and shirt, sitting with one of the animals that she was working with. Other scientists said, ‘Well, she only got the cover of Life Magazine because she had good legs.’ And Jane said, ‘Well, if I did, then that helped me get more money for my research,'” Stone said. “Sydney said, ‘Yeah, and I’m sure I made a billion dollars for the jeans company, and I’m good with that. Because, you know what? I’ll get another job.'”\n\t\n\n\tStone is a new addition to the ensemble for “Euphoria” Season 3, which will reportedly take place after a years-long time jump following the events of Season 2. Sweeney is reprising her role from the first two seasons, as are stars Zendaya, Jacob Elordi, Eric Dane, Alexa Demie, Maude Apatow, Colman Domingo and others. While Stone may be a series newcomer, she says she’s been a longtime “Euphoria” fan. \n\n\t“I had to watch it for the 67th time to get caught up again,” Stone joked. “It was such a joy to go to work with these amazing young people.”\n\n\tDirector Paul Feig, who worked with Sweeney on her upcoming thriller “The Housemaid,” also offered his support for his star in her Power of Women Variety cover story, calling the “great jeans” controversy “manufactured” by “a certain segment of the media [who] blew it up.”\n\n\t“She’s probably one of the most confident people I’ve ever met in my life — in a good way. She’s very savvy,” Feig said.\n\n\tAlong with Sweeney, Variety’s Power of Women L.A. event on Wednesday honored Wanda Sykes, Jamie Lee Curtis, Nicole Scherzinger and Kate Hudson. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWanda Sykes accepted honors at Variety’s Power of Women L.A. event on Wednesday evening, taking the stage for a speech in which she got candid about her preference for hiring women over men as a producer. \n\n\t“My joy is when I’m able to hire somebody. And you know who I like to hire? Women. … I’ll be upfront with you. When it comes to a position and I look on the paper — she might be right here, and he’s up there,” Sykes said, putting out both of her hands, with the “man” one slightly elevated above the “woman” one. “I’m hiring the woman. That’s just how I operate. And I’ll be honest with you, if she’s a black woman — oh, pssh. Girl, you got the job.”\n\t\n\n\tSykes drew applause from the crowd, before the stand-up went back in to build to a laugh line: “When women thrive, the community thrives. We make everyone around us better. When you get women, when we win, everybody wins. When men win, sometimes they get a younger wife.”\n\n\tThe comedian and producer went on to elaborate on why she sees a responsibility in her work as a producer in uplifting women. \n\n\t“What I plan on doing is to continue to create projects — and even in my stand-up — to speak and represent more of what powerful women can do. We’re at a moment in time where, with everything that’s going on in the government, we need to create projects where life imitates art,” Sykes said. “Looking at what’s happening with cutting SNAP benefits — that’s going to affect single mothers. I want to do things that speak to them and uplift them. … Use your power to uplift women. If we did that, and if that’s the way we moved, we would have two female presidents by now.”\n\t\n\n\tFor Variety’s Power of Women L.A., Sykes was introduced by Jane Fonda. Sykes’ speech also spotlit the Ruth Ellis Center, a Detroit-based nonprofit that offers housing and resources to homeless, runaway and at-risk queer youth. \n\n\t“The kids expressed how much that place meant to them — and you could see it,” Sykes said about visiting the group’s premises for the first time in her Variety cover story. “Immediately I was like, ‘I’m on board. What do y’all need? What can I do?’” \n\n\tAlong with Sykes, Variety’s Power of Women L.A. event featured honors for and speeches by Kate Hudson, Sydney Sweeney, Nicole Scherzinger and Jamie Lee Curtis. \n",

The jury began deliberations Tuesday morning and returned the verdict Wednesday afternoon.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Remember ... Grayson was arrested in July 2024 after he killed Massey, who had called 911 in the first place about a possible prowler. Horrific body cam footage came out in the aftermath of the shooting ... which showed the conversation take a deadly turn after Massey turned off a burner on her stove and brought a pot of boiling water over to the sink.\n      \n\n        \n                    \n                      7/6/24\n                  \n      \n    \n          With another deputy looking on, Grayson loses his cool and tells her repeatedly to drop the pot ... before stepping around the counter and shooting her. The Sangamon County Sheriff's Office later fired Grayson -- who claimed he feared Massey meant to throw the boiling water at him.\n      \n    \n          Famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump -- who represented Sonya's family -- told us he and Sonya's father, James Wilburn, weren't buying Grayson's excuse after the body cam footage was released. The family has since secured a $10 million civil settlement connected to her death.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

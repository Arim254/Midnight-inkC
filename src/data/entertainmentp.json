    "body": "\n\tThe team behind global family hits “Mia and the White Lion” and “The Wolf and the Lion,” Mediawan‘s Mai Juin Productions, is heading back into the wild with “Indiana and the Otter’s Legend.”  \n\n\tSet to shoot in the wilds of Canada’s Eastern Townships in 2026, the English-language family adventure project has been boarded by Playtime, the Paris-based company which is part of Vuelta.  \n\n\n\tPlaytime (“The Quiet Son”) is launching worldwide sales for the ambitious project at the American Film Market, marking its first collaboration with Mai Juin Productions.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing the journey of animals and children set against against a lush backdrop, “Indiana and the Otter’s Legend” has already secured distribution partners in major territories, including another Vuelta-affiliated banner, Pan Distribution in France, as well as Mediawan’s Leonine Studios in Germany, and Photon Films and TVA Films in Canada.\n\n\tThe new movie will be directed by Julien Decoin, best known for the acclaimed French drama series “Les Bracelets Rouges,” and written by Cynthia Knight, whose youth-focused credits include the series “The Next Step.” \n\n\tMarguerite Laurence, who was seen in Amazon’s “Three Pines,” stars in a first lead role as 12-year-old Indiana (Laurence), who is “uprooted from the city to the struggling riverside town of Otterville — once famous for its otters, now hauntingly without them. When two unexpectedly return, the town dares to hope again. But protecting them leads Indiana and her friends into a battle against a predatory developer, a corrupt mayor, and her own father — the town sheriff,” reads the synopsis. \n\t\n\n\tMai Juin Productions’ Catherine Camborde, the driving force behind the animal-led family hits, “Mia and the White Lion” ($40M), “The Wolf and the Lion” ($25M) and “The Last Jaguar” ($22M), is producing  “Indiana and the Otter’s Legend,” alongside Wishing Tree Productions’ Jonathan Vanger and Sylvain Proulx, whose credits span “Cat & Dog,” “Best Sellers,” and “Crisis”. The project is backed by Telefilm Canada.\n\n\t“Otters as the main characters are highly engaging,” said Playtime Co-CEO Sébastien Beffa. “They bring an imaginary background of positive values such as family and work, but also tenderness, humor, and genuine empathy.”\n\n\tBeffa also praised the script for offering an “authentic ecological perspective, not in a guilt-inducing way but in a constructive manner, allowing audiences of all ages to get involved in an entertaining way.”\n\n\tCamborde and Vanger, meanwhile, said they’re “delighted with this first partnership with Playtime.\n\n\tThe pair described “Indiana and the Otter’s Legend” as “an adventure film in the spirit of ‘E.T.,’ ‘Super 8,’ ‘The Goonies’ and ‘Stranger Things,’ featuring a group of children and otters.” The producers said the film will combine “adventure, emotion, and comedy thanks to the mischievous nature of the animals,” and universal themes such as ” friendship, teenage emancipation, environmental protection.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tDisney is going full throttle into Formula 1. As part of the newly announced multi-year “Fuel the Magic” collaboration between the two global powerhouses, Disney Store is debuting its first F1-themed capsule collection this week — a 25-piece drop that blends the prestige of the motorsport with the legacy characters of Mickey & Friends.\n\n\tLaunching Nov. 8 online at DisneyStore.com and in person at the F1 Las Vegas Hub inside the Venetian Resort, the line serves as the first consumer product expression of the Disney-F1 deal, which will roll out across content, experiences and merchandise through the 2027 season.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDesigned by Disney Consumer Products’ in-house team and led by Bobby Kim — the former Hundreds co-founder who now serves as VP of Creative — the collection adopts a red, black and white palette shared by both Mickey Mouse and Formula 1. Apparel, accessories and collectibles lean into racing cues: checkerboard trims reinterpreted as fashion accents, track-shaped graphics, athletic silhouettes and an aerodynamic, slightly edgier version of Mickey built specifically for this universe. “He was meant to look fast,” Kim tells Variety. “Not retro, not nostalgic — more sleek, more premium, more in line with the F1 aesthetic.”\n\n\n\tThat balance of heritage and futurism also appealed to Formula 1’s Las Vegas team. “This isn’t just merch — it’s an F1 lifestyle line,” Collette Gangemi, VP of Consumer Products for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, said in a statement. “We wanted the adrenaline and prestige of the sport, the neon energy of Vegas and the universal charm of Disney, all in one collection.”\n\t\n\n\tThe launch is timed to the sport’s splashiest U.S. stop: the Las Vegas Grand Prix, where Mickey & Friends will make an appearance during a special pit-lane walk for select grandstand ticket-holders. It’s one of several activations planned under the “Fuel the Magic” banner, a campaign Disney and F1 say is designed to bring fans “closer to the magic” through race-week programming, premium product and crossover storytelling.\n\n\t“I’ve always admired F1 from afar,” Kim says. “But once you’re inside it, you understand: it’s rock-star-driven, high-stakes, global, fast — literally and metaphorically. And Disney, at its best, moves just as fast.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tU.K. broadcaster ITV has confirmed it has received a £1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) bid from Comcast’s pay-TV platform Sky for its media and entertainment unit. \n\n\tThe shock news — which would fundamentally change the British broadcasting landscape if it were to go ahead — would see Comcast take control of ITV’s linear channels and ITVX streaming business, significantly expanding its U.K. TV foothold, having already acquired Sky for around $30 billion in 2018. \n\t\n\n\tAccording to news reports, the bid from Sky centers on the potential creation of a U.K.-focused streaming giant.\n\n\n\tIn a short statement sent Friday morning, ITV said it noted “the recent press speculation and confirms that it is in preliminary discussions regarding a possible sale of its M&E business to Sky for an enterprise value of £1.6bn.”\n\n\tIt added: “There can be no certainty as to the terms upon which any potential sale may be agreed or whether any transaction will take place. A further announcement will be made in due course if appropriate.”\n\n\tThe discussions do not include ITV’s production and sales arm, ITV Studios, which makes shows including “Love Island,” “I’m a Celebrity” and the drama “Mr Bates vs The Post Office” and has been the center of numerous recent takeover rumors. RedBird IMI and Banijay are understood to have expressed an interest in the unit.\n\n\tDespite only being preliminary, the idea of a sale of ITV’s TV business to Sky — which would require regulatory approval — has sent the U.K. broadcasting world into a spin. \n\t\n\n\t“ITV’s proposed £1.6 billion sale of its Media & Entertainment division to Sky could mark a turning point for British television,” said Giao Pacey, partner and corporate lawyer at media and entertainment law firm Simkins LLP. “It’s not just a divestment, it’s a sign that U.K. broadcasters are rethinking how they operate in a fast-moving media landscape. By offloading its traditional TV channels and streaming service ITVX, ITV is aiming to reduce its reliance on advertising, which can be unpredictable, and instead focus on producing content it can sell globally.”\n\n\tConfirmation of the deal talks came shortly after ITV reported that it would “temporarily” shave $46 million from its budgets over the U.K.’s “softening economy” and advertiser uncertainty. It said it expected ad revenues to fall by 9% in the key fourth-quarter period in the lead up to Christmas. \n\n\tITV shares jumped 18% at the start of trading in London on Friday following news of a potential deal with Sky.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) has unveiled its second Focus program for the 55th edition, turning the spotlight on Japan’s V-Cinema — the direct-to-video movement that exploded in the late 1980s and profoundly shaped the country’s contemporary film culture. \n\n\tThe section, curated by Tom Mes, will run as part of the festival’s 2026 edition from Jan. 29 to Feb. 8.\n\n\n\tOriginating with Toei’s “Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage” (1989), V-Cinema responded to Japan’s booming home video market by producing films that bypassed theaters entirely. The low-budget, high-speed production model gave directors unprecedented creative freedom, birthing a generation of filmmakers who went on to define modern Japanese cinema — including Miike Takashi, Nakata Hideo, Kurosawa Kiyoshi and Aoyama Shinji.\n\t\n\n\tIFFR’s V-Cinema Focus will showcase a range of Toei titles, among them the “Crime Hunter” trilogy — “Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage,” “Crime Hunter 2: Bullets of Betrayal” and “Crime Hunter 3: Killing Bullet.” The lineup also features Nakata’s debut feature “Female Teacher: Forbidden Sex,” the psychological noir “Betrayal Tomorrow,” and the cult action thriller “XX Beautiful Weapon.”\n\n\n\tThe program expands beyond Toei to highlight the anarchic spirit and genre experimentation that defined the movement. Among the selections are the ghostly anthology “Scary True Stories: Second Night,” the eerie found-footage investigation “Psychic Vision: Jaganrei,” and Miike’s hyperviolent “Fudoh: The New Generation.” Other highlights include the surreal gangland fable “Tuff: Part I,” Kurosawa’s deadpan yakuza comedy “Suit Yourself or Shoot Yourself!! VI: The Hero,” Aoyama’s archetypal action drama “A Weapon in My Heart,” and “The King of Minami,” about a loan shark aiding small business owners.\n\t\n\n\t“V-Cinema offered filmmakers the space to take risks, move fast and work with a freedom rarely possible within the traditional studio system,” said IFFR festival director Vanja Kaludjercic. “What emerged was a wild and inventive cinema embracing everything from anarchic yakuza tales and psycho-horror experiments to surreal hybrid pieces — work that still feels electric today.”\n\n\tIFFR’s full 2026 program will be unveiled on Dec. 16.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOz may have told us to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, but at the Dolby Theatre taping of “Wicked: One Wonderful Night,” audiences were treated to a rare peek at the magic behind the scenes.\n\n\tThe show was recorded at the Dolby Theater on Sept. 24 with a packed audience of “Wicked” fans dressed for the occasion.\n\n\tPlenty of standout moments made the broadcast — including a duet of the Judy Garland-Barbra Streisand classic “Happy Days Are Here Again/ Get Happy,” performed by film stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo — but some of the evening’s most delightful off-camera moments didn’t make the final cut. \n\t\n\n\tHere are a few things you didn’t see on air: \n\n\t\n\t\tAudience Participation  \t\n\n\tBefore cameras rolled, the audience was enlisted to learn choreography for the opening number, “No One Mourns the Wicked.” Those seated in the orchestra section were given faux tulips and taught the flower choreography from the film — tossing them into the air on cue, timed to Grande’s entrance as Glinda the Good. The group rehearsed for several minutes before dancers joined for a final run-through and filming. \n\t\n\t\tThe Show Must Go On \t\n\n\tThe sequences were filmed out of order and included full musical numbers along with the scene-to-scene transitions. While most numbers required only a single take, a few — including “The Wizard and I” and “Defying Gravity” — were performed twice to secure a clean version, giving the audience an extra encore. Grande and Erivo’s duet of “Happy Days Are Here Again/ Get Happy” also received an extra run-through — not for technical reasons, but simply because the pair wanted to “do it again.” \n\t\n\t\n\t\tMultiple Choice Moments \t\n\n\tAlong with taping alternate versions of musical performances, the production also recorded multiple intros for the show’s packaged segments. At one point, director Jon M. Chu filmed two separate setups: one introducing a segment of unseen audition tapes from actors “who tried out for the film” including Khloe Kardashian, Shaquille O’ Neal and Ludacris, and another teasing a new, exclusive clip. Only the unseen auditions made the broadcast, suggesting the other was ultimately cut. \n\t\n\t\tThe Tease… Without the Payoff \t\n\n\tThroughout the night, Grande, Erivo, and the cast teased exclusive looks at new film clips and musical moments — but the live audience didn’t end up seeing them. At one point, Grande and Erivo introduced the new songs premiering in the film and set up a “first listen,” only for no clip to appear.  “We’re sorry, you won’t actually hear them tonight!” Grande apologized. “Isn’t that evil? We said that!” Erivo chimed in, adding, “That was not our fault. We want to give you everything — we love you!”  Later, Bowen Yang and Ethan Slater teased a performance of “For Good” pre-recorded at the Gershwin Theatre, where “Wicked” lives on Broadway — only to reveal the audience wouldn’t be seeing it. The room responded with playful groans. “Sorry, guys!” Yang said.\n\n\tThe broadcast version featured a “Wicked” reunion of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, who first played the characters in the original Broadway production and made a cameo in the first film. Grande and Erivo were also on stage and the four were accompanied by composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz on piano.\n\t\n\t\tThe Emcee  \t\n\n\tDuring downtime, Bill Sindelar was tasked with emcee duties and kept spirits high. He updated the crowd on the run of show, mingled with audience members — even inviting those in elaborate costumes to the front to show them off — and helped guide the taping of audience reaction shots and B-roll.\n\t\n\t\tFun Between Scenes  \t\n\n\tThe taping stretched over four hours, with breaks between scenes as production reset for the next setup. During those pauses, music kept the crowd energized — from Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club,” which sparked a full-blown sing-along, to “Hot to Go!” which resulted in an emcee-led dance session. Later, when “Thank U, Next” began playing, Grande surprised the crowd by popping back onstage, laughing as she shared a quick moment with the audience. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tMarissa’s Moment \t\n\n\tMarissa Bode, who plays Nessarose, introduced “Defying Gravity” with a speech about authenticity and resilience. “This song is an ode to authenticity and about believing in yourself — no matter what obstacles the world puts in your way,” she said. The broadcast version cut to her intro; however, Bode added: “Whether it be school bullies… or power-hungry dictators…” which prompted a loud, sustained cheer in the room. Though the line was removed for the broadcast, the ovation lasted nearly 30 seconds live. \n\t\n\t\t‘Popular’\t\n\n\tIn a surprising turn of events, Grande picked an audience member to perform opposite with, instead of her usual scene partner Erivo as Elphaba. The lucky audience member happened to be a young 4-year-old boy named Remington. Remington was dressed as Elphaba, complete with a broom prop. Grande placed him down on the bed and danced and sang her way through the song, interacting with him. There were no unexpected surprises there. Grande and her newest co-star performed “Popular” in one take. And yes, she did give him his broom back.\n\n\tChoreographer Christopher Scott revealed he had stood in for the child during rehearsals. “It was me and Ari, and I’m pretending to be this 4-year-old child. In my mind, I’m thinking, ‘I don’t know what a 4-year-old child is going to do.'” Backstage, Scott was watching the monitors, having mini celebrations every time something worked.\n\t\n\t\t‘Dancing Through Life’\t\n\n\tPeople’s sexiest man alive, Jonathan Bailey, wasn’t available the day the show taped. “They were trying to move mountains to make it happen,” Scott told Variety.\n\n\tOnce the team knew it wasn’t going to happen, the team came up with various ideas to try to represent the number on the show. Scott said, “We wanted to honor Jonathan, and honor the show, and give the fans something fresh and new that was fun for them.”\n\n\tEnter Bowen Yang as Fiyero. “It opened up this opportunity to see another side of him,” said Scott. And they weren’t done yet — Slater and Bode also got to don Fiyero’s outfit and dance through life.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHong Kong sales company Cappu Films has picked up Thai Girls’ Love series “Love Design” and is introducing the title to buyers at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF), which is currently taking place.\n\n\tGL and BL (Boys’ Love) series, which center on same-sex romantic relationships, have become a popular genre across Asia, with Thailand emerging as a major production hub for such content.\n\n\n\tUnder the arrangement, Cappu Films and VelCurve Studio — the production company behind the sci-fi film “Uranus 2324” — will jointly handle international sales for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, North America, Latin America and Singapore.\n\t\n\n\tHelmed by Fuse Kittisak Cheewasatjasakun, the series follows two female architects, portrayed by Kao Supassara Thanachart and Jane Methika Jiranorraphat, whose romantic relationship deteriorates into professional animosity after one uses the other’s designs in a competition without permission.\n\n\n\tThe show debuted Oct. 2 with weekly Thursday releases. Thailand’s Channel 3 is airing an eight-episode version, while Tencent’s WeTV platform carries an extended cut with 10 episodes. Fan events for the final two episodes are planned for early December 2025.\n\n\tKeetawat Chinnakote, CEO and executive producer at VelCurve Studio, and Janice Woo, founder and head of sales at Cappu Films, negotiated the agreement.\n\n\t“‘Love Design’ is a GL series that tells the story of the architecture profession — exploring both the challenges of work and the romantic relationships of its characters,” said Keetawat. “It stars the talented Kao Supassara and Jane Methika, alongside promising newcomers Friend Tofan and Palm Paramee. Produced by VelCurve Studio, the series is crafted with a strong commitment to high production standards and storytelling that allows global audiences to easily understand and connect with its context and emotions.”\n\t\n\n\tHe characterized the series as Thai soft power content that showcases the country’s creative capabilities internationally, noting his hopes for global audience support through the Cappu Films partnership.\n\n\t“At Cappu Films, we are passionate about bringing distinctive Asian stories with global resonance to audiences worldwide,” said Woo. “‘Love Design’ is a bold and emotionally layered GL series that combines romance, rivalry, and ambition in a fresh way. Partnering with VelCurve Studio allows us to champion diverse storytelling while tapping into the phenomenal energy of the GL fan community across Asia and beyond.”\n\n\tCappu Films handles international sales for emerging directors and commercial genre content. The company’s TCCF slate features the Busan Vision competition winner “Malika” from Kazakhstan, the action-thriller “Fox Hunt” with Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Olga Kurylenko, Josh Radnor’s “All Happy Families,” the Karlovy Vary entry “Promise, I’ll Be Fine” from Aerofilms/Filmtopia, and the Chinese action title “Assassin,” which Film Movement’s Omnibus Entertainment label will distribute in North America.\n\n\tVelCurve Studio’s previous work includes “Uranus 2324,” which Netflix acquired for its streaming service throughout Southeast Asia, covering Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, East Timor, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and Indonesia.\n",

    "body": "\n\tShudder and Independent Film Company have closed a deal for Rod Blackhurst‘s horror film “Dolly” covering North American, U.K., Ireland and Australia-New Zealand territories, with plans for a theatrical release next year.\n\n\tThe film centers on Macy, a young woman fighting to survive after being taken by a monstrous figure intent on raising her as its child. Critics have noted its blend of New French Extremity aesthetics with 1970s American horror sensibilities.\n\t\n\n\tThe ensemble includes Fabianne Therese, Seann William Scott, Ethan Suplee, Russ Tiller, Kate Cobb and Michalina Scorzelli. Former NWA TV Champion Max the Impaler, also known as The Non-Binary Nightmare, makes their film debut in the title role.\n\n\n\tThe Witchcraft Motion Picture Company production, which earned strong reviews at Fantastic Fest and Sitges Film Festival, marks another genre project for Blackhurst, the Emmy and Critics Choice-nominated filmmaker behind “Blood For Dust” and Netflix’s “Amanda Knox” documentary. He also co-wrote Universal and Blumhouse’s “Night Swim” with Bryce McGuire.\n\n\tBlackhurst wrote the screenplay with Brandon Weavil. Ross O’Connor produces alongside Noah Lang and Blackhurst through Witchcraft Motion Picture Company, with Set Point Entertainment, Grim Discoveries, Gentile Entertainment Group, Monarque Entertainment and Mama Bear Studios attached. Additional producers include Joseph P. Grano, Betty Tong, Esteban Sanchez, McGuire, Isaiah Smallman and cast members Therese, Scott and Suplee.\n\n\tSamuel Zimmerman negotiated the acquisition for Independent Film Company and Shudder, while Blue Finch Films represented the filmmakers.\n\t\n\n\tSteven Schneider, whose credits include “Paranormal Activity” and “Insidious,” executive produces with Matt Patterson, Barry Large, Bobby Campbell, Sinan Germirli, Scorzelli, Rudy Mawer, Cam Doody, Jared Houghton, Travis Truitt, Anthony and John Gentile, Mike Chapman, Fatima Hayward, Antonio D’Intino, Lawrence Dossche and John Neumann.\n\n\t“‘Dolly’ is a grotesque, beautiful backwoods nightmare,” said Zimmerman, senior VP of programming and acquisitions. “Rod Blackhurst and team transcend their influences to create a beguiling, terrifying new monster; one to love and definitely fear.”\n\n\t“‘Dolly’ is both the exact kind of relentless uncompromising genre filmmaking we grew up loving and a testament to what Witchcraft as a studio understands is possible and most important right now; creating original IP and making films that audiences want,” added Blackhurst. “Truly independent, thematically rich, and created with care and craft. ‘Dolly’ is here to stay and we are excited for everyone to see the first chapter in an expansive horrifying universe.”\n\n\tWitchcraft Motion Picture Company’s slate includes Amblin’s “The White Room,” Carter Smith’s “Swallowed,” Peacock series “John Wayne Gacy: The Devil in Disguise” and Independent Spirit Award nominee “This is Not a War Story.” The company is prepping Blackhurst’s action thriller “Die By Night” while completing post-production on sci-fi film “Into the Sky,” starring Sam Richardson and David Cross, and drama “Ruby Road,” executive produced by Rosario Dawson.\n\n\tBlue Finch’s international lineup includes Fantasia selections “Hellcat” and “Hold The Fort,” plus horror sci-fi “Affection” with Jessica Rothe.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first five minutes of the final season of “Stranger Things” have been revealed.\n\n\tAfter the Season 5 premiere in Los Angeles on Thursday night, Netflix surprise dropped the clip on YouTube, which takes viewers all the way back to the beginning of the series after the 1983 disappearance of Will Byers (Noah Schnapp). \n\n\tTitled “The Crawl,” the first episode opens on a young Will in the Upside Down, trying to calm himself down by softly singing the Clash’s “Should I Stay or Should I Go.” Suddenly, a Demogorgon attacks, chasing Will up a tree and leading to a gnarly fall. Knocked unconscious, Will is then dragged by the Demogorgon to the lair of Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower). Wrapping Will up in his vines with one over his mouth, Vecna says creepily: “At long last, we can begin. You and I, we are going to do such beautiful things together.”\n\t\n\n\tVolume 1 of “Stranger Things” Season 5 is set to drop on Nov. 26, with Volume 2 debuting on Dec. 25. The series finale will premiere on Dec. 31. \n\n\n\t“The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna,” the synopsis for Season 5 reads. “But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the first five minutes of “Stranger Things 5” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\t“My parents didn’t just argue,” Carmela confides in her best friend at school, her face darkening. But she doesn’t go into detail. \n\n\t“Have you ever",
    "body": "\n\t“My parents didn’t just argue,” Carmela confides in her best friend at school, her face darkening. But she doesn’t go into detail. \n\n\t“Have you ever seen your dad act violent? Has he ever treated your badly?” a judge asks Carmela later in the film, in a crux scene caught in a new teaser trailer for “The Good Daughter,” from Catalan Júlia de Paz Solvas. The teaser does not capture Carmela’s reply.\n\n\n\tSold by Beta Cinema, The Good Daughter” world premieres in main competition at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, which runs Nov. 7-23. It begins with Carmela meeting her father in a secured room to ensure he will not meet her mother, who drops her off. Julia loves both parents, idolizes her father, who is preparing an art exhibition, wants to remain loyal to him, whatever he does, whatever her own cost. \n\t\n\n\tWhat he does do to Carmela, in psychological and physical terms, exacts a tremendous emotional toil on her, which she tries to bear in silence. \n\n\tCo-written with Núria Dunjó Lopez (“Ama,” “Jone Sometimes”), “The Good Daughter” marks the second feature by De Paz Solvas, a Variety 2021 Spanish Talent to Track whose debut “Ama” won …. She leapt to much further prominence this year for co-writing “Querer,” which won this year the top Grand Prix at Series Mania, Europe’s biggest TV  festival.\n\n\n\n\n\tThere have been any films on gender violence but “what’s most notable about ‘The Good Daughter’ is without doubt its viewpoint. The cinema I like most are films that present viewpoints that I’d never really thought about before,” says Sergio Grobas, the film’s producer at Barcelona-based Astra Pictures, which co-produced with Madrid’s Avalon Pictures and Belgium’s Kratin Films.  \n\t\n\n\tVariety sat down with De Paz Solvas in the run-up to the Black Nights Films Festival, where “The Good Daughter” is one of the big highlights among new films, at a Focus on Catalonia, dedicated by Tallinn Festival at a territory which has taken festivals by storm while emerging as a extraordinarily fertile co-production force in Europe and Latin America. \n\n\tThe teaser you’ve chosen to publish with Variety drives at the heart of the film: its exploration of gender violence from a not-so-often-considered angle of a daughter? How did you come to explore it?\n\n\tIf we want to talk about an issue, Nuria, the film’s co-screenwriter, and I always begin by research, which in this case took more or less four or five years. I wanted to explore gender-based violence. So we began to interview its victims, survivors. Talking with them, we realized that the large majority were hugely worried about their children which in a large majority of cases were not considered victims since they hadn’t suffered direct physical nor sexual violence from the abuser, their father. As a militant feminist, I was surprised I hadn’t thought about this… .   \n\n\tThe sons and daughters don’t receive psychological counselling?\n\n\tAt both a judicial and social level when it’s a case of psychological violence, it’s difficult for it to be considered violence since it’s subtler, if I can use that description. Since there isn’t evidence which proves violence, which can be the case with physical or sexual abuse, it’s more difficult for it to be considered violence. What we found is that the Spanish justice prioritises the role of the pater families, the father, rather than the figure of an abuser.\n\n\tAnd you talked to the children of victims of gender-based violence? \n\n\tYes, the mothers asked their children – who were normally around the age of Carmela in the film – if they wanted to be interviewed. We interviewed sons and daughters, letting them talk about what they were comfortable about. What they said enriched the screenplay. Also the screenplay was revised by Raúl Lizana,  one of Spain’s leading authorities on vicarious violence – when an aggressor who does not have direct access to the woman he wants to harm exercises that violence on significant persons for her. \n\t\n\n\tDid you interview aggressors?\n\n\tWe met with men who had been jailed for gender-based violence. It’s very easy to fall into clichés. We wanted to show they are not always monsters but have cycles of violence which means that at times they can be spontaneous, seductive, that there are moments of light. We wanted to create this sense of duality of the moments when Carmela is with her father, and in a certain way enamoured of him. We’d like spectators to understand that there’s no specific figure of a victim of gender-based violence, that it’s far more complicated that we are given to believe.\n\n\tIn the film’s first half-hour or so, you understand that the father has been guilty of gender-based violence but you don’t see it. That builds tension and suspense.… \n\n\tYes, there’s a certain similarity with “Querer”: That spectators have to fill in the gaps and be asked to doubt a kind of violence which isn’t that clear. In the scene at the swimming pool, it’s not quite totally clear if this was a game that they’d just seen. In “Querer,” for example, we didn’t want to show the husband’s attacks but rather the post.  \n\n\tWhat were your guidelines as a director? \n\n\tI wanted to follow Carmela at every moment, without judging her, and also that the film would travel between darkness and light, a light captured for example in the relationship with her friends or with the first kiss. We also wanted to play with spaces. I asked Victor Santacana, our art director, to work in a way that, even if Carmela wasn’t in a space, she would be for the spectator.  \n\n\tAnd do you sense that you form part of a a new generation of Catalan filmmakers who have broken trough in the last 10 years and are often women?\n\n\tAt a conscious level, maybe not so much but it’s true that I feel part o0f a network which we’ve all built together. Eva Libertad (“Deaf”),  Gemma Blasco (“La Furia”), or Sara Fantova of “Jone, Sometimes” are my friends. I’ve grown up with them. If I have questions I’ll ask the or other friends. For example, Alauda Ruiz de Azúa, writer-director of “Querer,” helped me with the editing of “The Good Daughter.” We have this support network between us.    \n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has unveiled the trailer for the third season of its hit spy-thriller series “The Family Man,” with Manoj Bajpayee‘s iconic character Srikant Tiwari now finding himself on the run from both new adversaries and his own intelligence unit.\n\n\tThe trailer was unveiled at a fan and media event in Mumbai on Friday, previewing the series created by Raj & DK under their D2R Films banner. Season 3 sees Srikant racing against time to protect himself, his family and the nation from an imminent threat, with the hunter now becoming the hunted.\n\t\n\n\t“For the past four years, fans have hounded me with the question, ‘When is Srikant Tiwari coming?’ And we finally have the answer with a new season that’s not only bigger, bolder, and more exciting but also raises the stakes higher than ever for Srikant, as he finds himself cornered with no respite in sight,” said Bajpayee. “Thanks to Raj and DK’s vision and masterful storytelling, and the continued support of Prime Video, ‘The Family Man’ has become one of the most-loved Indian series.”\n\n\n\tThe latest season introduces two formidable new adversaries: Rukma, played by Jaideep Ahlawat (“Paatal Lok”), and Meera, portrayed by Nimrat Kaur (“The Lunchbox”). \n\n\t“I have always admired Raj and DK for their creative abilities and bringing to life a series like ‘The Family Man,’ which has become one of the most watched and loved Indian series all over the world, and I am thrilled to be a part of the latest season,” said Ahlawat. “Without giving away much about my character, I am certain that everyone will be surprised to see me portraying this role.”\n\t\n\n\tThe series is written by Raj, DK and Suman Kumar, featuring dialogues by Sumit Arora. Raj & DK direct alongside Suman Kumar and Tusshar Seyth, who join as directors for Season 3.\n\n\tKaur, who described herself as a fan of the series since Season 1, called joining the show “a dream come true.” “Playing Meera was both thrilling and challenging, as I had to match the caliber and performative brilliance of Manoj and Jaideep,” she said. “And the way Raj, DK, and Suman have crafted the story with its rich characters and unpredictable twists, I believe audiences will want to binge the new season in one go.”\n\n\tThe explosive trailer showcases the series’ signature elements including witty dialogues, high-octane action, thrilling chases and the blurred lines between Srikant’s personal and professional life. In Season 3, Srikant must navigate life on the run with his family while being pursued by TASC, his own intelligence unit, in addition to the new threats.\n\n\t“Season 3 of ‘The Family Man’ turns Srikant’s covert professional and fragile personal life upside down, as he is forced to go on the run with his family while facing an even more alarming threat in Rukma and Meera,” said creators, directors and writers Raj & DK. “Both Jaideep and Nimrat are the perfect choice, as actors and personalities to embody these dynamic and menacing foes, testing not only Srikant’s grit and resolve but also his commitment to his family and his nation. Taking the story several notches higher the new season will grip audiences with its edge-of-the-seat tension and nail-biting moments as they witness their favorite spy navigating uncharted territories and peril.”\n\n\tReturning cast members include Sharib Hashmi as J.K. Talpade, Priyamani as Suchitra Tiwari, Ashlesha Thakur as Dhriti Tiwari, Vedant Sinha as Atharv Tiwari, Shreya Dhanwanthary as Zoya and Gul Panag as Saloni.\n\n\t“The Family Man” Season 3 will premiere exclusively on Prime Video on Nov. 21 in India and over 240 countries and territories worldwide.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

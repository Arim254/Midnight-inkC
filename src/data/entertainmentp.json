    "body": "\n\tFor more than four decades, Robert Kaplow has built an unconventional writing career. A novelist, longtime English teacher, radio essayist and East Coast lifer, Kaplow has spent his creative life obsessed with language — not just what words say, but how they sound, fade and linger. That obsession has now earned him his first Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay for “Blue Moon,” a wry, intimate biographical dramedy directed by Richard Linklater and starring Ethan Hawke as legendary lyricist Lorenz Hart. With it comes a permanent new prefix: Academy Award nominee.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s nice,” Kaplow says on the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast. “I feel like those words are going to be welded to my name forever. That isn’t a bad thing.”\n\n\n\tListen below!\n\n\tKaplow never wrote “Blue Moon” with awards in mind. “I felt it was a good piece of writing,” he says. “I wrote it as carefully as any novel I’d written. Every word mattered to me — not only the words, but the order of the words and the punctuation of the words.” That novelist’s precision is embedded in every beat of the screenplay, which values rhythm and implication over exposition.\n\n\tThe nomination marks a late-career milestone for Kaplow, 71, who never chased Hollywood in the traditional sense. He remained rooted in New Jersey, taught English for more than 30 years at Summit High School, wrote several novels and now serves as publisher of his local newspaper, the Metuchen Times. All the while, he quietly developed screenplays that favored character over spectacle. “Blue Moon,” which premiered at the Berlin Film Festival last February, fits squarely in that mold: a portrait of Hart’s final days, told not as a cradle-to-grave chronicle but as a compressed emotional reckoning.\n\t\n\n\t“It was freezing in Berlin,” Kaplow recalls. “But that was the first time I had ever seen the movie with an audience. What surprised me was hearing so much laughter in the room. I didn’t expect that.” The response affirmed something central to Kaplow’s conception of Hart — that comedy was not optional. “He made his living being the smartest guy in the room, the funniest guy in the room,” Kaplow says. “If you’re going to have his voice in the film, it had to be that.”\n\n\tYet the humor masks devastation. Beneath Hart’s wit lies abandonment, aging and the collapse of a 25-year partnership. The screenplay resists biopic convention, favoring restraint over grandeur and small behavioral choices over sweeping declarations.\n\n\tThat approach was sharpened through Kaplow’s collaboration with Hawke, whom he describes as both generous and relentlessly curious. Hawke arrived daily with ideas, often prefaced with self-deprecation. “He would come in saying, ‘This may be the worst idea ever, but …’ and then have 20 ideas — most of them really good,” Kaplow says. Hawke suggested restoring a cut monologue about the origins of “Blue Moon” to close the film, delivered as the camera drifts away from Hart at the bar. “This is a character who can’t stop talking,” Kaplow says. “Even when he’s been injured beyond belief, his instinct is still to be entertaining, to hold court.”\n\n\tHawke’s rigor extended to the most minor physical details. During early rehearsals of a pivotal coatroom scene, Kaplow recalls flagging that Hawke was touching his scene partner too often. “This guy is terrified of being physically repellent to her,” Kaplow told him. Hawke adjusted instantly. “In one second, he internalized it,” Kaplow says. “That’s transformation.”\n\n\tOn Jan. 22, 2026, Kaplow watched the Oscar nominations alone in his New Jersey home, fully expecting disappointment. “I thought I was going to eat the disappointment in private,” he admits. Instead, his name was called first. “I was astounded and delighted,” he says. “That somebody took the trouble to watch the film — and recognize there was some good writing going on here.”\n\n\tFor a writer who spent decades believing much of his work vanished into the ether, the recognition feels less like validation than revelation. “You think half the things you say just go into a black hole,” Kaplow says. “And so much of it didn’t.”\n\t\n\n\tHe’s working on two projects right now. “We’ll see which one takes flight.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEthan Hawke, as Lorenz Hart in “Blue Moon”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from his interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n\t\tWas the film always conceived as a comedy?\t\n\n\tI had a central character who had to be very funny and very entertaining. Lorenz Hart made his living being the smartest guy in the room, the funniest guy in the room, the most playful with language. If you’re going to have his voice in the film, it had to be that. But there’s also a subtext of loss. It’s the end of a 25-year friendship, the end of a lot of things. I was trying to navigate that line — him being funny and resilient, while sensing that just beneath the surface his heart is being annihilated.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you pitch the film to Richard Linklater?\t\n\n\tThank God I never had to pitch the film. Richard and I had worked together before on “Me and Orson Welles.” We were talking on the phone one day, and he asked what I was working on. I said I was writing about the last days of Lorenz Hart. He said, “I’m really interested in Lorenz Hart. Could I read that?” That was the pitch.\n\t\n\t\tWhen did Ethan Hawke become part of the conversation?\t\n\n\tI remember seeing Ethan once standing his ground in a room full of men who were all taller than he was, almost like a prizefighter. I’d already written a draft of the script, and I thought, this guy could play Lorenz Hart. Later, Richard showed him the script. We met for coffee in New York, talked for about an hour, and he hadn’t said whether he wanted to do it. Finally, I asked, “Do you think you could act this part?” He said, “I could act the fuck out of it.” That told me everything.\n\t\n\t\tHow much of Hart’s inner life was written directly into the script?\t\n\n\tIt’s there, but not spelled out. I didn’t put it in stage directions. Sometimes a line ends in an ellipsis instead of a period, because something is going on in his head. Ethan brought a tremendous amount to that. He was always asking why Hart says something, what he’s avoiding, what’s really hurting him.\n\t\n\t\tThe coatroom scene is devastating but restrained. How did you approach writing it?\t\n\n\tI knew it was going to be the big scene. It runs about 14 minutes, which is a nervy thing to do. The challenge was having her tell him the truth without wanting to devastate him. One word mattered — “How do you mean?” instead of “What do you mean?” One sounds naive. The other sounds like someone thinking through how to say something painful.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat was going through your mind on nomination morning?\t\n\n\tI was alone in the house watching on television. I fully expected to absorb the disappointment privately. Michael Barker, head of Sony Pictures Classics, had told me it was a long shot, but not impossible, which I assumed meant “impossible.” When my name was called first, I was astounded and delighted that someone took the trouble to watch the film and recognize the writing.\n\t\n\t\tWhat has surprised you most about the response?\t\n\n\tI’ve written novels and worked for NPR for years, and that work felt invisible compared to this. Suddenly, I was hearing from people I hadn’t spoken to in decades. Former students wrote saying they remembered learning about Lorenz Hart in my English class. As a teacher, you assume half of what you say disappears into a black hole. It turns out some of it didn’t.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve stayed rooted in New Jersey your entire life. Why?\t\n\n\tIt’s in my DNA. I was born in Newark, raised in Westfield and now live in Metuchen. I’m about 40 minutes from Manhattan and 40 minutes from Asbury Park. There’s a humility to New Jersey — you work hard, and if success comes, that’s great. If not, you’re still working for the joy of the work.\n\t\n\t\tWhat makes Ethan Hawke such a special collaborator?\t\n\n\tHis generosity. He loved this script and came in every day with ideas, always prefaced with humility. He never strong-armed me to change a line. He wanted to understand the character at the deepest level — why Hart says something, why he moves the way he does, what’s motivating him emotionally. That kind of commitment is rare, and it’s transformational.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tThose stalwarts holding out stubborn hope that Renny Harlin’s “Strangers” trilogy would end with more bang than whimper might choose the Who’s “Won’t Get Fooled Again” as their theme song after sitting through “The Strangers: Chapter 3.” Though it’s actually another vintage FM rock-radio classic, the Moody Blues’ “Nights in White Satin,” that provides the arguable high point here — if only because its use at a climactic moment provides the viewer a brief goosing of unintentional humor.\n\t\n\n\tOtherwise, this is an unconscionably lazy piece of work, the kind of movie that makes you marvel how people will put months of work into creating a feature film whose script seems to have been written in a few hours’ uninspired haste. If the two prior installments felt thin, to say the least, there was still the faith that it all had to be heading somewhere. No. 3, however, simply underlines that there were never enough ideas on tap to sustain more than a single episode, and a mediocre one at that. Bryan Bertino’s eerie 2008 original and Johannes Robert’s more conventional but effective 2018 “The Strangers: Prey at Night” now look positively masterful alongside these three tie-in footnotes, with whom they have almost no overlap save a trio of roaming masked killers. \n\n\n\tLast fall’s middle part — by default, the best of this recent lot — left heroine Maya (Madelaine Petsch) battered but alive in the Oregon hamlet of Venus, where everyone seems willing to sacrifice unlucky visitors to the bloodthirsty throuple. Her boyfriend (Froy Gutierrez) is dead, as well as several others, but she has just managed to terminate the homicidal spree of Pin-Up aka Shelly (Ema Horvath). That still leaves a furiously mourning Scarecrow and remaining female henchperson Dollface to hunt down their wounded quarry. Maya has learned by now to trust no locals, least of all aptly-named Sheriff Rotter (Richard Brake). She escapes him after a tense brief encounter with his son Gregory (Gabriel Basso), the likely face behind Scarecrow’s hood. But her travails are hardly over, even as a sibling is driving to the attempted rescue from Portland.\n\t\n\n\tRandomly tossed-in flashbacks offer backstory so rote, you might yearn for the 2008 film’s resistance to any explication whatsoever. Turns out Scarecrow and Pin-Up were bad kids, as in homicidal ones…just cuz. Residents decided to let them do their thing, so long as they restricted such activities to out-of-towners. That’s it — that’s the whole “mystery.” (As one short-lived figure nonsensically shrugs, this stuff is just what happens in a “fucked-up small town.”) There’s also a flashback to how they eventually acquired a third playmate. \n\n\tIf you’re going to suggest a smidgen of psychological insight to ground screen violence, it’s good to include some actual psychology, and character detail. But these figures are just blanks: Smirking children, smirking adults, bearing knives and axes. Alan R. Cohen and Alan Freedland’s screenplay doesn’t make the faintest attempt at etching motivation, beyond a general understanding that killers gonna kill. After all, this is a horror movie.\n\n\tYet nobody seems to actually care about making a horror movie. Harlin does stage a decent prologue (yet another flashback), which is routine in content but does provide one solid jump scare. Alas, for its remaining 75 minutes or so — excluding nearly ten minutes of final-credits crawl — “Chapter 3” barely manifests interest in its own by-numbers mayhem. Dramatic personae (including new arrivals played by Rachel Shenton, George Young and Miles Yekinni) are introduced in the most desultory fashion, then offed likewise. \n\n\tLast time around, the director managed a couple decent setpieces. Here, he appears to have given up. The performers do the best they can under the circumstances, but they’re operating in a vacuum where the filmmakers seem too unengaged to bother with building suspense, or even maintaining basic credibility. Conviction is entirely lacking. So, too, is any sense of fun. Just about the only thing that works of its own accord are shots in which those creepily old-fashioned masks get forefronted. They still cast a disquieting spell, as they first did 18 years ago, until inevitably that also goes flat.\n\n\tThere is absolutely nothing wrong with Jose David Montero’s cinematography, the sometimes atmospheric locations (like its predecessors, “3” was primarily shot in Slovakia), or Justin Burnett and Oscar Senen’s original score. All those factors and more might’ve heightened any scary movie that was at least making an effort. But in the end, this entire trilogy has found no raison d’etre, beyond the basic commercial one. (Which may also have failed: This critic was the lone customer at the opening-day multiplex screening.) It stretches material that wouldn’t overfill 90 minutes to 4.5 hours, arriving at no worthwhile destination and conveying scant excitement en route. It aims low…and still bunts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSavannah Guthrie was meant to be in Milan, Italy on Friday co-hosting the opening ceremony of the 2026 Winter Olympics. But that all changed over the weekend when her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, went missing. NBC commentators Mary Carillo and Terry Gannon kicked off the network’s Olympics coverage by sending well wishes to Guthrie.\n\n\t“We’re certainly without a very important and beloved member of our team tonight,” Gannon said of Guthrie right before NBC’s broadcast of the opening ceremony began. “She is dearly missed by everybody.”\n\t\n\n\t“She’s covered so many Olympics, and she loves it,” Carillo added. “Right now, of course, Savannah and her family are in unspeakable, unfathomable pain. We know that in the U.S., her extended family is legion. Savannah, my friend, it’s the same way here.”\n\n\n\tGannon concluded, “We send our love and prayers and all of our positive energy to Savannah tonight.”\n\n\tNBC announced before the Olympics began that Guthrie would be replaced by Carillo, a veteran sports journalist.\n\n\tNancy Guthrie has been missing since Jan. 31, when she was last seen at her Arizona residence. Local police and the FBI have been treating her disappearance as a possible kidnapping, now offering a $50,000 reward for any significant leads on where Nancy could be. They have not yet identified a suspect or person of interest in the case. \n\n\tOn Wednesday, Savannah Guthrie posted a video to Instagram in which she and her siblings pleaded with their mother’s kidnapper.\n\n\t“She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, and she needs it not to suffer,” Guthrie said. “We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 4, Episode 8 of “The Traitors,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tSince Season 4 of “The Traitors”",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 4, Episode 8 of “The Traitors,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tSince Season 4 of “The Traitors” premiered in early January, Colton Underwood has been under fire. The former Bachelor, who came out as gay in 2021, played a very intense game — something he admits! — but in turn, made quite a few enemies inside the castle.\n\n\tAs the episodes rolled out, Underwood started receiving a torrent of online bullying. While not the first, nor the only one on the cast to be subject to backlash, Underwood drew comments about his past. That only intensified after Michael Rapaport attacked him at the roundtable, saying, “Nobody in this room would be better at holding a secret than you,” seemingly citing Underwood’s closeted history: He led “The Bachelor” in 2019 and went on to have a long-term relationship with winner Cassie Randolph. In 2020, Randolph filed a restraining order against him for stalking and placing a tracker on her car, a lawsuit which she later withdrew by mutual agreement. The following year, Underwood came out as gay.\n\t\n\n\tThe former NFL player has since married and has a son. And when he went on “The Traitors,” the hate he received wasn’t about the game he played as a Faithful: It became personal quickly, with internet commenters reviving the allegations against him. The toxicity directed toward Underwood was one of the things that led Peacock to release a statement, urging fans to be respectful.\n\n\tAt the top of the eighth episode, Underwood was murdered by the remaining Traitors, Rob Rausch and Candiace Dillard Bassett — something he saw coming. Below, Variety speaks with Underwood about his journey on the show, how he feels about his gameplay — and where he stands today with the cast.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWere you shocked by the murder, or did you see it coming?\t\n\n\tI think at that point of the game, I knew the only way that I was going to make it to the end was to get recruited. So either I was getting recruited or getting murdered. If I was going to go out, I would rather have gone out murdered than banished, because I think part of the game and the fun of it is defending yourself at the roundtable and holding your own. And if you get banished, it means you didn’t do a good enough job at defending yourself. So if I went out, I always wanted to go out getting murdered.\n\t\n\t\tHow are you feeling now?\t\n\n\tI feel really proud of how I played the game. I was very intense. I get it. And I know people who are just meeting me for the very first time on camera were like, “Who is this dude?” I’m an ultimate competitor. I was also a superfan of the show. So there’s weirdly a part of me now that’s very excited to watch the rest of the season as a fan again, instead of the intensity in which I had to watch myself on that show. But I’m doing well. I’m in such a good place in my life where I’m happy and joyful. When I show up for my family, I’m not the same as what I am when I’m on television working. So I’m in a really good place.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s been terrible toxicity from the fandom this season, resulting in Peacock pleading with the audience to calm down. What’s that been like for you to experience?\t\n\n\tFirst and foremost, I want to say I’m proud of Peacock for standing up for the cast — the people, the human beings who are putting on a show for these fans. I think what makes “Traitors” so successful is all of the cast who are entering that castle have their own fans, and they have their own groups that are rooting for them and cheering for them. I totally understand the intensity of rooting and being upset when your player goes home. I think for me, personally, there were a few lines that got crossed with messages sent to me and things that were brought up lacking context and also lacking accuracy of my past — which, I will always and have taken accountability for. That was something that I wasn’t fully prepared to deal with six years later and at this stage of my life. But I do understand there are new fans, people meeting me for the first time. There are also people who watched my “Bachelor” season six years ago and then forgot about me, and then all of a sudden, this is jarring. Who is this dude? A lot of life has happened for me in six years — a lot of growth, a lot of self-work, and I’m in such a different place.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou’re not new to receiving backlash online, but did it feel different this time, with people bringing up the restraining order? How bad has it been?\t\n\n\tI focus on the positive, but you know me well, and I’m gonna shoot you very straight: An example of a message that I had to send to Peacock is after the Michael Rapaport comment, somebody told me to stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger and called me the F word in it. That’s crossing the line. If you don’t respect my gameplay, if you don’t like the character that I showed up as on “Traitors,” that is one thing, but to receive a message like that — to receive emails of my home address and referencing my child and my husband in it — that’s not OK. That’s too far. Like I said, I focus on the positive, but I also see comments. I see people, like I said before, that are saying things that just are completely inaccurate. And I have no interest in going tit for tat. I have no interest in fighting with people in the comments. But I think just understanding that there’s a lot of context left out in that part of my life.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCaroline Stanbury, Colton Underwood, Rob Rausch, Johnny Weir, Maura Higgins, Tiffany Mitchell and Candiace Dillard Basset \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEuan Cherry/Peacock\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a theory that you knew Rob was a Traitor; what do you think of that?\t\n\n\tI think that’s people trying to not give me credit for doing what I did. Was Rob my ally? Yes, he was my ally, and what I thought was a Faithful. The only mistake that Rob made that made my antennas go up was telling everybody that he had the dagger. That, for me, felt like a coverage play. And I was like, “Why is Rob doing this? Statistically speaking, one of us in this six is a Traitor. Why would he reveal his cards? Oh, he’s covering himself — for either somebody that’s not in this pack or somebody who is.” \n\n\tSo that was his only mistake in the game. I think Rob murdering me or allowing Candiace to murder me, was giving her her own shovel to dig her own grave. And I think it was brilliant. It was cutthroat. It was everything that “Traitors” is, and it was the best strategy move that I think I’ve ever seen in the game.\n\t\n\t\tRapaport said you guys have spoken and you’re fine now. How do you feel looking back at what he had said to you?\t\n\n\tThere’s a lot that always doesn’t get shown. What I would say about Michael is, I do feel like it was somewhat of a low-blow. When I came to the roundtable, I came with evidence, I kept it to the game. The furthest I would take it is, “Lisa is not the Lisa who I thought she would be.” I didn’t want to go into anybody’s antics or what I knew of them prior to the show. I just felt like that was inappropriate and not applicable to the game. I don’t think Michael’s a homophobe. He FaceTimed me after filming. We had a great conversation that I’m gonna let [him decide] if he wants to speak on it at the reunion. We moved past it. I forgave him. I’m someone who doesn’t want to hold grudges. I’ve also dealt with Michael Rapaports my entire life in locker rooms, where they’re fast talkers, they put their foot in their mouth and and they say things like that. I get it.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tHow do you feel about Lisa Rinna now?\t\n\n\tI love Lisa, and I think it was such an honor to go against her. I know she said this too, we were perfect nemeses for each other. I enjoy breaking the fourth wall a lot — we were making a television show. Of course, we’re playing a game. And I know people like to protect their bubbles, producers in “The Bachelor” hated when I always broke that fourth wall. But we’re there to entertain, and we get it; we’re gonna play heightened versions of ourselves. She said it, “You want a Housewife, I’ll give you a Housewife.” So I’m like, “Thank you! Let’s do this.” \n\n\tIt was fun for me. That’s when the adrenaline gets pumping. So, it was an honor, and we are in a good place, too. She said it on camera. She’s been in this industry for 36 years. I’m only 34, so I’m not super familiar with everything that she’s been in, but I do have so much respect for her career.\n\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom creating one monster to killing another, Christoph Waltz’s winter has been a horror show. \n\n\tThe 69-year-old Austrian Oscar winner played Henrich Harlander, Victor Frankenstein’s wealthy benefactor, in Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” which received nine Oscar nominations in January. He also stars in Luc Besson’s upcoming “Dracula” adaptation, in which he plays Van Helsing to Caleb Landry Jones’ titular bloodsucker. \n\t\n\n\tBut while there’s kismet to Waltz appearing in two stylish adaptations of classic monster novels, he admits he didn’t grow up reading either book. “I wasn’t into horror,” Waltz says in accented English. “Both ‘Frankenstein’ and ‘Dracula’ are not part of the German-speaking literary canon. So they were mostly movies to me. I was duly impressed by them, but I didn’t lose my self-control.” \n\n\n\tThere are parallels to be found between Waltz and his scary movies. While Dr. Frankenstein is analytical and ambitious, Dracula is all soul and romance; blend these two, and it approximates how Waltz approaches art and acting. Ask him a question that paints the art of acting in too lofty a light, and he’ll reframe it in workmanlike terms.\n\n\t“Are there any modern acting trends that interest you?” he’s asked. “No,” he replies.\n\n\tEvery word is deliberate with Waltz. He’s like your sharpest and most daunting college professor, eager to share his sage truths. If you can get on his wavelength, you’ll catch a twinkle in his eye. It’s an energy reminiscent of the scene that made him a star. While Waltz was a regular on German television, he took his first Hollywood role as Nazi Hans Landa in Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 war film “Inglourious Basterds.” The movie’s opening scene is a tense interrogation by Landa of a farmer who is hiding a Jewish family under the floorboards. Landa is relaxed in his questioning, considering every word, puffing his ornate pipe, his ease with the disintegrating situation making it more and more unbearable. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe role won him a best supporting actor Oscar, an award he’d win again three years later for Tarantino’s “Django Unchained.” In the years since, Waltz has taken on roles in high-profile films, often working with auteurs like Tim Burton, Alexander Payne and Walter Hill.\n\n\tIndeed, what drew Waltz to his current projects was the writer-directors behind them. Del Toro is known for his awards-friendly monster movies, like 2006’s “Pan’s Labyrinth” and 2017’s “The Shape of Water” — yet the Mary Shelley adaptation has long been his dream project. French filmmaker Besson is best known for bold, effects-laden blockbusters like 1997’s “The Fifth Element” and 2017’s “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.” His version of “Dracula” is filled with lush, expansive, blood-soaked visuals and leans into the erotic romance between the vampire and his young victim, Mina (Zoë Bleu). \n\n\t“I thought, ‘If anyone’s going to do Dracula with a new perspective, it’s Luc Besson,’” Waltz says. “I always want to work with great people. I was very flattered when he asked me. I didn’t really expect ‘Dracula’ to be up his alley, but it turned out to be a wonderful collaborative process.” \n\n\tIn turn, Besson says he’s equally im­pressed with Waltz’s technique and kindness on set. \n\n\t“He’s very minimalist in the role,” Besson says. “He doesn’t overact or anything. He’s very specific, very precise. The only way to get to this kind of performance is if you are so full of information and character that you don’t have to play it. And he’s so sweet with everyone. He’s helping everybody on the set; he’s a generous actor with others. That’s not always the case, so he helped me a lot.” \n\n\tJones agrees with Besson’s sentiment and says Waltz gives actors a blueprint to work with on set. “He’s prepared and ready in a way that I strive to be,” Jones says. “I feel like when I come to set, I’m still figuring so much of it out. When I look to Christoph, I feel like if I can get out of my own way and join him in the place that he’s at, then we might have something. I think when acting with someone of that caliber, you can’t help but rise, or you end up climbing up there without realizing it.” \n\t\n\n\tDespite the many adaptations of the novels, Waltz didn’t revisit any to keep his interpretation true to the originals. “I use the background, not other people’s foreground,” he says. “Sometimes it’s a little difficult. If you have an iconic performance like Bela Lugosi’s, that should not direct your thinking. So you take the script and then you go from there.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChristoph Waltz, playing the priest, Van Helsing, in Luc Besson’s “Dracula,” with David Shields,\nEwens Abid and Guillaume de Tonquédec\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVertical\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn both films, Waltz lands huge moments in a supporting role, something that’s been a constant throughout his career. Yet he doesn’t care to categorize gigs that way. “Every part is a leading part,” he says. “It may be for a second or two only, but when you have something to contribute, you’re leading. Categorizing for award reasons makes sense. Supporting a main part — especially if you get to play the antagonist — is a fantastic task.” \n\n\tWaltz has often played antagonists, facing classic protagonists like Tarzan, Pinocchio and James Bond. Much like the character that brought him instant fame, Waltz loves the gamesmanship that comes with a villainous turn. “It’s a conversation,” he says. “It’s like in life, in a relationship, in politics — the contradiction is an indispensable part of the whole. That’s one of the problems we’re living through right now. We refuse to accept contradictions. The contradiction makes the dynamic possible. It energizes.” \n\n\tWaltz’s thoughts about acting started at the Max Reinhardt Seminar, an elite drama school in Vienna. He later took classes in New York with legends Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler. Strasberg is largely seen as the father of Method acting, a practice that sometimes inspires actors to spend the entirety of their time on set in character, never letting their co-stars meet the performer underneath. Yet Waltz finds that behavior to be a misinterpretation of Strasberg’s teachings. “Frankly, everything is being ripped out of the context and inflated beyond recognition, and it’s acquired a completely different quality,” he says. “Strasberg himself said, ‘It’s just a method,’ meaning an approach to what you have to do with yourself. You’re not a robot programmed to follow ‘the Method.’ No, you learn basically what actors have been doing for hundreds of years.” \n\t\n\n\tWaltz keeps things simple when talking about his own method. How did he prepare to play the priest in “Dracula”? “I get up on time,” he says. “I show up on time. I have learned my lines, and I’m informed as to what the whole thing is supposed to be. Everything else follows from there. If you don’t know what it is that you’re doing, your urge to find out how to do it is going to be a lost cause.” \n\n\tThat focus on the fundamentals was what allowed Waltz to jump from European projects to his Hollywood start in “Basterds.” The actor knew the part could change the course of his career, but he kept focused on the process. “After a while, working in this business, you get a little bit of a feeling,” he says. “But I don’t strategize. Do I get a notion? Sure. Am I then acting on it — or acting even worse by acting out that notion? No, definitely not. I make a conscious effort not to do that.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWaltz transitioned to mostly English-language work because of the new opportunities afforded him. “Part of the reason why I wanted to venture out is because I thought, in the 20th century, you shouldn’t be confined,” he says. “If you can take an airplane and be on the other side of the world within half a day, you should be able to incorporate this experience into your development. Not specifically for acting purposes, just as a person. The world is pretty big.” \n\n\tLuckily, his accolades have allowed him to focus on scripts that speak to him, which Waltz says must have one key moment to spark his interest: “When an exchange is energized by real thought and insight into a topic,” he says, “it doesn’t have to be deep and philosophical; it can be quick and then flat and superficial. But it needs to have the thought and consideration behind it. As soon as I read that in a script, I’m interested.” \n\n\tWaltz balks when he’s asked to consider his career and its place in storytelling. “With increasing age, I get away from metaphysics. There is no truth, as such, hovering behind the world as we perceive it,” he says. \n\n\tBut pressed on the matter, he gestures to the heavens, searching for the perfect words to get close to an imperfect truth. “The job at hand is to make the story experience-able,” he says, “not just believable. You go to the movies to experience a momentary transformation of your existence. You need bodies for that. The actor is that body.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics kicked off on Friday with an unprecedentedly widespread opening ceremony. \n\n\tHeld in the two host cities and in several Alpine venues, the event is set to feature more than 1,000 performers — including Mariah Carey and Andrea Bocelli — who will celebrate Italian history, culture and fashion.\n\n\tMilan’s San Siro 75,000-seat stadium is the main venue for the two‑and‑a‑half‑hour live Olympic opener, expected to draw an audience of 2.2 billion globally. The ceremony is taking place amid tight security with thousands of Italian police officers, aided by surveillance drones and robots, patroling the area around the stadium where dozens of heads of state, including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will be watching the show.\n\t\n\n\tThe lead-up to the games has been marked by protests over the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who will not be in the streets but are instead there as security for Vance and Rubio, as well as a Russian cyberattack aimed at some Olympics-related websites and hotels. Tensions over the presence of ICE in Italy caused the official hospitality hangout space for the U.S. Olympic team in Milan to undergo a name change from The Ice House to The Winter House.\n\n\n\tVeteran Olympic ceremonies wizard Marco Balich, who is producing the opener, has built the multi-location show around the Greek concept of “harmony,” intended to bring together city and mountains, man and nature and the 2,900 athletes from cultures that share the Olympic space.\n\t\n\n\tBalich tells Variety that, unlike previous Olympic openers such as the star-studded Paris 2024 opener, “This is the first time we’re going to have a somber ceremony.” Olympics organizers are focusing on deploying less glitz and more ecological sustainability, while still generating lots of excitement.\n\n\tStill, Snoop Dogg is attending as a special correspondent for NBC’s coverage; and Sabrina Impacciatore, known to U.S. audiences for roles in “The White Lotus” and “The Paper,” will be performing a musical number retracing 100 years of the Winter Olympics.\n\n\tFor the the first time in Olympic history, two Olympic cauldrons — one at Milan’s Arco della Pace and one in Cortina’s Piazza Dibona — will be lit simultaneously. Also, the traditional Parade of Nations will be divided across four locations — Milan, Cortina, Livigno and Predazzo — with TV coverage weaving it all into a seamless narrative.\n\n\tRead on for the biggest moments from this year’s Winter Olympics opening ceremony, updating live.\n\t\n\t\tWelcome to Italy\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t06 February 2026, Italy, Mailand: Olympia, Olympic Winter Games Milan Cortina 2026, opening ceremony in Milan, San Siro, dancers from the Accademia del Teatro alla Scala perform during the opening ceremony under the motto “Armonia”.

Canova’s 18th century statue depicting the myth of Cupid and Psyche was brought to life on stage, intending to become symbolic tale of attraction, transformation, and union, visually embodying the concept of  “Armonia,” or “Harmony” in English, that organizers say is inspired by the word’s original Greek meaning of a harmony as a dialogue between diverse elements. \n\n\tThe piece, in which the stadium was transformed into a living museum, featured 70 young dancers from Milan’s Accademia del Teatro alla Scala. This segment showcased reproductions of four iconic works by Antonio Canova: the Venus Italica, the Genius of Death, the Bust of Paris, and the Naiad.\n\t\n\t\tItalian Harmony: Fantasia\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMatilda De Angelis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian actress Matilda De Angelis (C) performs during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games at the San Siro stadium in Milan, northern Italy, on February 6, 2026. (Photo by Piero CRUCIATTI / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tItaly’s Matilda De Angelis, who made her international acting breakthrough in Susanne Bier’s “The Undoing” – alongside Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant – took to the stage as an orchestra conductor and launched into what is being called a Symphony of Fantasia celebrating Italian creativity. The music shifted between different registers: from a trumpet reminiscent of Nino Rota’s film scores for Federico Fellini movies to a stadium choir, then from an Antonio Vivaldi aria to the pop music of the late Raffaella Carrà, the iconic Italian singer, actor, and dancer who was a TV sensation across Europe and Latin America. \n\t\n\n\tThe musical medley culminated in an electronic remix of of Gioachino Rossini’s opera “La Gazza Ladra” and ended with the aria “Vincerò” from Giacomo Puccini’s “Turandot,” performed by the late great Luciano Pavarotti, in a recorded version.\n\t\n\t\tGrand Parade/Mariah Carey Sings\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMariah Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUS singer Mariah Carey performs during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games at the San Siro stadium in Milan, northern Italy, on February 6, 2026. (Photo by WANG Zhao / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA grand parade of characters inspired by symbolic categories of Italian creativity through the ages culminated in Mariah Carey Carey, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colours on stage, performing entirely in Italian for the first time. Carey sang Domenico Modugno’s “Nel Blu, dipinto di Blu” – known internationally as “Volare.”\n\n\tWritten by Domenico Modugno and performed at the 1958 Sanremo Festival, “Volare,” with its famous refrain – “volare! oh, oh!” – marked a milestone in the history of Italian song, becoming a global phenomenon and winning two Grammy Awards, an unprecedented achievement for Italian music at the time. Carey’s “Volare” performance was conceived as a symbolic gesture, again underscoring the event’s “harmony” theme and the ambition to highlight local culture while giving the broadcast global appeal. \n\n\tCarey segued from “Volare” into her hit single “Nothing is Impossible” from the 2025 studio album “Here For It All.”\n\t\n\t\tPresidential Entrance, Followed By Giorgio Armani Tribute\t\n\n\tThe President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Kirsty Coventry, took their seats in the San Siro grandstand.\n\n\tTheir symbolic grand entrance was followed by a fashion show inspired by the Italian flag and based on one of Armani’s last drawings before he died at 91 last September.\n\n\tThree groups of models walk the runway wearing Armani creations in green, white, and red, transforming the Italian flag into a living image. It’s a moment of collective recognition, a tribute to Italian fashion and the timeless elegance of one of its most celebrated figures.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Models wearing creations designed by Giorgio Armani walk during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy.

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tAs tax season approaches, small business owners across the U.S. are preparing for one of the most administratively demanding times of the year. Between year-end reporting, employee tax forms and compliance deadlines, payroll management can quickly become one of the most complex parts of running a growing company. Financial software giant Intuit is positioning its QuickBooks Payroll platform as a solution for entrepreneurs looking to simplify those responsibilities during the busy filing period.\n\t\n\n\tThe company is currently offering new customers 50% off the first three months of QuickBooks Payroll, a promotion timed to coincide with tax season, when many businesses reassess their accounting and payroll workflows. The offer reflects a broader trend among small-business software providers emphasizing automation and integrated financial tools to reduce manual administrative work.\n\n\n\tDesigned to work alongside Intuit’s QuickBooks accounting ecosystem, QuickBooks Payroll automates wage calculations, tax deductions and payroll tax filings, helping business owners avoid common compliance errors and missed deadlines. The software allows employers to run payroll in minutes while keeping financial records, benefits tracking and tax documentation centralized in one platform — a feature that has become increasingly important as small teams operate with limited administrative staff.\n\n\tPayroll automation tools have grown in popularity in recent years, particularly among startups and independent businesses navigating evolving tax requirements and remote or hybrid workforces. Intuit has continued expanding its small-business services portfolio as competition intensifies in the financial-software market, where companies are racing to offer end-to-end solutions that combine accounting, payments, payroll and tax preparation.\n\t\n\n\tFor newer businesses hiring their first employees — or established companies scaling operations — QuickBooks Payroll also includes access to payroll experts and compliance resources intended to help owners manage changing regulations with greater confidence.\n\n\tThe limited-time promotion allows new users to test the platform at a reduced cost during one of the most operationally demanding times of the year. After the three-month promotional period, standard subscription pricing resumes depending on the selected payroll plan.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLong-running Canadian powerhouse Nettwerk Music Group has announced a management buyout from its existing investors, supported by Create Music Group. The transaction is expected to close this month.\n\n\tAs part of the proposed agreement, Create Capital will invest over $300 million into Nettwerk on closing and will provide access to substantial follow-on capital and support services thereafter, according to the announcement. “This investment will allow the Nettwerk management team to increase its ownership stake while enabling Nettwerk to retain its identity and independence in the market,” it continues. “Nettwerk will continue to serve its current roster of talented artists [and] remain committed to signing and nurturing new talent.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Nettwerk leadership team will continue to manage day-to-day operations, signings and artist development efforts, with support from Create’s platform.\n\n\n\tNettwerk was co-founded over 40 years ago by Terry McBride and his longtime business partner Mark Jowett. McBride, whose early career in artist management for acts including Coldplay and Avril Lavigne, grew the company into a record label and publisher. Today, Nettwerk’s roster includes Paris Paloma, Passenger, Leisure, SYML, Mon Rovîa and many more.\n\n\tThe partnership with Create Music Group provides Nettwerk with access to infrastructure, global distribution networks and label services. In addition, Create Capital will offer Nettwerk access to follow-on financing to support the company’s continued growth and investment in its frontline operations.﻿\n\n\t“We’re excited about this next chapter in Nettwerk’s journey,” said Terry McBride, co-founder and CEO of Nettwerk. “Partnering with Create allows us to continue to build on our foundation, grow our capabilities, and provide even more value to the artists we represent — while staying true to our roots as an artist-focused, independent Canadian label.”\n\t\n\n\t“Terry and his team at Nettwerk have built one of the most enduring and influential independent music companies in the modern era,” said Create Music Group CEO and co-founder Jonathan Strauss. “We are excited to put all of the resources at our disposal behind Terry and his management team to fuel Nettwerk’s continued global growth.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tAt this point, it’s old news that cable has become all but obsolete in the age of streaming. With the dominance of streamers such as Hulu, Disney+ and Max, many people have dumped their expensive cable and satellite TV subscriptions in favor of on-demand viewing. \n\n\tBut for live sports and events (like the 2026 Winter Olympics) there is still the occasional need for broadcast TV. While there are live TV streamers such as Peacock, DirecTV and Sling, which will all live stream this year’s Games on NBC, the most affordable way to access broadcast TV is through an indoor TV antenna.\n\n\n\tThe best indoor TV antennas allow you to pull dozens of TV channels in for free, making it the best way for cable-cutters to access network TV. NBC is the official broadcaster of the Milan Olympics and every indoor antenna pulls in a local NBC affiliate feed. What that means: buy the digital antenna once and you can have access to free NBC for as long as you own the unit.\n\n\tMost digital TV antennas also receive channels like ABC, CBS, FOX and PBS, in addition to networks like CW, Telemundo and ION. Channel selection will vary of course, depending on where you live and the signal strength.\n\n\tUnlike the antennas of the past, these new TV antennas don’t require hazardous mounting on rooftops or windows, and all of picks below are no bigger than a binder or shoebox. The installation process is also hassle-free; just face the antenna towards your local tower, plug it in and let it scan for channels. A good indoor antenna provides multiple mounting options, including 3m adhesive stickers, power-grip suction cups, or mounting screws, ensuring versatility in positioning.\n\n\n\tHere are some of the best indoor TV antennas to buy this year to let you watch the Winter Olympics at home and beyond.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTOP PICK\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital TV Indoor Long Range Smart Antenna\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThis Amazon antenna offers long-range reception, capable of receiving TV signals up to an impressive 200 miles, and includes signal amplifiers to ensure the best reception in any location within your home.

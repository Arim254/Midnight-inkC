    "body": "\n\tGuillermo del Toro reunited with “Crimson Peak” costume designer Kate Hawley to help bring the look of “Frankenstein” to life.\n\n\tWhen Hawley got the call, as a lover of the romantics and former art history student, the first thing she did was leap back into the pages of the book.\n\n\tBut Hawley admits, “Knowing that we were going on the journey with Guillermo meant a whole lot of wonderful things: trepidation as well as excitement.”\n\t\n\n\t“Frankenstein” stars Oscar Isaac as a brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a Creature (Jacob Elordi) to life in an experiment as he tries to conquer death. It’s an experiment that leads to his undoing, and begs the question, who is the monster?\n\n\tMia Goth also stars as Elizabeth. Ralph Ineson is Professor Krempe and Chrstoph Watlz plays Harlander. The cast also includes Felix Kammerer, Lars Mikkelsen, David Bradley, Christian Covery and Charles Dance, who plays Victor’s father.\n\n\tThe film is set firmly during the Crimean War in the 1850s. Hawley says del Toro was “very clear that he wanted this world to be bigger and larger than normal.”\n\n\tHere, Hawley breaks down the character looks she created.\n\n\tVictor Frankenstein\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen it came to crafting his looks, del Toro had no shortage of references for Hawley. “There were a lot that we discussed. There were the more contemporary references of David Bowie, and Oscar, who mentioned Prince.”\n\n\tThe initial childhood of Victor Frankenstein lends itself more to that age of enlightenment. Hawley says, “It’s definitely a nod more to the world and time period of Mary Shelley herself.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen the film hits the 1850s, Hawley says there was a broader sweep of the period. del Toro was clear he didn’t want a historical film with “lots of black top hats. I want a modern sensibility which is very much what was happening during the war in terms of technology and the time.”\n\n\tAdditionally, Hawley looked at Lord Bryon, “He’s an artist finding his muse. He’s not a scientist in the way that we traditionally know it, this is art that he’s building. We looked at all those references with bohemian irreverence and the way he wears his clothes.”\n\n\tVictor comes from the aristocracy. When audiences first see him, he’s presenting his invention in a theater. Hawley wanted to tell a story about the thick velvet he wears, but also show that a period of time had passed.\n\n\t“The velvets are old and worn. There’s a story being told of someone who’s sort of run out of money at this point, but he still has these lovely garments left over.”\n\n\tAs he gives his presentation, he meets Harlander, and the two begin a courtship. Frankenstein enjoys the money. “His clothes become more flamboyant,” says Hawley.\n\n\tElizabeth’s Wedding Dress\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHawley knew the importance of Elizabeth’s wedding dress. She links the entire story together. In crafting the character’s arc, Hawley says it was one of the first things she created.\n\n\t“It had its own pressures,” Hawley admits, knowing there would be the history of Frankenstein’s bride, but also having to make the dress work within the confines of the Victorian world. Elizabeth’s wedding to Victor’s brother, William, comes towards the final act of the film. By this point, she has formed a bond with the Creature. To reflect that, Hawley notes, “Elizabeth’s clothes in this stage in particular start echoing the world of the Creature more than the other world.”\n\n\tThe bodice was the Swiss style of the time, with boning and a pointed bottom, while the ribbons on the arms and corsetry “suggest the skeletal components of the Creature itself.” Hawley adds, “We’re going back to the anatomical language.”\n\n\tAll of Elizabeth’s gowns are tied to botany and the natural world.\n\n\tHer blue dress was based on the form of an X-ray. “We developed (an x-ray) as a print that also suggests a bit of the Victorian damask but feels part of the world and anatomy that we use a lot within patterns, textures and motifs.”\n\t\n\n\tIt took a few months for Hawley and her team to put together because it was going to be used for a nighttime scene. “We had to do a huge amount of work within the layers to keep the saturation of blue that Guillermo wanted.” For Hawley, the dress evokes the ephemeral, ethereal nature of Elizabeth. As for the fabric, she confirms “there were at least 60 meters in the skirt.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMia Goth as Elizabeth in “Frankenstein.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKen Woroner/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tParternship with Tiffany’s\n\n\tHawley calls it her personal fairy tale. In crafting Elizabeth’s jewelry, the company invited her to go behind the doors of the Tiffany archive.\n\n\tHawley worked with the company to pull pieces from the company’s 200 year old history.\n\n\tAmong the items were the Wade Necklace, worn by Elizabeth, with over 40 carats of diamonds, and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Scarab necklace.\n\n\t“This huge, wonderful resource became available to us, and all the language of these elements started fitting our storyline.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Creature\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJacob Elordi as The Creature in “Frankenstein.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKen Woroner/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Creature goes through an evolution. When he wakes up after the lab explosion, one of the first items he retrieves is a coat from the the burial ground of a Crimean War soldier. Hawley says, “As he goes through his travels and as he experiences warmth and love, he’s a constant, evolving metamorphosis in clothing alone.”\n\n\tWhen audiences first sees him, Hawley describes him as a “naked child underneath.” And so she started from the inside out, echoing what prosthetics artist Mike Hill was doing in his sculpting. “My job was to echo it and to keep the value of the Creature coming through the clothes. So when he picks the coat up off the skeleton, the imprint of the other man is still there.” She adds, “I thought that was such a beautiful image, having the imprint or the memory of another body, given that the Creature is made up of other bodies, it was a motif.”\n\n\tWatch the video above.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWe’re now in the thick of the fall movie season, but you wouldn’t know it from how skimpy the box office is, or how muted the chatter. Simply put: Where have all the indie hits gone?\n\n\tNot so long ago, the slate of buzzy, critically acclaimed prestige movies that opened during the fall added up to something like the indie version of blockbuster season. There’s a reason the movie calendar was arranged that way. Critically acclaimed films tended to open in the last part of the year because that’s when they did well. And the trend crystallized in the ’90s, when Harvey Weinstein transformed the old awards season into the awards-industrial complex (welcome to your life, actors and directors who now have to spend five months on the road-to-the-Oscars campaign trail).\n\t\n\n\tBut the days when a buzzy fall movie could be a box-office bonanza are starting to look like a weirdly distant memory. The flameout has been creeping up for a while, ever since the pandemic produced its unhappy paradigm shift in moviegoing (i.e., more and more folks don’t like going). You could see it in the disconnect between praise and popularity that greeted such films as “Tár,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” and, last year, “Anora” — which crawled its way to $20 million, though that was a sobering reminder that in the indie-film world, $20 million is the new $50 million.\n\n\n\tThis fall, however, it has seriously begun to look like the bottom is falling out. One high-profile, high-prestige film after another has opened to a deafening thud at the box office, and the failures are so varied that each movie tends to come with its own elaborately tailored excuse.\n\t\n\n\t“After the Hunt“? People didn’t want to see an anti-“woke” academic thriller starring Julia Roberts as a pill of a professor. “The Smashing Machine“? People didn’t want to see Dwayne Johnson in a serious role, looking like the Hulk’s damaged cousin, in a movie that felt like a staged documentary. “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere”? People didn’t want to see an “art-house” music biopic about the making of the Boss’s most austere record. And “Christy,” which is opening to the usual so-so grosses this weekend? People were more interested in scrutinizing Sydney Sweeney’s jeans commercial than they are in seeing her acclaimed performance in a gritty empowering boxing biopic.\n\n\tAnd then there’s “Bugonia,” the most exciting movie of the bunch. It will have earned $12.5 million at the end of its second wide-release weekend — in other words, it’s no “Poor Things” (the previous, highly successful collaboration between Emma Stone and director Yorgos Lanthimos), but just maybe it will wind up joining the $20-is-the-new-$50-million club.   \n\n\tWhat, exactly, is going on? Is indie film dying on the vine? I think that’s an overstatement, but before we get to the larger meaning of it all (and yes, there are signs of hope at the end of the rainbow), let’s run through the reasons this is happening.\n\n\tThe rise of streaming. Speaks for itself, at this point. People no longer need to go out to the movies because the movies are coming to them.\n\n\tThe closing of windows. If it took longer for films to move from theaters to home viewing, there would be more incentive to see them. The collapse of the window has been a Hollywood catastrophe. But can the industry collectively reverse course?\n\n\tTheaters suck. An overhyped factor, in my book. But we all know the litany of gripes (the floors are scuzzy, people are on their phones, the trailers last 35 minutes, and there’s now less of an avid populated hum to the whole experience).\n\n\tTV is the new indie film. Quality television, and even not-so-quality television, now fills the space that indie films used to.\n\n\tIt’s part of Netflix’s business plan to rob us of hits. I think “Frankenstein,” like “Nosferatu,” would have been a major hit in movie theaters. And “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery”? A no-brainer — it’s the best “Knives Out” movie yet. “A House of Dynamite”? I’m not a fan, but everyone’s talking about it. It should have been in theaters.\n\t\n\n\tDoes the film-festival “blast-off” still matter? This year’s slate of buzzy Sundance movies, when released, has been barely visible. (Sorry, “Sorry, Baby,” but the world hardly knew you existed.) From “Eleanor the Great” to “Eddington,” the 2025 Cannes films have been met with a meh response (though “Sentimental Value” may prove a different story). Same for the Venice titles. Yet the one major prestige hit of the fall, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” didn’t even play at a festival. Is there a message here?\n\n\tI think there’s a major message nestled in all of this, but it’s not about festivals, or streaming, or any of the other factors listed above. It’s about the kinds of movies that people are making. It’s a message that should echo through the indie-film world: If you build it, they will not come — unless you build it the right way.\n\n\tThere have been a small handful of daring and original movies that are hits this year, and what that adds up to is a story. A story about storytelling. Those hits are Celine Song’s “Materialists,” which had the audacity to be a romantic comedy about the real live current dating world; “One Battle After Another,” which is such an up-to-the-minute X-ray of what’s happening in America that it hits you like a thunderbolt; and, I predict, “Marty Supreme” (opening Dec. 25), Josh Safdie’s existential ping-pong thriller, starring a ferociously committed Timothée Chalamet — a movie that’s like “Uncut Gems” remade as a crowd-pleaser.\n\n\tHere’s the message of those films. In a world of faltering attention spans and blockbuster numbness, indie filmmakers need to start thinking more about the audience. Not in a cautious, lame, pandering way but in a bold and adventurous way. They need to meet what the marketplace is telling them. They need to start thinking like entertainers again.\n\n\tIt may sound like I’m making a reactionary argument, or doing one of those anti-art-film polemics. But I’m not. This is what Hollywood, at its greatest, has always stood for. This is what the New Hollywood of the ’70s stood for. This is what the ’90s indie-film revolution, incarnated by Quentin Tarantino, stood for. This is what “Materialists” and “One Battle After Another” and (mark my words) “Marty Supreme” stand for. \n\t\n\n\tThere needs to be a place for small and highly idiosyncratic movies. No question. But if indie film is going to save itself, it’s going to have to get busy remembering that movies, before they do anything else, need to lift us out of ourselves. They need to reach for danger, for beauty, for the third rail of reality, for a higher love. And they need to start doing it now.\n\n\tThe stakes are too high.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeremy Renner has denied allegations of harassment levied against him by filmmaker Yi Zhou, who claims that the actor sent her “personal and intimate photographs of himself” and exhibited disturbing behavior on one occasion that prompted her to lock herself in a room.\n\n\t“The allegations being made are totally inaccurate and untrue,” a rep for Renner told Variety.\n\n\tRenner’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.\n\t\n\n\tZhou, 37, first levied claims against Renner on Monday with a series of Instagram posts, including the hashtags “#Cancel” and “#CancelJeremyRenner.” Zhou claims she began dating Renner after he contacted her in June by sending “a string of unwanted/unsolicited pornographic images of himself via DM and Whatsapp” and then “seduced” her by “loving me so much I believed in him/the power of love.” She also claims that she has been contacted and “destroyed by a set up [of] smear fans campaigns.”\n\n\n\t“This experience really shows the dark side of Hollywood and the smear campaign to deter women and Asian female filmmakers and women in general,” Zhou wrote in another post. “I’m appalled but happy to read also many support from friends and media that will continue to uncover domestic abuse, abuse of women and the unwanted unsolicited porn attack against innocent young women.”\n\n\tSpeaking to the Daily Mail on Thursday, Zhou expounded on her allegations. She claimed that she was with Renner on the evening of Aug. 20 to discuss a documentary project. Renner allegedly consumed a bottle of wine. Zhou characterized Renner as “violent” in a text that she claims to have sent to another party on the evening. Zhou alleged that she resorted to locking herself in a room out of fear.\n\t\n\n\tPrior to Zhou’s allegations against Renner, the pair had been reported to be working together across a series of projects. Zhou is directing the documentary “Chronicles of Disney,” about the legacy and history of the studio, in which Renner is interviewed as a talking head. The film, which is not being produced by Disney itself, is also reported to feature costume designer Mark Bridges and makeup artist Bill Corso.\n\n\tRenner is also a voice actor in Zhou’s “Stardust Future: Stars and Scars,” which claims to be the first animated feature entirely created by AI. Per Variety, the film had set its sights on an awards-qualifying theatrical release for November, with a portion of revenue to be donated to Renner’s charity Rennervation Foundation.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter working as a lawyer trying to save Saul Goodman in Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould’s “Better Call Saul,” it’s now Rhea Seehorn’s turn to save the world in Apple TV’s “Pluribus.” \n\n\tIn the new sci-fi drama, Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, an author who must save the world from happiness after an unexplained virus is unleashed. After previously working with Gilligan on “Better Call Saul” for seven years, Seehorn was approached with the opportunity to be the lead in “Pluribus,” which originally was written for a male lead character, but was quickly changed.\n\t\n\n\t“Vince [Gilligan] is always trying to write without preaching an answer. He does not tell the audience what to think, and he trusts the intelligence of fans,” Seehorn told Variety at the “Pluribus” premiere in Los Angeles. “I feel like for me as a woman specifically playing this role, one thing that I got really interested in was that a woman’s anger is seen as a detriment and having dire consequences. But then, it’s this special quality that makes her different. That was very interesting to me as somebody that suppresses my anger, and I really loved exploring somebody that is impulsive and reactive, and then dealing with the obstacle of being told there are dire consequences.”\n\n\n\t“I created ‘Pluribus’ for Rhea Seehorn and because I wanted to work with her again,” revealed Gilligan on the red carpet. “I was very selfish. I knew that she is such a wonderful actor that people would snap her right up and put her in a movie or a TV show, and I wouldn’t get to work with her for a while.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the production, Gilligan teamed up with previous writers, directors, cinematographers and more that previously worked on “Breaking Bad” to help create the world of “Pluribus.” “I like working with people I worked with before, and I like working with my crew behind the camera too,” Gilligan said. “I’ve worked with some of these people for almost 20 years, going back to the beginning of ‘Breaking Bad,’ and they’re just a great bunch of people. To me, it’s like working with a family that you really get along well with.”\n\n\tActress Karolina Wydra hopes that audience members will identify and relate to her character, Zosia, and Carol as they navigate a new world based in optimism. “With Carol, she’s such a strong female character that is a reluctant hero, but she’s a hero who fights for something that she truly believes in. There’s an empowerment in that. For Zosia, her kindness and her sereneness has something inside that is so stunning and beautiful.” \n\n\tThe first two episodes of “Pluribus” are available on Apple TV.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe sci-fi sequel “Predator: Badlands” is opening atop the theatrical food chain, while a bunch of adult-skewing wide releases like Jennifer Lawrence’s “Die My Love,” Sydney Sweeney’s “Christy” and Russell Crowe and Rami Malek’s “Nuremberg” are debuting further down the charts. \n\n\tThe “Predator” entry got to the chopper with $15.6 million across Friday and preview screenings in 3,725 locations. That puts it on the path to land well ahead of its pre-weekend projections, which had forecast an opening from $25 million to $30 million. As a comp, “Alien: Romulus” — another Disney revival of a sci-fi property that it acquired in the 20th Century Fox merger of 2019 — earned $42 million in its August 2024 debut.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking of “Alien,” “Predator: Badlands” even has an outside shot at the biggest theatrical bow ever for the “Predator” franchise if it overachieves Saturday. The record is held by the 2004 crossover “Alien vs. Predator” ($38 million). But it’s worth noting that the “Predator” series has been out of theaters in recent years. The last two entries — the 2022 prequel “Prey” and this year’s animated anthology “Predator: Killer of Killers” — debuted directly on Hulu and Disney+. Director Dan Trachtenberg, who helmed both of those features, returned for the PG-13-rated “Badlands,” which stars newcomer Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi as a young Predator outcast and Elle Fanning as his legless android companion.\n\n\n\tDisney spent $105 million on producing “Predator: Badlands,” plus more on marketing expenses. It’s a considerable budget, but far less than the $180 million that the studio put towards its recent sci-fi flop “Tron: Ares.” “Badlands” will outperform the $33 million opening weekend of “Ares,” plus it has better reviews to boost word-of-mouth in the weeks ahead. Audiences liked it too, as moviegoer survey firm Cinema Score polled an “A-” grade from early crowds.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the weekend’s other new wide releases, Amazon MGM Studios’ “Sarah’s Oil” is faring the best, heading to a fourth-place bow after earning $1.7 million across Friday and previews in 2,410 locations. Projections are at $4.4 million for the weekend. The early-1900s-set and PG-rated drama, about one of the first Black women to become a millionaire, comes from Wonder Project and Kingdom Story. Not many critics have reviewed it, though CinemaScore turned in the highest marks possible with an “A+” grade.\n\n\tSony Pictures Classics has the historical courtroom drama “Nuremberg” in 1,802 locations after premiering it at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. It’s in the race for fifth. Grosses hit about $1.4 million across Friday and previews. Reviews lean positive for the James Vanderbilt-directed period piece, though it’s hardly a critical darling. SPC acquired rights from producers Walden Media and Bluestone Entertainment in June.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Mubi has Lynne Ramsay’s “Die My Love,” starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, in 1,983 locations. It’s the widest release ever for the indie-focused banner, which bowed “The Substance” in 1,949 theaters last year for a $3.2 million debut. That horror movie legged out to $17 million domestic and $77 million worldwide, becoming a significant awards season force along the way.\n\n\tHere’s hoping Mubi has a similar long-term vision for “Die My Love,” which earned roughly $1 million across Friday and previews. It’s a slim start considering the company acquired the starry drama for $24 million, in what was the most high-profile deal out of this year’s Cannes Film Festival. General audiences didn’t go for the arthouse title, with CinemaScore turning in a terrible “D+” grade.\n\n\tIn danger of opening outside the top 10, Black Bear Pictures is making its maiden voyage as a distributor with its release of “Christy,” starring Sydney Sweeney as boxer Christy Martin. Playing in 2,011 locations, the drama had a very quiet start, with roughly $670,000 across Friday and previews. Black Bear has looked to position “Christy” as a best actress Oscar contender, kicking off with a festival premiere at Toronto. Much like “Nuremberg,” reviews are respectable but hardly superlative. Audiences liked the movie at a “B+” grade from CinemaScore.\n\t\n\n\tSecond place looks to go to Paramount’s drama “Regretting You,” earning another $2.2 million on Friday and projecting a $7.3 million third weekend for a slim 7% drop. The Colleen Hoover adaptation has shown good holds since its opening and looks to hit a $38 million total domestic gross through Sunday.\n\n\tIn third, Universal’s “Black Phone 2” earned $1.5 million on Friday and is projecting $5.2 million for its fourth outing, down just 38% from its prior frame. The Blumhouse sequel looks to hit a total domestic gross of $70 million through Sunday, pacing a touch behind its 2022 predecessor ($72 million through four weekends).\n\n\tFocus Features’ kidnap thriller “Bugonia” is vying for fifth, earning $1.1 million on Friday and projecting $3.7 million for its second weekend of wide release (down 26%). The Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone reunion should hit a $12.5 million domestic total through Sunday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for Guillermo del Toro‘s “Frankenstein,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tGuillermo del Toro has often said that Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel “Frankenstein” is like his Bible. Now, he’s brought his vision to life with the release of his own film adaptation on Netflix, starring Oscar Isaac as mad genius Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the Creature.\n\n\n\tOf course, Shelley’s story is one of the most adapted tales of all time, spurring classic monster flicks like James Whale’s 1931 movie — in which the Creature was portrayed as it’s perhaps best known, a green-hued monster with a flat head and bolts in its neck — as well as more faithful retellings of the original text like Kenneth Branagh’s 1994 take “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.” \n\t\n\n\tThough del Toro made it clear that his “Frankenstein” may not be the most accurate adaptation — the character of Elizabeth (played by Mia Goth) is essentially reinvented, Victor has been given a new backstory and characters like Victor’s friend Henry Clerval and servant Justine Moritz are eliminated — he instead set out to capture the novel’s heart. \n\n\t“The usual discourse of Frankenstein has to do with science gone awry,” del Toro told Variety in a cover story in August. “But for me, it’s about the human spirit. It’s not a cautionary tale: It’s about forgiveness, understanding and the importance of listening to each other.”\n\n\tSo, just how well does del Toro’s version stack up against Mary Shelley’s original novel? We asked Julie Carlson, an English professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and an expert on the British Romantic period and the Wollstonecraft-Godwin-Shelley family, for her thoughts.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your initial reaction to the film — did you enjoy it?\t\n\n\tI did. I always like when serious artists take serious work seriously. I did feel, certainly in comparison to other renditions, there was real love for the book and for Mary Shelley’s brilliance. It was more faithful to the framed narrative, to the ways that Victor and the Creature get to tell their own story. And also, I thought it did a good job of capturing the language in the book. The Creature, at times, is very lyrical — not as lyrical as in the book, but still it’s clear there’s all kinds of philosophical pronouncements going on. \n\t\n\t\tDel Toro’s film adds to Victor’s backstory by making his father a physician who abused him (and possibly let his mother die in childbirth so he could experiment on her). How does this shift affect the story’s themes?\t\n\n\tIt’s less about hubris, although of course that’s there, and more about shame. The way the father slaps [Victor] around when he can’t learn his lessons, and then he strikes the Creature when the Creature doesn’t learn as quickly as he wants him to — I think that’s interesting. It seemed to me there was a little less Faustian stuff about knowledge and power, and more about knowledge and shame and not living up to the name Victor or his father’s reputation. And that’s what he says [to his father]: You failed, because the mother dies, and I’m going to beat you [in cheating death]. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein in “Frankenstein.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKen Woroner/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne of the characters del Toro takes the most liberties with is Elizabeth. Instead of being engaged to Victor like in the book, she is betrothed to his younger brother William, who is grown up instead of a young child. What do you make of this?\t\n\n\tThe Elizabeth stuff is very different. Of course, in these days, I think it would have to go in that direction. She’s quite passive in the book; she doesn’t have much to do. Here, she’s very independent, she’s a scientist herself, an entomologist. It seemed to me that this was one of those moments where [del Toro] is really in the book, because there is a kind of throwaway line where Victor describes Elizabeth as “playful as an insect.” And so, it was very interesting that that’s her passion in the film. In general, people whitewash that line and say it means she was flitting around [like an insect]. But that’s another thing about the book that the film touches on, where Shelley gets much more at the ways in which [Victor] is lying to himself as well as to everybody else. And Elizabeth in the film points that out a couple times, especially when he comes to wish her and William well at the marriage and she says basically, “No you don’t.” So she, in the film, articulates Victor’s kind of delusional qualities in the sense of the need to present himself a certain way.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s also been much discussion about Elizabeth’s relationship with the Creature in del Toro’s film. In the book, they never meet until he murders her on her wedding night to Victor out of revenge. In the movie, they interact several times, she’s the only one to show him empathy and eventually dies protecting him. Did you find the connection between them to be romantic and do you think that diminishes Shelley’s message at all?\t\n\n\tI think she identifies with him. One of the first things she says to him is, “Are you hurt?” Yes, there’s a real connection, but it’s not so eroticized for me. She does say, when she’s dying, “Love is brief; I am glad I found it with you.” So maybe, yeah, it skirts those edges. But I think a couple of times she says, “I’m odd,” because she’s an entomologist and no one understands her. So I think there is a sympathy between the Creature and Elizabeth that is about being a subordinated figure. It’s hard to take it as seriously in the film, just because she’s an aristocrat, but I think that’s more the connection. For Mary Shelley, it’s such a patriarchal world in the book. All the women — the mother, Elizabeth and Justine — are basically just sacrificed to patriarchy. And I like that del Toro doesn’t try to make it quite so heavy-handed like that. But I think that’s part of what their connection is.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJacob Elordi as the Creature and Mia Goth as Elizabeth in “Frankenstein.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAs you mentioned, a large theme in the book is the persistent violence against women and unfair treatment of oppressed people. Did you feel this was still communicated in the film?\t\n\n\tI think the film downplays what was so strong in Shelley’s “Frankenstein”: the social critique. [The film] is a structural critique. It’s more about war, militarism, capitalism — which is fine, I mean that is something we need to be worried about. But in the book and in other films, the sympathy for the Creature is about how nobody can stand him because of how he looks. It’s about how people read you. And the film doesn’t do that, certainly not at the beginning. In the book, Victor runs away as soon as the Creature opens his eyes because he’s so horrified. [In the movie], he parents for a while and only leaves when he gets frustrated. So in a certain way, that would not be true to the book, but [it is] in the way that Shelley is really thinking about maternity, paternity and what one owes to one’s progeny, whether it’s a book or a baby. But the way that “Frankenstein” often is read is about the socially oppressed. I’d say [the film is] less overtly about women’s oppression, enslavement — that’s less of its concern, although it’s there.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDel Toro’s film features one of the most human-like Creatures yet, and we don’t see him go on quite the killing rampage as in the book, which stirs up more sympathy. What are your thoughts on this difference?\t\n\n\tI do really like that he humanizes the Creature and does a lot more with face-to-face communication. It’s almost like [French philosopher Emmanuel] Levinas in that way: when you behold the face of the other, you can’t murder them. But it skirts over some of the questions of responsibility that I think Mary Shelley already, even at 19, is wondering about. People keep trying to shoot him [in the film], but it’s not like we are to fear him. And we are to fear him. It’s not because he’s ugly — but for Shelley, if you turn something loose in the world, that is fearful.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJacob Elordi as the Creature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne of the parts of the book that isn’t usually put to screen is the Creature’s time with the De Lacey family and the blind old man. What did you think of this inclusion?\t\n\n\tI think that’s one of the most faithful to the book. I am very interested in the notion of friendship in my work, and it really played that up. That was very interesting to me — that he emphasized that so much and as a way outside of, say, heterosexual or even homoerotic transfers. The film is not very sexual in any way, so you don’t really feel that’s a big preoccupation, but friendship was a big thing at least in that scene.\n\t\n\t\tCompared to other film adaptations of “Frankenstein,” how does del Toro’s measure up overall?\t\n\n\tIt’s closer to the multi-layered nature of Shelley’s text. It really does divide the film like the book and frames it in the same way. And it’s really not a horror film, it’s a gothic film. I think some of the other film versions also are interested in the big questions, but they seem to treat them serially or mainly about one thing or another, whereas this one does try to get at various components of what the book is after — but not always successfully. I think many of the film versions aren’t trying to be faithful to Mary Shelley. I would certainly say it’s more like the book, and it’s trying to honor not just the book, but Mary Shelley and that whole group [Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, etc.].\n\t\n\n\tThis conversation has been edited and condensed. \n",

    "body": "\n\tZoey Deutch has ideas. \n\n\tThey’re sharp, original and delivered with the kind of disarming charm that makes you wonder why Hollywood hasn’t already followed her lead. “Don’t you think there should be a blooper button on comedies?” she asks with a grin. “Watching bloopers is always so much fun, and Netflix has so many great comedies on their platform. I’ve been pitching this idea hard. It just makes sense.”\n\n\n\tShe also has another idea: a gender-swapped remake of ‘The Truman Show,’ with Deutch in the lead. “Isn’t it just the best?” she says, lighting up. “I want to play Truman. I think it would be amazing to explore that story from a different angle.”\n\t\n\n\tHer boldness isn’t just theoretical. Deutch’s decade-long journey to her latest role — as Jean Seberg in Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague” — is proof of an artist willing to wait, study, and evolve. The project, which began as a casual conversation with Linklater on the set of “Everybody Wants Some!!” when she was just 19, has now blossomed into what may be her most transformative performance to date.\n\n\t“I didn’t know how real that was,” she recalls. “But the point is, this movie has lived in Rick’s heart, his mind, and his soul for a long time. So it’s beautiful to see it come to fruition.”\n\n\tNow 30, Deutch fully inhabits the complicated Seberg during the tumultuous filming of Jean-Luc Godard’s revolutionary 1960 masterpiece. The role required her to master multiple dialects — Jean speaking English with “almost like a little bit of an affected Mid-Atlantic thing,” Jean speaking French, and Jean playing Patricia in “Breathless.” It was a linguistic high-wire act that Deutch approached with characteristic dedication, studying French for two years before filming began.\n\t\n\n\tThe actress describes “Nouvelle Vague” as “such a departure from anything [Linklater’s] ever made,” a sentiment echoed by frequent Linklater collaborator Ethan Hawke, who told the director after watching the film, “My friend didn’t make that. Who made that? Who was that?” Yet Deutch sees a deeper connection between Linklater and Godard despite their vastly different methods. “Godard is this spontaneous, no script, lightning in a bottle director and Rick is just as much rehearsal time as shooting time,” she explains. “But I do think that is the tether between them. Is their artistic integrity, their authenticity, their drive to make what they need to make inside of them.”\n\n\tThere’s a renewed passion which is palpable in her performance, as she captures both Seberg’s luminous screen presence and the vulnerability of a young actress navigating the chaotic genius of Godard’s set.\n\n\tThe role also allowed Deutch to channel her admiration for classic Hollywood, particularly Katharine Hepburn, whose performances in films like “Bringing Up Baby” and “The Philadelphia Story” altered her DNA as an artist. “I just felt so in love with her and what she was doing,” Deutch says of Hepburn, citing her as a primary inspiration throughout her career.\n\n\tAs “Nouvelle Vague” debuts on Netflix, reaching what will likely be the largest audience of her career, Deutch remains remarkably grounded about the industry’s fickleness. Recalling an Ethan Hawke speech about the cyclical nature of fame — “you’re somebody, then you’re nobody, then you’re somebody, then you’re nobody” — she’s adopted a healthier perspective: “If you believe all the bad, then you believe all the good, and if you believe all the good, then you believe all the bad, and then it cancels itself out, and then you can’t believe any of it, and you just know what’s true for you.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAubry Dullin as Jean-Paul Belmondo and Zoey Deutch as Jean Seberg in “Nouvelle Vague”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJean-Louis Fernandez/Courtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts below from the interview, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n\t\tWas it challenging speaking the French language and nailing Jean Seberg’s distinct accent?\t\n\n\tI did not speak a word of French. I started studying about two years before we filmed. I reached out to my dialect coach to see if she had a French tutor. I started working with her preemptively, in the hopes that this movie would actually happen. And then six months prior to that, I had another additional tutor who was our producer, actually, and she also helped me.\n\t\n\n\tBut to be clear, Jean was not fluent. Jean is from Marshalltown, Iowa. She was learning French while making this movie, while improvising a movie with no script. Her French is very specific, intentional — both the dialect and way that she speaks in the movie, which was a really awesome and welcome challenge. In France, the way she speaks French is very famous. So it was very intimidating.\n\n\tIt’s so funny — Americans are more critical of the French than the French. The French are like, “Oh my God, it sounds exactly like her.” And Americans are like, “Doesn’t sound right,” because she was American. So she had that little bit of that Mid-Atlantic thing, with a twinge of the Iowa. Then there was her speaking French, then there was her playing Patricia — however she spoke in “Breathless.” So there were three almost different versions that were really fun to play with, and oftentimes all three in the same scene.\n\t\n\t\tDo you think you could have worked with someone like Jean-Luc Godard?\t\n\n\tRick is a huge sports guy, which I guess some people are surprised by, but he’s like, would a coach or anybody tell Kobe Bryant, “Hey man, don’t practice. Why don’t you come to the game and see what happens. You’re gonna be great. Just see what happens.” No one would tell an athlete to not prepare, to not train, to not work out, to not study, to not explore every avenue of what could possibly happen. And in the case for actors, you want them to do that. That’s his analogy, and I love it. He kind of calls bullshit on “if you rehearse it too much, it becomes stale.” So what’s the alternative? What is theater then?\n\n\tAs an actor, it’s not my job to dictate the process. That’s the director’s vision, and they’re the captain of the ship and they’re the leader. He’s the only director I’ve worked with that brings his actors to the location to rehearse the scenes a month ahead. Could I have worked with Godard? That’s a good question. It depends on what stage of Godard’s life, and it depends on what stage of my life. Am I in this stage of my life now, or if I was Jean’s age? I think now, but when I was Jean’s age — 20, and I was 20 the first time I worked with Rick — no, I could not have done it at 20. I think I would have gone insane.\n\t\n\t\tAre you finding the roles you really want to play in Hollywood at the moment?\t\n\n\tI can’t imagine that there’s anybody that sits across from you and is like, “Yep, I’m getting offered all the parts that I want.” The fantasy that you somehow arrive at a place where that happens does a disservice to any artist. You never arrive, you’re always searching, you’re always looking and hoping and wanting. And it’s awesome. It’s awesome to want and it’s awesome to keep trying and keep going.\n\t\n\n\tI have had the great fortune of consistently working and really just continuing to hone in on my craft and alongside figuring out who I am as a human being. I started as a kid, and I am no longer a kid. In my mid-20s, I started producing because there was an element of frustration that I wasn’t getting the parts that I wanted. So it was born out of necessity, not out of anything other than that, and it created this newfound love of a different part of the job that I didn’t expect to fall into — to both create opportunities for myself and people that I love. But I definitely do feel like I’m in a different moment in my career and happy to be reintroduced.\n\t\n\t\tWhat are you looking for next?\t\n\n\tI just want to work with great directors. There’s no dream role inside — there are so many. But really, I’m out here stalking Yorgos [Lanthimos] and cold emailing directors. I want to do it all.\n\n\tI did a play on Broadway last year, and I got to play one of my dream roles, which was Emily Webb in “Our Town,” and that was a very transformative, deeply important experience in that I felt the weight of doing something that reminds people that has such a worthy and beautiful message. It reminds people to enjoy their life. It triggers people to want to call the people they love and say, “I love you.” That feeling is so deep. Seeking material like that is, of course, something I would like to do, but I’m not sure how much material there is that’s as good as Thornton Wilder’s words.\n\n\tI do have a feeling of wanting to put goodness out into the world, which I don’t feel like I had before. To be honest, I think for many years, my priority was playing very gnarly characters. I accidentally — accidentally on purpose — kept playing these scammer girls. I did “Buffaloed” and “The Outfit” and “Not Okay,” these films where I was playing these quote-unquote unlikable female characters, because I just didn’t want to get pigeonholed. I started in comedy. I didn’t want to get pushed into just the girl part.\n\n\tNow I want to do everything. I just want to work with great directors, and I want to work with people who are so much smarter and more interesting than me, and I want to just be in their orbit and learn from them.\n\t\n\t\tDo you subscribe to the notion that “movies are dying?”\t\n\n\tHow could movies be dying? Look at the films and how great they are. I mean, there are so many unbelievable films. Artists adapt. That’s what we do. There are too many great films. You can’t see everything great. It’s not that film is dying—there’s too much great art. It’s the same thing as dating, right? There are so many people who have a difficult time dating, and it’s because there’s so many options. You go on to a dating app and you’re like, ugh. Same thing when you go in to watch a film—there’s so many options; it takes forever to choose. But that’s a different problem than film is dying. Our brains just don’t know how to process that much information.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s your advice for aspiring actors looking to get into the business?\t\n\n\tI love the phrase “be ready to be lucky,” meaning do everything you possibly can in your control to prepare, because everything else is out of your control. Whatever that means for you—if it’s watching and studying every movie and going to class and learning different dialects and watching interviews of your heroes and reading—we have so much available and so much information available to us. I think that is of great value, to just take it all in and do as much as you can. It’s alongside manifesting. It’s doing everything that you possibly can to get yourself to a place so that if you ever were to be there, you’re like, “I got this. I can stand on my two feet and go, ‘Yeah, I can do that. Sure. I can try that.'” It’s equipping yourself with as many tools in your toolbox as possible.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFlorian Zeller, a world-acclaimed playwright who made his directorial debut with the Oscar-winning film “The Father” starring Anthony Hopkins, has joined the Académie Française, a prestigious French literary society founded in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu. \n\n\tCreated during the prolific reign of Louis XIV, the Académie Française has played a significant role in shaping French culture, preserving and updating the country’s language, grammar and usage over time. \n\t\n\n\tThe 40 members of the Académie Française, called “immortals,” are famous writers, philosophers and scientists, such as Victor Hugo, Corneille, Edmond Rostand, Jean Cocteau and Eugene Ionesco. At the age of 46, Zeller is the second youngest member ever elected by the society, following Rostand, the author of “Cyrano de Bergerac,” who was 33 when he joined in 1901.\n\n\n\tZeller is currently in pre-production with his third feature, “Bunker,” which will mark his anticipated follow-up to the emotionally gripping “The Son” with Hugh Jackman.  A psychological thriller, “Bunker” will start filming in Spain next month with Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem, alongside Stephen Graham (“Adolescence”). The film revolves around an architect who accepts a morally ambiguous project — building a survivalist bunker for a tech billionaire — and his wife, who begins to question their marriage after 17 years together.\n\n\t“The Father” and “The Son” are part of a trilogy of plays by Zeller that have traveled around the world. He’s written a dozen more plays. The Paris native author and filmmaker also runs Blue Morning Pictures, a production company that’s part of Mediawan, with Federica Sainte-Rose. Zeller’s upcoming production credits include “Alone Together,” Ben Sharrock‘s (“Limbo”) next film starring Callum Turner (“Masters of the Air”) and Adria Arjona (“Splitsville”). \n",

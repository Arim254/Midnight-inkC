    "body": "\n\tNick Reiner has long been open about his struggles with drug abuse and mental health. But legal experts say it would still be very difficult for his defense lawyers to argue that he is not responsible for the deaths of his parents.\n\n\tReiner, 32, has been charged with two counts of murder after allegedly killing his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, at their Brentwood home on Sunday. His mental state seems likely to be a major theme of the case.\n\t\n\n\t“When these kinds of things happen, there’s almost inevitably a mental health issue at the forefront,” said defense attorney Michael Artan.\n\n\n\tBut drug abuse alone is not enough to make a claim of insanity. Reiner’s lawyers would have to show he suffered from a separate psychiatric disorder that prevented him from telling right from wrong.\n\n\t“The law doesn’t want to excuse drug-induced criminal conduct,” said Dmitry Gorin, a criminal defense lawyer who has worked on insanity cases. Gorin said that an insanity plea is “an uphill battle for most defendants.”\n\n\t“In my experience, jurors come in prejudiced against the defendant,” he said. “They believe the insanity defense is used as an excuse. It’s rarely used successfully.”\n\n\tReiner made a brief appearance in court on Wednesday, agreeing to postpone his arraignment to Jan. 7. Outside court, his defense attorney Alan Jackson declined to comment on his client’s mental health.\n\n\tReiner was initially expected to go before a judge on Tuesday, but was not medically cleared to be transported from the jail. Defense lawyer Mark Geragos said he took that as a sign that Jackson may argue that his client is not competent to stand trial — a separate issue from an insanity plea.\n\t\n\n\t“To me that’s a red flag that it’s a competency issue,” Geragos said, noting that issue often arises in parricide cases.\n\n\tTo make that argument, Reiner’s lawyers would have to show that he does not understand the proceedings and is incapable of participating in his defense. He would then be sent for treatment at a state facility until he is well enough to be tried.\n\n\tAn insanity defense, by contrast, pertains to the defendant’s mental state at the time of the crime. It would be raised during an insanity phase of the trial. If successful, Reiner would be sent to a psychiatric institution instead of prison.\n\n\t“The defense of insanity is actually really tough to win,” said Laurie Levenson, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School. “It depends on what experts have to say. Does he have a mental disease or defect? Is it such that he didn’t know what he was doing or he didn’t know it was wrong?”\n\n\tDrug use would only be helpful to the defense if it had done permanent and verifiable brain damage, Levenson said. A drug-induced episode would not qualify.\n\n\tNick Reiner discussed his drug addiction several times on podcasts and in interviews during promotion of “Being Charlie,” the 2015 film he co-wrote about his experiences. On the Dopey Podcast in 2018, he described destroying his parents’ guest house while high on cocaine and other drugs.\n\n\t“Everything in the guest house got wrecked,” he said, saying he went “crazy” after his parents told him to leave.\n\n\tOn a 2016 podcast hosted by recovery writer Anna David, he said he been in 18 rehabs between the ages of 15 and 19. He said that at one facility, he threw a rock through a window in an effort to prove he needed medication.\n\n\t“I was insane,” he said. “And I said, ‘I’m insane.’ And they said, ‘No, you’re not.’ I was like, ‘Well, they’re not taking my word for it. I might as well demonstrate what crazy is.'”\n\n\tThe defense team will likely comb through Reiner’s treatment records for evidence of delusional behavior or psychotic episodes.\n\n\t“Often drug-addicted people are mentally challenged before they start taking drugs,” said attorney Stuart Goldfarb, who represented the porn star Ron Jeremy. “There’s going to be an enormous amount of discovery of his medical history before the defense attorneys decide exactly which way they’re going to go.”\n\t\n\n\tReiner’s mental health could also come up early in the proceedings if his lawyers seek bail. They could ask that he be ordered to a psychiatric facility, where he would get better care than he would in county jail.\n\n\tEven if Reiner’s defense team does not pursue an insanity defense, his mental health could be used to argue for conviction on a lesser offense, like second-degree murder or manslaughter.\n\n\t“We don’t know if he was thinking clearly enough to be guilty of the intent you need for first-degree murder,” Levenson said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYouTube will stop submitting its data to the U.S. Billboard charts next month due to a dispute over how streams are counted, according to an announcement Wednesday from the streamer’s global head of music Lyor Cohen.\n\n\tAt the center of the issue is the methodology Billboard counts paid/subscription versus ad-supported (i.e. free) streams: While Billboard updated its chart rules on Monday to upgrade ad-supported streams with a new ratio between the two tiers — narrowing from 1:3 to 1:2.5, i.e. 2.5 ad-supported streams now equal one paid/subscription stream — YouTube has long argued that they should be weighted equally. \n\t\n\n\tBillboard — which frequently updates its charts’ methodology — has stated that it does not consider all streams to be equal, arguing that a person hearing a clip playing in the background of a video is not the same as a person seeking out a song on Spotify. It applies similar weighting to other streaming services. \n\n\n\tYouTube will continue to submit its data to Luminate, which is a primary source for Billboard’s chart information. \n\n\tIn the announcement, posted on YouTube Music’s blog, Cohen argues, “We believe every fan matters and every play should count equally, therefore after January 16, YouTube data will no longer be delivered or factored into the U.S. Billboard charts.\n\n\t“Billboard uses an outdated formula that weights subscription-supported streams higher than ad-supported,” he continues. “This doesn’t reflect how fans engage with music today and ignores the massive engagement from fans who don’t have a subscription. Streaming is the primary way people experience music, making up 84% of U.S. recorded music revenue. We’re simply asking that every stream is counted fairly and equally, whether it is subscription-based or ad-supported — because every fan matters and every play should count.\n\t\n\n\t“After a decade-long partnership and extensive discussions, they are unwilling to make meaningful changes. Therefore, after January 16, 2026, our data will no longer be delivered to Billboard or factored into their charts.\n\n\t“We are committed to achieving equitable representation across the charts and hopefully can work with Billboard to return to theirs,” he concludes. \n\n\tIn response, a spokesperson for Billboard said in a statement: “There are so many ways a fan can support an artist they love, and each has a specific place in the music ecosystem. Billboard strives to measure that activity appropriately; balanced by various factors including consumer access, revenue analysis, data validation and industry guidance. It is our hope that YouTube reconsiders and joins Billboard in recognizing the reach and popularity of artists on all music platforms and in celebrating their achievements though the power of fans and how they interact with the music that they love.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has released the first teaser trailer for “Can This Love Be Translated?,” a Korean romantic comedy series starring Kim Seon-ho and Go Youn-jung, set to premiere Jan. 16.\n\n\tThe series marks the latest project from the Hong Sisters — Hong Jung-eun and Hong Mi-ran — the acclaimed writing duo whose credits include “Alchemy of Souls,” “Hotel Del Luna” and “The Master’s Sun.” Yoo Young-eun, who helmed “Bloody Heart,” directs the production, which was shot on location across Japan, Canada, Italy and additional international territories.\n\t\n\n\tThe globe-trotting production represents an ambitious scale for the romantic comedy genre, providing a cross-border setting that expands beyond the typical parameters of K-drama rom-coms.\n\n\n\tThe series centers on the relationship between Joo Ho-jin, a multilingual interpreter, and Cha Mu-hee, a world-famous celebrity. Their contrasting personalities create an initially mismatched pairing that evolves as the two characters grow closer, with the teaser offering an initial glimpse at their on-screen chemistry.\n\n\tKim Seon-ho, known for his roles in “When Life Gives You Tangerines,” “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha” and “Start-Up,” portrays Ho-jin. Go Youn-jung, whose credits include “Sweet Home,” “Alchemy of Souls: Light and Shadow” and “Resident Playbook,” plays Mu-hee.\n\n\tThe cast also includes Fukushi Sota as Hiro, a charismatic figure dubbed “Japan’s Romance Prince,” whose presence introduces additional romantic complications that explore themes of jealousy and miscommunication across language barriers.\n\n\tKorean romantic comedies have demonstrated consistent popularity on Netflix’s platform, with recent titles “Dynamite Kiss” and “Bon Appétit, Your Majesty” both appearing on the streamer’s Global Top 10 non-English TV list following their respective debuts.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, died from “multiple sharp force injuries,” according to records from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.\n\n\tReiner, who starred in the 1971 sitcom “All in the Family” before directing films like “This Is Spinal Tap,” “When Harry Met Sally…,” “A Few Good Men” and “Stand by Me,” was found dead on Sunday afternoon in his Brentwood home alongside Singer, his wife of over three decades. Reiner was 78, and Singer was 70.\n\t\n\n\tNick Reiner, Rob and Michele’s son, was arrested Sunday night near the USC campus and booked on suspicion of murder Monday morning. He was charged with two counts of murder in the death of his parents on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\tThe charges carry a maximum sentence of life without parole or the death penalty, according to the Los Angeles district attorney.\n\n\tHochman said at a press conference, “Prosecuting these cases involving family members are some of the most challenging and most heart-wrenching cases that this office faces because of the intimate and often brutal nature of the crimes involved.”\n\n\tA decision of whether or not to pursue the death penalty will come from the D.A.’s office at a later date. Hochman was elected D.A. in 2024. He reinstated the death penalty in a reversal of his predecessor George Gascón’s moratorium. California has suspended all executions since 2019.\n\n\tRob Reiner and Michele Singer’s deaths rocked the Hollywood community, sparking an outpouring of tributes from friends and former collaborators. Reiner’s most recent film was “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” a sequel to his 1984 classic mockumentary.\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe recent cancellation of Netflix‘s “Boots” after just one season struck a blow for representation, as a ground breaking coming-of-age queer drama ",
    "body": "\n\tThe recent cancellation of Netflix‘s “Boots” after just one season struck a blow for representation, as a ground breaking coming-of-age queer drama series set in the Marine Corps. But it was also notable for another reason: “Boots” was the final show to be executive produced by TV legend Norman Lear, who had helped develop the project before his death in December 2023.\n\n\tBrent Miller, who served as Lear’s producing partner and ran his Act III Prods. shingle, shared his disappointment with Variety that “Boots” won’t continue: “But I do feel so grateful that we were able to make the show – and I couldn’t be more proud of the show we made.”\n\t\n\n\tAs for where “Boots” might have gone in Season 2, Miller added, “Our creator, Andy Parker, had always intended to take the boys to war in a Season 2.”\n\n\tCreated by Parker, “Boots” was based on Greg Cope White’s book “The Pink Marine.” Miles Heizer starred as Cameron Cope, a disillusioned, closeted ‘90s teen who signs up for the Marine Corps with his best friend Ray McAffey, played by Liam Oh. Despite the unwelcoming environment (LGBTQ people were banned from the military at that time), the pair grow into themselves and form lifelong friendships with their fellow recruits as they navigate the social and physical hazards of boot camp.\n\n\tFor the Lear family, the news of the “Boots” cancellation has, of course, been overshadowed by the tragic deaths of Rob and Michelle Reiner. \n\n\t“To be perfectly honest, it would be extremely difficult for Norman to focus on anything but the Reiners and their family at this time,” Miller said. “However, had he heard the news of our cancellation prior to the Reiner tragedy, I’m rather confident he would’ve reacted with disappointment, but simultaneously sit in gratitude for having had the opportunity to make the show we made. He would’ve been proud to know that the last show to bare his name was so meaningful to so many in the 196 countries Netflix serves. \n\t\n\n\t“And although he was aware that cancellations happen all of the time for various business decisions, he would empower myself, our fellow EPs and Sony to do everything humanly possible for our actors, writers and producers to try and find ourselves a new home,” added Miller, who now runs A House On Brame Productions. “And of course, he would have encouraged the fans to make their voices be heard in the loudest ways possible to ensure a Season 2 – wherever, whenever.”\n\n\tThe timing of Lear’s final production ending right when the Reiner news came to light was an unfortunate coincidence. Lear was good friends, of course, with Rob Reiner’s father Carl Reiner, and later cast Rob Reiner in his breakout role on “All in the Family” as Mike “Meathead” Stivic. Lear also helped Reiner in his role as a filmmaker, serving as a producer on Reiner’s “The Princess Bride,” something Lear was very proud of.\n\n\tAs the Lear family wrote in a statement this week, “The Lear Family is devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner. Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world. Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends. Lyn Lear had remained very close with them and said, ‘The world is unmistakably darker tonight, and we are left bereft.’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tZooey Deschanel revealed during an interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast that she was offered the female lead in Jon Favreau’s 2003 Christmas movie classic “Elf” only after Katie Holmes dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts (via The Daily Beast). Deschanel was only 21 years old when she auditioned for the movie, although she revealed Favreau told her they didn’t need to run any lines together because “we just offered it to Katie Holmes.”\n\t\n\n\t“And I was like, ‘Oh, Ok, cool,’” Deschanel remembered, adding that she proceeded to “audition” for the movie just by staying in the room and chatting with the director as if they were just meeting up to talk.\n\n\n\t“What was great about that was like, I wasn’t nervous,” Deschanel said. “It’s like when you’re an actor, you’re like first starting, and you’re auditioning, you get nervous, and you’re like psyching yourself up. I wasn’t nervous at all, because I was like, ‘Well, I’m not getting the part.”\n\n\tWhen Holmes dropped out, Deschanel left a good enough of an impression on Favreau that she was next in line to be offered the part. She starred in “Elf” as Jovie, a department story worker who becomes the love interest for Will Ferrell’s Buddy. Deschanel said the role “was kind of meant to be like worked around whoever played her,” so the screenwriting team wrote in scenes where Jovie sings in the shower since Deschanel was a singer. \n\n\t“Elf” earned over $220 million at the worldwide box office at the time of its release and remains a Christmas classic. Ferrell plays Buddy, a human raised by Santa’s elves. He travels to New York City to meet his biological father, played by James Caan. Ferrell previously revealed that he once turned down a $29 million offer to star in an “Elf” sequel.\n\t\n\n\t“I would have had to promote the movie from an honest place, which would’ve been, like, ‘Oh no, it’s not good. I just couldn’t turn down that much money,’” Ferrell said about the simple decision to reject “Elf 2.” “And I thought, ‘Can I actually say those words? I don’t think I can, so I guess I can’t do the movie.’”\n\n\tWatch Deschanel’s full interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tPam Bondi, Trump’s U.S. Attorney General, may have conflicts of interest in overseeing a review of a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery — and she shoul",
    "body": "\n\tPam Bondi, Trump’s U.S. Attorney General, may have conflicts of interest in overseeing a review of a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery — and she should recuse herself from a review of any such transaction, two prominent Democratic senators said. \n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery has entered into an $83 billion agreement with Netflix, which would acquire Warner Bros.’ studios and HBO Max. David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance has mounted a hostile takeover bid, with what it claims are deal terms more favorable to shareholders. On Wednesday, WBD rejected Paramount’s $30/share bid as “inferior” to the Netflix deal and recommended that shareholders reject the Paramount offer. Paramount is sticking with its offer in appealing directly to WBD shareholders.\n\t\n\n\tAs the future of WBD’s assets hang in the balance, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called for Bondi to recuse herself from the DOJ’s review of any deal involving WBD because of “potential conflicts of interest related to her former employer, lobbying firm Ballard Partners.” Prior to Trump appointing her attorney general, Bondi spent six years as a lobbyist at Ballard Partners, “a favorite firm among companies with business before the Trump administration.” Since Bondi’s nomination as attorney general, Ballard has taken on both Netflix and Paramount Skydance as clients. According to the senators, Ballard was reportedly involved in the Paramount-Skydance merger earlier this year.\n\n\n\t“In line with our anti-corruption oversight and legislative priorities, and given the cloud of corruption surrounding this merger and your former employer Ballard’s potential role in this merger, we ask that you recuse yourself from the review of this purchase,” Warren and Blumenthal wrote in a Sept. 17 letter send to Bondi. The full text of the letter is at this link.\n\t\n\n\tVariety has reached out to the DOJ for comment.\n\n\tAccording to the senators, the DOJ has “indicated that Bondi will lead the Trump administration’s review of the merger, alongside DOJ Antitrust head Gail Slater.”\n\n\tThe two Democratic senators alleged that “Ballard is already enmeshed in the cloud of corruption surrounding the White House.” They claim that reports “revealed that Ballard lobbyists were instrumental in connecting their corporate clients with fundraisers for President Donald Trump’s ballroom, and nearly half of the corporations known to be funding the ballroom — 11 out of 26 publicly reported corporate donors — are Ballard’s clients.”\n\n\tIn addition, Warren and Blumenthal alleged, Ballard’s involvement has previously raised “questions of improper influence in DOJ deal reviews.” In July, the Justice Department dropped its challenge to the $570 million merger between American Express Global Business Travel and CWT Holdings “after Amex GBT paid Ballard Partners to lobby the DOJ on antitrust matters,” according to the senators.\n\n\tBondi signed an ethics agreement pledging not to participate “in any particular matter involving specific parties” in which she knows Ballard Partners “is a party or represents a party” for one year after confirmation, until Feb. 4, 2026. But after the February deadline, “Bondi’s involvement in the Netflix-Paramount matter would raise the appearance of serious impropriety and threaten to violate her obligations as a public servant,” according to Warren and Blumenthal.\n\n\t“DOJ must guarantee that any review of a potential Warner Bros. transaction is decided based upon the law, not perverted by political favoritism and cronyism — particularly given the stakes of this case for consumers. Regardless of which of these two giant media conglomerates wins the bid for Warner Bros., a takeover will further consolidate the media market — risking higher prices and less variety for consumers,” the senators wrote in the letter.\n\n\tPresident Donald Trump last week said he would be “involved” in a review of a Warner Bros. deal. He also opined that CNN should be sold as part of any deal for WBD because “I don’t think the people that are running that company right now and running CNN, which is a very dishonest group of people, I don’t think that should be allowed to continue,” Trump said. “I think CNN should be sold along with everything else.” Those comments “[raise] the specter of the President leveraging a possible merger to censor a prominent news network that he has openly criticized,” according to the two senators.\n",

David walked by the bar with a friend, and the guy with the hat ran out to say hello to him. We’re told David's friend told the guy they were meeting up with some girls, but then David said, \"No, let's go to this guy's house.\"\n      \n    \n          Our source says this struck the guy as strange, so he returned back inside the bar. Shortly later, we’re told David entered the bar, took his hat and fled. The witness says David spiked his hat on the ground and asked the group about the Iraq War, then began to get emotional before kneeling down to pray.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to rep for David for his side of things... so far no word back.\n      \n    \n          However, a source with direct knowledge tells TMZ ... \"David has always been honest about managing his bipolar disorder. Wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what he’s dealing with here after working non-stop all year and having his personal life under public scrutiny. That would be stressful for anyone but even more so for someone who is bipolar.\"\n      \n    \n          David himself has candidly discussed being diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the past.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          This comes after the \"Stranger Things\" actor had been under fire for a report claiming his costar Millie Bobby Brown filed a bullying and harassment complaint against him while filming the final season of the Netflix show. Executive producer Shawn Levy and Millie herself have come out and categorically denied those claims.\n      \n    \n          In fact, the actress told Deadline she had a particularly strong bond with David. Millie pointed out she and David play father and daughter on the show ... so, the two have acted opposite each other for years and built up quite the rapport.\n      \n      ",

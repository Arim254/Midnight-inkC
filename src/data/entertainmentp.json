    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tOn Jan. 22, 2006, Kobe Bryant had one of the best games of his career in the NBA. The L.A. Lakers were hosting the Toronto Raptors at the Staples Center (now called Crypto.com Arena) in Los Angeles, California. This was the game Kobe Bryant, who’s the subject of a new movie in the works at Warner Bros., scored a career-high 81 points in one game.\n\n\tAnd 20 years later, to celebrate the anniversary, Nike is releasing the Kobe 1 Protro “81 Points” sneakers on Thursday, Jan. 22 at 10 a.m. ET/7 a.m. PT.\n\n\n\tPriced at $210, the Nike Kobe 1 Protro “81 Points” sneakers have rubber soles, which adds to their cushioning, while they have a look that’s clean and retro with mid-2000s accents that dawns the team’s black, white, court purple and gold colorway. The sneakers are lightweight and made from a blend of real and synthetic leather paired with a fabric upper for durability.\n\n\tIn addition, the signature shoes feature Bryant’s “Shield” logo on each tongue, while the word “Uptempo” adorn the upper heels.

    "body": "\n\tRise and shine — it’s officially Oscar season. \n\n\tThe countdown begins early Thursday, Jan. 22, when Danielle Brooks and Lewis Pullman unveil the nominees for the 98th Academy Awards. The announcement kicks off at 5:30 a.m. PT and will stream across Oscar.com, Oscars.org and the Academy’s social platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. Viewers can also catch the reveal on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” with “ABC News Live” available via Disney+ and Hulu.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tAwards watchers are already bracing for a competitive best picture race. Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis projects nominations for “Bugonia,” “F1,” “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “One Battle After Another,” “The Secret Agent,” “Sentimental Value,” “Sinners” and “Train Dreams.” Two titles — Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” and Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” — could dominate the morning and even threaten the long-standing record of 14 nominations set by “All About Eve” (1950), “Titanic” (1997) and “La La Land” (2016).\n\n\n\tThis year’s ceremony also marks a notable expansion of the Oscar slate with the introduction of best casting, bringing the total number of categories to 24. Best picture will once again be capped at 10 nominees.\n\n\tIn the acting races, Davis predicts a best actor lineup that includes Timothée Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”), Leonardo DiCaprio (“One Battle After Another”), Ethan Hawke (“Blue Moon”), Michael B. Jordan (“Sinners”) and Wagner Moura (“The Secret Agent”). Chalamet enters nomination morning fresh off a Golden Globe win over DiCaprio.\n\t\n\n\tOn the actress side, Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”), Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”), Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”) and Emma Stone (“Bugonia”) are expected to land nominations.\n\n\tConan O’Brien will return to host the Oscars after his 2025 debut delivered the show’s biggest audience in five years. The 98th Academy Awards take place March 15 at the Dolby Theatre, airing on ABC and streaming on Hulu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has made a feature documentary about Lucy Letby, the British neonatal nurse found guilty of murdering seven babies under her care, and it will premiere on the streamer next month.\n\n\t“The Investigation of Lucy Letby” is set to launch globally on Feb. 4 and promises to include “new materials and testimony from the British police who investigated the case and never-before-seen footage of Letby during her arrest and questioning,” according to a press release. \n\t\n\n\tThe 90-minute doc also features an interview with the mother of one of the victims, marking the first time a family member involved in the prosecution has spoken out other than during Letby’s trial. Experts and lawyers from both sides of the case also weigh in.\n\n\n\tThe 36-year-old nurse was convicted of murdering seven infants between June 2015 and June 2016 as well as the attempted murders of seven others, making her the U.K.’s most prolific child murderer. In August 2023, she was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order, meaning she will die in prison. In July 2024, an attempted murder charge that the jury failed to reach a verdict on was retried, and Letby was again found guilty. Her case both gripped and divided the U.K., with some expressing doubt over the medical and statistical evidence that led to her conviction. \n\n\t“The Investigation of Lucy Letby” hails from ITN Productions and is directed by Dominic Sivyer. Executive producers include Caroline Short and Ian Rumsey. \n\n\tWatch the trailer for the doc below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAngelina Jolie is passionately promoting advocacy-driven drama “Muganga, The One Who Treats,” inspired by the true story of 2018 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Denis Mukwege, who treats survivors of wartime sexual violence. \n\n\tIn the video above, which Variety has obtained exclusively, Jolie — who first met survivors of rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2013, and has worked alongside Mukwege for over a decade — speaks with him about “how men can be part of the solution to fight sexual violence,” as she puts it.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the conversation, Jolie points out that it is imperative to get men involved in advocating against sexual violence “because I don’t see how women can do more to make the world understand,” she says.\n\n\tMukwege replies: “I said to some men once — we were talking about this issue, young men — they said, ‘Well, we don’t know, like, if we were to join, are we welcome to join? Because we feel like we’re the guys.’ And I said, ‘No, of course. Like, please, you’re welcome.’ We’re partners, men and women around the world. And we want men to see issues like this as their place to be with us.”\n\n\tIn “Muganga,” which in Swahili means doctor or traditional healer, Mukwege joins forces with Belgian surgeon Guy Cadière to treat thousands of women and fight sexual violence in eastern Congo. Filmed on location in Gabon, “Muganga” stars Cesar-winning actor Isaach De Bankolé as Mukwege, leading an ensemble cast also comprising Vincent Macaigne, Manon Bresch, Babetida Sadjo and Déborah Lukumuena. \n\n\tThe movie won three Valois awards at the Angoulême Film Festival in France, where it has been a box office success, scoring more than €3 million ($3.5 million). “Muganga,” which was produced by Cynthia Pinet of France’s Petites Poupées Production, is now eligible for France’s César Awards in all major categories. Jolie serves as a co-producer on the film.\n\t\n\n\t“Muganga” was financed by Canex Creations, an initiative of the African Export-Import Bank Afreximbank alongside partners including Canal+, France 3 Cinéma, France Télévisions, France’s CNC and Scope Pictures. France’s Canal+ holds streaming rights to “Muganga” in France and Francophone Africa. WME Independent is handling world sales.\n",

Their romance unfolds over a decade against the backdrop of the changing city, after which he spends the rest of his life creating a museum in her memory that contains “his beloved’s earrings, her hair clips, and even her discarded cigarette butts,” as the synopsis puts it.Directed by Zeynep Günay, “Museum of Innocence” is written by Ertan Kurtulan and produced by Turkish TV Powerhouse Ay Yapım known for International Emmy-winning series “Endless Love,” and also “Fatmagul,” “Ezel” and “Forbidden Love,” among other global hit series.\n\t\n\n\tOther standout titles in Netflix’s new Turkish that have not been previously announced comprise:\n\n\n\t— “Seni Tanıyorum,” a series written by Tuğba Doğan (“Hepimiz Birimiz Için”), directed by Mert Baykal (“Hot Skull”) and produced by Bonbon Studios. “After taking a break from painting following childbirth, Funda finds the nanny she has been searching for,” reads the synopsis. “But the mystery and unsettling nature of Nazlı begins to change the lives of Funda and her husband İlker forever. What starts as a simple encounter turns into a long-running game in which each of them is tested in their loyalty and desires.”\n\n\t— “Sonra Gözler Görür,” a series penned by Ece Yörenç (“Fallen Leaves,” “Forbidden Love”), directed by  Bertan Başaran (“Shahmaran”) and produced by Ay Yapim. “A quiet coastal town is shaken by the mysterious death of a young girl. When a renowned journalist returns to the place she grew up years later to investigate the case, her search uncovers not only a killer, but long-buried secrets and the truth about her own past,” the synopsis says.\n\t\n\n\tNew upcoming 2026 instalments of popular pre-existing Netflix Turkey originals shows include fresh seasons of “Ethos,” “Money Trap,” “Thank You, Next,” “Another Self” and Graveyard.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tMore than 700 artists, writers and creators, including Scarlett Johansson, Cate Blanchett and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, have united behind a new anti-AI campaign calling out the tech companies exploiting copyrighted work without permission.While lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are weighing new regulations around AI training data, the campaign argues that “Stealing our work is not innovation. It’s not progress. It’s theft – plain and simple.” \n\n\tFor Johansson, Blanchett, Gordon-Levitt and hundreds of others, the importance of fighting for authorship is not only meant to protect their own interest but also the U.S. creative sector as a whole, spanning film, television, music, publishing and digital media, which “supports millions of jobs, fuels economic growth and projects cultural power globally,” says the statement. That ecosystem is being threatened, the letter notes, due to AI developers scraping creative work, often without authorization, compensation or transparency.“America’s creative community is the envy of the world,” the statement reads. “But rather than respect and protect this valuable asset, some of the biggest tech companies – many backed by private equity and other funders — are using American creators’ work to build AI platforms without regard for copyright law.”The campaign urges companies to strike content deals or partnerships, like some have already done.  “A better way exists,” the statement says, arguing that responsible licensing deals can allow AI to advance while still respecting creators’ rights. “It is possible to have it all. We can have advanced, rapidly developing AI and ensure creators’ rights are respected.”\n\t\n\n\tJohansson has been vocal against the dangers of AI before, and has been fighting back against the recreation of her likeness for years. In Feb. 2024, she issued a statement slamming a viral video in which an AI version of herself, along with other celebrities, appears to protest Kanye West‘s antisemitic posts. She also took legal action in November 2023 against an AI app that used her name and likeness in an online advertisement without permission; and condemned OpenAI in May 2024 for using her voice from Spike Jonze’s 2013 movie “Her” as inspiration for a GPT-4o chatbot named Sky. \n\n\tBlanchett, meanwhile, has spoken about AI several times, including at Toronto in 2024, during a conversation with TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey. She said, “I think it’s really important to discuss any new technology. I think we should be very cautious with it, because innovation without imagination is a very, very dangerous thing.”\n\n\tLast year, Blanchett and Gordon-Levitt were among 400 Hollywood filmmakers, writers, actors and musicians who signed an open letter to the Trump White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, urging the administration to not roll back copyright protections at the behest of AI companies.Here’s the full statement: \n\n\tStealing is not innovation.\n\t\n\n\tAmerica’s creative community is the envy of the world and creates jobs, economic growth, and exports. But rather than respect and protect this valuable asset, some of the biggest tech companies, many backed by private equity and other funders, are using American creators’ work to build AI platforms without authorization or regard for copyright law.Artists, writers, and creators of all kinds are banding together with a simple message: Stealing our work is not innovation. It’s not progress. It’s theft – plain and simple.A better way exists – through licensing deals and partnerships, some AI companies have taken the responsible, ethical route to obtaining the content and materials they wish to use. It is possible to have it all. We can have advanced, rapidly developing AI and ensure creators’ rights are respected.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor the first time in a very long time, this year’s BAFTA Film Awards nominations are being announced after the Oscar nominations are unveiled. Indeed, there’s a full five days to wait after AMPAS lifts the lid on the 2026 lineup of nominees on Thursday to discover the decision of British Academy voters on Jan. 27.\n\n\tFor BAFTA CEO Jane Millichip — who admits even her colleagues are unsure when the last time this scenario occurred — it makes for a pleasant change. “It’s nice to have Oscar being a bellwether for BAFTA,” she says, while also noting that the Oscars final voting window is still very much open when the BAFTA Awards ceremony itself takes place on Feb. 22. \n\t\n\n\tThanks to the BAFTA Longlist — first introduced in 2021 as part of the major BAFTA Review overhaul — there’s some indication of where voters are leaning. But while awards season big hitters like “One Battle After Another,” “Sinners,” “Hamnet” and “Marty Supreme” may lead the pack after the first round of voting, Millichip points to what the overall lineup of 82 titles showcases, which includes not just a “stonking” array of British films alongside debut features that have come from former short film nominees, but also the expanding viewing habits of its members (this year has the highest number of longlisted films as a proportion to total entries).\n\n\n\tIn a wide-ranging interview, Millichip discusses how being on the longlist is “career enhancing” and something to celebrate even for those who don’t then make the nomination stage, why BAFTA will be keeping the director category intervention to ensure parity in longlisted male and female filmmakers, and landing Alan Cumming as Film Awards host for the first time.\n\t\n\n\tIs she prepared for the amount of tartan likely to be on display? “You can never have enough of it,” she says. \n\t\n\t\tI hear that you were recently in LA for the for the BAFTA Tea Party.\t\n\n\tYes, I’ve been each year that it’s been on since I joined BAFTA. But we obviously had to skip last year [due to the fires]. But it’s a great opportunity for us to take BAFTA to L.A. to celebrate the longlist there, rather than celebrating it here. And we had an amazing turnout of talent. Actually, it was kind of gobsmacking, to be honest. But I was also grateful for an invite to the Globes.\n\t\n\t\tOh great – how was that?\t\n\n\tIt was really lovely. It’s a quite intimate room. But when I go to other people’s award ceremonies, I come back with a really boring set of photographs of the venue — menus, tables centers, sometimes under the tables, chairs. I’m standing around pointing my camera at the least glamorous things on display so I can share footage with the team. So there’s a busman’s holiday element to it.\n\t\n\t\tAny inspiration from the Globes we might then see at the BAFTAs?\t\n\n\tI think we’re set for this year. But it’s always good for the mood board.\n\t\n\t\tWe just had the BAFTA Longlist. How are you feeling?\t\n\n\tI absolutely love the longlist because it’s long, as it says on the tin, it’s rich and it’s diverse. And if I were involved in a film that was longlisted but not nominated, I would want to know. I think it’s career enhancing. It’s a congratulations. It’s a well done. And, you know, in a really competitive field, I think it’s really great that for those people and films that have spots in the longlist, if they don’t make it to nomination, it’s still something to celebrate.\n\n\tIt was in 2021 that we started publishing it and it also provides another role, which is to encourage our members and voting members to watch as many films as possible. And after the awards, if anybody says to me, “What should I watch?” I go, “Look at the longlist.”\n\t\n\t\tIt’s perhaps no surprise that “One Battle After Another” dominated the longlist. But nice to see some great British titles in the mix — and in the best film category.\t\n\n\tYeah, and the outstanding British list is really, really good. There’s some stonking films in there. And it’s actually interesting, because it’s a celebration of British talent and British films, but quite a few of those films have been funded by American studios. So it’s a celebration of both British and American talent and filmmaking.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI feel like, as it’s the longlist stage rather than the nominations, you can probably offer some opinions. Any particular fllms you’re really pleased to see in the mix?\t\n\n\tI cannot offer my opinions! I can only talk about “Casablanca.” But I can say that the big four — “One Battle,” “Sinners,” “Hamnet” and “Marty Supreme” — have gotten a lot of mentions on the longlist, and deservedly so. I think what is interesting this year is there’s some really strong flavors and there are films like “One Battle,” “Sinners” and “House of Dynamite” that have tackled really big, chunky subjects — whether it’s the moral ambiguity of activism, corruption, Black identity or world collapse — in quite specific ways. So I’m really impressed with the take that a lot of filmmakers have taken in not just attacking it head on. And I think as a result, it’s a really rich, textured list of films. And then there’s another group of films, if you can group them, that are these really beautiful personal stories, like “Hamnet” and “I Swear.”\n\n\tWe also track the talent in some way associated with BAFTA. So it’s great to see Akinola Davis with his film “My Father’s Shadow.” He is a BAFTA Breakthrough and he previously had a BAFTA-nominated short. And the same is true of “Pillion” director Harry Lighton — he has previously had a BAFTA-nominated short. And then “The Ballad of Wallace Island” is based on a short that was BAFTA-nominated.\n\t\n\t\tOne film that isn’t going to be present is “KPop Demon Hunters,” which was ruled ineligible despite lobbying by Netflix.\t\n\n\tIt’s important for us to back that idea that films need to have been presented in a theater. It would have been lovely to have it entered, but it wasn’t.\n\t\n\t\tOutside of the U.K. industry, I think there was a little confusion about the longlist. But five years on, do you feel like people are starting to understand what they are about and why they exist?\t\n\n\tAbsolutely. When I was in L.A. last week, whenever I went to events I doorstopped a few people who were on the longlist and they were really delighted. I wasn’t looking for gratitude — I’m hoping for engagement and recognition. I bumped into Kate Hudson and she was thrilled. So I do get the sense that it’s being understood and it’s worthwhile. Because anyone mentioned on the longlist still doesn’t know if they’re going to make it to a nomination.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWe have an unusual scenario this year where the Oscar nominations are announced before the BAFTA nominations, which I don’t think has happened for a very long time. The usual route is that awards pundits will use the BAFTA noms to make predictions about the Oscars. Is there any concern that this might make the BAFTA nominations less relevant?\t\n\n\tNot at all. It’s nice to have Oscar being a bellwether for BAFTA. But the fact is, the BAFTA ceremony is on the 22nd of February, which is still in the voting window of the Oscars. The switch around with nominations is simply a consequence of dates. But I certainly don’t think it makes us less relevant. What happens on Feb. 22 is particularly relevant to everyone at the Academy.\n\t\n\t\tThe longlists were part of the huge BAFTA Review in 2020 implemented in 2021. Five years on, are the changes having the desired effect that was hoped?\t\n\n\tIt was before I joined, but I’m the beneficiary of a lot of hard work and time that went into that review. We have to look at what are we in control of at BAFTA. We have our membership and our awards process, so you start there. Since then, great efforts have been made to ensure that our membership maps much more to the population of the U.K. We’ve also set diversity targets for our membership, which we can continue to map against the population data. We’ve hit most of those targets, and we’ve given ourselves stretch targets in certain areas. So that is working, but we continue to keep working on it.\n\n\tAnd then, we have the longlist and the the randomized viewing groups, which were really about encouraging our members to watch as many films as possible, as wide variety as possible, outside their preference to ensure that more films are considered. \n\n\tWhat we’re not in control of is what is made. An area that still we continue to pay attention to are the number of women in some of the craft categories, particularly text, sound editing, cinematography and, of course, directing. And at the longlist stage, we still have the intervention around directors so we have parity in the number of women directors and male directors. But the industry stats around women directors are still not brilliant. As far as we know, 30% of British films were directed by women. So it will be interesting to see how many women directors don’t just make the director nominations, but how many films made by women directors feature at all in the nominations. So we’ll be keeping a keen eye on that. There’s some brilliant work made by women. But is it being seen? Is it being promoted? Does it receive the marketing budget that films made by men do?\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSo that positive intervention in the directors category for the longlists, given where we are, is here to stay for the time being?\t\n\n\tAbsolutely, because we think it’s necessary. We’re not here to fix elections or tell people how to vote, but we are here to say: “Have you looked over here?'”\n\t\n\t\tThis year, you’ve got Alan Cumming hosting the awards. I know he’s Scottish, but I would say, given “The Traitors,” he’s probably the highest profile figure in the U.S. to ever host the BAFTAs. He’s huge right now!\t\n\n\tYeah, he is. And when I was in L.A., I was noticing all the billboards. And he’s recently had a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He’s a joy to work with. He’s naturally very funny. But he’s accomplished, he’s professional and and he’s up for some fun. David Tennant, by the way, was only ever going to do two, so we knew we’d have to change film host this year.\n\t\n\t\tIt is a bit of Scottish monopoly right now…\t\n\n\tYeah, we’ve very Caledonian!\n\t\n\t\tWas Cumming’s popularity in the U.S. part of the decision?\t\n\n\tYeah, of course it’s a factor. Because we want someone who’s going to be great at the job, great on the day, and someone who the British audience, principally, are going to respond to. And we’re on the BBC again and on BBC and BAFTA socials. But of course international matters, and so having a host that also plays well in the States, which is a big market for us, it’s a double-whammy.\n\t\n\t\tAre you prepared for the sheer amount of tartan that’s going to be on display?\t\n\n\tI might be wearing it myself! But no, I’m always prepared for tartan. You can never have enough of it. But David upped the ante with his tartan and his knees. So I’m hoping for more knees. \n",

    "description": "\n\tBoth the good guys and the bad guys work for the Miami-Dade Police Department in “The Rip,” which reunites “Good Will Hunting” buds Ben Affleck and ",
    "body": "\n\tBoth the good guys and the bad guys work for the Miami-Dade Police Department in “The Rip,” which reunites “Good Will Hunting” buds Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for a dark, trust-no-one heist movie that’s conspicuously better than most Netflix originals and, frankly, right in line with a couple of films the boys made for Warner Bros. earlier this century: namely, “The Departed” and “The Town.” (Like those upscale crime movies, “The Rip” belongs on the big screen. The fact it can’t be seen that way underscores warnings that the streamer isn’t really interested in theatrical, whatever it might claim in order to acquire Warners.)\n\t\n\n\tColombian cartels are doing business in South Florida, but they’re hardly “the worst of the worst” in “Narc” director Joe Carnahan’s latest authority-questioning thriller. Instead, the intrigue is almost entirely internal, as dirty cops scheme to make off with more than $20 million in illicit cash — if only they could figure out where it’s hidden. Lt. Dane Dumars (Damon) has a pretty good idea, though the sheer scale of the haul catches him by surprise.\n\n\n\tA heavily fictionalized retelling of the department’s biggest seizure, “The Rip” opens with the waterfront execution of a respected captain, Jackie Velez (Lina Esco), by a pair of masked gunmen. From there, it accelerates into cat-and-mouse territory as Dumars, the officer she trusted most, leads his team to a nondescript house at the end of a sleepy suburban cul-de-sac.\n\n\tWhen a young Colombian woman (Sasha Calle as Desi) opens the door, Dumars feels fairly confident that they’ve come to the right place. Sure enough, the newly renovated attic hides a hidden room, where barrel upon barrel of $100 bills are neatly stashed. Per local police procedure, when Florida cops seize any quantity of cash, they’re required to count the money on site. In this case, that makes Dumars and his team sitting ducks for anyone else with designs on their score.\n\t\n\n\tCarnahan’s script introduces early the idea that Jackie was most likely killed by corrupt cops, which turns the entire scenario — a team of five holed up at the end of a street where the cartel appears to control every house — into a tense closed-circle mystery. “The Rip” clearly cost a lot of money, and yet, almost half the film unfolds in this single location: the run-down home Desi inherited from her abuela.\n\n\tThough it’s still daylight out when Dumars’ crew enters the house, Carnahan and DP Juanmi Azpiroz treat the film like they’re making “Heat 2,” adopting the same sleek, satiny, almost-monochromatic look Michael Mann brought to his modern-day crime classic — also matching the ultra-wide aspect ratio. The Florida sun is nowhere to be seen, as gray skies make exteriors feel oppressive and dangerous (composer Clinton Shorter’s accelerated-pulse score amplifies the tension even further).\n\n\tThings are even more underlit inside the house, and it’s not long before night falls and everyone is moving under cloak of darkness, further obscured by a fine mist. The testosterone is palpable in this high-stakes poker game, as thick beards mask the faces of nearly half the cast (that goes for Damon, Affleck and co-star Kyle Chandler, at least). When guns go off, they spark bright like welding torches, while street lights glow, piercing the gloom — visuals that collectively reinforce the film’s cinematic ambitions.\n\n\tMuch has already been said about how “The Rip” defies Netflix’s prescribed rules for distracted viewership (where the plot must be restated multiple times for divided-attention audiences). But even those who give “The Rip” their full attention may find it hard to explain all the twists and double-crosses Carnahan crams into his gripping two-hour thriller — which is presumably why Netflix saw fit to publish a Tudum article entitled “The Rip’s Ending, Explained: Who Is the Traitor? And What Happens to the Money?”\n\n\tThe primary suspects are Dumars and his belligerent partner, Detective Sergeant J.D. Byrne (Affleck), as well as fellow officers Ro (Steven Yeun), Salazar (Catalina Sandino Moreno) and Baptiste (about-to-be-Oscar-nominated Teyana Taylor). Let’s stop for a minute and take in that cast: It’s only January, and Netflix has already set the bar incredibly high when it comes to assembling the most impressive (but still surprising) team imaginable. Normally, a shrewd viewer can look at such a lineup and guess who the villains are going to be, since such roles typically attract strong actors. But this is a next-level ensemble, and it’s not that easy.\n\t\n\n\tBetween the sheer complexity of the plot (what’s the deal with the cops who roll up in their cruiser? who was shooting up the house? why doesn’t Dumar try to arrest anyone from the cartel?) and the intricate way Carnahan assembles the puzzle, “The Rip” is easily worth a second viewing. Having done so myself, I can attest that it’s even more satisfying on closer inspection. Editor Kevin Hale is constantly cutting between the faces of Dumars’ team, showing each of their reactions to unplanned wrinkles, and once you know what everyone’s motives are, the performances prove even more satisfying (as do a couple of corny shadows, staged to keep us guessing).\n\n\tAccording to a conversation Carnahan sets in the garage, the cops in “The Rip” make roughly $80,000 a year risking their lives to recover money earned from selling drugs and other serious crimes. At one point, Baptiste holds up a modest stack of bills and wonders aloud how just that amount might change her life. Imagine what $20 million could do. “The Rip” was made for nearly five times that sum, and though it’s hard to make sense of Netflix accounting, the money clearly went to good use — unless you count a lousy epilogue, set on Florida’s fakest looking beach. Surely they could’ve found a few more bucks.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe countdown to the 98th Academy Awards has begun, and Lewis Pullman and Danielle Brooks are announcing the 2026 Oscar nominations Thursday morning.\n\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” is expected to be the major frontrunner after it won four Golden Globes earlier this month. It took home best motion picture – drama, supporting actress for Teyana Taylor, and Anderson won best director and screenplay. Taylor and her co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Chase Infiniti, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro are also in the mix for Oscar recognition, in addition to many of the film’s artisans.\n\t\n\n\tRyan Coogler’s “Sinners,” a vampire drama set in the 1930s South, is also predicted to be a major Oscar player. It’s expected to land Oscar noms for stars Michael B. Jordan and Wunmi Mosaku, Coogler’s original screenplay and several below-the-line categories. According to Variety’s awards editor Clayton Davis, “Sinners” could land as many as 15 nods, which would break the all-time record for Oscar nominations currently held by “All About Eve,” “Titanic” and “La La Land.”\n\n\n\tConan O’Brien returns to host the 2026 Oscars on March 15.

    "body": "\n\tThe Mediapro Studio, Infinity Hill and IP4 have banded together to co-produce “The Blue Box” (“La Caja Azul”), a Spanish-language thriller set against the world of dating apps.\n\n\tThey are joined by MoJo Global Arts and Sepia Films, Film Suez, Salta Violeta, Tronito, Life Is One, and Habethy Films as producing partners.\n\n\tStarring Gustavo Bassani, a lead in Emmy-nominated “Yosi, the Regretful Spy,” and Argentina’s Luisana Lopilato (“The Marriage App”), the suspense drama centers on Pablo (Bassani), a young, wealthy but solitary man traumatized by a fatal car accident. He meets Lara (Lopilato) through a dating app tied to an exchange of the titular blue box. As their relationship grows, Lara draws Pablo out of his shell. But an anonymous warning alerts Pablo that Lara may not be all that she seems.\n\t\n\n\t“What begins as an intimate connection gradually turns into a tense psychological game of cat and mouse, forcing Pablo to confront both his past and the true nature of the woman he is falling in love with,” the synopsis concludes.\n\n\n\t“The Blue Box” “allows us to explore the conventions of classic thrillers,” said Argentine director Martín Hodara, who directed all episodes of “Yosi, the Regretful Spy” alongside showrunner-writer-director Daniel Burman and writer-helmer Sebastián Borensztein. “Through its narrative mechanisms, we can delve into the psychology and inner tensions of the characters.”\n\n\tDescribed as a contemporary take on the themes of desire, control, memory and family trauma, the feature is slated for release later this year.\n\t\n\n\t“It is the kind of bold, original filmmaking that highlights the complexities of our modern world through a classic genre story. We are thrilled to collaborate with our production partners to bring Martín Hodara’s groundbreaking vision to audiences around the world,” said JC Acosta, head of The Mediapro Studio U.S. & Canada, a production-distribution powerhouse based in Madrid with 53 offices across the world. Its productions have earned two Academy Awards, two Golden Globes, two Daytime Awards and multiple Goya Awards.\n\n\t“We love this film for its relentless drive to keep audiences on the edge of their seats and constantly surprised,” added Axel Kuschevatzky of Infinity Hill. “Moreover, working alongside such an extraordinary team of actors, technicians and producers makes the entire experience a dream come true.” Founded by Kuschevatzky, Cindy Teperman and Phin Glynn, Infinity Hill’s notable credits include the Oscar and BAFTA-nominated “Argentina, 1985,” winner of a Golden Globe.\n\n\tThe thriller’s multiple producers include Kuschevatzky, Teperman, Delfina Montecchia, Pablo Iacoviello, Sharon Wins, Morris Ruskin, Helena Thom, Anthony Epp, Mariano Peluffo, Gonzalo Arias and Mariano Suez.\n\n\tAcosta, Francesca Ricagni, Tina Pehme, Kim Roberts, Ari Tan, Joseph Mellicker, Glynn, Lopilato and Bassani serve as executive producers.\n",

The report also states surveillance footage captured her final moments.\n      \n\n          The medical examiner's findings note the injury occurred when she fell backward from a seated position on the rooftop parapet.\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Carrie died from blunt traumatic injuries after falling from the rooftop of a parking structure in Valencia, California, back in October.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Carrie's husband, Scott Romney -- Mitt's brother -- had reported her missing to the Sheriff's Department. He told authorities she previously drove her car off a cliff two years earlier and had struggled with anxiety, per the report.\n      \n    \n          At the time of her death, Carrie was also in the middle of a divorce. Scott filed in June, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\" The couple married in 2016, and Carrie was Scott's third wife.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Carrie Elizabeth Romney\n              \n                          \n                Mitt Romney\n              \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Drugs & Alcohol\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

'cause TMZ has learned she'll testify before Congress on supporting franchise businesses tied to her expanding salon franchises.\n      \n    \n          Sources familiar with the situation tell TMZ ... \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\" star will be testifying on behalf of the International Franchise Association Thursday, speaking from firsthand experience as a business owner whose hair salon brand -- Lunatic Fringe -- has now grown to 9 franchise locations nationwide.\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          We're told Angie plans to advocate strongly for franchisees, whom she views as a living example of the American Dream, especially for women and immigrants ... a message that's deeply personal for her. Angie's parents immigrated from Greece, and our sources say she sees franchising as a pathway to ownership, independence, and generational opportunity.\n      \n\n          And here's the historic twist ... this will make Angie the first Real Housewife to formally testify before Congress, marking a major milestone for the Bravo universe.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          While no Real Housewives star has previously testified before Congress as a reality TV personality, Bravo's influence in Washington isn't entirely new. Lisa Vanderpump has addressed Congress, lobbying lawmakers to take action against the Yulin Dog Meat Festival and support a House resolution to end the dog and cat meat trade.\n      \n    \n          Still, Angie's appearance stands apart ... blending pop culture, entrepreneurship, and public policy in a way we haven’t seen before.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Lisa Vanderpump\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Real Housewives\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

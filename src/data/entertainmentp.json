    "body": "\n\tAll3Media International has teamed with Korean production companies Luyworks Media and Something Special to bring a local adaptation of the reality competition format phenomenon “The Traitors” to South Korea, with actor Cha Seung-won tapped to host.\n\n\tThe Korean version marks another significant expansion for the Dutch-originated format, which has become a global juggernaut since its 2021 debut on RTL 4 in the Netherlands. More than 30 territories across six continents have commissioned local versions, while over 50 territories have broadcast episodes through tape sales.\n\t\n\n\tCha Seung-won brings considerable star power to the project, having built a career spanning dramas, films and variety shows. His credits include dramas “The Greatest Love,” “Our Blues” and “The Tyrant,” films “Believer,” “Night in Paradise” and “Uprising,” and variety series “Infinite Challenge,” “Three Meals a Day” and “Korean Hostel in Spain.”\n\n\n\t“We are very happy to announce the production greenlight of ‘The Traitors’ Korea and working with the nation’s beloved actor Cha Seung-won as the host of the Korean version,” said Yul Han, CEO of Luyworks Media and executive producer of the Korean adaptation. “It is a tremendous honor to be working with actor Cha Seung-won, whom we have long considered the most fitting host for ‘The Traitors’ while producing the Korean version. Despite his busy schedule, he has shown such affection for the program that he has even proposed ideas unique to the Korean version.”\n\n\tJin Woo Hwang, president of Something Special, added that the collaboration represents an opportunity to showcase K-entertainment production values. “Working on a project with the top-notch production house Luyworks Media and actor Cha Seung-won are an opportunity that cannot be missed,” Hwang said.\n\t\n\n\tThe format’s appeal has proven remarkably durable across markets. Created and developed by IDTV and POSVIDEO in cooperation with RTL Creative Unit, “The Traitors” was named K7’s Format of the Year 2024 and has collected multiple Emmy, BAFTA and RTS awards, along with a Rose d’Or, Asian Academy Creative Award and Producers Guild Award.\n\n\tIn the U.K., the celebrity edition’s finale drew 15 million viewers to the BBC and has been renewed for a second season. The U.S. version, hosted by Alan Cumming, has earned five Emmy Awards including outstanding reality competition program and outstanding host. Both the U.K. and U.S. versions are produced by Studio Lambert, part of All3Media.\n\n\tTony Ziran Tang, VP of sales Asia for finished programs and formats at All3Media International, said: “His stardom now stands alongside Claudia Winkleman (U.K.), Alan Cumming (U.S.), and Karan Johar (India). We are confident Luyworks will deliver an outstanding version that resonates with Korean audiences and fans across the region.”\n\n\tLuyworks Media has established itself as a force in the competition reality genre with productions including “Physical 100” for Netflix and “Street Woman Fighter” and “Show me the Money” for CJ ENM. Something Special operates as Korea’s first TV format agency focused on creative talents, with a track record developing over 150 format titles across 26 territories.\n\n\tAll3Media International serves as global partner for “The Traitors,” handling format, tape sales and licensing worldwide. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Frankenstein” director Guillermo del Toro is set to receive a BFI Fellowship, the film organization’s highest honor.\n\n\tThe award will celebrate del Toro’s “extraordinary contribution to film and the distinctive artistry that runs through his work across animation and live action, and as a Mexican filmmaker, in both Spanish and English,” according to a press release. “Fusing dark horror and gothic fantasy, drawing on folklore, fairytales, literature, sci-fi, religion and comic books, del Toro creates lavish fantastical cinematic worlds and characters, often monsters and creatures, of deep emotional complexity.”\n\t\n\n\tDel Toro, who won the Oscar for best picture and director for 2017’s “The Shape of Water,” will be honored with the fellowship at the annual BFI Chair’s dinner in May 2026. He will take part in a public career conversation at the BFI Southbank and will be celebrated with a retrospective of his films, in addition to programming his own film season at the BFI at a later date. A series of masterclasses will also be given by del Toro to aspiring filmmakers in the BFI Academy, a remastered 4K version of his 1992 debut “Cronos” will be rereleased by the BFI and he will make a visit to the BFI National Archive.\n\n\n\t“This is the honor of a lifetime and a thrilling moment in a storyteller’s life: to join a rarefied pantheon and to be recognized by the BFI,” del Toro said in a statement. “I have been greatly influenced by British film and have enjoyed a long and fruitful collaboration with great talent on both sides of the camera going back decades. I thank everyone at the BFI for this great distinction. I will endeavor myself to work hard to prove myself worthy of their faith in me.”\n\t\n\n\tAdded BFI chair Jay Hunt: “Guillermo del Toro is an extraordinary filmmaker with a long relationship with the BFI who has consistently championed British talent.  His collaborations here speak to the strength of our wider screen industries and the skilled people who power them.  His body of work is instantly recognisable as boldly imaginative and fantastical. In awarding a BFI Fellowship to Guillermo del Toro, we recognize his remarkable contribution to cinema and the inspiration and magic he has brought to filmmakers and audiences here and around the world.” \n\n\tDel Toro joins the ranks of previous BFI Fellowship honorees including Christopher Nolan, Tom Cruise, Spike Lee, Tilda Swinton, Martin Scorsese, Orson Welles, Elizabeth Taylor and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe new 4K remaster of “Mad Men” debuted Monday on HBO Max, and it came with an unexpected barf machine. Variety has confirmed that Lionsgate will soon deliver a corrected version of the “Mad Men” 4K episodes, after an unedited version of the series was accidentally uploaded to the service instead.\n\n\tViewers who went to binge “Mad Men” on Monday noticed some sloppy edits — including one scene in the Season 1 episode “Red in the Face,” where crew members could be clearly seen feeding fake vomit into a machine for the character of Roger Sterling (played by John Slattery).\n\t\n\n\tWrote one fan on X: “The new 4K transfer of ‘Mad Men on HBO somehow does not have any of the post-production edits added in, which means you get stuff like this where you can see the crew member manning the puke machine after Roger has too many oysters lmao.”\n\n\nthe new 4K transfer of mad men on HBO somehow does not have any of the post-production edits added in, which means you get stuff like this where you can see the crew member manning the puke machine after Roger has too many oysters lmao pic.twitter.com/HNgPRNOsla— johnny (@bigrackspart7) December 2, 2025\n\n\n\tFans also noticed that some episode titles have been mislabeled — which appear to have now been fixed. (At press time, the edited episodes had not yet been uploaded, as the vomit wrangler could still be seen.) Insiders confirmed that the incorrect files were delivered to HBO Max by mistake.\n\n\tThe Emmy winning series starring Jon Hamm made its 4K premiere on Monday on HBO Max; before that, the Lionsgate series had only been available on AMC+ and ad-supported platforms.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJon Hamm as Don Draper and John Slattery as Roger Sterling, “Mad Men” (Justin Mintz/AMC)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustina Mintz/AMC\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Mad Men,” which is set in one of New York’s most prestigious advertising agencies in the 1960s, won four consecutive Emmy awards for best drama, among 16 total wins and 116 nominations. Created by Matthew Weiner, the show ran from 2007 to 2015 on AMC.\n\t\n\n\tHamm played Madison Avenue’s biggest ad man (and ladies’ man) Don Draper, starring alongside Vincent Kartheiser, Elisabeth Moss, January Jones, Christina Hendricks, Rich Sommer, Aaron Staton, Kiernan Shipka, Jessica Pare and John Slattery.\n\n\t“’Mad Men’ is a great addition to the HBO Max library of iconic content,” said Royce Battleman, EVP of global content acquisitions at Warner Bros. Discovery said when HBO Max announced the acquisition last month. “We are thrilled that HBO Max will provide fans the opportunity to enjoy the series in a fresh way with an enhanced 4K viewing experience.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew Zealand-based sales outfit Black Mandala has secured rights to develop an animated series and action figure line based on “Guerreros del Manana” (Warriors of Tomorrow), the cult Argentine superhero toy franchise that launched in the 1980s.\n\n\tThe deal, closed during Ventana Sur, was signed with Guillermo Zanocco, who created the original toy line, and filmmaker Nicolás Onetti, who will direct the upcoming animated series.\n\n\n\tOriginally released during the same era as Mattel’s “He-Man” figures, the locally produced Argentine superhero toys have evolved into highly sought-after collectibles on the international market over the past four decades.\n\t\n\n\tBlack Mandala plans to unveil both the official series teaser and the first collectible sculpture at Argentina Comic-Con on Dec. 5 in Buenos Aires.\n\n\tThe animation project has assembled a creative team including Aníbal Morales as animation director, Luciano Onetti composing the score, and Germán Suracce handling sound design. Artist Martín Cardozo will create the new line of collectible sculptures.\n\n\tVeteran voice actor Ricardo Alanis, known for Spanish-language dubbing work on Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme films, as well as “Power Rangers,” will perform the teaser’s voice-over.\n\n\tMichael Kraetzer and Onetti founded genre specialist Black Mandala in 2017. Operating from Auckland, the company has built a catalog of more than 150 titles focused on independent horror and genre cinema, maintaining a presence at major film markets worldwide. \n\n\tThe company’s recent slate includes  “Nightfall – A Paranormal Investigation,” a debut feature from young Australian filmmakers Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens; “Beyond the Drumlins,” directed by Dan Bowhers; Gene Dolders’ “The Blade Cuts Deeper”; and horror anthology “The Last Supper.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPalme d’Or-winning Japanese filmmaker Kore-eda Hirokazu is in post on a live-action adaptation of Fujimoto Tatsuki’s bestselling manga “Look Back,” with the film scheduled for a late 2026 release.\n\n\tThe project marks the first live-action version of Fujimoto’s coming-of-age story about two young women pursuing their dreams of becoming manga artists. Kore-eda, whose credits include Palme d’Or winner “Shoplifters,” Cannes competition titles “Monster,” “Broker” and “Like Father, Like Son,” is currently in post-production on the feature after shooting in Nikaho City.\n\t\n\n\t“On a return trip from Kyoto to Tokyo, I was drawn to a figure’s back on the cover of a book in a bookstore at Shinagawa Station,” Kore-eda said. “Without thinking, I picked a copy up – that was my first encounter with ‘Look Back.’ That night, I read it in one sitting. Though manga and film are different genres, as a fellow creator, I felt the desperate resolve behind this work. I could feel, almost painfully, that Mr. Fujimoto simply couldn’t move forward without creating this piece. For me, ‘Nobody Knows’ was that kind of work.”\n\n\n\tThe director was approached by producer Koide Daiju to adapt the manga and subsequently met with Fujimoto to express his appreciation for the work, which evolved into a commitment to bring the story to the screen.\n\n\tFujimoto, creator of the hit manga “Chainsaw Man,” which has sold over 34 million copies worldwide, said, “If director Kore-eda is going to film ‘Look Back,’ I have nothing more to say. I’m looking forward to it.”\n\n\tOriginally published on Shonen Jump+ in 2021, “Look Back” generated significant attention upon release, recording over 2.5 million views on its first day and selling 900,000 copies in Japan. The manga has since been published in 37 countries and sold more than 750,000 copies internationally.\n\t\n\n\tThe property received an animated adaptation in 2024, directed by Oshiyama Kiyotaka and produced by Studio Durian. That film topped the Japanese box office for two consecutive weeks and grossed some $12.8 million during its theatrical run before being acquired by Prime Video for streaming. The animated version screened at festivals including Annecy International Animation Film Festival and won multiple awards for best anime of the year from organizations including the Japan Academy, the Japan Film Critics Association and the Tokyo Anime Festival.\n\n\tKoide is producing the live-action version under his K2 Pictures banner, which will also distribute the film in Japan. Distribution deals are already in place for Taiwan and South Korea. Goodfellas will handle international sales outside Asia.\n\n\tKore-eda also has another feature in the works. “Sheep in the Box,” produced by Fuji Television Network, Gaga, Toho Co. and Aoi Pro., is scheduled for an early summer 2026 release. Goodfellas is handling sales outside Asia for that project, while Gaga holds rights for Asian territories. As revealed by Variety, Neon has acquired the film for the U.S., U.K. and Australia.\n\n\tK2 Pictures, launched in 2023, is an independent production and distribution company focused on moving away from Japan’s traditional “production committee” conservative model in favor of a fund-based approach. The company collaborates with notable creators including Kore-eda, Miike Takashi and animation studio Mappa.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBD Wong issued a lengthy apology on Threads after making a “racist comment” on social media. The “Law & Order” and “Jurassic World” actor ignited backlash after commenting on a post from Mike Holston (aka @TheRealTarzan, which boasts 16 million Instagram followers). Holston, who is Black, posted a photo with an animal and used the caption: “Name this animal…wrong answers only.” Wong allegedly replied in a since-deleted comment: “It appears to be a Black man.”\n\t\n\n\t“Y’all I made a very bad joke,” Wong later wrote on Threads after the comment started making the rounds on social media. “As most people in hot water do, I deleted it for Damage Control but it’s out there & continues to hurt & disappoint & I’m really sorry about the hurt part. Super dumb, but I tried to follow the ‘Wrong Answers Only’ prompt with the wrongest answer. This succeeded only in that it was Super Wrong. I know nobody gets a free pass. I’m sorry if this #wtfbd moment tarnished any respect you may’ve had for me. & thanks if you advocate for an internet that’s safe for everybody.”\n\n\n\tThe actor added several hours later, “I want to elaborate on a racist comment I posted, to clarify that I recognize & accept the responsibility for how terrible it is. It’s also wrong to try to ‘explain’ anything, & I think that causes a further breaking down in folks’ trust.”\n\n\t“Let me please spend the energy on how wrong I know it is to exploit a despicable, racist trope in the supposed spirit of humor; I do know better, but again no excuses. Very sorry for the hurt I’ve caused & for taking lightly something so deeply injurious,” Wong concluded.\n\t\n\n\tWong is best known for playing Dr. George Huang on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” which he began playing during the series’ second season. After an extended hiatus after Season 17, Wong returned to the role earlier this year during the show’s 27th season. His other notable TV roles include Whiterose in “Mr. Robot,” for which he was nominated at the Emmys for guest actor in a drama series, and Hugo Strange in “Gotham.” Wong originated the role of Dr. Henry Wu in 1993’s “Jurassic Park” and reprised the character in the first “Jurassic World” trilogy from 2015 to 2022.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is ramping up its investment in Southeast Asian storytelling with a comprehensive slate of industry initiatives unveiled at Indonesia’s Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, including a two-year partnership with the Indonesian Producers Association (APROFI) and the debut of its Creative Asia program in the region.\n\n\tThe streaming giant’s expanded collaboration with JAFF, timed to the festival’s 20th anniversary, signals a long-term commitment to nurturing local talent and production infrastructure across Southeast Asia, where Netflix content is experiencing explosive growth. Global view hours of Southeast Asian titles surged nearly 50% from 2023 to 2024, with more than 40 regional titles charting in Netflix’s Global Top 10 in 2025 alone.\n\t\n\n\t“Even as the streaming world has changed, our support for this region has stayed consistent — and proudly local,” said Malobika Banerji, senior director of content for Southeast Asia at Netflix. “Our commitment isn’t just to the creators already in the spotlight. We care just as deeply about those who are still finding their voice — the next generation of filmmakers, storytellers, and crew who will shape the future of this region.”\n\n\n\tNetflix and APROFI formalized a two-year memorandum of understanding aimed at strengthening Indonesia’s production ecosystem. The partnership will fund workshops for above- and below-the-line talent, provide on-the-job training opportunities on Netflix projects, and foster industry dialogue. As part of the collaboration, the partners introduced Indonesia’s first national guidebook on production safety, designed to help productions operate more safely and sustainably.\n\t\n\n\tIrene Umar, Indonesia’s vice minister of creative economy, welcomed the initiative at the signing ceremony. “The Indonesian film industry is a significant engine of our economy. Netflix has played a major role in the global film and television ecosystem, and I truly appreciate its contribution to Indonesia,” Umar said. “Our gotong-royong (community driven) approach means in-depth collaboration across stakeholders — and here we see the clearest evidence of it with the film industry, associations, and key players like Netflix and APROFI coming together. I believe this MoU marks the beginning of a long-term partnership.”\n\n\tNetflix partnered with JAFF to bring Creative Asia to Southeast Asia for the first time, following the program’s 2024 debut at Busan International Film Festival. The initiative connects emerging filmmakers with established creators including Joko Anwar, Erik Matti, Kimo Stamboel, Kulp Kaljareuk, Carlo Ledesma and Indonesian author Dee Lestari.\n\n\t“I’m honored that JAFF is the next film festival to host Creative Asia, after its inaugural launch at BIFF in 2024,” said Ifa Isfansyah, JAFF founder and executive director. “What’s truly meaningful is that Netflix, BIFF, and JAFF all share a common vision: to nurture Asian cinema as a reflection of the dynamic and vibrant societies in our region.”\n\n\tProgramming included a creator conversation between Anwar (“Nightmares and Daydreams”) and Matti (“BuyBust”) on navigating creative risk and cultural specificity, plus a panel on Southeast Asia’s emerging zombie genre featuring Kaljareuk (“Ziam”), Ledesma (“Outside”) and Stamboel (“The Elixir”). The latter title recently ranked No. 1 among non-English films globally for two consecutive weeks and entered the Top 10 in 75 countries.\n\n\tNetflix hosted the second season of Reel Life Film Camp at JAFF, following a successful inaugural edition last year. The practical training initiative, supported by the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, received more than 800 applications across both seasons and hosted nearly 100 participants in intensive online, in-person and on-the-job training covering production, post-production, visual effects, editing and screenwriting. The streamer also launched a unit still photography workshop designed to help local photographers transition into new creative roles, and ran a second season of its Screenwriters Fellowship in collaboration with Soda Machine Films.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix offered a first look at its Southeast Asian pipeline, including behind-the-scenes footage from the highly anticipated remake of Thailand’s period drama “Ploeng Phra Nang.” Matti confirmed his upcoming Filipino series “BuyBust: The Undesirables” will stream next year.\n\n\tIn a major literary adaptation announcement, Netflix will partner with celebrated Indonesian author Dee Lestari to adapt three of her best-selling novels — “Rapi Jali,” “Aroma Karsa” and “Perahu Kertas” — into original series. The projects will be helmed by female filmmakers, with Sabrina Rochelle directing “Rapi Jali” and Kamila Andini tackling “Aroma Karsa.”\n\n\tThe festival also hosted the world premiere of “Lupa Daratan” (Lost in the Spotlight), an Indonesian comedy from writer-comedian Ernest Prakasa about an award-winning actor who loses his ability to act just as he’s cast to play the president of Indonesia.\n\n\tTo date, more than 100 Southeast Asian titles have appeared in Netflix’s Global Top 10, with regional content ranking in the Top 10 lists of over 80 countries this year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron wants moviegoers to know before “Avatar: Fire and Ash” opens in theaters worldwide that no generative AI was used in the making of the sequel. Speaking to ComicBook.com, the Oscar winner said he was speaking out on the matter not because he has a vendetta against generative AI but because he has an issue with people thinking anything but real human actors were used to bring the “Avatar” characters to life via performance capture technology.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m not negative about generative AI,” Cameron said. “I just wanted to point out we don’t use it on the ‘Avatar’ films. We honor and celebrate actors. We don’t replace actors. That’s going to find its level. I think Hollywood will be self-policing on that. We’ll find our way through that. But we can only find our way through it as artists if we exist. So it’s the existential threat from big AI that worries me more than all that stuff.”\n\n\n\tCameron and his “Avatar” actors have spent decades trying to show the industry just how real the performances are in the franchise. Zoe Saldaña, who plays Neytiri in the “Avatar” movies, told Beyond Noise earlier this year that performance capture “is the most empowering form of acting” because “it gives us the credit, the ability to own 100 percent of our performance on screen.”\n\n\t“Performance capture means that ‘Avatar’ wouldn’t exist if Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, myself, and the entire cast didn’t get up and put those dots on our faces,” she said. “From the archery, the martial arts, the free diving, the scuba diving – so that you can hold your breath under water for longer than five minutes – to the language [James] conceived out of thin air, to physically training with former gymnasts, circus performers, and acrobats so you can learn how to walk like an extraterrestrial human species… That’s all us, and a group of incredible stunt actors that make our characters feel bionic. God bless them. With the technology that Jim creates, he gives the artist the power of complete ownership.”\n\t\n\n\tCameron told Variety in 2024 as part of a Saldaña cover story that the Oscars are overdue to recognize her work as Neytiri in the “Avatar” franchise.\n\n\t“I’ve worked with Academy Award-winning actors, and there’s nothing that Zoe’s doing that’s of a caliber less than that,” the director said. “But because in my film she’s playing a ‘CG character,’ it kind of doesn’t count in some way, which makes no sense to me whatsoever. She can go from regal to, in two nanoseconds, utterly feral. The woman is ferocious. She is a freaking lioness.”\n\n\tCameron remains dedicated to human performers when it comes to the acting in his movies. He told CBS’ Sunday Morning last month that it is “horrifying” how generative AI can now create artificial actors for the screen.\n\n\t“You’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character,” Cameron said. “They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It’s like, no. That’s horrifying to me.”\n\n\tBut Cameron is not entirely anti-AI when it comes to Hollywood. He announced in September 2024 that he was joining the board of directors for Stability AI, the company behind the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion. Speaking on the “Boz to the Future” podcast earlier ths year, Cameron explained his interest in AI by saying the future of blockbuster filmmaking hinges on being able to “cut the cost of [VFX] in half.” The director openly admitted he was exploring ways to responsibly filter AI into the VFX workflow.\n\n\t“If we want to continue to see the kinds of movies that I’ve always loved and that I like to make and that I will go to see — ‘Dune,’ ‘Dune: Part Two,’ or one of my films or big effects-heavy, CG-heavy films — we’ve got to figure out how to cut the cost of that in half,” he said at the time. “Now that’s not about laying off half the staff and at the effects company. That’s about doubling their speed to completion on a given shot, so your cadence is faster and your throughput cycle is faster, and artists get to move on and do other cool things and then other cool things, right? That’s my sort of vision for that.”\n\n\tFor Cameron, the intersection of AI and Hollywood will be in the post-production process and not in the actual filmmaking and development process. In an interview with CTV News, the director expressed doubt over AI being able to write “a good story” and phase out screenwriters.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Cameron: “I just don’t personally believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what other embodied minds have said — about the life that they’ve had, about love, about lying, about fear, about mortality — and just put it all together into a word salad and then regurgitate it…I don’t believe that’s ever going to have something that’s going to move an audience. You have to be human to write that. I don’t know anyone that’s even thinking about having AI write a screenplay.”\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” opens in theaters Dec. 19 from Disney and 20th Century Studios.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn November 2023, the day that Cassie Ventura filed a lawsuit against Sean “Diddy” Combs, director Alexandria Stapleton and Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson got to work. Together, the pair created Netflix’s “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” a four-part docuseries that not only dives into the many allegations of abuse, racketeering and sexual assault leveled against Combs, but is also a closer look at his rise, from the creation of Bad Boy to the absolute power he began to have over those around him.\n\t\n\n\tThreaded through the four episodes, now all available on Netflix, is video footage of Combs, beginning six days before his 2024 arrest and indictment. While under federal investigation, Combs had someone follow him with a camera, capturing his conversations with lawyers, his increasing agitation about the mounting accusations and his mingling with fans. The videos were “obtained legally,” Stapleton tells Variety, despite Combs’ team slamming the previously unseen footage, calling it “unfair and illegal.” (See the full statement from his team here.)\n\n\n\tStapleton later said in a statement: “We moved heaven and earth to keep the filmmaker’s identity confidential. One thing about Sean Combs is that he’s always filming himself, and it’s been an obsession throughout the decades. We also reached out to Sean Combs’ legal team for an interview and comment multiple times, but did not hear back.”\n\n\tIn July 2025, Combs was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution and is currently serving a 50-month sentence in federal prison.\n\n\tIn a conversation with Variety, Jackson and Stapleton detail the process of making the docuseries, share what they wish they could ask Diddy had they been able to interview him — and what they think happens after his sentence is up.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLet’s start with the timeline — when did you start working on this? \t\n\n\tAlexandria Stapleton: We’ve been working on this for a very long time. The development started the day that Cassie’s suit dropped. The great thing about working with Netflix and the choice to work with them was really built on that there was no mandate of a timeline. We started this series before there was even an indictment. So we had to process the backstory, but then also be very observant and responsible with what was playing out publicly with his trial, and subsequent sentencing.\n\t\n\t\tObviously, one of the most shocking parts in the doc is the video, threaded through all four episodes, showing Diddy in the days leading up to his arrest. At what point did you obtain that, and what can you say about how?\t\n\n\tStapleton: There’s no date I can give. It was obtained legally. We were not present when it was being shot, so all I can say is after that.\n\t\n\t\tI have to say, our team was really shocked by it, and I said, “Only 50 would have this!”\t\n\n\tJackson laughs, does not respond.\n\t\n\t\t50, you weren’t in the doc on camera. Was that ever an option for you?\t\n\n\tCurtis “50 Cent” Jackson: I’m the only person who didn’t get a chance! I didn’t say anything because Alex was in control of what was going on.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Notorious B.I.G. and Sean Combs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe series very much argues that Diddy had something to do with both Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur’s deaths. How did you legally get that across the finish line?\t\n\n\tJackson: Well, you’ve got Keffe D [Duane Keith Davis] right there in California awaiting trial and saying it so openly. Nevada feels like what he’s saying is sufficient enough for them to try him on it. Just bringing those points up doesn’t bring up anything that doesn’t already exist.\n\n\tStapleton: This has been a very long path of Keffe D being very vocal. He even wrote a book. And the tapes — we’re not making this up. This isn’t stuff that’s put in the series because we heard it, and got another person to vet it: It’s through law enforcement, agencies, recordings and materials, including the work that [Detective] Greg Kading has done on this investigation. So, we’ll see how everything plays out next year. But it definitely was important to have this conversation and to have all of the context in it, because so often when we talk about Biggie and Tupac, it’s just the East Coast vs. West Coast thing has been distilled down to just these two guys, and there were no other external forces that were a part of their tragic deaths.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWere you surprised by the Diddy verdict?\t\n\n\tJackson: I was surprised by the choices. It was pretty intense the way they came for him — with three different agencies at one time. I haven’t seen them do that, even for Mafia bosses. That’s why I called him “the gay Teflon Don.” I said that only because he’s the only person who’s incarcerated at the current moment for paying male sex workers to travel across state lines. I think they did overcharge him — charges versus what he’s actually found guilty of. He didn’t do things that I thought he would, like file for bankruptcy right away, because the system itself is going to eat him alive. It’s going to be the lawyers who take the money from him. He’s not going to have anything by the time he touches down. You’ll see in the process just how expensive it is to have eight attorneys work on a case like that. You don’t blink when you do it, because you know your life is online. If you don’t win the case, you don’t have the results; it’s over. Period. And you could tell that the lawyers convinced him that he would be home on that date. That’s what the tears are about [in the scene] in that chair. He already booked speaking engagements, like he would be out and running around, doing different things. They really convinced him he was coming home.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAubrey O’Day’s interview was extremely heartbreaking, her reading a claim of what happened to her — but doesn’t know what is true. Can you talk about that interview?\t\n\n\tStapleton: I started communicating with her pretty early on in the process, and she really wanted to find the right place to share this story. So much of what was going on was just shock and awe, headlines of people dropping all kinds of crazy, salacious things. And I think Aubrey knew that this could look really bad for him or look really bad for her. She wanted the freedom to be able to talk about how conflicted she felt. She wanted the ability to know that she could be very honest, that she’d looked up to this guy. I don’t know how to feel about this. I don’t know how to process it. I don’t know if it’s real. She decided to share that story with us. And I think it’s really wild, and part of the gray area. It’s so complicated in matters of sexual assault. Unfortunately, it’s not a black and white situation. It can be very complex.\n\t\n\t\tDawn Richard, who sued Diddy for sexual battery and assault, was a big part of the doc. Did you reach out to have her be a part of it? \t\n\n\tStapleton: We did. We reached out to her and did not hear back.\n\t\n\t\t50, some people think you’re producing this because you’ve had this ongoing beef with Diddy. How do you feel about that?\t\n\n\tJackson: Well, they characterize me being vocal about him saying things that were inappropriate around me as us having a beef, but we’ve never done anything to each other. I’ve hired his sons to work in my scripted programs. I don’t have anything against him or his family. I’m a heterosexual man, I don’t like what a man talks to me like I’m a woman. He’s asking to take me shopping; that’s something that maybe a man does as a gesture to a female that he likes, and that made me uncomfortable. I was vocal about not wanting to participate in his parties or be around them. So they felt like this has been going on for 20 years, but what 20-year beef has no attacks from either side?\n\t\n\t\tMinus your comments on social media.\t\n\n\tJackson: If you look at the things that you hear, other people’s accounts of his behaviors, it doesn’t match up with beef. It matches up with us having a disagreement. He says inappropriate things in front of people all the time, and they excuse it, because he is who he is and his financial position. They look up to him.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSince the arrest happened, people started bringing up celebrity names, wondering who would be exposed. You show a photo of Leonardo DiCaprio at a white party, but there weren’t any exposé-type interviews. Did you have a list of dream people whom you tried to interview?\t\n\n\tJackson: Every party wasn’t a freakoff.\n\n\tStapleton: Yeah, the pictures of the white parties, there’s no judgment made.\n\n\tJackson: That would be maybe the party happening after the party or after people decide to leave. Those people in the pictures, they’re not all guilty of the same behavior. But they’re not saying anything out of the gate, because they just go, “If I’m not in it, I don’t have to say anything about it.” It does confuse the public about what the culture is comfortable with, because when they don’t hear anything, they say, “Well, that’s what they do.” They, as a collective. And it’s not true. It’s not everybody’s behavior.\n\n\tStapleton: We only had four hours, and this started with a story about Sean Combs. To go off into these different pockets of discovery, potentially, that’s another film on the horizon for another film team. We went after every lead that we could, but there was so much work that was necessary to do to give context to the allegations of Sean Combs. It’s such an anomaly, in a way, that you would have one man who has currently over 80 civil suits still pending against him, many of which are rooted in sexual assault claims. 50 and I have always said that this doesn’t necessarily feel like this is the marker of the end of the story. It feels like the end of a chapter, potentially. There’s a lot more that I think will probably come to light as a result of the civil process.\n\t\n\t\tIs there a possibility that you could make a second part of this after he’s out?\t\n\n\tStapleton: I think this story continues. I don’t know if I only want to make these documentaries, but I do think that one thing that did not happen, did not materialize was an interview with him. It’d be very interesting to hear what he says to all of this. What are some of the holes that he can fill with his own backstory?\n\t\n\t\t50, would you want to do more?\t\n\n\tJackson: Sure — I think we missed a lot of stuff.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat did you not get to tell?\t\n\n\tJackson: What happens is that people change when they’re extremely loyal to their comfort. I think when they see that they won’t be receiving the financial support that they were receiving, they’ll look for ways to create new revenue and new finances to come through. They just want to do it with whoever will make it most lucrative and effective… When you get charged with RICO, conspiracy, you don’t see people walk out of there with two years. That’s a win. He won that case completely. But when you see that, it also signals to the people who were around it that they no longer have a gravy train. So they jump ship, and things start to happen, and you start to see different things from different people. I think that’ll be even clearer as he comes back and is not able to continue with the lifestyle the same way. Two years, I can’t imagine the upkeep on these things — expenses of the lifestyle after two years without income, while also having to spend on the legal defenses.\n\t\n\t\tWhen he gets out, do you think he could have a career again in the music industry?\t\n\n\tJackson: He might be able to produce artists.\n\t\n\t\tYou think people would work with him again?\t\n\n\tJackson: New people. New artists would work with him in the studio, but he won’t be able to visibly be out as a brand because people won’t be in support of that.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKirk Burrowes in “Sean Combs: The Reckoning”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIf you were able to interview Sean Combs, what questions would be at the top of your list?\t\n\n\tJackson: Was it worth it, playboy?\n\t\n\n\tStapleton: I’d want to know a lot more about his childhood, teenage and college years, kind of the genesis. I’d have more questions about some of the characters that we weren’t able to bring to life completely, like Corey Jacobs and Wolf, some of these guys from Mount Vernon that were part of his crew that I think were really instrumental in the creation of his empire, and what their roles were, and his opinion on that.\n\t\n\t\tThat is part of the bigger theme in this documentary — what gets excused when you’re in a position of power. Alex, was that something you wanted to hone in on from the start?\t\n\n\tStapleton: Yes, the uber takeaway that I hope people get from the series is that maybe we stop looking at Sean Combs, and we start looking at ourselves, our society, our community and what we allow people that we idolize to get away with. I think that over the decades — Kirk Burrowes states it best — there’s a pattern to a lot of the behaviors. We always manage to make excuses for it. Even with Cassie’s tape from the Intercontinental dropping. It was really fascinating as a filmmaker. We’re watching how that’s being treated by the public. At first, there was a shocking reaction. Then the commentary started to change. It was, “What was said before? What was she doing that may have warranted him to hit her? What were they involved in?” It’s crazy what we, as a collective, start to say to justify things that we see with our own two eyes.\n\t\n\t\tWhat did you learn about yourselves during this process?\t\n\n\tJackson: That I’m almost the polar opposite of these people. I’m not interested in a woman not remembering the sexual experience. It’s the most confusing shit ever to me.\n\n\tStapleton: I used to go by “Alex,” and after I made Reggie Jackson doc, I always use “Alexandria,” because I want young female filmmakers, young girls, to know that we can make stories like this. We deserve to make stories like this and that’s really important to me.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTusday night’s “Dancing With the Stars” special may be celebrating the holiday season with musical performances and festive routines, but co-host Julianne Hough is also celebrating Season 34 — and her long-running career on the show.\n\n\t“I feel like it’s just part of my DNA now, and I think that’s because I have been on the show for so many years in different roles, there’s almost a familiarity for other people as well,” she tells Variety.\n\t\n\n\tHough joined the series in 2007 as a pro dancer on Season 4, winning both her first and second seasons. She continued on the show through Season 8, leaving ahead of fall 2009’s 9th season. Over the next few years, she returned for specific dances and in 2013, became the first former pro to return as a guest judge, which she did for both Seasons 17 and 18. She then landed a permaneant spot at the table for five seasons between 2014 to 2017 (Seasons 19, 20, 21, 23 and 24) before exiting. With a few more guest judging spots through the years, she rejoined the show full time in 2023 as a co-host for Season 32 alongside Alfonso Ribeiro.\n\n\n\t“My whole life has been dancing, and ballroom dancing specifically. So I’ve been in roles to help the celebrity feel comfortable so that they can come to me for anything, and the pros too. I also know what the judges are looking for,” she continues. “I feel lucky that I’ve just been able to grow up with this show and have it raise me.”\n\n\tThe series hit new highs this season, with Season 34 receiving a record number of votes (72 million on the finale and nearly a billion throughout the season) and the finale raking in 9.24 million viewers, the largest finale since 2016. Many factors contributed to the rise, including TikTok and social media in general, but more than anything, the casting team weas able to find a diverse crowd that brought in muolitple different age groups.\n\t\n\n\t“Where we were 20 years ago, being a reality star was almost a bad taste in your mouth. It had this connotation. But today, with social media, everybody has a platform to show who they are,” says Hough. “It’s been more wildly — not just accepted, but embraced. It’s encouraged to show the authenticity of who you are. And I think the show is built on being vulnerable and authentic and showing progress and growth versus just showing the excellent results always.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJulianne Hough, Daniella Karagach and Jenna Johnson on the “DWTS” holiday special. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPersonally, it’s been a safe haven — pun intended — for Hough, no matter what is going on in elsewhere in her personal or professional life.\n\n\t“My whole life has been about pivoting and trying different things, moving out of the country and training. This has been the most consistent thing in my life, and it’s always been the thing that I’ve been able to come home to and still feel like I’m being challenged and accepted,” she explains. “It’s a place to still discover myself, but in a safe, contained environment where it’s all about growth and expansion through rhinestones and glitter.”\n\n\tAlong with the positive — massive ratings and viewership — comes the negative: criticism and online bullying led to multiple people speaking out, pros, celebrities and judges alike. And it’s hard to avoid.\n\n\t“What I’m realizing is everybody wants to be seen and everybody wants to feel significant and important. The only way to really do that is if you go viral. And the fastest way to go viral is, unfortunately, through negativity,” says Hough. “Negativity breeds negativity. Positivity breeds positivity. We have this magic sauce where this show is so positive, so it’s breeding positivity, but then it’s also activating people to have polarity, and that’s what creates tension… Everybody has a right to say how they feel. It’s just unfortunate when it’s not necessarily true, or they’re looking to tear somebody apart.”\n\n\tWhile polarity can be a positive thing — “If there’s no polarity, then things just kind of like fizzle out,” she notes — there must also be a line between sharing opinions and being harmful. “You don’t have to be really, really mean. It’s almost dangerous with some of the comments people have been saying.” \n\t\n\n\t“I’ve never had people talk to me like that,” she says of the personal mean comments she received this season, but knows that sometimes their remarks “are not wrong.”\n\n\t“I think that’s what kind of makes me charming and funny and real, is that I do mess up sometimes. Instead of being defensive, I either play along with it, or I just ignore it,” she says. Others have received more vitriol, she adds — and sometimes it gets too much to ignore, especially for the dancers.\n\n\t“It takes a toll, because not only are they just getting feedback from people. They’re pouring so much energy in day after day. They don’t get a day off, their bodies are exhausted,” she says. “When your body is exhausted, you are so much more vulnerable and emotionally raw, so you’re susceptible to getting your feelings hurt.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlfonso Ribeiro, Julianne Hough, Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhitney Leavitt, for her part, was arguably the best celebrity dancer on the season. However, when “Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” came out and revealed she returned to the reality show only to audition for “DWTS,” it appeared audiences turned on her and she was eliminated that week. Leavitt and partner Mark Ballas later went on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and revealed the awful bullying they were receiving.\n\n\t“I think everybody was shocked [by her elimination],” the host says, adding that she was extremely sad to see people tearing Leavitt down for “being ambitious” and following her goal. “This woman is a star, and this has been her dream. Don’t knock somebody for finding the way to make that happen. I get protective when people are tearing other people down.”\n\n\tHough says she feels for all the cast members — but really doesn’t understand those who complain about Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough’s judging. “This is their job,” she says. “Let them do what they do.”\n\n\tDespite it all, she agrees that this has been the most competitive season in years — something she’s thrilled is back. And with the camaraderie among the cast, it proves people can be both respectful and want to win at the same time.\n\n\t“There were a few seasons where the show was really nice, but where’s the competition? Life, society, and culture shifts and the pendulum swings. I think a few years ago, we were in the participation award for everyone era. I think the pendulum has come back a little bit. Now, it’s okay; we can all support each other, but also it’s a good thing to feel competitive, to want to win,” she says. “Winning is not about other people losing; winning is about giving it your all and feeling like you put everything out there and not feeling bad. So I love that you can feel the energy of competition in the show again, and still have everybody rooting for each other. We are rooting for people to do their best.”\n\t\n\n\t“Dancing With the Stars” holiday special airs on Tuesday, Dec. 2, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+, streaming the next day on Hulu.\n",

He was transported to a local hospital, where he died Monday, after being taken off life support.\n      \n    \n          Police have yet to officially release the cause of death, but we're told the rapper's family isn't buying it was suicide.

Our source says POORSTACY was the child's father, and the woman is the mother.\n      \n    \n          It's unclear if they were in the hotel room when he shot himself.\n      \n    \n          We're told police released the room back to the hotel later Saturday to be thoroughly cleaned.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          We broke the story of POORSTACY's death, and at the time, there were unconfirmed rumblings it might have been suicide.\n      \n    \n          Sadly, that's what police believe happened to the 26-year-old artist, according to our sources -- but it sounds like his family members might demand further investigation.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

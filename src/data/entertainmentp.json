    "body": "\n\tAt Sundance, it’s a tale of two festivals. There are the films and the parties. And then there is Tao.\n\n\tA pop-up version of the Hollywood-beloved nightclub has been ruling Sundance after dark for over two decades. While wealthy locals relish in drunken nights at ski resorts and cinephiles cram into Main Street’s dive bars, Tao has given coastal industry players a place to call home after endless days promoting movies.\n\n\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Paris Hilton, Jon Hamm, Jason Momoa, Ryan Gosling, C-suite agents from WME and CAA and countless others have danced on those tables and thrown up hands for performances by the likes of Jennifer Lopez, 50 Cent and Diplo.\n\t\n\n\tProperly opened in 2005, Tao Sundance welcomes armies of stars, agents, publicists and media each year. As a private event teeming with liquor sponsors, the booze is free and flows through the early morning. Presently held at Park City’s Utah Film Studios, the cavernous space creates a downtown warehouse vibe decked out in après ski accents. The pop-up is microcosm of Sundance itself: At first an under-the-radar jewel box, soon transformed into a mass commercial endeavor populated by great artists and powerful insiders.\n\n\t“Our premise was to do something really great for the town, for brands, and something to strengthen relationships with key people that support and frequent our places all year round,” said Noah Tepperberg, co-CEO of Tao Hospitality group, reflecting on a 25-year run that will leave Park City this year for good as the festival heads to Colorado.\n\n\tTepperberg recalled the first ever Tao Sundance, which kicked off with a party for the band Good Charlotte’s concert film “Fast Future Generation.” Founders Joel and Benji Madden served as opening night DJs.\n\t\n\n\t“The second night was a party for Diego Luna, Gael Garcia Bernal and Pablo Cruz, who were up-and-coming producers at the time. Our final night was a part for Ryan Gosling’s ‘Half Nelson,’ which was a huge film and huge for us,” he said.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Lopez and DJ Chase B perform at TAO Park City in 2025.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Casamigos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs a young reporter covering celebrity and events, Tao was the most important invite to land when I started attending Sundance years ago. It was and still is a mix of high and low culture; a place where the Hungarian cinematographer of a war documentary could pound tequila while Lil Jon sang his banner hit “Shots!”  \n\n\tIt’s also been the site of occasional bad behavior. In 2015, actor Emile Hirsch attacked a female executive from Paramount Pictures, an incident that led to charges of aggravated assault and intoxication. He was later sentenced to 15 days of jail time and community service, and has since reflected on the moment as the worst of his life (defined by a pattern of binge drinking).\n\n\tOver the years, Tao grew in size and sponsorships from corporate brands and production labels. There are a staggering seven partners for this final Park City year, including Casamigos, Evian, Moet Hennessy, Jack Daniels, Hendricks, Red Bull and Q Mixers.\n\n\t“We’ve been able to create a nightclub in the mountains of Park City, throwing late night parties in parking garages and film studios that people and brands want to be a part of. But our event has always been about delivering the same level of hospitality our guests are accustomed to any of our venues around the world,” said Gabby Fernando, Tao’s vice preident of special projects. “That approach allowed Tao Park City to grow alongside Sundance and continue to be one of the most sought after events of the festival every year, and years to come.”\n\n\tOn Saturday — or “the last dance,” as organizers have been calling it — snug-jeans-wearing pop star Benson Boone set off the party with a backflip and a performance of his song “Beautiful Things.” Patrick Schwarzenegger and Maude Apatow cheered him on, as cast members of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” and “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” circulated. Even revelers chugging cocktails and Whispering Angel rosé got sentimental as hundreds streamed out around 3:30 a.m.\n\t\n\n\tBut the dance will go on. Tepperberg said he and his team will jet to Colorado next week to scout potential venues for Tao Boulder.\n\n\t“It’ll be a different experience because Boulder’s a college town with different energy and a different culture,” said Tepperberg. “But somehow, every year, we get the biggest names and our year-round guests to show up.”\n\n\tSee you there.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEthan Hawke might not be hanging from skyscrapers or clinging to a flying Airbus à la Tom Cruise in “Mission: Impossible” adventures, but he was game to do his own stunts in “The Weight,” a historical action-drama that’s premiering at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\tIn the Depression era movie, Hawke portrays a widower who is torn from his daughter and gets sent to a brutal work camp. So when the warden (Russell Crowe) tempts him with early release if he smuggles gold through a deadly wilderness, he goes to great lengths to complete the mission in order to see his child again. His brutal journey involved recklessly driving a car, throwing a fair share of punches and holding his breath underwater in a freezing river. \n\t\n\n\t“Tom Cruise has totally changed what’s expected for actors. Some part of me is getting angry over the years because everyone somehow feels like they’re less if they use a stunt team,” Hawke said at Variety‘s Sundance Studio presented by Audible. “What I liked about our movie is there were no ridiculous stunts. It’s human. It’s not about things blowing up, so most of the stunts were things we could do. They weren’t superhero things.”\n\n\tDirector Padraic McKinley, reuniting with Hawke after the Western “The Good Lord Bird,” interrupted his star to say that Hawke was underselling his herculean efforts.\n\n\t“Ethan is not saying that he did every single stunt, including driving those old cars with insane clutches,” McKinley said. “He did every single one, except one little wide shot after he almost tore his hamstring off the bone.”\n\n\tAt the core of the film is the bond between a father, who is willing to travel far and wide, and endure brutal conditions, to reunite with his daughter. \n\t\n\n\t“It’s about love. That’s what makes the script timeless,” says Hawke, adding that his performance was influenced by his own experiences as a parent. “Some of the best action movies of all time are oriented about something real.”\n\n\tAt times, filmmaking has been a family affair for Hawke. He directed his daughter, Maya, in the 2023 indie “Wildcat,” a biographical drama about the author Flannery O’Connor. While Ethan remained behind the camera for that collaboration, he said he’d be eager to one day act alongside Maya.\n\n\t“Heck yeah, are you kidding me?” Ethan said. “I want to be with the star of ‘Stranger Things’…”\n\n\tMaya Hawke played Robin Buckley in the Netflix sensation “Stranger Things,” which recently wrapped its fifth and final season. Ethan offered some advice to his offspring now that the show has ended.\n\n\t“Time to move on. You got to do it, and move on,” he said. “Don’t look back.”\n\n\tEthan Hawke, for his part, seems to be constantly moving forward. The 55-year-old actor appeared in several films — theater drama “Blue Moon” and horror sequel “Black Phone 2” among them — and two television shows — crime dramedy “The Lowdown” and historical drama “The American Revolution” — in 2025 alone. He just earned his fifth Oscar nomination, and his first in the lead actor category, for “Blue Moon.” Hawke said he has recently been wondering about his work ethic.\n\n\t“Why can’t I sit still? Why do I work so much?” Hawke asked. “I love it. I am amazed when people do one movie every five years. I really like making movies. I started when I was young and fell madly in love with the process. You can’t do it alone. It has magic attached to it. Once you felt that feeling of making something bigger than yourself and you watch it connect with audiences, I chase it. I’m just chasing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tACLU held a panel at the Sundance Film Festival about the state of freedom of expression and creative freedom in today’s America.\n\n\tModerated by ITVS president and CEO Carrie Lozano, panelists, including filmmakers, an ACLU attorney, and producers, discussed how mounting pressure from government censorship, corporate gatekeeping, and self-censorship is affecting their ability to tell challenging stories.\n\n\n\tTandem Pictures’ Julie Christeas, who is in Park City with the Molly Ringwald film “Run Amok,” explained how a location she had secured for an upcoming narrative project abruptly became unavailable.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m an indie producer and, like many, many indie producers, we go into real communities in our country and abroad to make our work,” Christeas said. “This year, after I made ‘Run Amok,’ I went to Ohio to make another film, and we were meant to film in a university. As the date got closer and we were calling to make plans, the university started to explain why we would no longer be welcome at that university. The reason was that the movie that we were making had a queer protagonist, and they were being threatened actively about their funding being taken away so severely that they didn’t know if they would be able to have classes on true American history, the foundation of slavery and any classes that had to do with female leadership.”\n\n\tChristeas said that she was shocked.\n\n\t“My producing partner and I both said, probably naively [to the university staff], ‘You have the chance right now to stand up to fascism. You can say no, and you can have us here and take our money.’ And this poor guy was just like, ‘I can’t. I will lose all my funding, but if I take that funding, I might be beholden to a new set of rules about what I can and cannot educate our students about.'” (Christeas did not state the name of the university.)\n\t\n\n\tDirector Sharon Liese spoke about the difficulties she faced while making her documentary “Seized,” about a small, family-run newspaper in Kansas that was raided by police in an overt attempt to stop the paper from reporting on their corruption. Liese said it took her over a year to gain access to subjects outside the newspaper staff.\n\n\t“There were rumors going around in the town that we were hired by the paper to do a documentary about [the editor in chief] and about how great he was,” Liese said. “A lot of fake news was going around. Everyone said they believed in the First Amendment and that the paper’s reporters were important and should be able to write about whatever they wanted to write about, except if it had to do with [their town]. So we really had to talk to the people in the town. And we worked really hard to talk to the mayor first. So, we got the mayor on board with talking to us and did a very long interview, and [the town] realized that we wanted to tell more of a panoramic view of what actually happened there.”\n\n\tAbby Cook, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Utah, said that while the filmmakers on the panel “tell wonderful stories through film,” she tells “these weird stories through complaints and lawsuits and stuff.”\n\n\tCook cited a recent lawsuit the ACLU is working on against Utah’s book-banning.\n\n\t“Utah is a little unique in that one of the worst things that it does is it allows individual districts to pull books off their shelves, and if three districts pull a book off their shelf, it goes on this big list, and it gets taken off every shelf,” Cook said. “In Utah we currently have 22 books on that list, including Toni Morrison’s ‘The Bluest Eye’ and by Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou’s ‘I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.'”\n\n\tCook explained that the ACLU is representing four author plaintiffs and two student plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\n\n\t“The young people we’re working with here are absolutely amazing,” she said. “They do such a good job in the lawsuit of saying that these books reflected my experiences back to me in a way that no one else has been able to do my entire life. I need access to that type of information in order for me to be the kind of citizen that you want me to be, in order to not feel alone at the loneliest time in my life in high school.”\n\t\n\n\tLozano said that although the government defunded ITVS, it is still very much alive. She described how the PBS platform has not backed away from political docs that tackle current events despite pressure from government leaders.\n\n\t“We all saw what happened to Jimmy Kimmel,” Lozano said. “We might have been aware of the ’60 Minutes’ piece that was pulled at CBS, or some of the settlements that happened pretty early on last year between some of the networks and the administration. One of the things that [TVS] talks about a lot is self-censorship. When we first started to feel the squeeze at ITVS, one of the things that our lawyer said to us was do not self-censor. That is a First Amendment violation.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHow does one build an enduring fandom? That was the question at the center of Variety and Adobe’s Storytelling for Fans — The Future of Audience Engagement panel at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. \n\n\tModerated by Variety’s Angelique Jackson at the Adobe House, panelists included Stacy Martinet, VP of marketing strategy & communications at Adobe; Jason Cassidy, vice chairman atFocus Features; Dawn Yang, global head of entertainment partnerships at TikTok; Mason Gooding, whose latest acting role is in Sundance premiere “I Want Your Sex”; and Hannah McMechan, screenwriter of “KPop Demon Hunters.”\n\t\n\n\tMcMehan found an enduring fandom with the explosive success of “KPop Demon Hunters,” whose passionate fanbase mirrors the hyper-engaged ecosystems of both KPop stans and anime devotees. Online, the “Demon Hunters” fandom thrives via TikTok edits, fancam-style character clips, lore breakdown threads and fan art that treats the animated characters like real music groups. The film received an Oscar nomination for best animated feature and best original song.\n\n\t“We believed that the fans would just eat this alive if we did it justice,” McMehan said about tapping into the KPop fanbase. “All of us were KPop fans so the whole time we were like, if this finds the KPop fans, it will blow up. But if it’s buried and it’s not marketed, then maybe no one will see it.”\n\n\tThe animated film did, of course, end up reaching KPop fans. The movie shattered records on Netflix, becoming the streamer’s most-watched film of all time with over 518 million views in roughly six months.\n\t\n\n\tFrom an actor’s perspective, tapping into a fandom is about “recognizing what a thing has to say — what a movie, TV show, book is trying to articulate to its audience and articulating that through performance in a way that resonates with the people watching it,” said Mason Gooding.\n\n\t“I love that this generation, in juxtaposition to the ones that came before, has kind of removed the focus on the individual,” he continued, “and allowed a more communal or social dynamic to take place in the landscape of art, specifically as it relates to film.”\n\n\tNo platform is better at fostering this communal, social dynamic than TikTok, which allows projects to organically intersect with the culture at large. Yang, the global head of partnerships at TikTok, pointed to fan edits made for Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” which she and the team believed had a direct correlation with the film’s high box office success. After opening weekend, the platform was immediately flooded with a range of original content about the film — from montages highlighting Coogler’s filmography, anime “Sinners” mash-ups (yes, that’s a thing) and, of course, Michael B. Jordan fan edits.\n\n\t“People saw the movie, started talking about the movie, started doing some edits, and then there was that very high box office result,” she said. \n\n\tMcMechan also points to TikTok as a driving force of “KPop Demon Hunters” success.  “That is why that movie blew up,” she said, pointing out that there was effectively no other marketing aside from the trailer. “It was fully just people making edits on TikTok — and then it blew up.”\n\n\tGooding perhaps put it best, wrapping up the panel: “There’s storytelling for fans, but more important is the storytelling with fans.”\n",

Nowadays, Titans-head coach Mike Vrabel in his rookie season as head coach and quarterback Drake Maye in his second season in the league lead the Pats with one more win to get to the Big Game.\n\n\n\tOn the other side of the football, the Broncos haven’t made it to the AFC Championship game since 2015.

Quarterback Jarrett Stidham steps in Nix’s place as starter.\n\n\tBoth have the same regular season record 14-3, so it’s likely going to be an equally matched game between two AFC teams.

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe temperature may be a few degrees warmer than usual this Sundance, but stars still descended on Park City this week in a variety of rich sweaters, billowing sweaters and textured layers that are offering us a wealth of winter style inspiration.\n\n\tJenny Slate and Chris Pine, whose film “Carousel” opened the fest on Thursday afternoon, are perhaps the most stylish duo on Main Street — and they saved their best ensembles for off the carpet. Before the premiere of their Judd Apatow film, Slate stepped out for a packed day of interviews in a dark grey turtleneck sweater, oversized brown leather jacket and straight-leg jeans. Later, she swapped out the jeans for a black maxi skirt, rounded out with black leather boots. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for IMDb\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPine, meanwhile, went cowboy chic for his first look of Sundance week — a fitting style for Park City, long defined by casual and rugged Western style, as well as his character’s own denim-forward looks in “Carousel.” On Thursday, he walked Main Street in a denim button down over a white tank and tucked into lightwash jeans. He layered with a mustard-olive hued coat. \n\n\tThe stylish pair star in the lyrical drama about a divorced doctor who reconnects with his high school girlfriend after she returns to their hometown. The film, which premiered at the Eccles, received mixed reviews. Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote in his review that it’s “a flawed drama that can be disjointed, but by the end the movie feels worth it: mannered at times, touchingly real at others.”\n\n\tWhat we do know: Pine and Slate have mastered their winter style looks.

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivalry” stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie carried the Olympic torch Sunday in Feltre, Italy, as part of the Milano Cortina 2026 relay.\n\n\tDressed in pink-and-white tracksuits, the two are seen in videos popping up on social media showing the duo holding the torch, smiling and waving to the crowds. At one point, they held each other’s hands over their heads.\n\n\t“This is crazy,” Williams said while holding the torch.\n\t\n\n\tWhen a fan told him, “Italy loves you a lot,” Williams said, “I love Italy.”\n\n\n\tIt was announced on Thursday that the actors had been selected as official torchbearers during the relay, which will conclude on Feb. 6 in Milan ahead of the opening ceremony. A date and location of their participation had not been announced ahead of time.\n\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry,” based on Rachel Reid’s queer hockey romance novel series Game Changer, became an overnight hit when HBO Max dropped the first two episodes of its six-part premiere season over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n\tHudson and Williams star as Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, professional hockey players who fall in love after carrying on a steamy decade-long secret affair.\n\n\tStorrie and Williams have become global celebrities. They made their awards ceremony debut as presenters at the Golden Globes in early January. Not long after, Hudson jetted to Milan for Men’s Fashion Week, walking in the Dsquared2 show and attending the Giorgio Armani runway presentation.\n\n\tHBO Max acquired the show from Canadian streamer Crave. Both greenlit Season 2 in December.\n\t\n\n\tThe Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 will be available to stream on HBO Max in Europe, including in Italy and Germany for the first time as part of the streamer’s expansion. In the U.S., the Olympics will be broadcast on NBC and streamed live on Peacock.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChris Pratt recently told Entertainment Weekly that he suggested an AI “actor” play the tyrannical AI judge in his new sci-fi thriller “Mercy.” However, the idea was quickly shut down by the production, and Rebecca Ferguson was cast in the role.\n\n\t“I remember talking about the various people who could play these characters, and early on, I was like, ‘Should we have it be an AI, where the judge is actually AI, and we create an AI?’ And everyone was like, ‘No, I don’t think so,'” Pratt said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, I don’t think that’s a good idea at all.’”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “So it was actually never a possibility any more than anything is a possibility when you’re zeroing in on what the outcome is going to be and what the choices are that you’re going to make. It’s a collaborative effort.”\n\n\tPratt then recalled another off-the-wall pitch he had early in the planning stages of “Mercy.”\n\n\t“But one of my pitches early on was like, ‘What if [my character] could pick the judge, and I could pick Oprah, or I could pick anyone I want. Because ultimately it’s just a face on a [screen].’ And I thought that would be funny to have Oprah do it.”\n\n\tAmazon MGM’s “Mercy” follows Pratt as Chris Raven, a cop from the near future who is on trial for the murder of his wife (Annabelle Wallis). Ferguson’s AI judge gives him 90 minutes to prove his innocence or face immediate execution.\n\n\tThe themes surrounding the oppressive nature of AI made the emerging tech a focal point during the “Mercy” press tour. At the film’s New York premiere, Pratt told Variety that he’s confident he’ll never be replaced by AI. He called the panic surrounding synthetic AI performers like Tilly Norwood “all bullshit.”\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t feel like someone’s gonna replace me that’s AI,” Pratt said. “I heard this Tilly Norwood thing, I think that’s all bullshit. I’ve never seen her in a movie. I don’t know who this bitch is. It’s all fake until it’s something.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFiction is filled with criminals who lead bifurcated double lives, but Angelo Doyle (Patrick Dempsey) takes this to an extreme. By day, Angelo is a suburban salesman mourning his late wife and helping his daughter Maria (Odeya Rush) prepare for the birth of her first child, all while wearing a quarter-zip vest that screams “dorky dad.” But when it’s time for his real job, Angelo transforms. The vest comes off; the Italian, custom-tailored suit comes on. The station wagon gets parked at an abandoned-looking garage where it’s swapped out for a Porsche. And Angelo drives into New York City, where he gets paid to kill people.\n\t\n\n\tWhat makes Angelo’s situation so unusual is that he doesn’t just hide his job from his family, but also his family from his job. Angelo’s handler Dutch (Michael Imperioli), a chef who’s somehow tapped into the underworld, has no idea his former schoolmate ever married, let alone is widowed. Dutch does know about Angelo’s brother Michael (Richard Clarkin), who’s in a home with advanced dementia— but just because his existence predates the split. Only when Angelo starts to show early signs of the same illness that’s left Michael unable to speak in full sentences does the rigid, long-lasting divide between his two worlds start to come crashing down.\n\n\n\t“Memory of a Killer” was developed by Ed Whitmore and Tracey Malone and inspired by the 2003 Belgian film “De Zaak Alzheimer,” which was in turn adapted from a novel. (Aaron Zelman and Glenn Kessler serve as day-to-day showrunners.) Yet unlike “Best Medicine,” another Fox midseason debut adapted from an international title, “Memory of a Killer” doesn’t translate its compelling logline into the vernacular of American TV. Disjointed and bland in the two episodes provided to critics in advance, this assassin drama has some execution issues.\n\t\n\n\tTo start, Dempsey convincingly plays only one of Angelo’s two faces. The former McDreamy plays the forced, upbeat enthusiasm of repressed grief well enough, but when it’s time for Angelo to return to his Eye-talian, mafia-connected roots, he’s out of his comfort zone — especially opposite a legendary “Sopranos” alum like Imperioli, who’s essentially playing Artie Bucco, the proprietor of Tony’s favorite restaurant. (By contrast, in the home scenes, it’s a wooden Rush who seems outmatched by Dempsey.) It’s impossible to believe Angelo’s kept up this deception for decades when the audience can’t buy in for the length of a single episode.\n\n\tIf “Memory of a Killer” can’t find the realism in Angelo’s objectively implausible setup, it could at least lean into the fantasy. But when the hitman’s cognitive decline starts to manifest, the slippage between reality and delusion is played disappointingly straight. Angelo forgets passcodes and gets lost in a forest, symptoms helpfully foreshadowed for him by one of Michael’s nurses. The objectively amusing ways such slippages can cross over with his chosen profession — like leaving a gun in his pied-a-terre’s refrigerator, where it’s discovered by a one-night stand — aren’t played for laughs. Nor is there much visual experimentation to show how Angelo experiences his crumbling reality.\n\n\tAngelo’s targets and adversaries are a succession of generic organized crime tropes: the mobsters’ accountant; a Chinese American gangster. With the exception of a hand-to-hand fight sequence in an elevator, there’s little intrigue to his exploits. The great Gina Torres is a welcome presence as an FBI agent investigating a shooting that brings the violence of Angelo’s vocation onto his home turf. (Apparently, it took the mystery assailant a few days to figure out what his family and friends couldn’t for many years.) She’s still not enough to keep the crime elements of this show from feeling as half-baked as the character work. Angelo’s wife was killed by a drunk driver before the events of the show, and one gets the impression she was written out to spare the effort of imagining this stubbornly surface-level character in a long-term intimate partnership. \n\n\tYou never want to write a show off entirely based on just a few episodes, even a start as unpromising as that of “Memory of a Killer.” The remainder of the season could fill in Angelo’s backstory to explain how he got to this place, or use his illness as a way to look back on his choices and regrets. At least to start, however, the drama is a disappointingly flat take on its inherited premise. Angelo may be a killer, but the show he leads sure isn’t.\n\t\n\n\t“Memory of a Killer” premieres on Fox on Jan. 25 at 10 p.m. ET, with remaining episodes airing weekly on Mondays starting Jan. 26.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“What does it mean to be a storyteller in 2026?”\n\n\tThat was the big question posed at Sundance’s Variety & Audible Cocktails & Conversations panel. Brent Lang, Variety‘s Executive Editor, led a discussion that included Tony and Grammy award-winning actor, rapper, writer and producer Daveed Diggs, comedian and actress Iliza Shlesinger and Marshall Lewy, Audible’s head of regional content in North America.\n\n\n\tWhile there’s not one simple answer, the panel provided keen insight into the modern landscape of storytelling. Diggs, for instance, spoke to the need for empathy and connection through storytelling, especially as many people in society are going through a difficult time.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a time of great opportunity, and in other ways it feels very heavy,” Diggs said. “There’s a lot of weight on the shoulders of storytellers right now, because there are so many. I think we’re at an empathy deficit, and that’s kind of our thing; it’s what we do. It feels like we are needed right now. Sometimes when people need me, I really don’t show up. I get stressed out. It’s a stressful time to be a storyteller, but also, I think, when you can get over yourself and lean into it, it’s a really important time. It’s nice to feel needed, even though I wish it were better.”\n\n\tShlesinger was honest about the challenge of being open and authentic as a storyteller.\n\n\t“I think we’re all so scared,” she said. “For a long time, regardless of how you lean politically, whatever baggage you’re carrying, whatever you represent, there’s a fear that you’ll be judged, canceled, cast out. Everybody’s got their weight that they carry. I think it takes a lot of guts to be authentic and own your story. Sometimes you’re like, ‘I don’t have something as traumatic, or I don’t have a family story like that, or I didn’t have this or that.’ To decide that you don’t matter and your story doesn’t matter because it isn’t the same as someone else’s that might be lauded … perhaps if you feel that way, you shouldn’t try. Artists are those who dare to try and have the balls to say, ‘My voice matters. My story is just as valid.'”\n\t\n\n\tLewy discussed the importance of specificity in storytelling and how that can, in fact, make the experience more universal.\n\n\t“Being here at Sundance and just thinking about what an incredible legacy this festival has and how it started and how it is a corrective to a lot of things that are going on … I think for me, it’s the specificity of telling a story and how the more specific you are, the more universal it becomes, regardless of what it’s about,” Lewy says. “In 2026, when we’re struggling to connect and understand each other, you go deep, you have courage, you tell your story, and then people will relate. It doesn’t matter if it’s about a girl in Gaza halfway around the world, or it’s the town you grew up in: That is, to me, the power of storytelling.”\n\n\tWatch the entire conversation above.\n",

In fact, he admitted he would've taken on the dangerous climb even without a paycheck if he had permission from the building.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          \"If there was no TV program and the building gave me permission to go do the thing,\" Honnold told the paper, \"I would do the thing because I know I can, and it'd be amazing.\"\n      \n    \n          The stunt took just over an hour and a half and added another jaw dropping achievement to Honnold's resume. He famously became the first person to free solo climb El Capitan in Yosemite in 2017.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Netflix\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

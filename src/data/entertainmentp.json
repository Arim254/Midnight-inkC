Speaking of former cast members, Dorinda Medley has just joined the reunion show ... but not as a full-time cast member, as of now.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported, Blink49 Studios cut ties with Jill on Tuesday after she posted and then deleted an Instagram video on Sunday criticizing Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show. The clip, later reposted on X, sparked backlash and ultimately led to her termination from the E! project.\n      \n    \n          Sources close to Jill told us she believes she was punished for expressing an opinion, especially when other Housewives have weathered controversies without losing their roles. Our sources tell us she quickly deleted the video after realizing she misspoke and, after rewatching the performance, came to better understand its cultural significance.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to reps for E! ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jill Zarin\n              \n                          \n                Bad Bunny\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Real Housewives\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

It’s an incredible outpouring of support -- but doctors haven't found a match yet.\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          Bijou's blood type is B negative, and she needs donors with B negative, B positive, O negative or O positive blood. Despite the overwhelming response, our sources say more people are being urged to get tested because of how critical her condition is.\n      \n\n          Right now, we're told it's touch and go by the minute. She's alert and able to communicate, but there are good hours and bad hours. Dialysis takes a serious toll, and when she's especially sick, she's resting extensively. Our sources say she'll likely remain hospitalized until doctors find a match.\n      \n    \n          According to our sources, her loved ones are by her side. Her half-sisters -- singer Chynna Phillips and actress Mackenzie Phillips -- have been visiting, and her daughter, Fianna, has been spending time with her mom as well. When Fianna isn't at the hospital, we're told Bijou's being cared for by family members and a close family friend.\n      \n    \n          We broke the story ... Bijou is hospitalized at UCLA under the care of Dr. Anjay Rastogi at CORE Kidney. She received a kidney transplant in 2017 from a friend, but that kidney has failed. Her rep told us she suffered serious complications, including the BK virus, which triggered cellular and antibody rejection.\n      \n    \n          Bijou was born with underdeveloped kidneys and spent the first three months of her life in the NICU on dialysis. She's battled kidney disease ever since.\n      \n      ",

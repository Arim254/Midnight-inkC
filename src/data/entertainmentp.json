    "body": "\n\tOf all the mysteries in the Netflix thriller “The Beast in Me,” the least suspenseful is its source of inspiration. The limited series co-stars Matthew Rhys as Nile Jarvis, a reclusive New York real estate heir widely suspected of murdering his first wife who decides to unburden himself to a suspicious interlocutor. Nile’s conversation partner is a writer, not a filmmaker, but scrubbed of proper nouns, this synopsis is more or less identical to that of “The Jinx,” the 2015 docuseries that made now-convicted killer Robert Durst a household name.\n\t\n\n\tMost of the invention in “The Beast in Me,” which was created by novelist Gabe Rotter (the “X-Files” revival) and showrun by Howard Gordon (“Homeland”), is reserved for Nile’s interviewer. Claire Danes is one of few actors with a TV résumé as long and decorated as Rhys’, and their pairing positions “The Beast in Me” as an equally matched intellectual duel. But it’s Danes, not Rhys, who serves as an executive producer on the show, and whose character is its true center. (Conan O’Brien and Jodie Foster are also executive producers, though neither star appears on screen.) Agatha “Aggie” Wiggs is an author living in the shadow of her own Pulitzer-winning success, holed up in a charming-but-crumbling pile of a Long Island house left empty by the collapse of her family a few years earlier. Trapped in a prison of her own grief while struggling in vain to produce a follow-up to her hit memoir, Aggie is mired in debt and stuck in a rut — until Nile moves in next door and offers her an intriguing new subject. \n\t\n\n\tRooting “The Beast in Me” in Aggie’s perspective means that, while the series is absorbingly paced and makes full use of the lead actors’ talents, it’s also lopsided as a character study. There’s a certain logic to this choice of focus, beyond Danes’ behind-the-scenes involvement: our collective fascination with suspected serial killers leaves more room to shade in the less fetishized party. But that choice, which leaves Nile more hazy and less defined than his real-life analog, also comes with trade-offs. The very selling point of putting Danes and Rhys in a “The Journalist and the Murderer”-type scenario — the prospect of two live-wire performers on opposite sides of the table and the electric, unpredictable chemistry that might ensue — is also the most disappointing aspect of the show, because there’s such a clear precedent to compare it to. \n\n\tEven if “The Beast in Me” doesn’t have official source material, the show seems to understand its own adjacency to true crime; producing director Antonio Campos previously spearheaded the scripted adaptation of “The Staircase.” But it’s that same adjacency that brings up memories of Durst’s strange, meandering conversations with “The Jinx” creator Andrew Jarecki, hours of tape that gave a true eccentric enough rope with which to hang himself. (Durst was convicted of murder in 2021, partly on the strength of evidence uncovered by “The Jinx,” and died in prison in 2022.) Rhys’ Nile is disturbingly intense, yet can’t match the sheer oddity that made Durst both so compelling to watch and so believable as a killer. Rather than getting to the root of what makes Nile tick, “The Beast in Me” positions him as a foil to Aggie and a catalyst for her development. These are workmanlike tasks, done well but aiming well below the transcendence of other duets between psychopaths and their pursuers, both scripted and not: Clarice and Hannibal, Eve and Villanelle or — yes — Jarecki and Durst.\n\n\t“The Beast in Me” fills itself out with enough plot to propel a satisfying binge, and provide the momentum that might otherwise come from the friction between Aggie and Nile. Aggie and her ex-wife Shelley (Natalie Morales), a painter, split up after their 8-year-old son died in a car accident. The writer tries to throw herself into a book about the unlikely friendship between Supreme Court justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia, but finds herself distracted by backed-up pipes and barking dogs. (Production designer Loren Weeks outfits the Oyster Bay home in enviable amounts of packed bookshelves and richly patterned wallpaper, making the space a highly attractive cocoon.) The latter belong to her new neighbor Nile, so Aggie’s already primed to dislike him when an FBI agent named Brian (David Lyons) bangs on her back door and tells her to stay away. “He’s not like us,” Brian warns, and Aggie soon has reason to believe him. The day after she and Nile first have lunch, the likely-drunk driver who may have caused the fateful crash goes missing, leaving a seeming suicide note but no body — just like Nile’s first wife.\n\t\n\n\tAs the off-the-books investigation motivates Aggie, Nile has his own reasons to try and clear his name. An AOC-esque city councilwoman (Aleyse Shannon) is drumming up popular opposition to Jarvis Yards, the legacy-cementing megadevelopment Nile co-leads with his father Martin (Jonathan Banks, well-cast as a scowling authority figure but poorly cast as the kind of guy who would willingly spend thousands of dollars on a bottle of wine). Nile hopes Aggie’s work-in-progress can help remake a murderous image that’s not helping his political problem, and recruits his second wife Nina (Brittany Snow) to help charm her into buying his side of the story.\n\n\tThough Aggie is surprised to find that Nile’s former in-laws (Bill Irwin and Kate Burton) completely buy that their mentally ill daughter took her own life, “The Beast in Me” never cultivates a great deal of tension around whether Nile is really someone to be scared of. Nor does the titular question of how much Aggie, who Nile claims shares his “bloodlust” by way of explaining why he’s drawn to her, has in common with her subject keep us on the edge of our seats. Instead, the central question and driving force is how Aggie and Brian will lure Nile out of the walled fortress afforded by wealth and into the trap of spilling his guts to a confessor. The pleasing sensation of watching disparate pieces slowly lock into place pays off like an extended procedural led by name-brand actors.\n\n\tAnd what acting! Danes is so known for maximalist emotion that Carrie Mathison’s crying face is the lasting legacy of “Homeland.” She makes that expression once more in the first five minutes of “The Beast in Me,” which begins with a flashback to the collision that changed the course of Aggie’s life, and stays at a panicked fever pitch throughout. Aggie is drawn tight as a string, a state of mind emphasized by sound design that cranks up every slamming door and gurgling drain even before Nile shows up on the scene. Rhys and the writers may not build a cohesive psychological profile in illustrating Nile’s sociopathy, but he makes a gleeful Mephistopheles as he eggs Aggie on, encouraging her dark side. “The Beast in Me” can’t deliver the payoff of capturing an actual killer in more ways than one, but it can heighten the drama of the hunt. Fiction does have some advantages. \n\t\n\n\tAll episodes of “The Beast in Me” are now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe creators of Emmy-winning drama “Shogun” offered tantalizing glimpses into the ambitious scope of the show’s second season during a discussion at the Disney+ originals preview at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Thursday, promising unprecedented battle sequences and an unexpected romance alongside the series’ 10-year narrative leap.\n\n\tCo-creator and executive producer Justin Marks described the sophomore season as both a sweeping love story and an exploration of war’s devastating cost, teasing visual scale that will push beyond what audiences have seen before. “Part 2 is, I would say two things,” Marks said. “Like the first season, I think part two is a really sweeping, beautiful and you’re never going to see a coming, entirely unexpected love story. It’s also a story of war and the cost of war. There are battle sequences that we’re putting together now in part two. I don’t think you’ve ever seen anything like this kind of scale, this kind of tragedy and this kind of humanity.”\n\t\n\n\tThe new season will jump ahead a decade from the events that concluded season one, a creative choice that Marks said reflects both the realities of modern television production and an opportunity to rediscover the characters in a fresh context. “This show is going to take us a little while to produce. It’s not coming out one year later, and there’s this thing that drives me crazy when you watch a show that ended three years ago, and you get into season two and it’s like five minutes later,” Marks explained. “We’re trying to use this jump as a way to come back to our characters again for the very first time, to see them, to see what’s changed in their lives over the course of the last 10 years, and to rediscover them.”\n\t\n\n\tThe time jump also serves the show’s larger ambitions as what Marks described as “a saga first and foremost.” While the first season centered on agency and power, following “a man intent on bringing about peace from the threshold of war,” the historical reality of feudal Japan’s trajectory means season two will grapple with different themes. “As we know in history, that’s not quite how things turned out for feudal Japan at that time,” Marks noted.\n\n\tCo-creator and executive producer Rachel Kondo said the connection audiences formed with the first season has given the creative team confidence to venture into more challenging territory. “I think it was surprising to us that the audience was drawn to the story as emotionally and as profoundly as they were,” Kondo said. “What we felt in the audience was that they had lent us the most important things. They lent us their time. They lent us their care, they lent us their attention. It’s really the thing that we take into season two, because it’s what emboldens us.” That trust, she suggested, opens creative possibilities. “If we had people follow us into this land of feudal Japan, maybe they’ll follow us into some deeper, more cavernous spaces.”\n\n\tStar and executive producer Sanada Hiroyuki, whose performance as Lord Toranaga Yoshii earned him Emmy and Golden Globe awards, spoke extensively about the show’s impact and what lies ahead. “It was a great surprise, big surprise,” Sanada said. “We got a lot of awards, and for me, especially as a producer and as a leading actor, each time I got a award, that was amazing. I could never have imagined shooting in Vancouver a few years ago.”\n\n\tThe veteran actor, who started as a child actor in Japan and has worked for 40 years locally and 20 years in Hollywood, reflected on pouring all that experience into the first season. “Being recognized in this way is a significant point in my life,” he said. “During the awards ceremonies, the faces of all the people involved, my seniors and teachers, appeared in my mind. In a sense, I feel I was able to repay them.”\n\n\tSanada emphasized the broader significance of the show’s success for Asian talent globally. “The awards I received are not just for this work, not just for Japanese actors, but they represent opportunities expanding for talented individuals from various countries,” he said. “What was once called a dream can now be achieved if you work toward it. I hope this becomes a message.”\n\t\n\n\tHe had encouragement for aspiring actors. “As long as you prepare yourself so you won’t be flustered when your chance comes, by learning language, acting, and physical skills including movement, I believe opportunities like this will come again,” Sanada said. “I think this ‘Shogun’ platform has become an important stage for giving chances to wonderful young talent and introducing them to the world. Please look forward.”\n\n\tSpeaking about working with younger actors, including Asano Tadanobu, who played Yabushige Kashigi in the first season, Sanada said the experience has been enriching. “Working with young actors is always stimulating, and I learn a lot from them as well,” he said. As both an actor and producer on the series, he was able to provide guidance from early production stages, including advising on physical movement, sword techniques and how to sheathe the sword properly. “When good takes were captured, I felt even happier than when I succeeded myself. I worked with a parental feeling of joy,” he said.\n\n\tWhen asked what audiences can expect from the new season, Sanada teased surprises. “This is a historical story, but even those who know what happened in history will be freshly surprised and excited by the twists,” he said.\n\n\tSanada acknowledged the pressure of following up the first season’s success while expressing confidence in the team. “Of course, I have pressure for Season 2, but we have a teamwork from season one, and we have a lot of great new casts, so I can’t wait to start shooting, and I can use my pressure as strength to create even better season two,” he said. Kondo playfully reminded him to rest and take vitamins, noting that the new season will be demanding. Sanada joked that playing the character 10 years older might allow for a quieter performance.\n\n\tThe production is bringing back two directors from the first season, Kamata Hiromi and Fukunaga Takeshi, while adding new voices including Anthony Byrne, Kate Herron and Marks himself to the directorial roster. Marks praised the new directors’ deep engagement with the show’s world. “Anthony and Kate, these two new faces coming to our show in Vancouver are filmmakers and visionaries in their own right, and came to this show as people who had really immersed themselves in the world of season one and fallen in love with it. We were really touched by that and the insights they had.” The directors are currently in pre-production in Vancouver, building sets for what promises to be a visually ambitious season.\n\t\n\n\tWith Season 2 venturing beyond James Clavell’s original novel, Marks emphasized the continued close partnership with the author’s estate. Clavell’s daughter Michaela remains an executive producer on the series and has been deeply involved in every creative decision. “She’s been for us from the very beginning, our muse in this process, someone who really understands her father’s words and has been engaged on every draft, every casting choice, every director choice,” Marks said. “She really has been someone who keeps us honest with the words.”\n\n\tThe creative team began developing ideas for Season 2 during production of the first season, leaning into what Marks described as “the spirit of storytelling from the era in which ‘Shogun’ was written, which is a great serialized saga storytelling of the 70s, where you could just pick up a story and get immersed in 100 different horizontal directions.”\n\n\tKondo suggested that working within constraints has actually enhanced their storytelling approach. “I think we discovered that having parameters enhance the story,” she said. “We had so many blockades along the way, COVID, a huge shoot, inexperienced people. We learned to invite parameters. The biggest parameter of all right now for us is this history itself. We have to work within the confines of what has happened and make choices and be discerning.”\n\n\tMarks credited FX with giving the production creative freedom from the start, including the bold decision to produce the show predominantly in Japanese with subtitles. “They allowed us to make these risks,” he said. “To do this show in the United States, predominantly in Japanese, to allow us to subtitle it in the way that we did. That’s on them, to really give it to us. It was a very courageous choice on their end.” That creative courage extended to allowing the show to explore “poetry and performance and dance contests and all kinds of things” rather than defaulting to more conventional action-driven storytelling.\n\n\tWhile the creators remained tight-lipped about specific plot details, Marks acknowledged that the new season will introduce fresh faces alongside returning cast members. “We killed a lot of people” in the first season, he said. “We have some really exciting characters this season, characters that I want to tell you everything about, but cannot. These faces really popped for us, so we’re just so excited to bring our own family together with these new faces and watch them become part of this world.”\n\t\n\n\t“Shogun” Season 1 broke the record for most Emmy Award wins by a series in a single season with 18 statuettes. Sanada became the first Japanese actor history to win the Emmy for best lead actor in a drama. Anna Sawai was also the first actress of Asian decent to win best lead actress in a drama.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Walt Disney Company is ramping up its local content investments in Japan and Korea as it enters a new phase of scaled production, while plotting expansion of its ESPN sports offering beyond Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\tLuke Kang, president of The Walt Disney Company Asia Pacific, says the streamer is maturing its regional strategy after four years of laying groundwork in most markets. Disney+ is now focusing on high-quality productions from Japan and Korea that can travel globally, while monitoring emerging opportunities in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve been in the region now for about four or five years, and I think most of our markets are in the fourth year post launch,” Kang tells Variety. “We always looked at the first few years as a period of setting the table and building the foundation.” He was speaking with Variety on the sidelines of the Disney+ originals preview event at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.\n\n\n\tThe company’s upcoming Asia Pacific slate spans anime, Korean drama, unscripted content and cross-border romantic comedies, including adaptations of Kojima Hideo’s “Death Stranding Isolations” (working title), Japan-Korea series “Merry Berry Love,” and webtoon-based titles like “The Remarried Empress.”\n\n\t“We’re working with the top creators in the region,” Kang says. “We know we’re not in the volume game. We want to make sure that we create compelling stories and bring compelling stories to the audience.”\n\n\tSince 2021, Disney+ has produced more than 150 APAC originals. The company is now concentrating resources on Japan and Korea, where Kang believes scaled, high-quality productions can be created with global appeal.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve learned that great stories, great storytelling cuts through boundaries,” he says. “We also have learned that creativity exists in many different pockets.”\n\n\tJapan represents a particular area of focus. While the country has long been recognized for high-quality anime, Kang sees it emerging as a source for compelling live-action dramas.\n\n\t“We feel that we can produce the quality of product that can compete globally in these markets,” he says. “Right now we’re focused on Japan and Korea, because we feel that’s where the scaled productions can come out of.”\n\n\tThe company is also tapping into Asia’s rich pipeline of source material, from webtoons and web novels to traditional literature and folktales. Kang notes that crowdsourcing platforms like webtoons allow Disney to identify popular stories before adaptation.\n\n\t“The ability of anybody to tell a great story has now been magnified,” he says. “The other great thing is we know what’s been popular. That gives us the ability to focus our resources on the most popular stories.”\n\n\tThe upcoming slate also includes unscripted content such as “Battle of Fates,” which pits fortune tellers and oracles against each other, and “Travis Japan Summer Vacation!! in the USA,” a docuseries following the seven-member group on a 10-day American road trip.\n\n\tDisney+ is monitoring Asia’s microdrama boom, particularly its explosive growth in mainland China, though Kang says the company hasn’t made definitive plans to enter that space.\n\n\t“We’ve been keeping an eye on microdramas for a long time,” he says. “It’s very early stages, but highly engaging. We do think it should be in the mix of the way we tell stories in the future.”\n\n\tOn the sports front, Disney launched ESPN on Disney+ in Australia and New Zealand as a beachhead for regional expansion. The company is now exploring a tiered strategy that combines regional sports rights with locally popular content.\n\n\t“There are very few single sports that cut across the entire region,” Kang explains. The company is coordinating its ESPN expansion with the availability of sports rights, which vary by market and don’t become available simultaneously.\n\n\tDisney has been experimenting with event-based sports, including broadcasting a friendly soccer match in Korea, while it evaluates longer-term rights acquisitions.\n\t\n\n\tIn Southeast Asia, Disney has shifted strategy from a mass-market approach under the former Disney+ Hotstar brand, which is now rebranded Disney+, to focusing on higher average revenue per user and specific audience segments. This has led to reduced local content production in those markets, though Kang says the company remains connected to regional creative communities.\n\n\t“We’re keeping an eye on Indonesia and Thailand and the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia,” he says. “As our business grows and expands, we will continue to evaluate what we want to do out of those markets.”\n\n\tKang emphasizes that Disney’s approach centers on creating content with a strong home-market foundation that can travel internationally, citing the success of films like “Dangal,” which earned $198 million in China, besides being a massive hit in its native India. \n\n\t“I firmly believe that content needs to have a home base,” he says. “Great content will travel, and great stories will travel beyond borders. But you always need that home base for every content.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\t“South Park” returned to its regularly scheduled programming on Wednesday night after detouring for a Halloween Special on Oct. 31. The third episode of Season 28 saw Butters experimenting with OpenAI’s generative AI video platform Sora 2, much to the chagrin of fellow South Park Elementary student Red. Meanwhile, JD Vance manages to seduce Donald Trump and dodge punishment for trying to kill his unborn baby with Satan. \n\n\tThe episode opens with Butters showing off his latest AI video, which features Santa Claus peeing in the mouth of his classmate Red. In an act of swift vengeance, Red creates her own AI video of Butters having sex with Studio Ghibli icon Totoro and plays it during a schoolwide assembly. Once Detective Harris of the Park County Police Department catches wind of the videos, he launches an investigation under the suspicion that popular fictional icons are really committing unspeakable acts against the children of South Park. \n\t\n\n\tBack at the White House, Trump is deciding how to punish Vance for his treason. However, Vance manages to smooth-talk his way out of it. Having mended their relationship, Trump and Vance have a quick soak in the hot tub together, and afterward, they make passionate love in the Lincoln Bedroom.\n\n\tOpenAI has come under fire in recent weeks for allowing Sora 2 users to generate videos with copyrighted IP. Sora 2 currently operates on an opt-out system, meaning any creator can contact the platform developers and have their IP made inaccessible. However, according to copyright law, rights holders can still sue and obtain statutory damages for individual acts of infringement, regardless of the opt-out policy. \n\t\n\n\t“South Park” in 2025 has been all about Trump, and this week’s episode brought more of the same. Seasons 27 and 28 have practically revolved around the president, focusing mostly on his relationship with Satan, while many series mainstays have been allocated to supporting roles.\n\n\t“South Park” co-creator Trey Parker recently told the New York Times that the focus on Trump is not because he and longtime collaborator Matt Stone have “got all political.” It’s instead because “politics became pop culture.”\n\n\t“It’s like the government is just in your face everywhere you look,” Parker explained. “Whether it’s the actual government or whether it is all the podcasters and the TikToks and the YouTubes and all of that, and it’s just all political and political because it’s more than political. It’s pop culture.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWorld premiering in main competition at Tallinn,”The Frog and The Water” by Thomas Stuber, a student Oscar winner for his 2012 short ”Of Dogs And Horses,” sounds like a fairytale. \n\n\tAnd it is. A warm-hearted story about the most unlikely characters, two drifting souls, who unexpectedly and almost magically, create a bond and become friends. The upbeat mood and playfulness is revealed in the first clip from The Match Factory, which handles global sales.\n\t\n\n\tThe feature, produced by long-standing German arthouse player Pandora Film Produktion, marks a fresh beginning for Stuber. Best known internationally for “A Heavy Heart”, Toronto-selected in 2016, the Golden Bear entry ”In the Aisles” (2018) and ”Dark Satellites” (2022), all co-penned by Clemens Meyer, Stuber’s ”The Frog and the Water” is based on an idea by Gotthart Kuppel, co-writer with Stuber and Hyoe Yamamoto. The pic is also the German helmer’s first multi-country-set feature, shot in German, Japanese and English-language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe central-character Stefan Busch– known as Buschi –  lives in an assisted living facility, where routine activities fill the days. When on a group outing, he suddenly takes a different route and follows a group of Japanese tourists travelling through Germany. An unexpected bond and intriguing wordless friendship develops with Hideo Kitamura, one of the tourists, a man in black, on a journey of his own. Their connection transcends cultural barriers and takes Buschi to new adventures. \n\n\tThe German-Swiss co-production between Pandora Film Production, Hugofilm Productions, Lomotion and Gretchenfilm is due to open in Germany April 30, 2026, via Pandora Film.  \n\t\n\n\tWe caught up with Stuber ahead of the film’s world premiere at Tallinn’s Black Nights Film Festival Nov. 19. He told Variety about getting lost in translation with Japanese – unlike his main character Buschi who communicates without words. Instinctively, and through mimicry.  \n\n\tWhat was the genesis for this heart-warming buddy road movie?\n\n\tIt all started in 2018. I was at the Berlinale in the main competition with “In the Aisles,” and Pandora Film approached me with this script by Gotthart Kuppel. Then I worked quite intensively to get the script in shape. This is a leap from my earlier films “Heavy Heart,” “In the Aisles” and “Dark Satellites” that were all connected in a way to Eastern Germany, the period before reunification.\n\n\tHere I just loved the core idea. I felt it was so unique, so never heard of, and that instantly drew me to it. Again, It’s a story about outsiders, the kind of stories I like – and perhaps why I was handed out the script. You have those two main characters, outside of society, outsiders of a group who kind of take their fate, in a small scale, in their own hands. I felt it was so magical, warm-hearted, almost fairytale like, but set in a realistic world.\n\n\tHow was it to dive into this story and create a bridge between Western and Japanese culture? I guess it was crucial for you to have Hyoe Yamamoto as a co-writer?\n\n\tMy first connection with Japan came when “In the Aisles” was distributed there in 2019. I went to Tokyo with the main actor, Franz Rogowski, and our guide, our helping hand was Hyoe Yamamoto. That’s when our friendship and collaboration kicked off. We had our own idea for the material, but the script needed Japanese eyes to make it authentic and culturally relevant. I personally always wanted to find out more about Japan, so I travelled there quite extensively, and through research for this project came a strong bond for Japanese culture, people and society.\n\n\tThat said, the deeper I get into Japanese culture, the more I feel that I don’t know anything at all! That’s something to acknowledge and accept. And going back to “The Frog and the Water,” perhaps that’s the power of this story. You have this character Buschi who doesn’t question that [cultural difference]. He just is. He looks for the right place for him to be and he finds it close to Hideo Kitamura. That’s the magic and beauty of it.\n\t\n\n\tHow was the casting process to find Aladdin Detlefsen for the lead character of Buschi?\n\n\tThe casting was the most intense I’ve ever experienced. What’s special about Buschi is that except for one word in the end, he does not speak. Not because he is mute, but because he chooses not to. Since he doesn’t speak, we didn’t have to look only in Germany. We contacted many theatre groups with people with disabilities in Switzerland, in the Netherlands, in France, all over Germany and did different stages of casting calls. We found amazing professional actors, and kept some for the supporting roles. We narrowed it down to three-four people, until we went for Aladdin [from the Blaumeier-Atelier] in Bremen. I mean – just listen to that name! He kind of nailed it.\n\n\tHow did you help him prepare for his character?\n\n\tHe had never done a feature film production of that length, so we had to think of basic stuff: how long can we work per day? How many days a week can we do it? But he worked long hours, every day that was needed. This was really astonishing. It took around two years for Aladdin to rehearse, to make him adapt to his character and get acquainted with the story. At the same time, we made sure he had a fresh way of acting.\n\n\tBuschi has a unique way of mimicking Hideo Kitamura. There are lovely scenes in a restaurant and in the countryside, where the choreography of their movements takes a new dimension. That must have taken quite some time to rehearse…\n\n\tThe mimicry is a very important part in the film. Something that I studied and researched as I’m very fond of that. How nature does it, how we do it as humans. I find that very interesting. How do we get acquainted with each other or with somebody we don’t know. Mimicking is one way of communicating. Without words. And here again, I think that the character of Buschi is so far ahead of us who communicate in a normal way. Maybe we need to learn from him. First do not judge, look closely, maybe mimic, maybe copy. Try out something for yourself. That’s the way Buschi creates this magic bond with Kitamura.\n\n\tRegarding the two scenes that you mention, well it’s not “La La Land,” perfectly choreographed. That’s not what we wanted. We were looking for the narrow path, to have some pieces that are set up, but with imperfection. That was the soul of it.\n\t\n\n\tKanji Tsuda is also wonderful as the mysterious man-in-black Kitamura, who accepts Buschi in the most natural way. How did you cast him?\n\n\tWell it was a huge process again. Firstly, we wanted to find Buschi, then a Japanese actor who would be ideal to create that odd couple with him. Kanji is a versatile and very experienced professional actor. I saw him in “Onoda – 10,000 Nights in the Jungle.” I was very impressed by that. He’s also great in “Tokyo Sonata.” But again, it was a whole new world for me to dive into casting Japanese actors, communicating with Japanese casting agencies. You have to speak English of course, but you always need to translate everything. And as in the film – how much actually gets lost in translation?\n\n\tThere are lovely touches of humor, although it’s also a story about grief. You gradually unlock Kitamura’s inner secret. Could you discuss your character development?\n\n\tWell throughout all my works, my way of storytelling is not to give too much background on the characters, not to explain too much, and let the audience find out by themselves. With Buschi, we understand few things about his background, but enough I believe, to go on that journey with him. You discover things along the way. It’s the same with Kitamura. Why he’s traveling alone. When he meets Buschi, that unexpected encounter fills a void. Buschi has this gift of touching everybody he encounters. Nobody can really explain why, but that’s the way.\n\n\tAnother third major character is Buschi’s caretaker [played by Bettina Stucky], who keeps running after him and adds a kind of slapstick element to the story. How would you describe her?\n\n\tWell, I thought about “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” and I wanted to create my own caretaker. In the Milos Forman film, Jack Nicholson’s caretaker evolves into a very dark and evil character. I felt that’s O.K., great, for that film, but definitely wrong for us. We need to create something else, much lighter.\n\n\tI think that in most of my films, I don’t have antagonists and no real obstacles that need to be overcome. In “The Frog and the Water,” all the characters are good people.And even Buschi’s caretaker only wants the best for him.  She just needs to find out on that journey that this guy thinks big and cannot be stopped. It’s like parents with their children. It’s about learning to let go.\n\t\n\n\tCould you detail your visual style and camera work?\n\n\tThis was my first collaboration with Swiss cinematographer Filip Zumbrunn. I wanted to let the frames stand, not cut away, combine handheld camera with fixed images, where Buschi could just walk along, then we would jump next to him. I think it added to the humor. And the other thing is the framing. We have this very narrow frame, four by three in the beginning, which kind of states the world he’s in, somehow not quite right for him. He wants to get out of this frame. And when he meets Kitamura, the frame widens to the widescreen.For you what is the meaning of the title “The Frog and the Water”? The title was my co-writer Gotthart Kuppel’ s choice from the early stages of the project. Although it is not real Haiku poem it has a nice Haiku touch to it. Gotthart made it up and I think it fits the story very well, in a gentle, mysterious way. The frog in its natural environment, simple but not so simple at the same time.\n\n\tIn today’s world where there’s bigotry, so much intolerance, was it important for you to simply remind people to be kind, and open to different encounters in life?\n\n\tFor sure.I see a lot of great heavy dramas about the state of the world. But I think you’re right. Somebody has to come up with the other stories, and those are the kind of arthouse film experiences that I want to create. \n\n\tWhat’s next for you?\n\n\tRight now I’m finishing the post-production on the last instalment in a three-part crime show, “Poliizeiruf 110.” I’m also in the early stages of my next feature film which will dive into the theater world in the late 1980s, early ‘90s.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter a four-year hiatus, Prime Video’s hit Indian spy thriller “The Family Man” is finally returning with its third season, and the cast and creators say the extended development time was necessary to maintain the show’s high quality standards.\n\n\t“It does take a long time. We’re not that quick to churn out a season, and we didn’t want to rush into it if it’s not good,” says co-creator Raj at a roundtable with Variety in Mumbai following the trailer launch. The creative duo behind the series acknowledged that while they were working on other projects, the lengthy development cycle was primarily about ensuring Season 3 met fan expectations.\n\t\n\n\tManoj Bajpayee reprises his role as Srikant Tiwari, the middle-class family man who secretly works as an intelligence officer. However, the actor revealed that returning to the character after such a gap presented unique challenges.\n\n\n\t“It is taken for granted that since one has played Srikant Tiwari in two seasons, so it is going to be a cakewalk. But it’s not that,” Bajpayee says. “It’s a different time altogether. Srikant Tiwari is in a different age, facing a different nemesis altogether. The circumstances are completely different.”\n\n\tIn Season 3, Srikant finds himself in an unprecedented vulnerable position, racing against time to protect himself, his family and the nation from an imminent threat, with the hunter now becoming the hunted. “He’s trying to come to terms with everything that he has lost in these four years. He’s trying to build something new,” Bajpayee says. “In this one, he’s not on top of the game. The story is not giving you that chance, the circumstances are such that he’s not getting any opportunity to be what he used to be.”\n\t\n\n\tThe new season introduces two formidable antagonists: Rukma, played by Jaideep Ahlawat, and Meera, portrayed by Nimrat Kaur. Both actors spoke about the challenge of joining such an established franchise.\n\n\t“I knew that the world that I’m getting into is going to be everything else other than what I come in prepared with,” Kaur says. She compared the experience to working on “Homeland,” noting the unpredictability kept her “on your toes” and created a healthy creative environment. “The culture and that almost… let’s make something amazing happen. That ball was always up in the air.”\n\n\tThe series is set between Mumbai and Nagaland, in India’s northeast. Ahlawat, who previously was the lead in Season 2 of “Paatal Lok,” set in Nagaland, expressed his excitement about returning to the region in a different capacity. “When I was in Kohima [Nagaland’s capital], playing a very different character, this time it felt different. When you go into that get up and then suddenly see yourself like, same spot, different mindset. But that was fun,” he says, referring to his role as the menacing Rukma.\n\n\tThe creative team explained that the extended timeline was partly due to the complexity of developing the new antagonists. “It took us a long time to crack Rukma and Meera’s track. The nemesis, the antagonist. So that was a big deal,” Raj says.\n\n\tCo-creator DK added that even after deciding to proceed with the season, the production timeline required substantial investment. “It does take almost a year to develop, and then maybe another year to make it. So there’s a two-year timeline to make anyway,” he says.\n\n\tNikhil Madhok, director and head of originals at Prime Video India, also spoke about the extended development period. “When you create a great series, people watch it over a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and then Monday, they ask you, when’s the next season? And it actually takes a good three to four years to put a great series together, because it’s almost like making two and a half three movies,” he says.\n\n\tMadhok emphasized the importance of maintaining quality over speed. “What you don’t want to do is create a substandard season, because there’s such a strong legacy. So it’s better to do it only when you’re right, versus try to do it fast and get it wrong,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tReturning cast members Sharib Hashmi, who plays JK Talpade, and Priyamani, who portrays Suchitra Tiwari, both spoke about the ease of returning to their characters. “Playing JK is really, I enjoy going on the sets of ‘The Family Man,’” Hashmi says. \n\n\tPriyamani described herself as “quite a spot-on actress,” noting that once on set with Bajpayee and the directors, “we just go with the flow.” She added that the well-written scripts made preparation easier: “You know what the scene is all about, what’s going to happen. So once you’re on set, you’re sort of 50% mentally prepared,” she says.\n\n\tSeema Biswas, who plays a political figure in the series, spoke about the challenges of her role. “Doing a politician’s role is, I feel like very tough, so technical,” she says. “They try to make it a political figure, but it’s a human. She is a human. The human emotion is also there. So try to make it like that way.”\n\n\tVeteran actor Dalip Tahil, who plays the recurring character Kulkarni, reflected on being part of the series from its inception in 2018 when streaming was just beginning in India. “’The Family Man’ for me is very significant and important as it is for the vast audience of this country, because for the first time in the OTT [streaming] platform in this country, we saw the success of a show that was so strongly based and supported by its writing, its terrific direction,” he says.\n\n\tVipin Sharma, another recurring cast member, spoke about how he became part of the show. “I saw Raj and DK’s ‘Shor’ and I loved that. I have a habit when I see something that really touches me, I try and find the people who’ve done it and I get in touch with them,” he says. “Suddenly, one day, I got a call from DK saying, ‘we need you in three days.’ And I was like, ‘wow,’ that’s how I became part of it. It also proves that like-mindedness really creates beauty in this world.”\n\n\tBajpayee credited Raj and DK for creating a collaborative atmosphere on set. “One of the main elements of ‘The Family Man’ [that is] really touching, apart from the wonderful script writing, is the vibe on the set,” he says. “Raj and DK have this immense ability to create atmosphere where everyone can collaborate. There is no hierarchy. Everyone is contributing.”\n\t\n\n\tThe actor recalled that from the first season, rehearsals took place in his van, with the cast having lunch together and workshopping scenes. “It was, it started like that, and I was so glad that it’s still going like that,” Bajpayee says. “In these now, how many years? Seven, eight years, and the vibe is same, the culture of work is same.”\n\n\tWriter-director Suman Kumar explained the creative team’s approach to keeping the series fresh across seasons. “I don’t think you study audience statistics and see what is working. I don’t think that’s the way. I think stories choose you,” he says. “One of the greatest qualities that I have learned from Raj and DK is you don’t compromise on keeping it fresh.”\n\n\tKumar revealed that after Season 1 focused on Islamic terror and Season 2 shifted to a Tamil Tigers story, the team deliberately chose to explore India’s northeast region for Season 3. “India is one country, many worlds. So let’s explore the world,” he says.\n\n\tDialogue writer Sumit Arora emphasized the importance of staying connected to contemporary language and emotions. “The only thing that I try to take care of is that I am connected to the ground, that I have my ear on the ground,” he says. “As the world is going, Srikant and his world is going, the family is going, the kids are growing up. So you also keep an eye or ear open to the language, to the kind of things that people are using in today’s time.”\n\n\tYounger cast member Ashlesha Thakur, who plays Dhriti Tiwari, spoke about her character’s evolution as she transitions to college in Season 3. She recalled the emotional challenges of Season 2, when her character was kidnapped. “I spoke to Suman. I spoke to Raj sir also, and I just broke down on set. Because they say, right, you should keep your character on set. You should never take it back,” she says.\n\n\tWhen asked about a potential Season 4, Madhok confirmed the studio’s interest but maintained the same quality-first approach. “Are we keen on ‘The Family Man’ four? Absolutely keen. But we’ll continue to maintain the bar. First, ‘The Family Man’ three should be loved by everybody. And second, four should have a compelling story,” he says.\n\n\tCo-creator Raj adds cryptically, “Once you see Season 3, the question will be answered.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Family Man” Season 3 will premiere on Prime Video on Nov. 21 worldwide. The series also stars Vedant Sinha, Shreya Dhanwanthary, Gul Panag, Seema Biswas, Jugal Hansraj and Aditya Srivastava.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

The event also featured new concept art by Ilya Kuvshinov, who previously worked as character designer on “Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045.”\n\t\n\n\tKojima will serve as executive producer on the series, which will tell an entirely new story set within the “Death Stranding” universe, separate from the video games’ narrative. The animated project will follow a young man and woman on an adventure, rendered in traditional hand-drawn 2D animation. Japan’s E&H production is handling the animation.\n\n\n\tThe original “Death Stranding” PlayStation game launched in 2019 and has attracted more than 20 million players worldwide. The franchise recently expanded with “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,” which launched exclusively on PlayStation 5.\n\n\tKojima, who established Kojima Productions in December 2015, is widely credited as the father of the stealth game genre. In 2020, he received the BAFTA Fellowship in recognition of his contributions to gaming. The original “Death Stranding” starred Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen and Léa Seydoux.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\tThe Disney+ series represents the latest expansion of gaming intellectual property into streaming animation, following successful adaptations of franchises including Netflix’s “Castlevania,” “Arcane” and “Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

Jed Wallace and his company, Street Relations Inc., filed suit against Blake in February 2025 after she named both parties, along with Baldoni, in her December 2024 California civil rights complaint for bad behavior related to the filming of \"It Ends With Us.\"\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          The lawsuit was filed in Texas ... but, according to new legal docs obtained by TMZ, it was dismissed due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. Translation: the judge ruled Wallace didn't establish that the Texas court had the power to deal with the case.\n      \n\n          Blake's rep tells TMZ ... \"With this decision, all of the retaliatory lawsuits filed against Blake Lively by Justin Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and their crisis communications and digital teams have been dismissed. Ms. Lively will have her day in court on her claims at the March trial in New York.\"\n      \n    \n          But Blake has also had her legal setbacks ... Just last week, a judge dismissed Blake's claims in her lawsuit against Jed that he helped smear her reputation online during the release of “It Ends With Us.\" The judge ruled Blake's lawyers should not have sued Jed in New York because his firm is based in Austin, Texas and he has little connection to the Big Apple.\n      \n    \n          Unclear if Wallace plans to refile the lawsuit in a different state. We reached out to Wallace and his PR firm ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Blake Lively\n              \n                          \n                Justin Baldoni\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tAdam Driver and Steven Soderbergh almost brought their own twist to a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\tIn a recent sit down with AP, Driver said that over the span of two years, he and Soderbergh developed a script called “The Hunt for Ben Solo.” The film would have taken place after the events of “The Rise of Skywalker,” and followed Driver’s Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, on a search for redemption.\n\n\n\tSoderbergh roughed out the story with “Logan Lucky” screenwriter Rebecca Blunt. Scott Z. Burns later joined to pen the script.\n\t\n\n\t“I always was interested in doing another ‘Star Wars,’” Driver said. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. Kathleen [Kennedy] had reached out. I always said: ‘With a great director and a great story, I’d be there in a second.’ I loved that character and loved playing him.”\n\n\tDriver described the film as “handmade and character-driven,” comparing it to 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back.” The “White Noise” star said that that film is the “standard” of what a “Star Wars” movie should be.”\n\n\tSoderbergh and Driver pitched “The Hunt for Ben Solo” to Kathleen Kennedy, Dave Filoni and Cary Beck at Lucasfilm, who “loved the idea.” However, when they took the script over to Disney, they were shut down.\n\n\t“We presented the script to Lucasfilm. They loved the idea,” Driver recalled. “They totally understood our angle and why we were doing it. We took it to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman, and they said no. They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”\n\n\tLucasfilm declined to comment.\n\n\tSoderbergh told AP of the experience, “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.” Driver agreed, calling the project “one of the coolest (expletive) scripts I had ever been a part of.”\n\t\n\n\tDriver debuted as Kylo Ren in 2015’s “The Force Awakens,” and reprised the role in 2017’s “The Last Jedi” and 2019’s “The Rise of Skywalker.”\n\n\tRead Driver’s entire interview with AP here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTicketmaster unveiled what it says are new measures to stop scalpers by barring users and ticket brokers from making multiple accounts, requiring resellers to use taxpayer ID verification, and using AI tools for “faster assessment and cancellation of bot-purchased tickets,” as a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit filed last month continues that accuses the platform of working with resellers to elevate prices. The letter states that “Ticketmaster does more than anyone to fight bots and get tickets into the hands of real fans.”\n\t\n\n\tThe announcement was made via a lengthy letter written to the senators behind the lawsuit by the company’s executive vice president Dan Wall, obtained by Variety, with a goal to “increase the percentage of tickets going to real fans” by utilizing the Social Security number or taxpayer ID verification to cancel scalper accounts. Wall also said the company will not allow brokers to exceed the platform’s ticket resale limits, another accusation in the lawsuit.\n\n\n\tTicketmaster will also discontinue TradeDesk, a tool that allows resellers to track their ticket sales, although Live Nation denied that the tool was being used to mislead customers, as stated in the lawsuit.\n\n\tThe company also denied other allegations made in the lawsuit, claiming that it does not collude with ticket resellers to elevate prices, and that it violate the Better Online Ticket Sales Act (BOTS Act), a 2016 law meant to stop bots from reselling tickets at high prices.\n\n\tNot surprisingly, independent venue and touring organizations were quick to criticize the claims made in the letter. In a statement, the National Independent Venue Assn. wrote: “Live Nation’s ‘actions’ on resale detailed in a letter to Congress are too little and too late to get back the trust of fans, artists, and stages. They apparently got caught opening up their systems to predatory resellers, which is a betrayal of fans and artists. This looks like an attempt to clean up their devastated public image following the Federal Trade Commission’s strong BOTS Act and deceptive practices case against them. Based on that suit and this letter, we have seen clear evidence that Live Nation and Ticketmaster are in bed with scalpers, and resale platforms like StubHub and Vivid Seats benefit daily from it.\n\t\n\n\t“The meaningful way to repair the damage done by Live Nation’s alleged collusion with scalpers is for them to voluntarily cap resale tickets on their resale platform at no more than the face value of the original ticket.”\n\n\tAlso on Monday, the National Independent Talent Association, a trade group for independent U.S. managers, agents, and artists they represent, wrote, “Ticketmaster nor any other platform should engage in reselling tickets above face value. This practice hurts both artists and their fans. We are encouraged that the FTC’s efforts have already led to Ticketmaster reforming its systems by canceling multiple broker accounts and improving its efforts regarding BOTS sweeps.”\n\n\tVariety will have more on the situation as it develops.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHulu has greenlit a reboot of “Prison Break,” Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe project was first reported to be in the works at Hulu in December 2024 with a pilot order. The cast includes Emily Browning as Cassidy, Drake Rodger as Tommy, Lukas Gage as Jackson, Clayton Cardenas  as Michael a.k.a “Ghost,” JR Bourne as Junior, Georgie Flores as Andrea, and Myles Bullock as Darius a.k.a “Red.”\n\n\n\tAs previously reported, the new show is set in the same world as the original series but will feature different characters and a new storyline. The official logline states, “An ex-soldier turned corrections officer (Browning) takes a job at one of the deadliest prisons in America to prove just how far she’ll go for someone she loves.”\n\t\n\n\tElgin James serves as the writer, showrunner, and executive producer on the series in addition to directing the pilot. Dawn Olmstead executive produces along with “Prison Break” creator Paul Scheuring, Marty Adelstein and Neal Moritz. Olmstead, Adelstein, and Moritz were all executive producers on the original series. 20th Television, which produced the original show, is the studio. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tElgin James and Dawn Olmstead\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Prison Break” ran for five seasons on Fox and prove to be a hit for the network. The original cast included Dominic Purcell, Wentworth Miller, Amaury Nolasco, Robert Knepper, Sarah Wayne Callies, and Rockmund Dunbar. The show also spawned a TV movie, “The Final Break,” and a low-budget spinoff, “Prison Break: Proof of Innocence,” which was exclusively available on mobile phones.

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” alum Leslie Jones is among the guest stars set for Season 1 of CBS’ new comedy “DMV,” the network announced Monday. Other guest stars lined up include Zoe Lister-Jones (“Slip”), Chelsea Frei (“The Paper”) and former WNBA player Renee Montgomery, while Jessica Camacho (“Countdown”) is set for a recurring role.\n\n\t“DMV” premiered Oct. 13 and is back for its second episode tonight. The show, which airs Mondays at 8:30 p.m. ET, is a single-camera comedy set in the fictional “East Hollywood” branch of the Department of Motor Vehicles – where, as the logline notes, “employees are making minimum wage dealing with customers who are annoyed before they even walk in the door.”\n\t\n\n\tHarriet Dyer, Tim Meadows, Tony Cavalero, Molly Kearney, Alex Tarrant and Gigi Zumbado star in “DMV,” which was developed by Dana Klein and inspired by a short story from Katherine Heiny. The show has already been given a full season order of seven more episodes, bringing the total this year to 20.\n\n\n\tOn an upcoming episode of “DMV” Jones will play Sally, described as “the energetic and proud executive assistant to the Director of the California DMV. Our characters meet Sally on their road trip to the DMV holiday party in Sacramento and Barb (Molly Kearney) and Sally are kindred spirits and share a love for all things DMV.” \n\n\tLister-Jones will guest as Dr. Jacobs, “the entitled surgeon who’s finally set aside time to get their license and is not at all pleased that it is taking so long.” Frei plays Amber, the childhood friend of Colette (Dyer) “who is now an out of touch actress who visits the DMV to get her Real ID.” \n\t\n\n\tIn her recurring role, Camacho plays Surfer Mary, “the confident and carefree love interest who meets love interest Noa (Tarrant) when she is taking her driving test.” And Montgomery is set for a cameo.\n\n\tJones’ new comedy special, “Leslie Jones: Life Part 2,” premieres this Friday, Oct. 24, on Peacock; Lister-Jones’ credits also include “Beau is Afraid,” while Frei (repped by Paradigm and Untitled Ent.) has also been seen in “Poker Face.” Camacho’s other credits include “All Rise.” Montgomery is co-host of “Women’s Sports Now,” a TNT basketball analyst and co-owner and vice president of the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream.\n\n\tThey all join previously announced guest star Randall Park (“Fresh Off the Boat”), who will appear in an upcoming episode as Beau Young, manager of the rival North Hollywood DMV. \n\n\tCBS Studios is behind “DMV,” which is exec produced by Klein, Matt Kuhn, Aaron Kaplan, Wendi Trilling and Robyn Meisinger. Trent O’Donnell executive produced and directed the pilot from a script written by Klein.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor the second consecutive year, two films have shared the top prize at the Middleburg Film Festival — and both come from women directors.\n\n\tChloé Zhao’s emotional drama “Hamnet” and Hikari’s moving crowd-pleaser “Rental Family” won the audience award at the Virginia-based festival, which marked its 13th edition this weekend. Orlando von Einsiedel’s “The Cycle of Love,” about the romantic journey of a Delhi street artist, took home the best documentary prize, while Kaouther Ben Hania’s emotionally charged “The Voice of Hind Rajab” won for international feature.\n\t\n\n\t“Hamnet,” which screened Saturday night as the festival’s Centerpiece selection, continues to be a crowd favorite following its audience prizes at the Toronto and Mill Valley film festivals. “Rental Family” closed out Middleburg, with writer-director Hikari in attendance for the screening.\n\n\n\tThe Middleburg Film Festival has earned a reputation as a bellwether for awards season. With the exception of the 2022 audience winner “Devotion,” every recipient of the festival’s top prize has gone on to receive at least one Academy Award nomination. Past honorees include “Conclave” and “September 5” (2023), “American Fiction” (2023), “Belfast” (2021), “Minari” (2020) and “Green Book” (2018).\n\n\tAcross the four-day weekend, the festival presented several tributes and special honors. Casting director Nina Gold received the inaugural Ensemble and Casting Award for her work on “Jay Kelly,” as well as “Hamnet,” which also earned Zhao the Visionary Director Award. Colin Farrell was honored with the Spotlight Actor Award following a screening of Edward Berger’s thriller “Ballad of a Small Player,” while Rose Byrne received the Agnès Varda Trailblazing Film Artist Award for her performance in Mary Bronstein’s A24 release “If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You.”\n\t\n\n\tFilmmaker Jon M. Chu and his longtime collaborators, cinematographer Alice Brooks and editor Myron Kerstein, were also honored with the fourth annual Variety Creative Collaborators award.\n\n\t“This year’s festival has been one of our most inspiring yet,” said MFF founder and board chair Sheila Johnson. “We’re deeply appreciative of the filmmakers and studios who shared their extraordinary work with us, and to our audiences, sponsors and volunteers whose enthusiasm and support continue to make Middleburg such a special community for cinema.”\n\n\tFollowing each screening, festivalgoers cast ballots for their favorite films. This year’s lineup featured 48 titles, spanning awards-season contenders, thought-provoking documentaries and acclaimed international features.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA news special on Britain’s Channel 4 titled “Will AI Take My Job?” investigated how automation is reshaping the workplace and pitting humans against machines. At the end of the hour-long program, a major twist was revealed: the anchor, who narrates and appears throughout the telecast reporting from different locations, was entirely AI-generated.\n\n\tIn the final moments of the special, the host says: “AI is going to touch everybody’s lives in the next few years. And for some, it will take their jobs. Call center workers? Customer service agents? Maybe even TV presenters like me. Because I’m not real. In a British TV first, I’m an AI presenter. Some of you might have guessed: I don’t exist, I wasn’t on location reporting this story. My image and voice were generated using AI.”\n\t\n\n\tThe hour aired Monday at 8 p.m. as part of the “Dispatches” documentary program, which Channel 4 says is now the first British television show to feature an AI presenter. The “anchor” was produced by AI fashion brand Seraphinne Vallora for Kalel Productions and was guided by prompts to create a realistic on-camera performance.\n\n\t“The use of an AI presenter is not something we will be making a habit of at Channel 4 — instead our focus in news and current affairs is on premium, fact checked, duly impartial and trusted journalism — something AI is not capable of doing,” said Louisa Compton, Channel 4’s head of news and current affairs. “But this stunt does serve as a useful reminder of just how disruptive AI has the potential to be — and how easy it is to hoodwink audiences with content they have no way of verifying.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the state-owned network, the stunt complies with Channel 4’s editorial guidelines governing the ethical use of AI, as the reveal at the end is meant to make the viewer reflect on questions relating to trust and authenticity in the digital age.\n\n\t“Will AI Take My Job?” explores the findings of a Channel 4 survey of 1,000 business leaders in the U.K. According to the survey, 76% of bosses have already adopted AI for tasks previously carried out by humans, and 66% say they are “excited” about the technology’s use in the workplace. 41% said AI adoption has already led to reduced recruitment at their companies, and nearly half said they expect further staff reductions in the next five years.\n\n\tChannel 4’s stunt follows the media firestorm surrounding Tilly Norwood, an AI-generated “actress” that sparked backlash from actors, agencies and Hollywood unions.\n\n\t“To be clear, ‘Tilly Norwood’ is not an actor, it’s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation,” SAG-AFTRA wrote in a statement. “It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we’ve seen, audiences aren’t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn’t solve any ‘problem’ — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tYes, that was a “Jaws” reference in the latest “The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror” episode, and it very much riffs off John Williams’ iconic score. ",
    "body": "\n\tYes, that was a “Jaws” reference in the latest “The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror” episode, and it very much riffs off John Williams’ iconic score. \n\n\tComposer Kara Talve confirms “Jaws” was the main reference. Talve is no stranger to scoring “Treehouse of Horror,” the annual horror-themed episode of “The Simpsons,” which is now in its 37th season. She is part of Bleeding Fingers Music, a collective founded over a decade ago by Hans Zimmer. Talve is on her sixth go-round with score producer Russell Emanuel.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the episode, Springfield is “menaced by a mysterious murdering monster from out of the sewers, Krusty has a demonic special guest on his live Halloween special, and we are transported a thousand years into the town’s poseable plastic post-apocalyptic future.” \n\n\n\tThe episode is split into three segments, the first titled “The Last Days of Crisco.” Fatberg is the monster who draws fat from his victims and parodies “Jaws.” Emanuel explains, “The music to Fatberg had to be delightfully distasteful and disgusting. So we had to score disgusting.”\n\n\tTalve adds, “‘Jaws’ was the biggest reference for Fatberg. So we got to go really John Williams, with heavy orchestral music, and we used big, over-the-top brass.” The duo moved around notes to create a sound that was dissonant, amplifying the disgusting effect.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Clown Night with the Devil” sees Krusty the Clown’s show go haywire when the Devil (voiced by Idris Elba) shows up and causes chaos. Unlike the previous segment, the music veered away from orchestral sounds and leaned into synth-heavy tones. Talve points out, “It references ‘Late Night With the Devil.’” She went back to revisit the 2023 horror film by Cameron Cairnes and Colin Cairnes. Talve says, “We watched it because, on the spotting call, Mike Price, the showrunner, kept referencing this demonic hum that he wanted to come out of the characters possessed by the devil.” When watching the film, she finally understood the rumble Price was referring to. “He really wanted the music to feel like it was coming internally from the characters, rather than it being scored.”\n\t\n\n\t“Plastic World” leans away from horror and more into a dystopian depiction of Springfield, imagining a world covered in Buzz Cola bottles. For that segment, renowned woodwind player Pedro Eustache was brought in with his extensive arsenal of woodwinds. Talve says, “He used the Wilding Horn,” and, in addition to that, Eustache — who is known for making many of his own instruments — brought in a pipe.\n\n\tEmanuel says, “He had made this giant thing out of PVC pipe, and he was a key part of the sound of ‘Plastic World.’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe wait is over for Rosalía fans. On Monday, the Spanish singer, songwriter and producer confirmed that “Lux” — the follow-up to 2022’s “Motomami” — will arrive on Nov. 7 via Columbia Records.\n\n\tThe Grammy-winning artist appeared at Madrid’s Gran Vía to reveal the official album artwork, a photograph of her in nuns attire against a baby-blue backdrop. The journey to Gran Vía was captured on both TikTok and Instagram livestreams. (Rosalía was driving and smoking a cigarette on the TikTok stream — which is against the platform’s policies. It is possible that is the reason why the live stream there was cut short.) \n\t\n\n\t“Been waiting so long for this day, this moment, and finally, this moment has arrived,” Rosalía said on live. Vinyl and CD editions of “Lux” are already available for sale on her website, including a package with a limited-edition signed postcard going for $34.99. \n\n\tPrior to the reveal, Rosalía had spent weeks dropping “Lux”-related clues across social media. This past month, she tweeted, “LUX = LOVE.” \n\n\tEarlier today, a billboard appeared in Times Square showing that “Lux” had a supposed November release date. More recently, she shared a clip of herself listening to a symphony orchestra with a rosary between her teeth.\n\n\tRosalía also revealed in a conversation with Highsnobiety that she’s experienced personal growth during the album-making process.\n\n\t“I’ve changed a lot, but at the same time, I’m still wrapping my head around the same things,” she said. “It’s like I still have the same questions and the same desire to answer them. I still have the same love for the past and the same curiosity for the future.”\n\t\n\n\tRosalía’s “Motomami” was released in March 2022, and won album of the year at the 23rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards. The feat made her the first woman to win album of the year twice, following her win for “El Mal Querer” in 2019. A concept album, “Motomami” was produced by Rosalía alongside Noah Goldstein, Michael Uzowuru, Dylan Wiggins and Pharrell Williams.\n\n\tFollowing the success of “Motomami,” Rosalía released features alongside Bjork, Lisa from Blackpink, and Ralphie Choo. She also released a three-song collaborative EP called “RR” in 2023 with Rauw Alejandro. The set included popular tracks like “Beso,” “Vampiros,” and “Promesa.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKeira Knightley recently told The Times of London that “I went mad” during the height of “Pirates of the Caribbean” fame, as the paparazzi descended onto her life and stalked her every move.\n\n\t“It was mostly ‘whore’ [they’d shout],” the actor said. “‘Slut’ sometimes. Particularly if I was with someone — a boyfriend, my brother or my dad. They were trying to get a reaction out of them — provoking people into punching them, so they could sue. And that was the time the crashes started happening — they were forcing people off the roads, then getting even bigger money for pictures of a crashed actress or whatever. And then Britney shaved her head so it was like, ‘Great — we can push them into doing something fucking crazy.’”\n\t\n\n\tKnightley said she went into survival mode and “started wearing the same clothes every day” in order to make herself not appealing to tabloid magazines. Her clothes included “three pairs of the same jeans, stripy T-shirt, boots. I gave all my other clothes away.”\n\n\n\t“And then, if I was being followed, I stopped walking,” Knightley added. “I’d literally stand there. Stock still. One day, I stood there for five hours. ‘If you’re still there, I’m not going. I’m not going to move’… [and then] it wasn’t a valuable shot to them if it was always me in the same clothes, standing still. There’s only so many times you can write, ‘Ooh, she’s wearing the same clothes,’ with a photo of me standing still. It gets boring.” \n\n\tThe unwanted attention got so extreme that Knightley made the decision to quit acting and “my family backed me. They said, ‘Just fucking walk.’” She first went to London and then started taking various trains all over Europe. Knightley was never noticed.\n\t\n\n\t“I was very good,” she said. “Museums, trains… no one expects to see you there. I was very scruffy, which they also wouldn’t have expected. You just don’t make eye contact, go a bit hunched. I kind of slithered.”\n\n\tKnightley was 18 years old when Disney’s “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise launched and turned her into an international star. She told The Times last year that fame came at a “big price” and she found herself “stalked by men.” To make matters worse, she was told she deserved such behavior since she was a famous actor. She added at the time: “It was a brutal time to be a young woman in the public eye.”\n\n\tKnightley can currently be seen in the Netflix original movie “The Woman in Cabin 10,” now streaming.\n",

We're told it's something Mossimo insisted on before they married.\n      \n    \n          What's more ... Mossimo was worth north of $100 million at the time. It's unclear if the prenup changed, but if it didn't, it looks like she's screwed.\n      \n\n          This could explain why Lori doesn't consider herself \"single\" yet, despite living separately for months. Sources with direct knowledge previously told us she's waiting to see how the separation shakes out.\n      \n    \n          In the meantime, our sources say Lori has a terrific relationship with her daughters and has been spending quality time with them.\n      \n    \n          The \"Full House\" actress is devastated by the separation because she thought Mossimo would make changes after they were released from prison -- but he didn’t -- and she’s disappointed in him, according to our sources.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As you know, the pair were sentenced to several months in prison over the 2019 \"Varsity Blues\" college admissions scandal. The feds accused Lori and Mossimo of paying $500,000 to college admissions fixer Rick Singer to get Olivia Jade into USC on a crew scholarship.\n      \n    \n          Both Lori and Mossimo struck plea deals, confessing to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. She got 2 months in prison, and he got 5 months.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Mossimo, who had no comment.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Mossimo Giannulli\n              \n                          \n                Lori Loughlin\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

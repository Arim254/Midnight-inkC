    "body": "\n\tGoogle has removed dozens of AI-generated videos that depicted Disney-owned characters after receiving a cease and desist letter from the studio on Wednesday.\n\n\tDisney flagged the YouTube links to the videos in its letter, and demanded that Google remove them immediately. The AI videos included Mickey Mouse, Deadpool and characters from “Star Wars” and “The Simpsons,” many of which were made using Google’s AI video tool, Veo.\n\n\n\tThe links were still working on Thursday, but now reroute to a message that reads, “This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Disney.”\n\t\n\n\tDisney launched the broadside shortly before announcing a deal to license 200 characters to OpenAI, which will allow Sora users to create short AI clips.\n\n\tThe company has sought to draw a line in the sand to protect its characters from unlicensed AI use. In the cease and desist letter, Disney also provided a long list of characters it wants removed from YouTube and YouTube Shorts, including those from “Frozen,” “Moana,” “Toy Story,” “Deadpool,” “Iron Man,” “Lilo & Stitch,” and “Winnie the Pooh.”\n\n\tIn a statement on Thursday, Google said it would work with Disney on the issue.\n\n\t“We have a longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney, and will continue to engage with them,” the company said. “More generally, we use public data from the open web to build our AI and have built additional innovative copyright controls like Google-extended and Content ID for YouTube, which give sites and copyright holders control over their content.”\n\n\tDisney also demanded that Google implement safeguard to prevent its AI tools from generating Disney-owned characters. It also demanded that Google cease using Disney’s characters to train its AI models.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney+ is not moving forward with its TV adaptation of the Louis Sachar novel “Holes” — which was the basis of Disney’s 2003 film of the same name — after ordering a pilot at the beginning of this year.\n\n\tSachar’s novel was published in 1998 and won a National Book Award and a Newbery Medal. The film, directed by Andrew Davis, starred Shia LaBeouf as Stanley Yelnats, a teenager sent to a juvenile detention camp called Camp Green Lake for a crime he did not commit. There, while being forced to spend every day digging holes in the desert, he discovers a shocking connection between the land and his family. The cast also included Sigourney Weaver, Khleo Thomas, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Patricia Arquette, Dulé Hill and Eartha Kitt. Both the book and the movie were critical and commercial successes.\n\t\n\n\tThe new Disney+ pilot was gender bent, following a teenage girl at a detention camp instead of a boy. Shay Rudolph was set to play Hayley, the lead role, with Greg Kinnear as the warden. The cast also included Aidy Bryant as camp counselor Sissy, Noah Cottrell as kitchen employee Kitch and Flor Delis Alicea, Anire Kim Amoda, Iesha Daniels, Sophie Dieterlen, Alexandra Doke and Maeve Press as Hayley’s fellow campers at Camp Yucca.\n\n\n\tThe “Holes” pilot had Alina Mankin attached as writer with Liz Phang as showrunner and Jac Schaeffer as director. Executive producers included Mankin, Phang, Drew Goddard via Goddard Textiles, Sarah Esberg and Mike Medavoy via Shamrock, which holds the rights. Goddard Textiles’ Andrea Massaro was a co-executive producer. The pilot was produced by Walden Media, which produced the film, and 20th Television was the studio.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaKeith Stanfield is set to play NBA legend Dennis Rodman in Lionsgate’s “48 Hours in Vegas,” taking over the role after Jonathan Majors was dropped from the film following his 2023 assault conviction.\n\n\tThe upcoming comedy is “inspired by the untold story of Dennis Rodman’s legendary trip to Las Vegas during the 1998 NBA Finals — just as the Rodman’s Chicago Bulls are on the verge of completing their second consecutive threepeat championship in eight years,” according to a release. \n\t\n\n\tRick Famuyiwa (“The Mandalorian,” “Ahsoka”) will direct “48 Hours in Vegas” and write the next draft of the screenplay, following an earlier draft by Jordan VanDina.\n\n\n\tThe film will be produced by Lord Miller’s Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and Aditya Sood. Executive producers include Ari Lubet, Rodman and Lucy Kitada, with Nikki Baida serving as co-producer. Meredith Wieck and Pavan Kalidindi will oversee the project for Lionsgate, while Robert Melnik negotiated the deals on behalf of the studio.\n\n\t“I’m genuinely excited to help create an exhilarating, joyful work that both honors and thoughtfully examines the legacy of Rodman and fellow trailblazers,” Stanfield said in a statement. “Those who moved to the beat of their own drum, undeterred by the obstacles placed before them, then and now.” \n\n\tStanfield received an Oscar nomination for his performance in 2021’s “Judas and the Black Messiah.” He is known for roles in films including “The Book of Clarence,” “Sorry to Bother You” and “Get Out,” as well as the FX dramedy series “Atlanta.” He most recently appeared in “Roofman” and “Die My Love,” and will next be seen in “I Love Boosters.” Stanfield is represented by CAA, Stark Management and Ginsburg Daniels Kallis.\n\t\n\n\t“Dennis Rodman is more than a basketball player, more than a personality—he’s an entire cultural phenomenon. His bold style and physical presence, combined with an iconic persona, created a larger-than-life impact on and off the court,” said Erin Westerman, president of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “There’ll never be another like him. LaKeith and the incredibly talented team on this film will bring the legend to life in this most extraordinarily unbelievable story.”\n\n\tMajors was previously attached to the Rodman film until he was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault stemming from a domestic dispute with his former partner. He was sentenced in April 2024 to one year of domestic violence counseling.\n\n\tInsneider was first to report the casting news. \n",

    "body": "\n\tLast year, the Last Word hospitality team was all set to open Chez Renée in the Malibu spot that formerly housed La La Cabana and Giorgio’s. But fate had other ideas, and the historic former sheriff’s station on Pacific Coast Highway burned in the Palisades-Malibu fire in January. \n\n\tNow co-founders Holly Fox and Adam Weisblatt are paying tribute to that concept at their new restaurant Hermon’s, with the Ode to Chez cheeseburger, a decadent patty topped with soubise fondue and bordelaise onions on a sesame milk bun. It’s just one of the elevated but approachable dishes on the menu of the first serious restaurant ever to open in the tiny neighborhood of Hermon in Northeast Los Angeles. Where is Hermon? Tucked along the Arroyo Parkway between South Pasadena, Highland Park and Montecito Heights, it’s a mostly residential area that was crying out for a place to get a well-made cocktail and a plate of steak frites. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLoaded potato fritter with bacon, chives and parmesan at Hermon’s \n\t\n\n\n\n\tLast Word operates several of the area’s hottest restaurants, including Portuguese wine bar Barra Santos  in Glassell Park, Queen St. Raw Bar & Grill in Eagle Rock and Found Oyster in East Hollywood. Weisblatt lives in nearby South Pasadena, and had his eye on the former church banquet hall along Monterey Road for several years. While the fire was a harsh setback, it paved the way for Hermon’s, which locals are already welcoming as an addition to the sometimes overly-trendy NELA dining scene.\n\n\n\tHermon’s is almost resolutely anti-trendy: It stakes its claim as a grown-up restaurant, with large half-circle booths, an appealing u-shaped bar and a selection of eclectic art lining the walls. The mission-style dark wood furnishings and tiled bar almost look like they’ve been since Musso & Frank set the city’s dining style and ostriches and lions roamed the nearby movie studios and tourist attractions. \n\t\n\n\tDespite its vintage feel, chef David Kolender’s American bistro-style menu is full of creative touches that situate the restaurant firmly in the modern era. Even the marinated olives zing with orange, fennel and chili flakes, while scallop crudo and panzanella salad also showcase citrus flavors. Steak frites is a classic rendition with perfectly-done fries and a horseradish mayo. While the menu is still growing, mains also include a nightly pasta dish, whole grilled branzino and mushroom bourguignon. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tScallop crudo at Hermon’s\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHowever you order, you will want to start with the garlic bread for the table — a whole round spelt loaf is doused in garlic butter and sure to be instantly devoured. Pair it with a Tiny Tini – the perfect petite cocktail for light drinkers, at just $9; a walnut old-fashioned or the fruit daiquiri of the day. Welcome to Hermon!\n\n\tHermon’s, 5800 Monterey Road, Los Angeles\n",

We’ve diligently studied each of this year’s offerings from the major streamers, and this crop really has it all: mystery Santas, precocious kids, grand larceny, ski-slope bullies, chaste smooches, sculpted abs, snowstorms, messy divorces — and Oliver Hudson. With so many presents to choose from, this handy chart will help you pick the right movie for a hot cocoa-fueled evening by the fire.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFinding Joy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chip Bergmann/Prime\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAmazon Prime Video\n\n\tLovelorn New York fashion designer Joy (Shannon Thornton) is stranded in a snowstorm in Colorado for Christmas. Luckily, a mysterious man, Ridge (Tosin Morohunfola), is ready to assist.\n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Fine? The enemies-to-lovers trope is convincing, but the cutting away to her two stoner friends distracts from the romance. \n\n\tCHEER: Negative. This could have taken place any time of year. \n\n\tVERDICT: If you’re looking for a light holiday romance, this isn’t it! (But it’s almost worth it for the very nontraditional Christmas movie ending.)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChampagne Problems\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix\n\n\tExecutive Sydney (Minka Kelly) is sent to Paris to acquire a Champagne brand, then accidentally falls for the heir of the empire, Henri (Tom Wozniczka). \n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Decent. They hook up the night they meet(!) — plus, he doesn’t lose interest after she reveals her relatable tummy issues. \n\n\tCHEER: Pretty. How could Christmas in Paris with holiday markets and bubbly not be pretty? \n\n\tVERDICT: It’s charming and sweet, while reminding you to follow your heart, pursue your career aspirations … and go to Europe.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMerv\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Amazon/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAmazon Prime Video\n\n\tCharlie Cox and Zooey Deschanel are exes who split custody of their pup, Merv. But when Merv is diagnosed with depression, the trio heads to a pampered dog resort where the human romance rekindles. Plenty of cute set pieces and misunderstandings follow.\n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Intense. Cox and Deschanel play yearning just right, and once the sad reason behind their split is revealed, there won’t be a dry eye in the audience.\n\n\tCHEER: Apathetic. It’s snowy in one early scene, but most of the movie takes place on a Florida beach.\n\n\tVERDICT: It’s a mostly cute sitcom-level romp, but the lack of holiday tidings doesn’t make it feel seasonal at all.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMy Secret Santa\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix\n\n\t“Mrs. Doubtfire,” but with a single mom (Alexandra Breckenridge) cosplaying as St. Nick who falls in love with a nepo baby ski lodge tycoon (Ryan Eggold).\n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Low. He bares great abs (and almost flashes his buns!), but she mostly keeps her Santa suit on. \n\n\tCHEER: High. It looks like Buddy the Elf set-decorated this drenched-in-tinsel production. \n\n\tVERDICT: So delightfully sweet and sappy it will rot your teeth.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJoy to the World\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Hulu\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHulu\n\n\tLifestyle author Joy (Emmanuelle Chriqui) enlists her best friend (Chad Michael Murray) to play her husband for a Christmas broadcast — but he’s a little too believable. \n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Joyful! The trope of the best friend who secretly wants more packs on extra heat here — pun intended for that kitchen kiss. \n\n\tCHEER: Happy. Joy and her fake family give her house a complete Christmas makeover. Gorgeous. \n\n\tVERDICT: Highly predictable, but combining veteran actors with great chemistry works holiday wonders.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Merry Little Ex-Mas\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix\n\n\tKate (Alicia Silverstone) and Everett (Oliver Hudson) are recent exes hoping to do Christmas as a family with the kids — but he brings along his new girlfriend. \n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Merry! Kate and Everett are clearly meant for each other, since they broke up for … no real reason. \n\n\tCHEER: Bright! There’s sledding, cozy sweaters, snuggling, tree trimming, snowmen and flannel everywhere. \n\n\tVERDICT: It’s the perfect family holiday vibe, and Pierson Fodé takes MVP as Chet, Kate’s hunky and good-natured fling.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJingle Bell Heist\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Rob Baker Ashton/Netflix ©2025\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix\n\n\tSophie (Olivia Holt) and Nick (Connor Swindells) are two desperate (and sexy!) singles who conspire to rob her greedy boss. \n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Sad. Sophie and Nick are much more focused on their tragic backstories than on flirting. \n\n\tCHEER: Happy. The mood is heavy, but the department store backdrop dazzles. \n\n\tVERDICT: If you’re looking for a sappy Hallmark movie knockoff, search elsewhere. But if you’re looking for a darkly comedic heist film with a Christmas setting, this is a solid watch.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "description": "\n\tJim Carrey recently joined Vulture for an oral history to mark the 25th anniversary of “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” Ron Howard’s 2000 film adap",
    "body": "\n\tJim Carrey recently joined Vulture for an oral history to mark the 25th anniversary of “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” Ron Howard’s 2000 film adaptation of Dr. Seuss’s 1957 children’s book. The movie was a giant box office hit, earning $346 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2000 domestically, but it was also a tortuous experience for Carrey given the grueling transformation process. Carrey has been honest in previous interviews about how “excruciating” it was to play the Grinch under heavy makeup and prosthetics, but he revealed wild new details to Vulture about the process.\n\t\n\n\tRick Baker, the legendary make-up effects artist who won an Oscar for his work on “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” told the publication that the studio originally offered to just have Carrey painted green as the Grinch.\n\n\n\t“The studio said, ‘We’re paying Jim $20 million, and we want to see him. Just paint him green,'” Baker said. “But it’s not ‘How the Green Jim Carrey Stole Christmas.’ It’s ‘How the Grinch Stole Christmas.’ He should look like a fantasy character.\n\n\t“There was a popular movie website at the time, Ain’t It Cool News, and the guy who ran it was a fan of my work, and I contacted him,” Baker continued. “I said, ‘Listen, Universal wants to paint Jim Carrey green. I feel it’s a major mistake. I did a test on myself of what I think it should look like. Can you somehow say that you saw this test and that Universal is making a major mistake and they don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about?’ And he did. And it was outrageous responses from everybody. ‘What the hell is wrong with these people at Universal? I don’t want to see green Jim Carrey. I want to see a Grinch!’ Blah, blah, blah. So they finally caved in.”\n\t\n\n\tCarrey was also adamant about undergoing a full transformation into the character, much to his own detriment.\n\n\t“When it came down to actually designing the Grinch to look like the Grinch, they had to put the tip of my nose on the top of the bridge of the Grinch’s nose,” the comedian explained. “So, all of the rest of it was covered and I couldn’t breathe through my nose, and they had a real problem trying to get holes in the mask that could allow me to breathe through my nose. Ultimately, I ended up mouth-breathing through the entire movie.”Carrey continued, “The suit was made of unnervingly itchy yak hair that drove me insane all day long. I had ten-inch-long fingers, so I couldn’t scratch myself or touch my face or do anything. I had teeth that I had to find a way to speak around, and I had full contact lenses that covered the entire eyeball, and I could only see a tiny tunnel in front of me.”\n\n\tThe film’s producer, Brian Grazer, revealed to Vulture that the team originally offered Carrey the option of using digital special effects to turn his eyes green. But Carrey “didn’t want to do that. He wanted to have green eyes. They were like Frisbees in his eyes. He was in so much pain.”\n\n\t“It was something that I asked for that I can’t blame on anyone but myself,” Carrey admitted. “You’ve got to be careful what you ask for. You don’t think about it when you see an actor do a part that is about excruciating pain or whatever. But that actor has to live in that feeling. They don’t just go home and suddenly stop feeling it.”\n\n\tDirector Howard said Carrey “started having panic attacks” during the early days of filming because of how uncomfortable the transformation was on his body, adding: “I would see him lying down on the floor in between setups with a brown paper bag. Literally on the floor. He was miserable.”\n\n\tCarrey threatened to quit the movie after his first day of filming required eight hours in the makeup chair, with Howard revealing: “He was ready to give his $20 million back! I mean, he was sincere.”\n\n\tA solution came in the form of “a guy who trained the military on enduring imprisonment and torture,” who was brought on to the film’s set to prevent Carrey from quitting the movie and to teach him how to endure the hardship of his Grinch transformation.\n\n\t“Richard Marcinko was a gentleman that trained CIA officers and special-ops people how to endure torture,” Carrey said. “He gave me a litany of things that I could do when I began to spiral. Like punch myself in the leg as hard as I can. Have a friend that I trust and punch him in the arm. Eat everything in sight. Changing patterns in the room. If there’s a TV on when you start to spiral, turn it off and turn the radio on. Smoke cigarettes as much as possible. There are pictures of me as the Grinch sitting in a director’s chair with a long cigarette holder. I had to have the holder, because the yak hair would catch on fire if it got too close.”\n\t\n\n\t“Later on I found out that the gentleman that trained me to endure the Grinch also founded SEAL Team Six,” Carrey added. “But what really helped me through the makeup process, which they eventually pulled down to about three hours, was the Bee Gees. I listened through the makeup process to the entire Bee Gees catalogue. Their music is so joyful. I’ve never met Barry Gibb, but I want to thank him.”\n\n\tCarrey told ComicBook.com last year that he would be interested in playing the Grinch again if he was able to do it through motion capture technology and not makeup. \n\n\t“Oh, gosh, you know, if we could figure out the Grinch,” Carrey said at the time. “The thing about it is, on the day, I do that with a ton of makeup and can hardly breathe. It was an extremely excruciating process. The children were in my mind all the time. ‘It’s for the kids. It’s for the kids. It’s for the kids.’ And now, with motion capture and things like that, I could be free to do other things. Anything is possible in this world.”\n\n\tSpecial effects makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji worked with Baker on applying Carrey’s makeup every day and once revealed that he checked into therapy after working with Carrey because the actor was so difficult in the makeup chair.\n\n\t“In the makeup trailer he just suddenly stands up and looks in the mirror, and pointing on his chin, he goes, ‘This color is different from what you did yesterday,’” Tsuji once told Vulture. “I was using the same color I used yesterday. He says, ‘Fix it.’ And okay, you know, I ‘fixed’ it. Every day was like that.”\n\n\tHead over to Vulture’s website to read the full “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” oral history.\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrançois Ozon has emerged as the early frontrunner in France’s awards season, with “The Stranger” leading the nominations for the 31st Lumières Awards. \n\n\tConsidered France’s equivalent to the Golden Globes, the Lumières Awards are voted on by international journalists from 36 countries and are handed out during a ceremony that takes place roughly a month before the Cesar Awards and kicks off France’s awards season. The Lumières ceremony will be hosted on Jan. 18 at Paris’ Institut du monde arabe.“The Stranger,” an adaptation of Albert Camus’ literary masterpiece which was backed by Gaumont and world premiered at Venice, scored six nominations; ahead of Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” a black-and-white love letter to the French cinematic movement known as the New Wave, which opened at Cannes and landed five Lumières nods. \n\t\n\n\tDominik Moll’s “Case 137,” which is set during France’s yellow vests protests; and Stéphane Demoustier’s “The Great Arch,” a historical drama starring Claes Bang, followed closely with four nominations each. All four titles will compete for best film; alongside Abdellatif Kechiche’s “Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” which is the last chapter of the controversial French-Tunisian filmmaker’s coming-of-age trilogy and picked up three nominations.\n\n\n\tAside from best film, “The Stranger” is nominated for best director, actor for Benjamin Voisin, screenplay, cinematography and original score. Set in the early 1940s, the film depicts life in Algeria, then under French colonial rule and stars Voisin as the novel’s antihero, Meursault, who is sentenced to death after shooting a young Arab man five times. Voisin stars opposite rising French talent Rebecca Marder. \n\n\t“Nouvelle Vague,” meanwhile, is competing for best director, screenplay, best male newcomer for Guillaume Marbeck and best cinematography.\n\t\n\n\tOther notable nominees include Jodie Foster, who delivers a bold French-language performance as a tormented psychiatrist alongside Daniel Auteuil in Rebecca Zlotowski’s humor-laced thriller “A Private Life;” “Arco,” Ugo Bienvenu’s animated feature voiced and produced by Natalie Portman; Hafsia Herzi’s queer coming-of-age drama “The Little Sister” which won Cannes’ best actress prize for Nadia Melliti and just picked up the Louis Delluc Award from French Critics earlier this week; and Cannes boss Thierry Fremaux’s documentary feature “Lumière ! L’Aventure Continue,” an exploration of the invention of cinema showcasing more than 100 immaculately restored short films shot by Louis and Auguste Lumière.\n\n\tFoster will be facing off Isabelle Huppert for her colorful – and lauded — performance in “The Richest Woman in the World,” a film loosely based on the 2010 Bettencourt Affair involving the heiress to the L’Oreal empire. Lea Drucker in “Case 137,” Vicky Krieps  in “Love Me Tender” and Melanie Thierry in “La Chambre de Mariana” round up the best actress category.  \n\n\tJafar Panahi‘s “It Was Just an Accident,” a morally charged thriller that the Iranian filmmaker shot clandestinely, is vying for best international co-production, alongside Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Brazilian period thriller “The Secret Agent,” Albert Serra’s “Tardes de Soledad,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” and Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab.” Nominations for the 31st Lumières Awards:\n\n\tBest Film\n\n\t“Case 137,” Dominik Moll“The Stranger,” François Ozon“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” Abdellatif Kechiche“Nouvelle Vague,” Richard LinklaterBest Director\n\n\t“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” Abdellatif Kechiche“Nouvelle Vague,” Richard Linklater“Case 137,” Dominik Moll“The Stranger,” François OzonBest Screenplay\n\n\t“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Nouvelle Vague,” Holly Gent, Vince Palmo and Michèle Halberstadt“Nino,” Pauline Loquès“Case 137,” Dominik Moll and Gilles Marchand“The Stranger,” François OzonBest Documentary“Le Chant des Forêts,” Vincent Munier“Dites-lui que je l’aime,” Romane Bohringer“Lumière !

    "body": "\n\tElle Fanning‘s first arrest came at a Sabrina Carpenter concert. Just an hour before leaving for the show, she received a text: “Getting arrested tonight. Dress accordingly.”\n\n\tThe mock arrest, captured on the big screen for all concertgoers to see, was worth it.\n\n\t“At least it was a joint arrest,” Fanning laughs, referring to sharing the experience with her sister Dakota. “If it’s going to happen, might as well happen together.”\n\n\n\tIt’s fitting that Fanning approaches even staged arrests with grace and humor, because in Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” she plays Rachel Kemp, a Hollywood actress who must learn the hardest lesson of all: how to walk away from something she desperately wants.\n\t\n\n\tThe role came as a surprise. “I was a big fan, obviously, of ‘The Worst Person in the World,’ like everyone,” Fanning says. “You think of directors, and you think, ‘Yeah, Joachim, he’s on my bucket list,’ but I didn’t know if there would ever necessarily be a part for me.”\n\n\tWhen the script arrived while she was in New York preparing to shoot “Predator: Badlands” in New Zealand, her heart started racing. “I didn’t even necessarily care what the part was. After reading the script, I was in tears. And then I really just related to Rachel Kemp so much. I could just see how I wanted to play her.”\n\n\tWhat followed was a logistical ballet worthy of Rachel herself: rehearsals in Oslo, shooting an action franchise in New Zealand, then flying directly to France to film beach scenes with Stellan Skarsgård at the Deauville Film Festival — all while the festival was happening. Two studios worked together to make it possible, a rare feat in Hollywood, Fanning notes.\n\t\n\n\tRachel Kemp is an actress in crisis, miscast in a prestigious European film but desperate to prove herself. She’s goal-oriented, slightly thirsty, and lost.\n\n\t“I think you’re right,” Fanning says when asked about drawing from the experiences of actors she’s worked with. “There are definitely feelings that I can relate to, or maybe my younger self has felt. We find her at a place when she’s lost, and a little depressed herself. I don’t think she feels like she has much agency over her career and choices. She feels that she has so much to give, but you have to be given the opportunities or placed in those roles to show that.”\n\n\tThe key, Fanning explains, was balancing Rachel’s Hollywood star quality with her vulnerability. “I was aware that audiences have to believe that she is a big star. So there has to be a bit of that air.” But Rachel is also learning something crucial that she points to: “She’s learning how to say no for the first time and think to be confident in being like, as much as she wants something, she’s walking away for reasons that aren’t like, the director is a monster, or it didn’t pay enough money. She knows it’s a great opportunity, but she knows that it’s just not right. And that can be very hard for actors.”\n\n\tThe role comes at a pivotal moment in Fanning’s career. Having acted since age two — starting with playing young Dakota in “I Am Sam” — she’s navigated the treacherous transition from child star to adult actress with remarkable grace. Unlike many young actors who struggle to shed their childhood image, Fanning credits shows like Hulu’s period comedy “The Great” with helping audiences see her evolution in real time. “I felt myself growing in my power doing that show,” she reflects.\n\n\tNext on the docket is a long-gestating project. After years of delays, she’s finally preparing to shoot “The Nightingale” with Dakota, their first narrative film together through their production company. Originally scheduled to shoot in March 2020, the pandemic derailed those plans. “We were about to get on a plane to go to Budapest, right before the lockdown,” Fanning recalls. But she sees the silver lining: “Everything happens for a reason, and it’s even better now. We get to produce it now.”\n\n\tAs for those Oscar dreams, Fanning keeps it all in perspective. “I have been acting since I was two years old, so I have felt like I’ve had a lot of firsts, but I also know that I’m still young. It would be a very special thing. Of course, it’s the pinnacle of that, but you have to keep in perspective what matters in the world.”\n\t\n\n\tFor now, she’s savoring the response to “Sentimental Value” and the character who taught her — and Rachel — that sometimes the bravest thing an actress can do is walk away.\n\n\tOn this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Fanning discusses working on the Norwegian drama, transitioning from a child actor to one of the most exciting young adult performers, and finally getting to produce her first big feature with her sister Dakota. \n\n\tAlso on this episode, Amanda Seyfried, the star of the musical drama “The Testament of Ann Lee” who discusses dancing, singing and if we are getting “Mamma Mia 3.” Listen below!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMubi\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you get involved with Joachim Trier and “Sentimental Value”?\t\n\n\tI was a big fan of “The Worst Person in the World,” like everyone. You think of directors and you’re like, “Yeah, Joachim, he’s on my bucket list,” but I didn’t know if there would ever be a part for me. It all happened pretty quickly. I had finished “A Complete Unknown” and was about to go to New Zealand to film “Predator: Badlands,” and then I got a call saying Joachim was thinking of me. My heart just started racing. I didn’t even necessarily care what the part was. I wanted to work with him. After reading the script, I was in tears. I related to Rachel Kemp so much. We got on a long Zoom call, and we both had the same ideas about her. From that Zoom he said, “Okay, let’s do this.” But he also said, “I do like doing rehearsals, so you need to come to Oslo.”\n\t\n\t\tThat must have been complicated with your “Predator” schedule.\t\n\n\tThere was some scheduling stuff between “Predator” and “Sentimental Value.” I wanted to do both, which turned out to be kind of meta for the Rachel character. Two studios worked together to make it happen, which I’m so grateful for. Joachim finagled a couple of things too—he wanted to film the beach scenes in Deauville while the festival was happening. So I went to Oslo before New Zealand, we rehearsed for a week, and then I wrapped “Predator,” flew to Paris the next day, drove to Deauville and was on the beach with Stellan the next morning.\n\t\n\t\tWhat drew you to Rachel Kemp as a character?\t\n\n\tThere are definitely feelings I can relate to, or that my younger self has felt. We find her when she’s lost and a little depressed. She doesn’t feel she has much agency over her career, and she knows she has so much to give. Every actor wants the meaty role and a director who sees you and digs things out of you. Joachim is an expert at connecting with his actors and creating a safe space. I liked that she isn’t the cliché Hollywood star, but you still need a little of that air so audiences believe she’s famous. She’s also desperate and confused. She hits a real high during the monologue rehearsal—I’ve had that feeling on set—but it’s not captured on screen, which becomes a huge learning experience for her.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRachel eventually walks away from something she really wants. Have you ever had to do that?\t\n\n\tI’m a very instinctual person when I choose projects, and normally the first gut reaction is the one. There have been times where I’ve tried to fit a square peg in a round hole, but your initial reaction is usually right. I’ve never walked away from something as far down the line as she does, but the feeling is universal. I also love how Joachim wrote that she hits that high and then is lost again, and Gustav isn’t giving her the answers. Rachel’s the one who realizes it’s not about his mother—it’s about his daughter. I was so happy I got to have that scene with Renate.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve been acting since you were two. How did you navigate the transition from child actor to adult roles?\t\n\n\tPeople talk a lot about that transition period. I feel lucky because it happened organically for me. “Super Eight” was a big role for me at 12—it was the first time people recognized me for me and not as my sister. “Somewhere” was so important because it wasn’t a kid’s film. Then “The Neon Demon” came along when I was 16. It was my taste, and I really pick the directors. Staying true to that made the transition feel effortless. “The Great” was a big turning point too, because you watch that character grow from a girl into the Empress of Russia. I felt myself growing in my power doing that show. And comedy is harder than drama—it taught me a lot.\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned “A Complete Unknown” earlier. That role felt like a breakthrough.\t\n\n\tIt was such a tricky role because it was the least “famous” role in the movie. It’s easy to go into a biopic knowing someone’s voice or mythology. But Sylvie was like, “Who’s Sylvie?” It was the first time I saw myself doing the work for the audience to understand someone we don’t know. I wanted to make it as raw as possible.\n\t\n\t\tYou and Dakota are finally making “The Nightingale.” What has that process been like?\t\n\n\tWe were about to get on a plane to Budapest right before the lockdown in March 2020. Crew was already there. But in hindsight, everything happens for a reason. It’s even better now, and we get to produce it. It being a sister story—and us being sisters—is going to add a lot. We’re going in spring. I don’t fear it. I like fear. If you’re not getting nervous, that’s a problem. The book is beloved, and we want to stay true to it. We just have to do it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow do you and Dakota approach your careers differently?\t\n\n\tWe kept things separate growing up so we could find our own paths. Now we’re doing things together and have a production company. People who’ve worked with both of us say we work very differently. We’ve never run lines together or gotten involved in each other’s choices. Sometimes I’ll ask her, “Should I do this?” and she’ll ask me too, but we never talk about process. It’s going to have to merge soon—we’ll have to read lines together.\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s the best directorial note you’ve received?\t\n\n\tPeople say this all the time, but it’s true: I like simple notes. “Faster, angrier, slower.” Not over-analyzing or manipulating. I shut down with that. The best directors give you space but make you feel incredibly seen. Joachim is like that—he’s right next to the camera watching in real time. They’re not micromanaging. They want to be surprised, and I love surprising a director. Nicole Kidman once said, “Don’t ever cut a take.” If you think you messed up, just roll with it. The magic happens in the imperfections. I used to be a perfectionist about that, but I’ve tried to take her advice. It’s the director’s job to cut.\n\t\n\t\tHow would it feel to get an Oscar nomination after acting for so long?\t\n\n\tI would be really excited, and it would be very moving for me and my family. I’ve been acting since I was two, and there are still firsts. I had never been to the Oscars until last year, when I got to present. Being on that stage was incredible. You feel the Hollywood history and magic of it. I love old movies and old Hollywood stars. It’s the pinnacle. But you have to keep perspective about what matters—the experiences, the steppingstones. What will be, will be.

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains minor spoilers from “Silent Night, Deadly Night,” now in theaters.\n\n\tThe 1984 slasher “Silent Night, Deadly Night”",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains minor spoilers from “Silent Night, Deadly Night,” now in theaters.\n\n\tThe 1984 slasher “Silent Night, Deadly Night” was an above-average movie, which grew in infamy due to advertising that depicted a bloodied, axe-wielding Santa. Nationwide protests to shield children from the images coincided with the opening, which, of course, had the unintentional effect of drumming up more business. This ultimately led to four more chapters in the series and a loose 2012 reboot, yet most of the movies haven’t stood the test of time in the horror community compared to franchises like “Halloween” or “A Nightmare on Elm Street.”\n\t\n\n\tIn fact, horror filmmaker Mike P. Nelson says his first experience with “Deadly Night” wasn’t the film itself, but rather the advertising campaign.\n\n\n\t“I was born in ’82 and the movie came out in ’84,” Nelson says. “I do feel like a lot of people my age who weren’t able to watch the movie remember that poster: Santa Claus, but then he’s got an axe, and he’s coming down the chimney. That left a pretty big impression on me. From there, that movie was always forbidden. Not that my parents were like on the whole bandwagon of “Ban this movie,” but like horror movies in general, it was off limits. So I didn’t see it until much later in life.”\n\n\tPerhaps that’s why, when he was asked if he wanted to pitch an idea for a remake, Nelson went with a bold vision that wasn’t nostalgically beholden to the plot of the original.\n\n\t“It was super important to me to not over-think it,” he says. “I think it’s so easy to go into these and be like, ‘Oh my God, what does everybody want to see?’ And then you get mush. You get a gray pile of mush because you’re either trying to satisfy everybody or it’s too close to the original.”\n\t\n\n\tThe result is a wholly different “Silent Night, Deadly Night,” written and directed by Nelson, in theaters Friday via Cineverse. Outside of some key elements and nods to the original film series, it is nowhere near a beat-by-beat remake of the original. In Nelson’s vision, a young Billy Chapman (Rohan Campbell) witnesses a family tragedy perpetrated by a psychotic Santa. This causes him to snap and grow up to become a red-suited killer himself, guided by a mysterious imaginary voice in his head. But once he falls in love with a young woman (Ruby Modine) in a small town with her own issues, things go in very unexpected — and bloody — directions.\n\n\tSurprisingly, Nelson says the romantic thread of “Deadly Night” took inspiration from Will Ferrell and Zooey Deschanel’s quirky, mismatched flirtation in another holiday favorite, 2003’s “Elf.”\n\n\t“I’d be lying if I said that had no influence,” he says. “We have two very different people in our movie, obviously, but they have their thing. Billy literally has a demon in his head, and Pam is dealing with her own demons and explosive personality disorder. What does that look like when those two people come together? Is it explosive? Is it perfect? Or is it explosive perfection? It’s this perfect merging of these people that are going through crazy shit.”\n\n\tWhile Nelson has had success in taking big swings with genre reboots in the past — including the well-received 2021 “Wrong Turn” and this year’s “Friday the 13th” short film “Sweet Revenge” — he says that even the marketing team behind “Deadly Night” was surprised at how much the central relationship resonated with audiences.\n\n\t“We got to see what people responded to in that first screening, and we were all surprised at how well people responded to the love story and the warm, fuzzy, almost Hallmark-y vibe of it,” he says. “It was really cool. We knew it was there, but it’s ‘Silent Night, Deadly Night.’ It’s a horror film. But when we found that really good response to that, the marketing team said, ‘Well, let’s put more of that in [to the promotion]. Let’s show that there is a relationship story. There’s this romance, a kind of whimsy to it.’ Strangely enough, that has been a really good thing for the movie. I think it’s opened a wider audience. ‘Yeah, this movie is going to be probably violent and bloody, but there’s also this other aspect to it that I’m very intrigued about. It’s this love story.'”\n\t\n\n\tLike any good slasher, Nelson admits that he’s already considering more gory installments.\n\n\t“Ruby and I have already started talking about weird things, like where things could go,” he says. “We’ve been having a lot of fun. We’ve already created a handful of moments and scenes we’d love to see in it, and it’s absolutely off the wall. It’s a lot of fun, though, and it keeps in the same spirit of the movie. You learn more about the lore. But it remains a relationship movie. It remains a love story. There are so many fun things that we play with and expand on.”\n\n\tWatch the “Silent Night, Deadly Night” trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

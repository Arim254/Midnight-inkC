    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures has joined the outcry against Seedance 2.0, the Chinese video platform that has united Hollywood studios in their condemnation of AI-generated copyright infringement.\n\n\tIn a cease and desist letter sent Wednesday, the studio demanded that ByteDance immediately remove its valuable IP — including “Breaking Bad” and the “Spider-Verse” films — from the Seedance AI training data.\n\n\n\t“Given the egregious nature of Seedance 2.0’s outputs and the complete lack of observable copyright guardrails at launch, SPE can only conclude that ByteDance’s infringements are willful,” wrote Jill Ratner, general counsel of Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\t\n\n\tSony is the fifth studio to lodge a protest directly with ByteDance, following similar letters from Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros. and Netflix. ByteDance has sought to reassure copyright holders that it will strengthen its measures to prevent copyright infringement and misuse of actors’ likenesses, but that has not quelled the protest.\n\n\n\t“SPE will not tolerate delayed or half-baked measures,” Ratner wrote. “Please contact us immediately to confirm that effective, robust, and meaningful guardrails are being implemented forthwith.”\n\n\tSeedance 2.0 AI clips have circulated on social media since last week, with users taking the opportunity to stage superhero fight scenes and create alternate endings of TV shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Stranger Things.” \n\n\tThe Motion Picture Association — which represents all five studios, plus Amazon and Universal Studios — was first out of the gate with its condemnation on Feb. 12, when CEO Charles Rivkin called on ByteDance to immediately cease its infringement.\n\t\n\n\tOn Wednesday, Netflix threatened “immediate litigation” if the company did not comply.\n\n\tDisney, Warner Bros. and Universal are also pursuing litigation against Midjourney and MiniMax over their AI video models. Those cases are at the earliest stages. \n\n\tMiniMax, like ByteDance, is headquartered in China, and the plaintiffs have had difficulty serving the defendants. According to a court filing, the studios’ lawyer has been told that it could take 18 to 24 months to serve defendants via the Chinese Ministry of Justice under the Hague Convention — suggesting that any action against ByteDance would face similar delays.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe correspondents and producers who work at CBS News’ “60 Minutes” will soon leave the newsmagazine’s longtime New York offices as part of a consolidation of real estate  occupied by some of Paramount Skydance‘s best-known properties.\n\n\t“60 Minutes,” CBS Sports and “Inside Edition” are among the CBS productions that have long taken up space at 555 West 57th Street. All three will relocate to other offices in New York, a CBS spokesperson confirmed Wednesday. The “60 Minutes” staff will move to the CBS Broadcast Center, across the street, a large structure that once served as a dairy depot and now houses the bulk of CBS News, some CBS Sports production facilities, and shows hosted by Drew Barrymore and John Oliver, as well as CNN’s “Have I Got News for You.”\n\t\n\n\tCBS Sports and “Inside Edition” are expected to move to 1515 Broadway, a large office building that has served as New York headquarters for the company once known as Viacom and many of its cable networks, including Nickelodeon and MTV.\n\n\n\tThe office shuffle is the latest in a gradual downsizing of real estate for the company over the years. CBS, once headquartered in the distinctive Black Rock building in midtown Manhattan, opted to get out of that building once it merged with Viacom in 2019. Employees were notified of the current moves as much as two weeks ago.\n\n\tStaffers at “60 Minutes” might feel the real-estate pinch the most. The show has for years enjoyed autonomy from the rest of CBS News, and the separate offices, with individual quarters for each correspondent and top producers, only heightened the feeling that the program operated independently from the rest of the company’s journalism operations.\n\t\n\n\tCBS News and “60 Minutes” will start working in closer proximity as the show has been undermined by two different waves of corporate management. \n\n\tParamount, under its previous owners, the Redstone family, opted to pay a $16 million settlement to President Trump after he alleged a “60 Minutes” interview with former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris affected the course of the 2025 election. Legal experts believed the case was a flimsy one, but noted Paramount was under pressure to find a buyer and feared the suit would be an overhang. More recently, CBS News Editor in Chief Bari Weiss brought new scrutiny to bear on the program after ordering a report on the dire circumstances of migrants deported by the United States held, even though the show had already promoted the segment to viewers. The report, by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, aired weeks later, left relatively unchanged except for additional remarks before and after it aired on the program.\n\n\tThe moves are slated to take place by early 2027.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOver half of YouTube’s U.K. audience watches via a television set, according to the latest viewing habits report from U.K. ratings body Barb.\n\n\tAccording to the report, published today, while almost half of YouTube viewing is on smartphones, tablets and laptops, 54% is on a TV set across all demographics. Barb now calls the video platform a “significant part of the U.K.’s AV ecosystem.”\n\n\n\tYouTube is also the fourth most-viewed navigation platform making it, in Barb’s view, as much of a “gateway to content” as EPGs on traditional cable and satellite platforms. According to the report, ITV’s average YouTube reach via a TV set for its content was 4.9 million in 2025. For Sky that figure was 3.4 million and for Channel 4 it was 2.5 million.\n\t\n\n\tWhich means that as well as being a place for content creators to start their careers before crossing over to “traditional” broadcasters or streamers, such as Mr Beast and Mark Rober, TV companies are increasingly looking to the tech company for discovery.\n\n\n\tBBC Studios is among a number of traditional TV companies who have inked a partnership with YouTube. Last year the production company’s digital SVP Jasmine Dawson took part in a joint Mipcom panel with YouTube’s EMEA boss Pedro Pina, in which she extolled the benefits of working with the tech company. “We’re not sacrificing anything,” she said. “Actually it’s incremental. And that is a really powerful conversation to have our distribution partners, whether it’s ‘Bluey’ with Disney or some of our BBC Earth titles with PBS and other distributors, they understand that this is where the fandom grows, and then it drives incrementality.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever YouTube is bested by Netflix when it comes to switch on, meaning where a viewer goes first when they switch on their TV. According to this metric, a third of viewers go to traditional broadcasters, a third to streamers and YouTube combined and a third everywhere else.\n\n\tOf the third who go to the streamers/YouTube, Netflix leads the way with 14% of the audience going to the “Love is Blind” streamer first compared to YouTube’s 10%.\n\n\tFor 16–34-year-olds Netflix is the most popular platform and where 26% of that demographic go upon first switching on the TV. For children aged 4-15 years old 26% head to YouTube first in any viewing session with the TV set the most-used device for watching the platform.\n\n\tOther significant trends show the continued decline of live TV from 60% of all viewing on a TV set in 2022 to 45% in Dec. 2025. Unsurprisingly sport continues to be a big driver of live TV, with the Women’s Euros final, which saw England defeat Spain, draw in a combined average audience of 9.8 million across the BBC and ITV, of which 94% of people watched it live.\n\n\tFamily viewing also continues to pull in large live audiences, who consider it appointment viewing, including the Eurovision Song Contest grand final, “Celebrity Traitors” and even “Gogglebox.”\n\n\tOn-demand streaming continues to account for a large number of views, amounting to 38% of U.K. viewing in 2025. Curiously, a large proportion of viewing on Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and Netflix — the U.K.’s three biggest streamers – was library content that had been available for more than 12 months. According to Barb, “Bluey” accounted for 4.2% of all TV set viewing of Disney+.\n\n\t“Commentary about television is too often based on a binary premise that ignores a more complex reality,” said Barb CEO Justin Sampson. “Barb’s independent evidence points to a world in which viewing is defined more by adaptation than disruption.”\n\n\t“The prognosis is more connected, nuanced and resilient than the clichés and partial viewpoints suggest. Live audiences are healthy, children and young people haven’t deserted linear services, and there’s an increasingly symbiotic relationship between all services and platforms in the TV ecosystem.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmanda Seyfried has scored one of the biggest box office hits of her career with “The Housemaid,” which has grossed a mighty $374 million and counting worldwide on a reported $35 million budget. Seyfried was recently promoting the film on “The Graham Norton Show” and was asked about the movie being a boost to her career not only as an actor but also as an executive producer. The Oscar nominee openly admitted the latter title was a pure vanity credit.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m a producer on it and I didn’t know until three weeks in,” Seyfried said. “I saw the call sheet and I was like, ‘Executive producer? I didn’t sign up for that.’ I called one of the producers and was like, ‘You guys have me on as an executive producer.’ And he was like, ‘That’s what your agent negotiated.’ And I was like, ‘Well this really better be a hit then.'”\n\n\n\t“It was one of those vanity credits, because I didn’t do shit to make that movie. I only acted in it,” Seyfried added. “That’s the thing about vanity credits. I don’t want people to get it twisted. What Margot [Robbie] does is really intensely develop movies from jump. I just jumped in, had a bunch of fun and left. And now, I’m like, they’re sending me on a vacation.”\n\n\n\t“The Housemaid,” based on Freida McFadden’s best-selling novel of the same, stars Sydney Sweeney as Millie, a young woman trying to escape her past who is recruited to work as a live-in housemaid for the wealthy Nina (Seyfried) and Andrew Winchester (Brandon Skelnar), who have dangerous secrets of their own.\n\n\tVariety reported last month that Lionsgate is currently developing a sequel with Sweeney and director Paul Feig based on McFadden’s “The Housemaid’s Secret,” the second novel in the book trilogy. The first movie’s screenwriter, Rebecca Sonnenshine, is returning to adapt the next book. Sweeney and McFadden are attached to executive produce once again.\n\t\n\n\tSeyfried’s name was nowhere to be found when news broke of “The Housemaid’s Secret,” although she told Graham Norton that she wants nothing more than to be involved with the sequel. The problem is that  her character, Nina, is not included in the book as Sweeney’s characters goes to work for a new family.  \n\n\t“No one’s said anything about No. 2, but I guarantee there will be No. 2,” Seyfried told Variety’s Marc Malkin before official news of the sequel was announced. “And I almost guarantee that I’m gonna be some small cameo in it, because it’s about Syd and her working for a new family. And there’s so much that happens, especially with Michele’s character Enzo. I really wanna see how she keeps Nina Winchester in her pocket, because I will jump the fuck back into that.”\n\n\tWatch Seyfried’s full interview on “The Graham Norton Show” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” picks up where “The Way of Water” left off. The Sully family is hiding as they deal with the loss of son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters). When they take Spider (Jack Champion) to live with the Wind Traders, Varang (Oona Chaplin) leads the Ash People in an ambush on the convoy. The ilu, a sea creature that is ridden by the Na’vi, is also employed in the action sequence. In all, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” needed over 3,000 visual effects shots.\n\t\n\n\tWeta FX senior visual effects supervisor Eric Saindon breaks down how some of the key scenescame together.\n\n\n\tKiri, Spider and the Ilu\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVFX Progression Frames from “Avatar: Fire and Ash”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20th Century Studios\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Our live-action plate of Jack Champion was filmed in a shallow pool in New Zealand. The actor was seated on a camera-ready saddle, while the ilu’s motion was performed by our stunt team in blue suits, LED screens were reflected into mirrors to project the surrounding environment and reflections onto the water surface,” says Saindon.\n\n\tExcavators were operated with slightly offset timing and fitted with practical paddles designed by Steve Ingram’s SPFX team to generate gentle, overlapping waves characteristic of a protected bay.\n\n\t“Using our in-house live depth compositing tools, James Cameron was able to view a real-timecomposite of the live-action and CG worlds. The same setup also allowed us to generate per-frame geometry of the water surface, which was used to drive the FX simulations,” he says.\n\n\t“For the final composite, rotoscoping was used to extract Jack Champion and all water interactions from the plate. The matched FX simulation was then combined with a CG lower half for Jack and the underwater elements. The full CG environment and Kiri were added and composited together, with depth-based haze and physically accurate depth of field applied.”\n\t\n\n\tTulkun Council\n\n\tFor the Tulkun council scene, the animation team animated the Tulkun — huge, whale-like sea creatures — rising through a blocking simulation of the water surface. The simulation calculated momentum and volume displacement as the Tulkun ascended and broke through the surface.\n\n\t“As the Tulkun breaks the surface and displaces water, the resulting volume is coupled into the simulation, generating bulk water motion and splashes that affect the surrounding ocean surface,” Saindon says. “Thin-film simulations were used to model water running along the Tulkun’s surface and reintegrating into the bulk water simulation.”\n\n\tHe notes that water shed from the Tulkun’s head transitions from the bulk simulation into splashes, mist and atmospheric spray, driven by velocity and prevailing atmospheric conditions.\n\n\t“For the final composite, our in-house renderer was used to compute physically accurate atmospheric haze. Depth of field was set based on the lens data, and all compositing was performed using deep data,” he says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPeter Greene, the “Pulp Fiction” character actor who died on Dec. 12 at 60 years old, suffered a fatal accidental gunshot wound, it was revealed Wednesday.\n\n\tHe died from “a gunshot wound of the left axilla with injury of the brachial artery,” according to the New York’s Chief Medical Examiner office (via People). The bullet entered his left armpit and caused major bleeding after damaging the artery supplying blood to his arm, elbow, forearm and hand. Greene’s death was ruled an accident.\n\t\n\n\tThe actor had been found dead in his apartment in New York’s Lower East Side on Dec. 12, 2025. A neighbor reportedly called his landlord and the police to perform a wellness check after hearing music play non-stop in Greene’s apartment for several days.\n\n\n\tIn Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” Greene played Zed, a security guard who rapes crime boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Three of the characters — Greene’s Zed, Duane Whitaker’s Maynard and Stephen Hibbert’s gimp — were “psycho hillbillies” that paid homage to the 1972 film “Deliverance.”\n\n\tAlso in 1994, Greene played the villain Dorian Tyrell in “The Mask” opposite Jim Carrey. He was a mafioso with a plan to overthrow his boss by donning the powerful Mast of Loki, which transformed his physique to be muscle-bound and his voice to be deep and demonic.\n\n\tGreene appeared in almost 100 films and TV shows, including “For Life,” “Chicago P.D.,” “Hawaii Five-O,” “Justified,” “Life on Mars,” “The Black Donnellys,” “Tesla,” “City of Lies,” “Once Fallen,” “Permanent Midnight” and more. The upcoming drama “Clika” will include a posthumous performance by Greene.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “How to Get to Heaven From Belfast,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tIt starts, as so many things in Irish life do, with a wake.\n\n\tLisa McGee had wanted to take on the murder mystery genre for years. She just knew she couldn’t do it straight. “I was such a big ‘Murder, She Wrote’ fan,” says the creator of “Derry Girls,” whose semi-autobiographical Troubles-era sitcom became a global phenomenon by refusing to sand down its Northern Irish idiosyncrasies.\n\t\n\n\t“How to Get to Heaven From Belfast” is her answer — an eight-episode Netflix comedy-mystery and her first major project since “Derry Girls” concluded in 2022. Three childhood best friends, Saoirse (Roisin Gallagher), Robyn (Sinéad Keenan) and Dara (Caoilfhionn Dunne), are summoned to rural County Donegal after learning their estranged fourth, Greta (Natasha O’Keeffe), has died. Except Greta may not be dead. And Greta, it turns out, has secrets stretching back to a childhood religious commune, an abusive leader and a church that burned down with children inside.\n\n\n\tThe three women are not equipped to handle any of this. They handle it anyway — badly, loudly and, somehow, hilariously. They get locked in a confessional, blow up a boat and stumble into an underground women’s relocation network run by a quasi-assassin with a flexible attitude toward killing men. Though the darkness of the material never swamps the comedy, a balance McGee calibrated deliberately — less interested in the whodunit than in the women fumbling through it. “The idea of finding nearly the worst people to solve this thing was very amusing to me,” she tells Variety.\n\t\n\n\tBelow, McGee breaks down the making of “How to Get to Heaven From Belfast” from its murder-mystery beginnings to the unlikely heroes at its heart.\n\n\tThis show has a lot going on genre-wise. How do you describe what the show actually is?\n\n\tI saw someone describe it recently as a murder mystery, but then add “has there even been a murder?” — which I thought was quite good. The deaths aren’t your classic murders. I’ve been calling it a comedy mystery, because it’s a mash-up of those two tones. What I always hoped was that people are trying to piece a puzzle together while laughing. That was my ambition for it.\n\n\tYou’ve said you wanted to do your version of “Murder, She Wrote” — but with three women who aren’t good at it. Why did incompetence feel like the right way in?\n\n\tThose old mystery shows must have been incredibly difficult to write — so technical. I always wanted to have a crack at it because I was such a big “Murder, She Wrote” fan. But I knew I’d have to do it my way. My tone is fast and chaotic and Irish and funny. So the idea of finding nearly the worst people to solve this thing was very amusing to me. They get there in the end, but they really have to learn to trust their instincts. I just loved the idea of life getting in the way — you’re trying to be Jessica Fletcher, but you also have to sort out your kid’s birthday party.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe show taps into the true crime obsession that’s dominated the last decade, and the audience is overwhelmingly women. Why do you think that is?\n\n\tThat’s the question, isn’t it? I do not know why women are so fascinated by it, and I talk about it a lot with my friends. This is so depressing, but I wonder if it’s because most of the crimes are happening to women, so we’re trying to find out as much as we can about what is out there — like, no surprises for us if we know all the scary things that could possibly happen. That’s the depressing take.\n\n\tThe other take might be that women think they can sort shit out. Like, “I could solve it.” Me and my friends think we could solve these things, and we absolutely couldn’t. We’d be as bad as the guards in this show. But in my experience, the biggest true crime fans I know are all my female friends.\n\n\tYou joke that you and your friends think you could figure these things out — are Saoirse, Robyn and Dara based on your real friends?\n\t\n\n\tThey’re very much based on my real friendship group, yeah. I have a very glam mom of four who’s very forthright, takes no nonsense — that’s Robyn. And I have a much softer, gentler friend who looks after people, likes to care for people, a little bit eccentric too — that’s Dara. We do go on these trips together. We haven’t had to solve a murder yet, but we live in hope.\n\n\tAnd Saoirse — the television writer — is she you?\n\n\tShe was a way in, definitely. I could understand her career frustrations, her chaotic approach to life. But she’s 100 times more interesting than me — she’s got a lot more going on. There’s a point where she ceases to be me and becomes her own thing. But it was how I could start to get my head under the story.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNatasha O’keeffe as Greta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Barr/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGreta is the central mystery but she’s barely present — we experience her almost entirely through other people’s memories. Was it a challenge to make audiences care about someone who’s essentially an absence?\n\n\tGetting Natasha O’Keeffe to play her did a lot of that work. She had to sell everything without saying anything. The three leads are insane — they’re jumping out of lighthouses, blowing up boats — and then we go to Greta and she’s very still. All that trauma is in her veins. I tried to drip-feed information so the audience would stay curious, and by the end maybe understand why she did what she did.\n\n\tThat backstory — Greta accidentally burning down a church with children inside — is genuinely horrifying. How did you decide a comedy-mystery could handle that level of darkness?\n\n\tYou just have to try it. On the page, a lot is about what you leave out and what you suggest. Some sentences you simply can’t write because the tone won’t take them. With the heavy stuff, it was about saying as little as possible — giving the audience just enough information to fill in the gaps. And then we took some jokes out that were too close to that material, because they were burying the seriousness of the story. A lot got resolved in the edit. Using those visual flashes helped — you’re seeing something but not necessarily hearing it in dialogue. It was a real puzzle.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRoisin Gallagher, left, as Saoirse Shaw, Caoilfhionn Dunne as Dara Friel & Sinead Keenan as Robyn Winters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd how do you calibrate the tonal shift from comedy to darkness without giving the audience whiplash?\n\t\n\n\tI think a lot of it comes down to the performances. These three actors — Roisin, Sinéad and Caoilfhionn — have this incredible ensemble chemistry. To walk that line as an actor and go from the really stupid stuff to the more emotional stuff is so hard. They sell everything. They sell the stupid bits and they sell the really sad bits. That’s what makes the tone work.\n\n\tThe underground relocation scheme — basically a secret witness protection program — is a wild plot element. Up until the last 10 minutes I thought Booker and Feeney were evil. Where did the idea for the scheme come from, and what led you to give them redemption?\n\n\tI had this idea of not wanting anybody to be really bad or anybody to be really good. I wanted you to think Booker [Bronagh Gallagher] is psychotic at the beginning — she seems like a hitwoman. But then you realize she’s actually part of this organization that’s trying to help women, just in a psychotic way, in mad ways. She doesn’t have a huge problem killing people if she needs to, particularly if she has to kill a man. But she really believed in what that organization set out to do, which was help women start a new life. That got so corrupted and eroded over time. I really liked that she believed in something — and that sometimes believing in something very hard can be very dangerous.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSaoirse Monica Jackson as Feeney.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Barr/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSaoirse-Monica Jackson who plays Erin in “Derry Girls” turns up as a bubblegum-pink assassin’s sidekick whose costumes get more elaborate with every scene. How did that casting happen?\n\n\tBooker needed a sidekick — someone she would want to throw out a car window while it was still moving. I kept picturing this quirky blonde, like Gwen Stefani actually, and then I thought: Saoirse-Monica. Just the worst possible person to put next to Booker. She agreed immediately. I don’t think she’d even read it. And then the costume designer Kathy Prior just kept throwing more on, and it kept getting funnier.\n\n\t“Derry Girls” you wrote entirely alone. This time you had a writers’ room. What changed?\n\n\tI don’t think I would ever want to do something on my own again. “Derry Girls” was so personal it would have been complicated to explain to other writers. But having smart people you can go to for help — it’s just better. It’s eight hours of television. You’re trying to turn the story constantly. My husband is one of the writers and he’s very good at horror, which isn’t my strength. Some writers brought real emotional intelligence to the younger characters. And then Brona — there’s no situation too silly for Brona. She did all the stuff where they’re locked in the confessional. You need a specialist for all of it.\n\t\n\n\tThe show moved from Channel 4 to Netflix around the time of the writers’ strike. What was that transition like?\n\n\tNetflix have been amazing — they want to support the writer’s vision and help it reach as large an audience as possible. But honestly it felt the same, because my team hasn’t changed in 16 years. Same director, same producer, same production company, filming in Belfast. We just got the gang back together and made another show. Only now it goes out all over the world at once, which is terrifying. The idea that someone on the other side of the world who has never heard of Belfast might watch this — I still can’t quite believe it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSinead Keenan, left, as Robyn, Caoilfhionn Dunne as Dara, Roisin Gallagher as Saoirse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Barr/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the end Greta gets to leave with her daughter and husband under new identities. Will we be seeing her again?\n\n\tPossibly. There’s something connected to what’s in the bag at the end, and she might help with that. I also love the idea of throwing the three leads into a new, even crazier scenario—maybe taking them out of Ireland and bringing them back.\n\n\tIf there’s a season two, do the women get any better at solving mysteries?\n\n\t I don’t think they’ll have learned anything. They might have a false sense of confidence about themselves, which could be even more dangerous. Or cause more problems. Which would also be funny. I think it’s probably funnier if they’re still chaotic and not very good. \n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has released the main trailer for its upcoming Korean romantic comedy series “Boyfriend on Demand,” with Blackpink’s Jisoo leading a star-studded cast.\n\n\tJisoo plays Mi-rae, a webtoon producer worn out by her daily grind who escapes into a subscription-based virtual dating simulation program promising the dates of her dreams. The series takes its title from the in-story service itself, which offers custom-made fantasy scenarios tailored to each user’s ideal type. Set against the backdrop of office life, the show uses the virtual boyfriend concept to explore the gap between perfect fantasy and imperfect reality.\n\t\n\n\tThe trailer offers a closer look at the blend of everyday life and romantic escapism at the heart of the series. Mi-rae is swept into one date after another in the virtual world, while in reality she keeps crossing paths with Kyeong-nam, played by Seo In-guk, the two gradually becoming “overtime work buddies.” The slow-burn connection between them builds alongside her virtual adventures, hinting at a more grounded romance that complicates her idea of the perfect match.\n\n\n\t“Boyfriend on Demand” is directed by Kim Jung-sik, whose previous credits include “Work Later, Drink Now” and “No Gain No Love,” with a script by Namgung Do-young.\n\n\tDirector Kim Jung-sik said: “One of the most appealing points of ‘Boyfriend on Demand’ is that the main character experiences different romantic relationships with various individuals, in diverse settings and universes, all within a single series. As such, viewers can enjoy a wide spectrum of romantic comedies.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the virtual dating sequences, he added: “I focused most on portraying the many charms Jisoo has in the most versatile way possible. To do this, I used different occupations and added subtle variations to her character in the virtual world so that her acting style would feel distinct from Mi-rae in reality.”\n\n\tThe series features a lineup of virtual boyfriends with special appearances from Seo Kang-jun, Lee Soo-hyuk, Ong Seong-wu, Lee Jae-wook, Lee Hyun-wook, Jay Park, Kim Young-dae and Lee Sang-yi, each bringing a different flavor of romance to Mi-rae’s simulated love life. Ha Young and Yoo In-na round out the cast.\n\n\tThe series, which premieres March 6, is produced by Whynot Media, Baram Pictures and Kakao Entertainment.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n",

    "body": "\n\tPeter Krause is set to star in the NBC drama pilot “Protection,” Variety has learned. \n\n\tKrause is the first addition to what is said to be an ensemble cast, with NBC having picked up the pilot back in January. The logline for the pilot states: \n\n\t“When a U.S. Marshal falls in the line of duty, a seemingly cut-and-dry case turns into a deadly conspiracy as a family of law enforcement agents become the target of a mysterious assassin. Bridging personal differences and crossing professional boundaries, the Thornhill family must use the expertise from a lifetime of protecting civilians and politicians to protect one another and bring the killer to justice … even if it means betraying their sworn code.” \n\t\n\n\tKrause will play Mike Thornhill. The character is described as “a former Secret Service agent and now Assistant Director of Intelligence. Mike is a career blue-collar government worker who doesn’t want his job to end. He’s been the life of the party forever and that attitude has come at a cost.” \n\n\tThe role marks a return to NBC for Krause, who famously starred in the network’s drama “Parenthood” for six seasons. Krause was previously a main cast member on the hit Fox/ABC show “9-1-1.” He was with the show from the beginning, exiting towards the end of the eighth season in 2025. Krause has also starred in shows like “Sports Night” and “Dirty Sexy Money” at ABC. He is perhaps best known for his role as Nate Fisher in the critically-acclaimed HBO series “Six Feet Under,” for which he received three Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations. \n\n\tKrause is repped by CAA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. \n\t\n\n\t“Protection” hails from writer and executive producer Josh Safran. Jenna Bush Hager is also an executive producer, as is Ben Spector. Universal Television is the studio. \n\n\tKrause is the latest NBC drama pilot star to be announced in recent weeks. Previously, it was reported that David Boreanaz would lead the network’s attempt to reboot “The Rockford Files,” while fellow “Bones” alum Emily Deschanel will star in an untitled criminal profiler drama pilot. In addition, Damon Wayans Jr. will star in the pilot “Puzzled” about a man with Acquired Savant Syndrome. \n",

Quinton has been recovering nicely. He's now practicing writing, solving puzzles, and even has feeling in his legs again!

These rooms belonged to the 4 students who lost their lives to Kohberger's knife in November 2022 -- Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, and Xana Kernodle.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Other images show typical bedrooms belonging to college students -- maybe a bit messy, nothing out of the ordinary ... some clothing and school supplies strewn about, no blood in sight. Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke were the 2 survivors from that dreaded night ... completely untouched.\n      \n\n          Idaho police released the photos from the brutal slaughters Tuesday evening ... and some photos are quite graphic, showing blood smeared across the walls and speckled on surrounding furniture. We also got a look at some of the everyday items left in the house.\n      \n    \n          Kohberger pleaded guilty to murdering each of the victims in a plea deal that saved him from the death penalty.

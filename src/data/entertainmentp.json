    "body": "\n\tMatthew Lillard surprised fans during Cinespia’s “Scream” Halloween party screening on Friday night, and while talking to the crowd, he shared an emboldened message to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\t“Fuck ICE,” Lillard said. “In this time, in this city, we need to lead with love. Do not forget that shit in this moment. Not to be political, but to be political as shit.”\n\n\tHe also encouraged fans to vote for Prop 50, which allows California to redraw its congressional districts to combat redistricting in Texas.\n\t\n\n\t“Yes to 50. You have to vote. If you don’t vote, we are going down. So it’s on us. And if you don’t like that, I’m so not sorry,” he added.\n\n\tLillard stars in “Scream” as Stu Macher, who makes up the two-man killing team in Wes Craven’s 1996 horror masterpiece along with Skeet Ulrich’s Billy Loomis. Lillard is set to return for “Scream 7” alongside fellow original cast members Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox.\n\n\tEver since Donald Trump took office, ICE has remained top of mind for many in the U.S., and Hollywood is no exception. In early October, Jeff Bridges appeared as his iconic “Big Lebowski” character, The Dude, on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to proclaim, “Let’s get ICE off our streets and into our beverages, man.”\n\n\tLate-night satires like “South Park” and “Saturday Night Live” have also taken plenty of jabs at ICE. For example, the cold open on the Oct. 8 episode of “SNL” featured host Amy Poehler and Tina Fey as United States Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, respectively. During the sketch, Fey’s noem gave some context on how they hire people for ICE: “How did I find them? By running ads like this: Do you need a job now? Yeah. Are you a big, tough guy? Yeah. Tough enough for the army or police? No. Do you take supplements that you bought at a gas station? Daily. Do you like to use zip ties because people in your life don’t trust you with keys? You know it. Suck on some of these, big boy. Welcome to ICE.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFans will be seeing more of Ariana Grande on the big screen next year. \n\n\tGrande took to Instagram on Friday to announce that she has wrapped filming on the upcoming fourth installment in the “Meet the Parents” franchise, titled “Focker In-Law.”\n\n\t“These past few months have been so, so unimaginably special,” she wrote in the caption. “I love my Fockers, and I love my Byrnes… so, so very much. I will miss this bunch terribly. See you next November!” \n\t\n\n\tGrande’s Instagram post also featured a carousel of behind-the-scenes photos from set, including her hugging Ben Stiller, who returns as Greg Focker, alongside another photo of her locking arms with Beanie Feldstein.\n\n\n\n\tThe fourth edition of the long-running 2000 comedy film series is set to hit theaters on Nov. 25, 2026. \n\n\tStiller, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson are returning for “Focker In-Law” with Skyler Gisondo also joining the cast. \n\n\tJohn Hamburg, who wrote the first three films, directed and wrote the screenplay for the new installment.\n\n\tWhile the plot details remain under wraps, Stiller teased the fourquel during a 25th anniversary screening of “Meet the Parents” at this year’s Tribeca Festival.\n\n\t“What spurred the idea is that I’m the age that Bob was when we did the first movie,” Stiller said. “It felt like a mirror to the first film, where one of my kids is thinking about introducing his person to the family.”\n\n\tThe first film, which centered on Greg Fockner (Ben Stiller) enduring many awkward encounters while trying to impress his girlfriend’s parents before proposing, became a blockbuster hit, grossing $330 million worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tIts success led to the 2004 comedy spawning into two more successful sequels: 2004’s “Meet the Fockers” (which introduced Greg’s parents, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) and 2010’s “Little Fockers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGeorge Clooney said during a recent sit-down on CBS’ “Sunday Morning” that he had no regrets about writing his New York Times op-ed insisting that former president Joe Biden bow out of the 2024 presidential election. However, in hindsight, he feels that it was a “mistake” to have Kamala Harris step in for Biden as the democratic nominee.\n\n\tWhen asked if he would write his NYT op-ed again if given the chance, Clooney replied, “Yes. We had a chance. I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary. Let’s battle-test this quickly and get it up and going. I think the mistake with it being Kamala is she had to run against her own record. It’s very hard to do if the point of running is to say, ‘I’m not that person.’ It’s hard to do, and so she was given a very tough task. I think it was a mistake, quite honestly. But we are where we are. We were gonna lose more House seats, they say. So I don’t know. To not do it would be to say, ‘I’m not gonna tell the truth.'”\n\t\n\n\tAfter Biden’s disastrous performance during his first presidential debate with Donald Trump, many in Hollywood called for him to step aside for a more capable candidate. Clooney became the de facto face of this movement after his July 2024 essay. In it, he wrote of Biden, “We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter facing backlash for the piece, Clooney told CNN’s Jake Tapper that he felt it was his “civic duty” to call attention to what he believed was an imperative issue.\n\n\t“That’s the deal, you have to take your stand if you believe in it,” he said. “Take a stand, stand for it and then deal with the consequences. That’s the rules, so when people criticize me — they criticized me for my stance against the war 20 years ago, people picketed my movies and they put me on a deck of cards — I have to take that, that’s fair. I’m OK with that, I’m OK with criticism for where I stand. I defend their right to criticize me as much as I defend my right to criticize them.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe five participants for the second cohort of the Film Frontier Global Networking Program, who will receive 18 months of tailored support to advance their international careers, have been unveiled.\n\n\tDirectors Kaneko Yurina, Kusano Natsuka, Takahashi Sota and Fujimoto Akio, along with producer Yoshihara Hiroyuki, were revealed at an announcement event held during the 38th Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\n\tThe Creator Development Program operates under the Japan Creator Support Fund, established in 2023 within the Japan Arts Council through a subsidy from the Agency for Cultural Affairs. The initiative aims to nurture creative professionals capable of working globally by providing guidance for international development, supporting participation in overseas film festivals and facilitating networking with international industry partners.\n\t\n\n\tThe Global Networking Program is one of three Film Frontier initiatives, alongside the Feature Anime Creators in Progress and the Residency Program.\n\n\tAt the announcement event, directors Nakanishi Mai (first cohort) and Yamashita Tsubomi (Residency Program) reported on their current activities. This was followed by a panel discussion featuring selection committee member director Ishikawa Kei, TIFF programming director Ichiyama Shozo and guest Christian Jeune, deputy delegate and director of the film department at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\t“Once again, the applicants were of an extremely high standard, and the selection process was truly challenging,” Ichiyama said. “We chose projects that we believe are highly feasible, and I hope the participants will start working on them as soon as next year.”\n\t\n\n\tIshikawa offered words of encouragement: “As a director, I focused not on feasibility but purely on the excellence of the proposals. All of the selected projects are highly original and can only be created by these participants. I believe they will even become my competitors for my next work.”\n\n\tThe selected filmmakers expressed their gratitude and enthusiasm. Kaneko noted the value of support throughout the entire filmmaking process, particularly fundraising. Takahashi revealed he has wanted to make a film in Serbia for 12 years, calling the selection “a significant step forward.” Fujimoto expressed pleasure at receiving support while his film “Lost Land” screens at TIFF. Yoshihara said he was grateful his project was chosen despite being difficult to center. Kusano, via video message, emphasized her happiness at dedicating time to research for her next project.\n\n\tSince October, the program has expanded to include training in English-language pitching and development initiatives aimed at participating in international markets.\n\n\tKaneko made her commercial feature debut in 2023 with “People Who Talk to Plushies Are Kind,” which was selected for the Asian New Talent section at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival. Kusano’s second feature “The Kingdom (or About That House)” (2018) screened at International Film Festival Rotterdam and was selected by the BFI as one of the best films of the year.\n\n\tTakahashi’s graduation film “Memory Devices” won the Audience Award at PFF Award 2023. He directed “Addressee Unknown” in 2025 as part of NDJC: New Directions in Japanese Cinema. Fujimoto’s latest film “Lost Land,” about Rohingya refugees, won the special jury prize in the Horizons section at the 82nd Venice Film Festival and will be released across Japan in spring 2026.\n\n\tYoshihara is currently producing international co-productions including the Japan-Korea feature “3mm Love” and the Japan-Taiwan-Poland co-production “Good Death.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoland Sejko’s doc “A State Film,” culled from a vast archive of official footage made under the regime of Albanian strongman Enver Hoxha, is a fascinating study in the power of image and myth.\n\n\n\n\n\tScreened in the main competition at the Czech Republic’s primary annual nonfiction film event, the Ji.hlava Intl. Documentary Film Festival, the compilation of carefully constructed images for the masses contains much to unpack, says Sejko.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been working for several years with propaganda film archives — first with Istituto Luce Cinecitta, and also with the archives of the Albanian communist regime,” Sejko says. “Both contain thousands of films created to construct a political narrative, often with striking cinematic ambition.”\n\n\n\tThe genre is one Sejko explored in his previous film, “The Image Machine of Alfredo C.,” screened in 2021 at the Venice film fest. That film tells the true story of an Istituto Luce cameraman who filmed Mussolini and fascist propaganda, and, eventually, the head of communist Albania.\n\n\t“It was a hybrid film, but during its making I realized that the vast Albanian film archive — and the central figure of Enver Hoxha — had never been narrated exclusively through their own images.”\n\n\tSo Sejko, as a professional archivist and head of the editorial department for Italy’s Cinecitta Luce, set about analyzing and curating from the decades of state propaganda films.\n\n\t“The Albanian propaganda newsreels and documentaries clearly bear the mark of Eastern Bloc cinematography,” Sejko says. “The first Albanian camera operators were trained by Soviet masters — starting with Roman Karmen, the legendary chronicler of revolutions and wars.”\n\t\n\n\t“There was never a manual for the propaganda cameraman, no written rulebook for how to film a regime. Yet something invisible governed their images. A First of May parade filmed in communist Albania looks strikingly similar to one filmed in Moscow or Bucharest or Sofia in the same years.”\n\n\tIndeed, the images of cheering worker heroes and dancing girls in traditional folk garb seen in “A State Film” are hauntingly familiar.\n\n\tSpanning the post-WWII years, with Albanians urged to “obey and execute the laws of the government” while honoring heroes’ bloody sacrifices, the footage makes clear Hoxha’s devotion to Stalin and Yugoslavian dictator Josip Broz Tito.\n\n\tOutsize portraits of all three are hauled down endless streets as crowds of obligatory fans parade their wheelbarrows, shovels and carbines. Praises are sung for industry while defensive bunkers, of which Hoxha build hundreds of thousands, withstand test blasts, proving their readiness to stand up to decadent imperialist forces from the West.\n\n\tDogs and guinea pigs are sacrificed, presumably to test exposure to potential gas attacks.\n\n\tAnd all the while, there’s always another rousing patriotic song for the peasants to sing.\n\n\t“It is not just the cameraman’s technique that creates this resemblance,” Sejko says. “It is the vision of the world being shown: always the same choreography of collective joy.”\n\n\tThat said, as audiences take in “A State Film,” they begin to perceive that the images have been somehow distilled. Then they may notice the soundtrack, with the original heavy-handed narration replace by the sounds of the breeze in trees, birds chirping and feet tramping unpaved roads.\n\n\t“In official propaganda films — newsreels, documentaries, parades — the narrator’s voice was not descriptive but prescriptive: it told viewers what to think. Replacing it with another commentary, even a critical one, would have meant repeating the same mechanism.”\n\n\t“So I removed not only the voice but the whole original soundtrack, keeping only what was real — applause, songs, speeches. I built a new, realistic soundscape with footsteps, murmurs, creaks, silences, as if the scenes had been recorded live. This new texture restores the images’ physicality and opens a space where sound itself becomes a narrative tool.”\n\t\n\n\tAdd to this the intercutting of footage from Hoxha’s personal archive, showing moments away from the cheering masses, invariably featuring drives in the dictator’s favorite black Mercedes, and a striking contrast emerges.\n\n\tThese motifs take on a symbolic value, according to Sejko, and suggest the loneliness and isolation of power. “A State Film” raises the question of how forms of propaganda have changed, while also forcing uncomfortable realizations as to how many of the classic tropes are still being rolled out today.\n\n\t“A State Film” has been described as demonstrating “how the archive is not just a repository of images, but a tool for interpreting and rewriting history.”\n\n\tIndeed, the chilling parade of carefully staged scenes does seem to transcend the framework of national history, and, as the director says, explore the function of the image in the political sphere, and its ability to create collective memory.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOctober was a bust at the box office as big-budget tentpoles and awards contenders like Disney’s “Tron: Ares” and Dwayne Johnson’s “The Smashing Machine” struggled to sell tickets.\n\n\tOverall revenues for the month were tragic with $425 million across all titles, the worst collective haul since October 1997 — when psychological thriller “Kiss the Girls,” slasher “I Know What You Did Last Summer” and supernatural mind-bender “The Devil’s Advocate” were the top-grossing titles — with $385 million, not adjusted for inflation. This ignominious record doesn’t include 2020, when theaters hadn’t rebounded from the pandemic and major studios were less than eager to unveil new films.\n\t\n\n\t“An inauspicious Halloween ended a rather challenging month of October at the box office,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian.\n\n\n\tSure enough, this Halloween was especially dreadful with grosses between Friday and Sunday at just $49 million, marking the worst weekend of the entire year as holdover titles like Paramount’s Colleen Hoover adaptation “Regretting You” and Universal’s scary sequel “Black Phone 2” topped North American charts. Several reasons were to blame for the scary-low turnout, including a dearth of new releases as well as the misfortune of Halloween landing on a Friday, which meant families were distracted by trick-or-treating. Then there was Saturday night’s Major League Baseball championships, which saw the Los Angeles Dodgers win the World Series over the Toronto Blue Jays in a nail-biting Game 7.\n\n\tBright spots for the month — including Taylor Swift’s “The Release Party of a Showgirl” and Sony and Crunchyroll’s “Chainsaw Man” — were few and far between and weren’t enough to overcompensate for high-profile misses like Luca Guadagnino’s “After the Hunt” ($7.8 million), Disney and 20th Century’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” ($20 million), and Jennifer Lopez’s musical adaptation “Kiss of the Spider Woman” ($1.6 million). \n\t\n\n\tSci-fi sequel “Tron: Ares” ($126 million globally against a $180 million budget) and A24’s “Smashing Machine” ($19 million against a $50 million budget) were particularly expensive for their respective studios to produce and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in theatrical losses. \n\n\tBut movies of all sizes and genres, including the family adventure “Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie” ($68 million), Channing Tatum-led dramedy “Roofman” ($27 million), Aziz Ansari’s fantastical comedy “Good Fortune” ($14 million) and Neon’s supernatural thriller “Shelby Oaks” ($3.2 million), struggled to appeal to their target audiences. \n\n\t“The major releases this month failed to deliver. Simple as that,” says box office analyst Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations. He also believes that Hollywood under-delivered on scary movies during the spookiest month of the year. “Apart from the moderately successful ‘Black Phone 2,’ there just weren’t enough horror films to entice moviegoers,” Bock adds. “That should be a no-brainer.”\n\n\tOverall, it’s been an up-and-down year; April was unexpectedly huge with “A Minecraft Movie” and “Sinners” while March was abysmal with “Snow White” and “The Alto Knights.” Currently, box office returns are 2.9% ahead of 2024 — a gap that’s been rapidly shrinking since summer, when ticket sales were 25% ahead of last year. Meanwhile, domestic revenues remain more than 22% behind pre-pandemic times of 2019, according to Comscore. November and December releases, including “Zootopia 2,” “Wicked: For Good” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” are expected to close the year on a high note.\n\n\t“Not to fear though,” Bock says. “Holiday season kicks into gear next weekend — and Hollywood will be breathing a huge sigh of relief.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf only we could hear Norma Desmond rise up and sing: Don’t cha wish your girflriend, that little tart Betty Schaefer, was hot like me?\n\n\tThat does not happen in Nicole Scherzinger‘s current run of shows, which included a diverting stop Thursday night at Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown L.A. The show tunes stayed in their corner, and the Pussycat Dolls oldies stayed in theirs. It was a show with a slightly split personality, with musical theater numbers dominating the first three-quarters and the flashy pop perpetrated by her ex-girl-group taking over the last stretch. \n\t\n\n\tBut it didn’t feel like an impossibly wide chasm. Even as Scherzinger sang two bravura songs from the stage musical that brought her back into the limelight in a big way, “Sunset Blvd.,” you were reminded that that Broadway/West End show was rejiggered some when she was starring in it so that Gloria Swanson was a very distant memory, and so that you had to think of Norma Desmond not as a hag but as being a woman of a certain age who is very much H-O-T-T-O-G-O. And it worked.\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, there’s the F.O.M.O. that the L.A. theater community has suffered from not getting a local transfer of Scherzinger’s run in “Sunset” on Broadway. Of course, many Angelenos made their way east to catch her in that Tony-winning turn in late 2024 and early ’25. “You were everything in ‘Sunset’!” shouted the man in front of me, which is exactly the right thing to shout at a diva performance where everyone is just a little too mature to call out anything about mothering. So the full house was probably made up of about one-third jet-setters who already knew how spectacularly her “With One Look” would go, and two-thirds less-privileged locals who until now had only been able to guess it.\n\t\n\n\tAs the “Sunset” segment unfolded in the middle of her concert’s second act (the show that is “what’s gotten me here today,” as she told the audience), “With One Look” was really just the warm-up, though. The number that followed, “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” was the money song, the one that seemed redolent of Barbra Streisand’s own cover of the Andrew Lloyd Webber neo-classic. Throughout it, I sensed a few of the people around me who seemed eager for the song to end — not because they really wanted Scherzinger to stop singing, but because they were literally jittery on the edge of their seats, barely able to hold off jumping up for the inevitable standing ovation. I felt their twitchiness.  \n\n\tAnd not so very long after that peak, gown-clad classiness: the Pussycat Dolls’ “Buttons,” and the unveiling of a slinky, button-less catsuit to match. Because why not? Scherzinger clearly is favoring her stage-actress era nowadays, but she’s still got the goods to indulge in some throwback choreo, or cardio, from back in the day.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNicole Scherzinger at Walt Disney Concert Hall, Oct. 30, 2025.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTimothy Norris/Los Angeles Philharmonic\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis isn’t a full tour for the singer, but the last of three shows taking place in some of the world’s most storied venues — the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall and now (the day after she was honored at Variety’s Power of Women L.A. event) Disney Hall. It’s easy to imagine her taking it further on the road, if she doesn’t book another theater gig, or doing a residency. Would it draw a wider split of fans, in other cities, who might be attracted to come only for the Dolls stuff or only for a night of standards? Possibly, but she would likely leave everyone ultimately pleased, either way.\n\n\tThursday’s show certainly announced its primary intentions right at the start, with Scherzinger doing a faithful rendition of “Don’t Rain on My Parade.” That’s a bold way for a singer who hasn’t been known primarily for being in the theater arena that long to start off with — maybe too bold, in declaring that Streisand’s turf is her terra firma, too. Her version was terrific, for what it was, but not an especially imaginative or reinvented pick. From there, she got a little looser with the perennial Halloween/R&B favorite “I Put a Spell on You,” giving good growliness. “Diamonds Are Forever” was a great choice of movie song to include (Variety having previously declared it the best Bond theme of all time), and it was wise that she paid proper homage to the originator, but the issue remains of how difficult it is to out-Bassey Shirley Bassey. (At least she is a dozen times more capable of nailing it than poor, miscast Doja Cat at this year’s Oscars.)\n\t\n\n\tFinally Scherzinger arrived at the first song truly associated with her, with some chan-toozy banter to set it up: “Y’all look so good, I think I might ‘stickwitu’ forever. That reminds me of a song…” Hey, us too. The diversion to Pussycat hit territory was only a momentary one for the moment, veritably a trailer for the show’s finale. But there was something about it that seemed to put her on a surer footing, even as she returned to the stage and film perennials. A medley of Sondheim’s “Losing My Mind” and “Not a Day Goes By,” which seem to have become conjoined in the interpreter mindset somewhere around the turn of the century, offered a good teaser for the mind-losing possibilities of the “Sunset” material to come later.\n\n\tAnd then, for her pre-intermission closer, Scherzinger tackled “Cabaret’s” greatest number, “Maybe This Time,” the patron saint of songs for losers everywhere. She wouldn’t fit into a modern “Cabaret” production where the leading lady has to play it like an unpracticed waif, but she sure would have killed the role in the day when everyone looked to do it as skillfully as Liza. At the end, she sacrificed emotion for a moment of camp, but that was okay. Going back to the sort of nightstand where she kept her water bottle and Kleenex, Scherzinger crouched down in an odd way — was she working off a cramp? — and then reemerged holding something behind her back. “Maybe this time,” she belted, pausing for effect… out come her two biggest trophies, in either hand… “I’ll win!” She referred to them as her friends “Laurence and Antoinette,” as in, of course, an Olivier and a Tony.\n\n\tIntermission thoughts: Either you love this kind of blowsy, broad (in all the senses), old-school show-biz-stuff — lengthy patter interludes included — or you don’t. Anyone who doesn’t hold the same nostalgic hankering for veteran actresses holding court with one-woman shows might not be blamed for opting out. But Scherzinger is operating out of a great tradition with this stuff, and there aren’t a lot of others of her generation filling the void, at least with her profile coming from the pop side and the chops to work it on the theater side. She feels more born to this than she was to being a 2010s pop tart… although she was a good enough actress to pull that off, too. Being an Interscope sex bomb definitely did not allow her to casually walk around the stage making slightly off-color remarks in-between showing off coloratura prowess. All of which is to say, if this is a prelude to her doing shows like this indefinitely, and working up to putting “I’m Still Here” into her repertoire 20 years from now, some of us will be there for it.\n\t\n\n\t“The ladies are looking absolutely divine,” Scherzinger told the audience. “A lot of hot men in the house tonight.” Here’s betting she says that to all the Carnegie and Royal Albert Hall boys. Or maybe not. “Looks like all the WeHos showed up,” she added, getting a big enough roar to drown out whatever she said subsequently. She did not shy away from elbow-nudging humor. Talking of her heritage, she described herself as “Hawaiian, Filipino, Spanish, Chinese, Polish… Irish 2%… I also have some English in me, too. His name is Thom.” Her fiance, Thom Evans, came up for referencing again when she sang the one new, original song of the evening, the pop-R&B vamp “Bullshit”: “This is my idea of a love song. It’s about waiting for that special someone to, how do you say it, get it together (and) put a ring on it. You catch my drift?” Sample lyric: “Wake your ass up before I up and leave.” Flashing a ring after the song was over, she said, “Needless to say, he got the message.”\n\n\tScherzinger did not ignore the folks in the balcony behind her, although she meant to, at times. “You’ve got the best seats in the house!” she informed them early on. Much later, toward the end of the second of three acts, she got verklempt as she started talking about Prince, whom she described as “a big part of who I am — he was my mentor, my big brother.” Retreating back to the nightstand, she took a moment to turn her back to the audience and wipe her nose. “Thank God for these tissues…” Then she remembered there was a whole separate audience behind the stage. “Oh great, you guys are here; I’d forgotten that. Give it up for my surprise party back there.”\n\n\t“Purple Rain” was her main sop to mainstream pop-rock tastes, and to the one who makes her cry. The “La Cage aux Folles”/Jerry Herman/Gloria Gaynor anthem “I Am What I Am” was her main sop to the WeHos, as she put it. As for the pure Broadway demographic in the crowd, although she mostly stuck to musical theater’s greatest hits, it was a delight when, to kick off the final act, she brought out the cheeky “Drowsy Chaperone” number “Show Off,” which is exactly what she intended to do for the finale. She appeared for this last bit in what almost appeared to be an elegant bedroom dressing gown, sipping tea (“Let me put this down before I spill too much,” she said), which eventually showed some leg. And then was abandoned altogether to show a lot more than that, as the show settled into its full-Pussycat end run.\n\t\n\n\tWith the final Pussycat Dolls medley, Scherzinger — hoofing it up in black lace and heels, somehow looking about a foot taller than her 5’5″ frame — was all about the life of a showgirl. That’s what would truly draw ’em in, probably, if she ever deigned to do this as a Vegas residency. \n\n\tBut what most of this Disney Hall audience will remember most is that two-song “Sunset Blvd.” bit, where Norma came alive on west-coast home turf, minus the Broadway stage blood. Without Jamie Lloyd’s cameras there to do close-ups, Scherzinger played the anti-heroine just a little less for obsessive mania and more for pure Barbra-style butter. Norma Desmond doesn’t really have to be portrayed as a killer when, from this murderously good revue, we already understand that Nicole Scherzinger is one.\n\n\tSetlist for Nicole Scherzinger at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, Oct. 30, 2025:\n\n\tDon’t Rain on My ParadeI Put a Spell on YouDiamonds Are ForeverStickwituYou Raise Me Up/ReflectionLosing My Mind/Not a Day Goes ByMaybe This Time\n\n\tSet 2:I Am What I AmBullshitWith One LookAs If We Never Said GoodbyePurple Rain\n\n\tSet 3:Show OffButtonsWhen I Grow UpDon’t ChaDon’t Hold Your Breath\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Podnieks on Podnieks” is the story of a phenomenally influential Latvian documentarian who is remembered by relatively few today – but whose work was once seen by over 40 million people in the former Soviet Union. The film played last week at Ji.hlava Intl. Documentary Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\tThat Juris Podnieks’ films, which chronicled what he called “the death of the monster,” as the director called the last days of the Soviet Union, were seen by anyone was something of a miracle. A likely reason that happened was because he worked in the era he did, says Anna Viduleja, who co-directed “Podnieks on Podnieks” with Antra Cilinska, a former editor for Podnieks.\n\t\n\n\tIn fact, Podnieks, who died under mysterious circumstances in 1992, gained worldwide attention for his relentless need to “be there” during events that would turn out to mark the end of the Cold War.\n\n\n\tThe BBC would turn to him for accounts of uprisings in his native Latvia in which protesters faced off with Moscow-backed armies, sometimes fatally. Podnieks himself witnessed his cameraman taking a fatal hit while the team were recording events on the streets of Riga in 1992. Another colleague died later of injuries caused by troops trying to quell the mass choruses singing songs banned by the Soviets, something Podnieks put into his film “Homeland.”\n\n\tBut in Podnieks’ own country, he was celebrated and respected as a rare source of truth telling and courageous reporting on a world that was changing fast.\n\n\t“Podnieks on Podnieks” reveals the thoughts, worries and drive of this remarkable figure, using personal diaries, photographs and film footage, presenting what Viduleja calls the life journey of a filmmaker who reflects on his obsessions but is unable to control them.\n\t\n\n\tWhen the film was being conceived, says Viduleja, the discovery of the director’s personal journals was a breakthrough moment.\n\n\t“After I was invited into the project by Antra Cilinska, director, producer and the head of JPS – Juris Podnieks Studio,” she recalls, “I found a Latvian magazine Kino Raksti from 2000 in which there was an excerpt from Juris Podnieks diary from 1975.”\n\n\t“The passion for his creative tasks, precise details of the filmmaking process in the Riga Documentary Film Studio as well as his kind attitude to his newly wed wife and personal hopes were in these pages.”\n\n\tTelling Podnieks story incorporating his own thoughts, she says, “seemed to be the answer.”\n\n\t“I looked at the shelf above and the books: Fellini on Fellini, Bergman on Bergman, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, Cassavetes on Cassavetes… so “Podnieks on Podnieks” seemed to be the right title.”\n\n\tAt first, the directing duo had only the diary excerpts the magazine had used, Viduleja says, “but then Podnieks diaries started to appear one by one as we were working with the particular film archive materials. As if Juris would be watching us from the edge of a cloud above there asking, ‘Do you need my thoughts on the making of the Strelnieku zvaigznajs (‘The Constellation of the Riflemen’)?”\n\n\tAnd more diary pages would be uncovered.\n\n\tThey found detailed entries written during the making of the film about the last Latvian Rifles units and also Lenin’s Praetorian Guard soldiers.\n\n\t“Or later as we researched the materials on Podnieks making the film about the post-war generation of sculptors: ‘Sisyphus Rolling a Rock.’ Or his most dear film, ‘Is it Easy to be Young?’”\n\n\tEach time, someone who had been close to Podnieks would share more of the director’s journals with Viduleja and Cilinska.\n\n\tThe latter film was made based on the confessions of young people living in Latvia who openly spoke of patronizing teachers and parents, worries for the future and fears over fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\n\tThe 1986 film also included accounts by former conscripts who had been forced to participate in the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, making clear the hopelessness and brutality of the war, starkly contrasting with the Kremlin’s version of a war of progress and purpose.\n\t\n\n\tIf made even a few months earlier, “Is it Easy” would likely have been banned, says Viduleja. Instead, “The political changes that were started by Gorbachev gave this film a chance to land on the screen and after that it was not possible to stop it anymore.”\n\n\t“Juris’ cousin, Inara Zeltiņa, granted us his diaries, revealing the tasks he set himself during the process of creating his honest relationship with the young generation portrayed in the film.”\n\n\tIn 1978 Podnieks wrote in a letter to his colleague, “Maybe it is my arrogance to say that I shall come and using my eye and my head shall tell the whole truth, but I am determined to do so!”\n\n\t“Podnieks ability to recognize the wider political and social processes that were happening in the society,” says Viduleja, “combined with his sincere and deep interest in the life of the person he was talking to, is the reason why his film was understood and valued by those tens of millions of Soviet people.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRevered Indian actor Naseeruddin Shah (“Monsoon Wedding”) has joined the Oscar-qualifying documentary “Far From Home” as executive producer, marking his first foray into the documentary space in this capacity.\n\n\tThe short doc, currently campaigning for best documentary short at the Academy Awards, chronicles the plight of Afghan refugees in India through the story of Samira Faizi, who fled to the country in 2021 following the Taliban‘s takeover of Afghanistan.\n\t\n\n\t“The film showcases her struggle in setting up base in India, whose political environment has changed and is no longer welcome for refugees. The film sheds light on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), that excludes Muslim refugees from a pathway towards citizenship and its impact on Afghan refugees, who have no country to go back to,” according to the film’s synopsis. \n\n\n\t“I’ve always believed the most important function of cinema is to act as a record of its times,” Shah said. “Since it is the only medium that can do that I consider documentaries to be of more value for posterity than features.”\n\n\t“Refugee rights is a tricky topic in India and given the current political scenario, refugees are scared to talk or come forth in public,” said Kumar, a former journalist. “I am proud of Samira for her bravery in telling her story and bringing awareness across the world about the situation of Afghan refugees in India.”\n\n\t“When one thinks of refugees, they usually visualize them on a boat going to Europe or on the US-Mexico border. But rarely do we talk about refugees who are in parts of the world where there is no framework to integrate them,” she added.\n\t\n\n\tEmmy-winning producer Brent E. Huffman produces the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting-funded project, which was a Japan Prize finalist and runner-up for best short documentary at the Chicago South Asian Film Festival.\n\n\t“Far From Home” has made the rounds at multiple festivals, including the Oscar-qualifying American Documentary and Animation Film Festival and Tasveer Film Festival.

    "body": "\n\tTribeca Festival Lisboa wrapped its second edition on Saturday after hosting a bevy of U.S. talent, led by Meg Ryan, Kim Cattrall, Edie Falco, Giancarlo Esposito, Ed Westwick and Daniela Ruah and Piper Perabo and director Stephen Kay, her husband. \n\n\tThe co-organizers – Tribeca Enterprises and Portuguese media group Impresa – said they’re delighted by the way that the spirit of the New York festival is bringing fresh energy to the Portuguese film and TV sector.\n\t\n\n\t“We thought we were only going to do one festival, back in 2002 and now we’re now going to be 25 years old!” commented Jane Rosenthal, Tribeca co-founder and CEO. \n\n\n\t“Continuous learning is what makes any festival a living breathing organism. We look forward to bringing more of our expertise here, especially through our mentorship programs. \n\n\tShe added: “Like New York, Lisbon is a very international city. I feel very much at home here. I have my own Portuguese connection from my childhood in Providence, Rhode Island, where one of our most famous senators was Claiborne Pell, whose father served as U.S. ambassador to Portugal and of course I was lucky to grow up around great Portuguese bakeries!” \n\n\tFrancisco Pedro Balsemão, Impresa CEO, explained that with the success of Tribeca Lisboa  and after attending two editions of Tribeca in New York, he would now like to organize a year-round program of Tribeca-linked initiatives and incorporate the associated mentoring expertise into the wider producing strategy of the Impresa Group: “For this year’s edition we made sure that there are more screening venues, more talks focusing on a wide array of filmmaking skills, bringing it closer to the New York festival, where the Tribeca neighborhood itself is also a key element.”\n\t\n\n\tVarious fruits of the Tribeca-Lisbon connection were highlighted during the fest’s second edition, including Chazz Palmentiri who after attending last year’s edition with his documentary, “A Bronx Tale: The Original One Man Show,” now plans to return to Lisbon to stage the first live performance of his show outside the U.S. \n\n\t“We’ve upgraded this year’s event,” explained Tony Gonçalves, former AT&T-exec, who is one of the fest’s executive producers. “We’ve changed from a one-size-fits-all festival pass to individual ticketing, and most of the films are sold out.” \n\n\t“There’s a lot of resonance between New York City and Tribeca,” says Cara Cusumano, Tribeca’s Festival Director and senior vp of programming. “Our flagship event filled a need of both the city and the local industry. I think that Tribeca Festival Lisboa has that potential as well.”\n\n\tHeld in Lisbon’s Beato Innovation District over Oct. 30–Nov. 1, Tribeca Lisboa showcased five films from the flagship Tribeca festival, together with other U.S. independent films and Portuguese films. \n\n\t“The timing of this festival is perfect to raise awareness, in the buildup to the Awards season,” says Cusumano. “Last year, the Portuguese premiere of ‘Anora’ put us clearly on the radar.”\n\n\tJulian Schnabel’s ‘In the Hand of Dante’ opened this year’s fest, in a ceremony that included a tribute to Impresa Group founder, Francisco Pinto Balsemão, who died Oct. 21. \n\n\tOther titles, that didn’t previously screen in Tribeca in New York, included Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia,” and Scarlett Johansson’s directorial debut, “Eleanor the Great.” Mexican director Michel Franco attended for the Portuguese premiere of “Dreams.”\n\n\tTwo films from Tribeca’s New York line-up have a direct Portuguese connection: Lilian T. Mehrel’s dark comedy, “Honeyjoon,” shot in the Azores, and Alberto Arévelo’s Spain-to-Portugal road movie, “All We Cannot See.” \n\n\t“Honeyjoon,” which won Tribeca’s AT&T 2024 Untold Stories $1 million award, was produced by Portuguese producer, Andreia Nunes, and had its world premiere at Tribeca in June. “It feels very full circle,” explained Mehrel, “It’s so rewarding to see a film that is inspired by real life, real grief, real love, based on my original trip to the Azores, to be celebrated in New York and now here.”\n\t\n\n\tForeign talent attending the event heaped praise on Portugal. Meg Ryan said she wants to travel to Nazaré, after watching Chris Smith’s documentary series “100 Foot Wave,” featuring Garrett McNamara. “Are those waves real?” she asked. \n\n\tThe event also served to showcase rising international interest in Portuguese film and TV, with one of the highlights being discussion of Netflix’s “Turn of the Tide,” featuring director Augusto Fraga and the lead cast, including José Condessa and veteran actor Joaquim d’Almeida. Almeida recently returned to Portugal after a four decade career in Hollywood. Fluent in five languages, he confided that he gets more nervous when acting in his native tongue. \n\n\tOther Portuguese films screening during the fest included Antonio Ferreira’s colonial war pic, “The Scent of Things Remembered,” Duarte Neves’ feature debut, “Match,” and Fernando Vendrell’s aviation pioneers drama, “Além do Horizonte – A Travessia,” based on his series “Star Sailors.” \n\n\tCasting directors Cindy Tolan, Lucy Bevan and Patricia Vasconcelos provided a  masterclass and held a series of casting sessions with Portuguese actors in the build-up to Passaporte Lisboa, a casting festival that runs in November.\n\n\tVasconcelos who curated this year’s talks, said she’s delighted to program such a wide array of topics, including how to leverage Portugal’s tax incentives. Podcasts were curated by Joana Beleza, who invited various well-known podcasters to the festival, making it possible to reach beyond the immediate fest audience. \n\n\tLatvian producer Matiss Kaza discussed making “Flow,” that won the 2025 Animation Feature Academy Award, and how smaller countries such as Latvia and Portugal can put together international co-productions. \n\n\tLisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas concluded that he’s delighted by this year’s edition: “I want to create dynamism for our city and want to create a dream, and Tribeca is an integral part of that dream.”\n",

That’s when George stepped in, warning the guy to put her down or things would get ugly fast.\n      \n\n          George says the would-be kidnapper dropped the woman and bolted before police and an ambulance arrived. He gave cops his account of what went down ... we’ve reached out to authorities ... so far, no word back.\n      \n    \n          George adds, \"I hope she’s okay.

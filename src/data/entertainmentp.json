    "body": "\n\tWith negotiations heating up over Netflix’s bid for Warner Discovery, the streamer’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos plans to visit the White House for meetings on Thursday.\n\n\tSarandos is sure to discuss President Trump’s recent demand that Netflix fire board member Susan Rice. However, it’s not clear whether Sarandos will actually be meeting with Trump at the White House, according to Politico.\n\n\tOn Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Netflix should “immediately” fire former UN ambassador and board member Rice or “pay the consequences.” Sarandos responded in an interview, “This is a business deal. It’s not a political deal.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile Netflix is working to finalize a deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studios and streaming businesses for $83 billion, Paramount Skydance recently increased its offer to $31 a share. \n\n\tWBD’s board “will engage further” with Paramount to determine if a “company superior proposal” — a term defined within the language of its existing Netflix pact — can be reached. Netflix will have four business days to propose revisions to its deal if the WBD board finds Paramount Skydance’s offer to be superior. \n\n\tMeanwhile, Paramount CEO David Ellison attended Tuesday’s State of the Union address as a guest of Republican  Senator Lindsey Graham. \n\n\tThe Department of Justice Antitrust division is currently assessing Netflix’s market power and dealmaking, while Sarandos told Variety recently that he has been working hard to combat the perception that Netflix has an outsized share of the market. \n\n\t“Most of the work that we’ve been doing is un-ringing the bells of a misinformation campaign. What is our market share? I mean, the market share is very clear. Nielsen publishes the market share constantly, called The Gauge, and it shows that we are 9% of the business. And if you put HBO together with us, we’re 10% of the business. And it certainly is nowhere near monopoly, which folks have been batting around the last couple of days, which is 50-70% market share. It’s insane,” Sarandos said Friday. \n\t\n\n\tNetflix had no comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s not difficult to see why Kelly Ripa has spent the last 25 years as host of “Live.” A natural blend of wit, enthusiasm and inquisitiveness was evident from her first appearance as a guest host alongside Regis Philbin in 2000. It was evident then — and now, as Ripa immediately begins asking the questions during our discussion — that that’s who she is.\n\n\t“I don’t care if it’s the flight attendant on the plane or the person that I just met standing in line at Starbucks,” she says. “I want to know the origin story of the person.”\n\t\n\n\tRipa’s origin story with “Live” begins in 2000, when Philbin’s co-host of 15 years, Kathie Lee Gifford, departed. There was a slew of people — Gloria Estefan, Rosie O’Donnell, Lisa Rinna and Whoopi Goldberg, to name a few — in the rotation as guest hosts in the following months. Ripa wasn’t one of them.\n\n\n\tRipa had been playing the scrappy Hayley Vaughan on ABC’s “All My Children” for a decade and, unbeknownst to virtually everyone, she was expecting her second child with husband Mark Consuelos.\n\n\tBut while she wasn’t looking for the hosting gig, she filled in one day, and it was clear she was the front-runner for the spot from her first appearance.\n\n\tThree months later, the show was rebranded “Live With Regis and Kelly.” She’d sit next to Philbin for the next 10 years until he left the show in 2011. Michael Strahan and Ryan Seacrest occupied the chair next to Ripa in the years that followed. Then, in 2023, the perfect partner came along — Ripa’s real-life one.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos co-host “Live with Kelly and Mark.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney  via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis time, there were no co-host auditions. Consuelos, who had regularly filled in on the show over the years, was made the permanent co-host on April 17, 2023.\n\t\n\n\tNow, Ripa looks back at her start on “Live” — and her future. She even turned to Oprah Winfrey, who left her daytime show in 2011 after 25 years, for advice. \n\n\tWhat do you remember of your first time guest hosting?My first day was the day after Halloween. The only reason that sticks out in my head is because Mark and I knew we were pregnant. We hadn’t told anyone. They tell you at the show, “Come with something to talk about for the host chat.” I was like, “I have a lot to talk about because I just took a 3-year-old trick-or-treating.” There was a psychic on the show, Char Margolis, that we were going to be interviewing. She came out and told the world I was pregnant.\n\n\tYou were on “All My Children” for 11 years when Kathie Lee Gifford decided to leave. Did someone come to you and say you should try out?I knew I was pregnant with our second child and working on a soap opera is an extraordinarily demanding schedule. I was like, “I don’t think I can do this with two kids. It’s not fair to me, and it’s not fair to the kids.” My contract at “All My Children” had a year and a half left and I decided at that point that I would just stop working and raise my kids. I wasn’t paying attention at all to the Kathie Lee of it all — I certainly wasn’t looking for that job. \n\n\tBut you were convinced?I think part of the reason I was attractive in any way is because I was the one person not pushing to get an audition for that show. My boss at the time was Angela Shapiro. She said, “I think you should fill in for Kathie Lee.” And I was like, “Angela, I’m exhausted.” What I didn’t tell her was, “I’m pregnant and I’m exhausted.” Then she said, “We had somebody cancel.” I did it, I had fun, but it was not on my radar at all to do that show. I guess there was an audience response to me. I really never thought about it again and then I got a call right away to come back and do it again. The rest was history. I think, by December, they were already negotiating my contract. It was very fast. I think I had hosted three times and then they signed me to a contract.\n\n\tDid your nerves immediately kick in?When there’s something at stake, a far greater pressure is on you when you are a co-host versus when you’re just a fill-in person. I felt terrified.\n\t\n\n\tWhen did that go away?Maybe the eighth year? It took me a while to not feel terrified. It really took a long time to get comfortable. What surprised me about Mark is how comfortable and good at it he was immediately. Where it took me eight years to become comfortable, it took him maybe eight days!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©ABC/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen did you realize that this was going to be something you’d be doing for a long time?When I tell you I never knew it was going to be a long-term thing — I’m still on the fence about it being a long-term thing! The fact that we are celebrating my 25th anniversary does not seem real to me.\n\n\tIn the early days of “Live,” you were still on “All My Children,” then did three years of “Hope & Faith.” Right now, you have this and your podcast — on top of home responsibilities. How would you describe your work ethic?I’m always busy. I always work. I feel like I burned out for a while because I was offered a lot of things after the sitcom that I turned down outright. They were big things. I was like, “Wait, why did I take this talk show in the beginning?” Because it allowed me the opportunity to be a present parent while still earning a living at the end of the day. So, I went back to that. \n\n\tYou interview so many people. Who is the last person that made you nervous?They all get me excited. The reason I’ve been able to maintain longevity in this job is because I assume the role of the person at home that is excited. I’ve always been curious about people. And I don’t care if it’s the flight attendant on the plane or the person that I just met in line at Starbucks. I want to know the origin story of the person — no matter who it is. If Madonna comes on, I’m up at night planning how I can try to look cool in front of her. I guess that’s the exception.\n\n\tHow much longer do you want to keep hosting the show?Let me give Oprah credit. She left her show at the 25-year mark, and I said to her, “Should this be my signal?” She’s like, “Don’t leave. Don’t do it. Right now, you’ll regret it.” She said, “With you and Mark, the dynamic, the show is more important than ever. People really relate to it, and they need that in this world of a lot of darkness and an endless 24-hour, never-ending news cycle.” I need to actually ask her, “You said not to leave at 25, but what year? What are we thinking? Give me an idea of how far beyond 25 I should go.” But I always say, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. We are really having a very good time. \n\t\n\n\tSo, no end date in sight?I want to see this show stay on the air as long as linear TV lives. The show is far more important than any two hosts, so I just want the show to live forever because it’s a really, really great piece of history. It’s also a great way for people to have worry-free TV that they can watch with their kids.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFamously, “Heated Rivalry” star Connor Storrie is great at accents. His Russian is especially popular, which the actor pulled off to play a convincingly Slavic Ilya Rozanov in the hit series. \n\n\tNow, ahead of Storrie’s gig as “Saturday Night Live” host on Feb. 28, the actor put his language chops to the test in a hilarious accent duel against cast member James Austin Johnson. \n\n\n\t“And by the way, the Russian accent was awesome,” Marcello Hernández says to Storrie, who responds, “Thanks, I actually do all kinds of accents!” The mere mention of the subject summons Johnson, who rolls up ready to defend his honor as the accent authority at “SNL.” \n\t\n\n\tThe two face off, putting on their best German (Storrie sips a beer while quipping about the ease at which he can slip into the pronunciation), Cajun, French, Italian and even Shakespearean accents. (After hearing Storrie’s Shakespeare, his next role might just need to be a reimagining of one of the Bard’s works.) \n\n\n\tHernández also asks them both to do their best Jamaican accent, which Storrie and Johnson politely decline: “I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Storrie stammers. \n\n\tAnd while the two continue to go back and forth, it’s Storrie’s hailed Russian accent that wins the duel for him. “When you get to hell, tell them Rozanov sent you,” he says in reference to his beloved “Heated Rivalry” character, before using his finger pistol to shoot down Johnson. \n\n\tFeb. 28 will mark Storrie’s “Saturday Night Live” hosting debut. While the rest of the skits are still tightly under wraps, if they’re anything like this, fans are sure to be delighted. \n\t\n\n\tThe show’s musical guest will be Mumford & Sons, who are promoting their upcoming album, “Prizefighter,” set to be released on Feb. 20.\n\n\tWatch the full promo here: \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert Cosby Jr., the son of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star Mary Cosby, has died at just 23 years old. Salt Lake City police confirmed the death to Variety, saying they originally responded to an overdose call on Monday, but then it became a death investigation\n\n\tCosby Jr. has been a presence on the Bravo series, discussing his addiction to drugs with his mother in several episodes. During the show’s fifth season, Mary and Robert Jr. had a long, honest conversation about his drug usage that resonated with viewers. (The scene is included below.) Mary asked him when he began taking drugs, and he told her he’d started using at 16, taking Xanax, Molly, acid and cocaine in addition to weed. He told her that it had gotten out of control, as she listened sympathetically and told him she’d help him. “I wanted to die at the time,” he told her. “Do you know how that would kill me?” Mary asked through tears. “I just felt like a stain,” he answered.\n\t\n\n\tThe scene — so raw and real — had a huge impact on Bravo viewers. In an interview with Vulture at the end of Season 5, Cosby said: “When I watched it, I bawled my eyeballs out. I was shocked that that’s what we delivered.” Cosby said that she’d gotten a tremendous amount of support from fans, including Rihanna, who reached out to her twice after the episode aired, including to say, “Merry Christmas, and I love you and Robert Jr.” \n\n\n\tRobert Jr. entered treatment soon after that Season 5 scene, but his sobriety didn’t last. During the show’s recently concluded sixth season, Robert Jr. admitted that he was still using, though he was trying not to. During the filming of the Season 6 reunion, Mary Cosby said that Robert Jr. was in jail for violating a restraining order against his estranged wife. (Cosby had also expressed her disappointment with Robert Jr. getting secretly married during the run of the show.)\n\t\n\n\tCosby debuted as an original cast member on “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” in 2020. She did not shoot for the film’s third season, but returned for the fourth as a “friend of” the cast, before returning to the main cast for its fifth season. Cosby has become one of the popular show’s breakout cast members, having really clocked in during the show’s fifth season. She received a standing ovation at BravoCon — the fan convention that celebrates shows on the network — during a taping of Andy Cohen’s “Watch What Happens Live.” Cosby, the pastor of Faith Temple Pentecostal Church, had initially drawn criticism from her fellow castmates, who claimed that her church is a cult. Such allegations are why Cosby didn’t show up at the show’s Season 2 reunion. Recently, though, her charisma, cutting humor and being a loving mother have somehow eclipsed those accusations, and not even an entire TLC docuseries about her and her church could dent put a dent in her popularity.\n\n\tTMZ first reported the news.\n\n\tWatch the clip of Cosby Jr. and Mary on the show below.\n\n\n\tPat Saperstein contributed to this story.\n",

    "body": "\n\tUma Thurman is back in killer form. Prime Video released the first trailer for “Pretty Lethal,” a survival action-thriller in which a group of elite ballerinas must fight their way out of a remote inn run by Thurman’s unhinged former dance prodigy.\n\n\tThe film follows five dancers — played by Maddie Ziegler (“My Old Ass”), Lana Condor (“To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before “), Iris Apatow (“This Is 40”), Avantika (“Mean Girls”) and Millicent Simmonds (“A Quiet Place”) — traveling to a prestigious competition when their bus breaks down in a remote forest. Stranded and out of options, they seek shelter at a roadside inn run by Devora Kasimer.\n\t\n\n\tThe trailer wastes little time getting to the carnage. Kasimer’s welcome is unsettling from the start — gracious on the surface but clearly off. The inn grows more sinister by the minute, and it becomes apparent the dancers have walked into something they may not walk out of. As the threat turns violent, the group — still barely on speaking terms — are forced to set aside their rivalries and fight back together. The ballerinas draw on their physical training to fight back, using footwork, flexibility and, in one memorable moment, a pointe shoe — to survive.\n\n\n\tDirector Vicky Jewson, who previously helmed “The Witcher: Blood Origin,” describes the film as a genre mash-up that moves between horror, comedy and action. The film is written by Kate Freund and produced by Kelly McCormick, whose credits include “Bullet Train” and “Violent Night.”\n\n\t“Pretty Lethal” premieres at SXSW on March 13 before streaming globally on Prime Video March 25.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJake Johnson is set to star in Dan Goor and Luke Del Tredici’s private investigator comedy pilot at NBC, Variety has learned. \n\n\tIn addition, Akiva Schaffer (“The Naked Gun,” “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping”) has boarded the pilot as director and executive producer. \n\n\tFew plot details are available for the untitled single-camera show, with the logline simply stating the pilot “Continues the proud tradition of Los Angeles private eyes that began with Philip Marlowe and will end with this show.” It was picked up to pilot at NBC in January. \n\t\n\n\tJohnson’s character is named Mickey. He is described as “Smart, cynical and heartbroken, but trying to pretend he’s not, Mickey is a private investigator with a knack for solving cases. Formerly an LAPD cop until his life imploded three years ago.” \n\n\n\tWhether or not Johnson’s private eye character will be hard-boiled, soft-boiled, or even poached remains to be seen. \n\n\tJohnson is best known for playing the curmudgeonly Nick Miller in the popular Fox sitcom “New Girl.” The show aired for seven seasons between 2011 and 2018. He has since starred in shows like the animated comedy “Hoops” at Netflix and the 1970s porn magazine comedy “Minx” at HBO Max/Starz. Next up, he has the series “Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed” at Apple TV. In film, Johnson is known for his work in the hit “Spider-Verse” animated film franchise as well as for features like “Let’s Be Cops,” “Jurassic World,” “Ride the Eagle,” and “Self Reliance.” He also wrote and produced the latter two films, with Johnson making his feature directorial debut with “Self Reliance.” \n\t\n\n\tJohnson is repped by UTA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.  \n\n\tGoor and Del Tredici are co-writing and executive producing the pilot. Schaffer will executive produce, with Johnson producing in addition to starring. Universal Television is the studio. \n\n\tThis is not the only pilot about a private investigator presently in the works at NBC. The Peacock network is also prepping a reboot of “The Rockford Files,” with David Boreanaz attached to play Jim Rockford.  \n",

Katherine died by suicide Monday inside her Hollywood Hills home. Law enforcement sources told us she died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Broadcastify.com\n          \n    \n          Katherine was a social worker and worked for a mental health nonprofit ... and her close friend told us her work weighed her down. We're told Katherine was laser-focused on hearing other people's problems that were being thrown at her, and she was always trying to help them with their mental struggles, which she could relate to.\n      \n\n          Katherine's friend tells us she did not readily discuss her own specific mental health problems ... other than to make it clear she had them.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          We told you Katherine had a service dog, Joni, to assist with \"mental illness\" ... and the friend says she had another dog before ... a rescue named Charlie who was \"loving and comforting to her and made her feel safe.\"\n      \n    \n          Katherine wasn't a solitary person. We're told she had friends ... and the last time she spoke with this close friend, nothing in their conversation indicated anything impending.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          One last thing ... the friend knew Katherine as Katherine Hartley -- her middle name, not her famous last name -- and says she didn't go about broadcasting she was the daughter of a Hollywood star.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel on Monday went after Donald Trump for his scathing review of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show.\n\n\t“Bad Bunny got a bad review from our bad president, unfortunately,” Kimmel said during Monday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” “He wrote, ‘The Super Bowl halftime show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst ever. It makes no sense. It’s an affront to the greatness of America and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A and around the world.’ This is a man who paid off a porn star who spanked him with his own face on a magazine.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel then went after Turning Point USA’s rival programming, the “All American Halftime Show.” The late-night host joked that TPUSA should’ve “put on the Kristi Noem shoots her puppy bowl because this was not a good program.”\n\n\n\t“[Conservatives] complain about how bad everything is, and then they do it worse,” Kimmel added. “And not only do they do it worse, they do it in jorts. Of course, the gang at Fox News thought it was great, and Turning Point, they seemed happy with it too.”\n\n\tThe show then cut to a TPUSA rep telling Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade that the organization plans to do “another halftime show for the country next year.”\n\n\t“Next year it will be Lara Trump with a Ted Nguyen cover band,” Kimmel quipped. “They’ve got to do it for the country.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKid Rock, who headlined the rival “All-American Halftime Show,” gave his review of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime performance during a Monday appearance on Fox News’ “The Ingrahm Angle.”\n\n\t“Like most people, I didn’t understand any of it,” Rock said of the show (via The Wrap), which Bad Bunny performed entirely in Spanish. “I saw there’s a lot of dancers and a lot of big to-do stuff. And, you know, he said he wanted to have a dance party; it looked like he had one.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “Not my cup of tea, but I don’t fault that kid for doing the Super Bowl, getting in front of a global audience. I fault the NFL for putting him in that position and Turning Point for having to come out and have an alternative for people to watch. You know, it’s just — poor kid.”\n\n\n\tRock wasn’t the only conservative voice with criticism for Bad Bunny, who is largely shunned by the Right for his outspoken objections to ICE and Puerto Rican roots. President Donald Trump posted a scathing review on Truth Social shortly after Bad Bunny ended his set.\n\n\t“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” Trump wrote. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World. This ‘Show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the Best Stock Market and 401(k)s in History!”\n\t\n\n\tBad Bunny hasn’t been without supporters, however. Pop sensation Lady Gaga, who performed alongside Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl Halftime Show, wrote on Instagram that it was her “absolute honor” to sing with the album of the year winner.\n\n\t“Thank you Benito for inviting me and thank you to the entire cast for welcoming me onto your stage,” she wrote. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”\n\n\tBravo host Andy Cohen was also vocal in his support of Bad Bunny. He went on Instagram Threads to troll anyone taking shots at the Puerto Rican superstar. One Threads user wrote that the “All American Halftime Show” had them “fighting back tears,” to which Cohen replied, “Me too. The idea that I can wear jorts while looking like a prune gives me hope about getting older! Kinda getting misty just typing it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichael Douglas revealed at the recent TCM Classic Film Festival in New York City that director Oliver Stone originally disliked his acting in 1987’s “Wall Street” so much that he asked Douglas if he was taking drugs during production. \n\n\t“Okay, so we were finishing the second week of filming, and there was a knock on my door. ‘Hey Mike, it’s s Oliver. Can I come in?'” Douglas remembered (via EW). “I say, ‘Yeah, come on in.’ He comes in the trailer and sits down. He says to me, ‘You okay?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’m okay.’ [He says], ‘Are you doing drugs?’ I said, ‘No, I’m not doing drugs.’ And he said, ‘Because you look like you’ve never acted before in your life.'”\n\t\n\n\tDouglas informed Stone that he wasn’t watching the film’s dailies to check on his performance “because I’m one of those guys that always sees what’s wrong or what’s not going to be in the film… so I don’t pay attention to the dailies. So I said, ‘I guess I’d better take a look,’ and he said, ‘Yeah, you better.'”\n\n\n\t“And then I’m looking at them really hard, and critically, and they seemed pretty good,” Douglas continued about when filming resumed. “So I keep saying, ‘I think it’s pretty good.'”\n\n\tStone eventually came around and agreed with his star, who played the iconic role of Gordon Gekko opposite Charlie Sheen and Daryl Hannah in “Wall Street.” The film centers on the relationship between Sheen’s young stockbroker and Douglas’ wealthy corporate raider. \n\n\t“He was willing for me to hate his guts for the rest of this movie to get that extra little push,” Douglas said of Stone’s original insults, which he did not take personally. “His record of successes with actors is quite impressive. So I’m deeply, deeply appreciative of the fact that it gave me part and the fact that he pushed me to another level.”\n\t\n\n\tDouglas ended up winning the Oscar for best actor thanks to his performance in “Wall Street.” He was also awarded a Golden Globe and the National Board of Review’s best actor prize. He returned as Gordon Gekko in Stone’s 2010 sequel “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.”\n\n\tIn Matt Zoller Seitz’s “The Oliver Stone Experience,” Stone had this to say about Douglas: “I think he was more comfortable [playing a villain], but I think Michael struggles for comfort levels. I mean, he’s not comfortable, per se; he’s always looking. If you notice, he moves his shoulders a lot. When he’s misused, which he sometimes is in films, that cockiness of Gekko can be irritating, smarmy, in the wrong roles. But I like Michael when he’s doing it in good movies, with good material. I liked him in ‘Wall Street’ very much.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart covered the conservative outrage over Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show.\n\n\t“Mr. Bunny killed it, despite being trapped in an inescapable sugarcane hedge maze,” Stewart joked. “He had Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin and The Mandalorian. He threw a wedding! He held a model U.N.! He even had the time to make a con-ed service stop midconcert. He did it all. ‘Just reboot the box and enjoy! De nada.’ It was joyful and infectious and…”\n\t\n\n\tThe show then cut to a clip of conservative commentator Benny Johnson calling the performance “the single worst halftime show in NFL history.”\n\n\n\t“Oh, right. I forgot,” said a dejected Stewart. “For a significant portion of Americans, everything that happens must uniformly be filtered through a particular MAGA-centric worldview and judged on how well it conforms to that traditional vision, which doesn’t include knowing where the biblioteca is.”\n\n\tLater in the show, Stewart played clips of Newsmax anchors claiming that “doing a halftime show in all Spanish is not unifying” and that the performance “divided” America amid great political turmoil.\n\n\t“Why the fuck is it the Super Bowl Halftime entertainer’s job to unify the country?” Stewart said. “Isn’t there another person whose job description is more along those lines? Let me ask you a question… What did that person do to unify the country?”\n\n\tStewart then cut to a clip of NBC News covering President Donald Trump‘s Truth Social review of Bad Bunny’s halftime show. Trump wrote that it was “absolutely terrible, one of the worst ever,” adding that “nobody understands a word this guy is saying.”\n\t\n\n\t“Nobody? I love that he thinks Bad Bunny is the one guy in the world that’s fluent in Spanish,” Stewart joked. “’Nobody understands it. It’s a dead language.’ You know the right has a lot of balls complaining that Bad Bunny didn’t do enough to unify this country when you only found out a few days ago that Puerto Rico’s a part of it!”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBill Maher said during a recent “Club Random” podcast interview (via Mediaite) with Adam Carolla that Jimmy Kimmel is “very mad at me.” Carolla and Kimmel used to work together as co-hosts of “The Man Show” on Comedy Central from 1999 to 2004.\n\n\t“Jimmy Kimmel, you know, he’s very mad at me and I know you’re close to him,” Maher told Carolla. “I hope you tell him that I’m sorry that it got bent out of shape. I don’t think I did anything wrong. We can have disagreements. I mean, you and I don’t agree on everything, look at this clash now, and yet we’re cool.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Republicans are always this sort of difference between the right and the left. It bugs me so much,” Maher continued, noting how Democrats struggle with criticism far more than Republicans. “My tribe is supposed to be the left, but these are the people who just can’t talk to you unless you’re exactly there, whereas the Republicans, they always fucking come to my show. John Kennedy from Louisiana was on last week, took his beating like a man, like they all do, and we came across lovingly and smilingly and happily and we can disagree.”\n\n\tMaher said that Kimmel is “one of the nicest guys,” but he is not going to go the traditional late-night route when it comes to political humor. Maher will always take aim at both political parties, “and if that’s not good enough for you, then I think you’re the asshole,” the “Real Time” host added.\n\n\t“I don’t just buy into the left-wing bullshit, and I never stop making fun of the right-wing bullshit at all!” Maher said. “And like, if that’s not good enough for you, then I think you’re the asshole, and I don’t think Jimmy is an asshole… I think he’s a great guy, and it bugs me that, you know, because of what the latest thing was, that, you know, we may never talk again.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile Maher did not say directly why Kimmel is mad at him, it appears tied to a “Real Time” episode last November, where Maher called out Kimmel’s wife, Molly McNearney, for revealing she had cut ties with Trump-loving family members.\n\n\tMcNearney joined Kimmel for an interview on the “We Can Do Hard Things” podcast at the time and opened up on her “challenging” relationships with Trump-supporting family members amid the president’s ongoing feud with Kimmel. She said she has “sympathy” for her relatives who are “deliberately being misinformed every day,” but “it hurts me so much because of the personal relationship I now have where my husband is out there fighting this man.”\n\n\t“To me, them voting for Trump is them not voting for my husband and me and our family,” she added, saying “unfortunately” she has “lost relationships with people in my family because of it.”\n\n\tMaher responded to McNearney’s reveal on “Real Time” by saying: “She says she’s lost relationships with relatives because she wrote them an email before the election with ten reasons why they shouldn’t vote for Trump, and some still didn’t obey, so you know. Ultimatums. Ten reasons? I can think of 100. But I would never present it to someone as an ultimatum. Ultimatums don’t make people rethink their politics. They make them rethink you.”\n\n\tThe host then said on a December episode of the “Club Random” podcast that Kimmel was mad at him for the criticism, adding: “I was as kid-gloved as I could. And I see they’re mad at me. Uh, I’m sorry. I mean, I was being, again, as respectful as I could, but I don’t agree with that point of view. And since she went public with it, it wasn’t out of school for me to go public with it. I love Jimmy. I’ve always have. I don’t know him that well, but he’s a great guy… I hope we’re friends forever, but I don’t know. You know, the liberals and the woke, that’s a schism. It just is.”\n\n\tWatch the latest episode of Maher’s “Club Random” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMultiple artists are seeking to leave the Wasserman Agency after details regarding founder-CEO Casey Wasserman’s connection to late financier and convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell emerged in documents last week, sources tell Variety. \n\n\tThe artists’ agents are said to have presented Wasserman with an ultimatum that he step down and divest or sell the company, which he thus far has declined. However, Wasserman is said to be meeting with top executives at the company later this week to determine a course of action. He is chairman of the organizing committee for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where he is also facing pressure to step down.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a house on fire,” one source says. \n\n\n\tSeveral artists, beginning with Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino and including Chappell Roan and top indie acts Wednesday, Water From Your Eyes and Beach Bunny, have posted social-media messages expressing unhappiness with Wasserman and are seeking or beginning the process to leave.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe agency is one of the largest in the music business, with a roster also featuring Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, Lorde, Phish, Raye, SZA, Joni Mitchell, Janelle Monae, Geese and frontman Cameron Winter, Tyler, the Creator, Wednesday and hundreds of others. Wasserman’s artist roster was taken down from its website at some point over the last couple of days, presumably in response to artists’ requests for their names to be removed.\n\n\tHowever, the situation is more complicated for agents, who typically are bound by contracts spanning three to five years, whereas the artists are not. Complicating the situation further, artists often tend to be more loyal to their agents than agencies, and many follow their agents from one company to another over years. Similarly, agents often travel together from one company to another, sometimes over decades.\n\t\n\n\tThe situation was said to reach a “fever pitch” over the weekend, one source says, and has only accelerated from there. The executives, who include such veteran agents as Marty Diamond, Duffy McSwiggin and others, are said to be rallying together in an effort to maintain a unified company in some form. Sources say that several offers have been made for the company, along with the possibility for the executives to buy the division themselves, although it is unclear how serious or realistic any of the proposals are.\n\n\tRepresentatives for Wasserman and many of the above artists either declined or did not respond to Variety’s requests for comment. News of the impending ultimatum was first reported by the Wrap late Sunday, although rumors had been circulating since the latest batch of Epstein documents was released.\n\n\tIn a social media post Monday, the band Wednesday wrote, “Last week we were among the hundreds of artists who were aghast to find out about Casey Wasserman’s communications with Ghislaine Maxwell,” it reads in part. “It’s also important that we acknowledge the team of people we work with at the Wasserman agency as decent and trustworthy people with whom we’ve worked several years dating back to a time prior to their connection with Wasserman.”\n\n\tThe agency was formed in 2021 after a number of agents and artists parted ways with Paradigm, and Wasserman merged that company with his existing sports division. That sports division is not said to be at a similar crisis point.\n\n\tOn balance, Wasserman is not currently connected to any of Epstein’s crimes or misconduct and is documented as riding on Epstein’s private jet once (on a 2002 humanitarian trip with a Clinton Foundation delegation), and exchanging raunchy emails with Maxwell while he was married, years before the crimes became public. He has apologized for the connection, saying he was “terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” He is also the head of several charities.\n\n\tHowever, it is the second such scandal in 18 months for Wasserman. In July of 2024 — ironically, during the Paris Olympics — a damning report emerged in which Wasserman, grandson of the vaunted Hollywood dealmaker Lew Wasserman, was accused of having “serial” affairs with junior employees over many years. These reported indiscretions — on which Wasserman did not comment — caused a stir at the time but seemed to fade as weeks went by. Billie Eilish’s departure from the agency was perceived to be connected to the report, although multiple sources tell Variety she was already leaving when it emerged.\n\t\n\n\tComing so soon after the previous allegations, optics — particularly for a company named after its founder — can matter more than facts.\n\n\t“As an artist represented by Wasserman, I did not consent to having my name or my career tied to someone with this kind of association to exploitation,” Cosentino wrote. “Staying quiet isn’t something I can do in good conscience — especially in a moment when men in power are so often protected, excused, or allowed to move on without consequence. Pretending this isn’t a big deal is not an option for me.”\n\n\tVariety will have more on the situation as it develops.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners,” “Zootopia 2” and “KPop Demon Hunters” took top honors at the Advanced Imaging Society Awards.\n\n\tThe Lumiere Awards recognized outstanding creative and technical achievements during its 16th annual celebration. The awards honor the artists, engineers and innovators whose work continues to push the boundaries of storytelling and cinematic technology.\n\n\t“These Lumiere winners produced their brilliant stories by pushing the boundaries of what’s possible creatively and technically,” said Jim Chabin, president of the Advanced Imaging Society. “In these honorees we see our industry’s future – and that future is truly more exciting than ever.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Society awarded the best live action feature film Lumiere Award to “Sinners,” with best supporting actor nominee Delroy Lindo on hand to present the award to producer Sev Ohanian. The film’s sound team — Chris Welcker, Steve Boeddeker and Benny Burtt — were present to accept the Lumiere for best audio. Voters praised “Sinners,” calling it a “brilliant and meaningful story,” and noted that as a film, it was “perfectly executed.”\n\n\n\t “Zootopia 2” won best animated feature. Actor and voice artist Patrick Warburton presented the award to director Byron Howard. Voters noted not only its stunning visuals, but its “unprecedented technical integration across every production dimension.”\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” took home two Lumiere awards, winning for best original song for “Golden” and best musical scene or sequence for “Golden.”\n\n\tPicturehouse’s “The King of Color,” written and directed by Patrick Creadon, won best documentary. The film follows Larry Herbert, inventor of the Pantone Matching System, which established a universal worldwide standard for color. Creadon was there to accept the award and read a note of appreciation from 97-year-old Herbert. AIS commented, “We’re an organization spanning filmmaking, post-production, and technology, united by a commitment to educating audiences. ‘The King of Color’ tells our origin story.”\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” won best motion picture – musical. AIS honoree and director Jon M. Chu accepted the award. Voters commented on “the way it perfectly integrated difficult, high-production value VFX and imagery work into the musical storytelling throughout the film. The work in all departments was extraordinary in this film.”\n\n\tThe Lumiere for best theatrical scene or sequence was awarded to “Avatar: Fire and Ash” for the third act Flux Devil fire tornado battle sequence. Oscar-nominated visual effects supervisor Eric Saindon of Wētā FX accepted the award on behalf of the VFX team that included Joe Letteri and Lightstorm’s Richard Baneham, who also attended. Voters unequivocally agreed that the unforgettable third-act sequence once again set a new benchmark for visual effects–driven storytelling.\n\n\tAmong the episodic winners was “Andor” Season 2, which received the Lumiere for best episodic – live action, accepted by executive producer John Gilroy, Meanwhile, the award for best episodic – animation went to “Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,” accepted by showrunner Jeff Trammell.\n\n\tOther technical awards went to Apple TV’s “Severance” for best audio – episodic, accepted by scoring mixer Chris Fogel. “Stranger Things” Season 5 won the Lumiere for best use of high dynamic range – episodic and was accepted by colorist Jared Arkulary from Company 3, and “F1” won best use of high dynamic range – feature film, accepted by Company 3 colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld.\n\n\tGoogle was presented with the Society’s annual Sir Charles Wheatstone Award for its innovations that include its VEO and Imagen models, Google Cloud and YouTube production tools. The award was accepted by Anil Jain, global managing director of strategic industries.\n\n\tThe awards also recognized five organizations for their “impact and innovation” in driving the media and entertainment ecosystem forward this year. Production Technology Lumiere Awards were presented to the following: AMD for their EPYC CPU’s and Threadripper PRO workstation tools; Conductor, by CoreWeave, was recognized for their desktop tools for cloud optimization; Flawless became the first AI company to be recognized for pioneering Assistive AI that preserves and supports human creativity; 6P Color was recognized for their “Full Color Range” format for electronic color imagery; DisneyResearch|Studios was honored with a Lumiere for its Artistically Controllable ML Stereo Conversion toolset.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition, VUE and CEO Tim Richards were honored with the Society’s Governor’s Award for Cinema Excellence for their new generation of premium EPIC screen cinemas, featuring state of the art laser projection and sound.\n\n\tAs previously announced, Ethan Hawke was honored with the 2026 Distinguished Artist Award for his performance in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” Former president of Lucasfilm Kathleen Kennedy presented Hawke with the award and said, “Whether he’s playing a young idealist, a tortured poet, or — most recently — Lorenz Hart in ‘Blue Moon,’ Ethan brings the same deep commitment to showing us the essence of what makes us human. His work invites us to feel more, understand more and care more. That honesty, that humanity, is at the heart of everything he does. Ethan doesn’t just step into the spotlight — he is the light.”\n\n\tChu was awarded the inaugural Judy Garland Legacy Award, which was introduced by Garland’s daughter Lorna Luft and presented by actor Josh Gad.\n\n\tThe Harold Lloyd Award was presented to Joseph Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer by Suzanne Lloyd, chairman of Harold Lloyd Entertainment. \n\n\tSee the complete list of winners below:\n\n\tBest Feature Film – Live Action: “Sinners”\n\n\tBest Feature Film – Animation: “Zootopia 2”\n\n\tBest Documentary: “The King of Color”\n\n\tBest Motion Picture – Musical: “Wicked: For Good”\n\n\tBest Audio – Theatrical: “Sinners”\n\n\tBest Audio – Episodic: “Severance”\n\n\tBest Original Song: “Golden,” from “KPop Demon Hunters”\n\n\tBest Use of High Dynamic Range – Feature Film: “F1”\n\n\tBest Use of High Dynamic Range – Episodic: “Stranger Things” Season 5\n\n\tBest Musical Scene or Sequence: “KPop Demon Hunters” – “Golden”\n\n\tBest Theatrical Scene or Sequence: “Avatar: Fire and Ash” – “Flux Devil”\n\n\tBest Episodic – Animation: “Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man”\n\n\tBest Episodic – Live Action: “Andor” Season 2\n\n\tBest International 3D Documentary: NHK for The Mark of Beauty Tokyo Imperial Palace\n\n\tBest Use of VR: Dolphins of the Reef, Immotion\n\n\tProduction Technology Awards:AMD, DisneyResearch|Studios Flawless, 6P Color, CoreWeave\n\n\tGovernor’s Award for Cinema Excellence: VUE\n\n\tSir Charles Wheatstone Award: Google\n\n\tJudy Garland Legacy Award: Jon M.

    "body": "\n\tThe producers behind Bad Bunny’s triumphant Super Bowl LX Halftime Show had a problem: The NFL wouldn’t allow more than 25 carts to bring equipment on to the all-grass Levi’s Stadium field in Santa Clara, Calif. To pull off Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio’s and his creative team’s tremendous production plans, that meant something would have to give.\n\n\tLuckily,  a solution to one of the show’s most stunning visuals — the pastizales (grass fields and other plants) that harken back to Bad Bunny’s native Puerto Rican landscape — was to make it real people. Production designers Bruce and Shelly Rodgers, as well as Julio Himede recruited around 380 people to dress up as the grass, allowing for easier on-and-off staging.\n\t\n\n\t“That solution of making the plant people, and then the plant people getting on and off in time, plus all the sets and all the performers — it was audacious in every direction,” said creative director Harriet Cuddeford. “There were over 330 actual cast performers in addition to the plant people. It was just huge.”\n\n\tBad Bunny and the event’s producers and directors pulled off what may have been the most intricate halftime extravaganza in Super Bowl history. With superstar guests like Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, a real-life wedding and authentic business owners (including Los Angeles’ own Villa’s Tacos), the “Benito Bowl” was planned with many moving parts that could have gone wrong.\n\n\t“There’s just so many variables in live TV,” Cuddeford said. “Even the weather. It was on a real grass field, and there’s no roof. We had to have backup rain plans. There were so many things that could have caused an issue. But it just kind of almost flawlessly unfolded before our eyes. We were all just like, ‘Wow, it worked!’”\n\t\n\n\tDirector Hamish Hamilton — who has produced countless Super Bowl Halftime Shows, Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and more — said, “It was the biggest team effort of a show I have ever been involved in.”\n\n\tHere are some details Cuddeford and Hamilton shared about this year’s Bad Bunny halftime show.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBad Bunny managed to pull off several stunts while singing at the same time. At one point, much to the producers’ chagrin, the singer climbed a tall utility poll without any safety rigging.\t\n\n\t“He refused to wear a harness,” Hamilton said. “He was like, ‘I don’t need it.’ There are all kinds of legal ramifications to that, which is not really my thing, but interestingly enough, when he decided he wasn’t going to wear a harness, we were able to then put a camera on the pole to look down at him climbing up!”\n\n\tAdded Cuddeford: “There was all safety and rigging and all of that available, obviously, of course, but he didn’t want it. He does his own stunts, that guy, and he learned it in about three minutes. Straight up that pole. At rehearsal, we were all like, ‘Is he gonna be OK?’ But he just went straight up there, and managed his vocals. Very agile. He could just, like, handle anything.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of stunts, Bad Bunny falling through the roof of the pink casita was one thing — but it also had to be perfectly timed to the pre-tape of him doing the same thing as seen by the family watching TV inside.\t\n\n\t“The stunt itself, to fall through the roof, wasn’t so crazy — there’s a trap door,” Cuddeford said. “They just literally open it, and pull it out underneath him. But it required so much meticulous planning, because we cut straight into the pre-tape. Inside the pre-tape was the shot on the TV of him falling through the roof of the Super Bowl — so the family in the la casita were watching the Super Bowl live, and then he fell onto their table. That’s basically two different pre-tapes: The pre-tape inside the house, and then there’s the pre-tape on the field of him falling through the roof during the dress rehearsal. And then comping that all together, then cutting to the transition of him falling through the roof and be able to kick the front door open.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe couple who got married during the halftime show is from Ontario, Calif., and had sent Bad Bunny a wedding invitation on a lark.\t\n\n\tAccording to Hamilton, the engaged couple wound up with 15 extra wedding announcements — so they sent most to local businesses with the hope of maybe getting some free wedding perks. But the last invite? “They were like, ‘Why don’t we send one to Bad Bunny? Lots of people send wedding invitations to him, so why not,’” Hamilton said. “Bad Bunny’s office reached out, and they thought, ‘Amazing, maybe we’ll get a signed photo. But they were invited to a Zoom call, which they thought was kind of weird.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the Zoom call, they learned the plan: Bad Bunny was inviting them to get married at the Super Bowl. “An overprinting of wedding invitations led to a series of events where they wound up getting married during Bad Bunny’s performance at the Super Bowl!” Hamilton said.\n\n\tThe couple had planned to make Bad Bunny’s “Baile Inolvidable” be their first dance. “And so, they went from planning to play it at their wedding to being on the Super Bowl with him live, singing it,” Cuddeford said. “And with the bonus prize of Lady Gaga being the wedding singer as well.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDespite rumors on social media, Bad Bunny didn’t hand his recently won Grammy to Liam, the young boy from Minnesota who had been imprisoned by ICE. But that moment is meant to convey a personal connection to the performer’s childhood.\t\n\n\t“The kid is somebody that we cast,” Cuddeford said. “But the story behind that was Benito’s idea. He’d grown up watching his idols on TV getting awards. In his life now, he stands on stage and gets given awards by his idols. He knew the Grammys were coming up, and he was hoping to win something. And then obviously he won Best Album last weekend. And so, he really wanted to inspire the next generation.”\n\n\tThat’s why the boy at the Super Bowl was wearing an outfit similar to one a young Benito is seen wearing in a well-known photo of the superstar as a young child. “This is really representing a younger version of himself,  with the hope of him inspiring  the kids of today,” she said.\n\t\n\t\tDid Bad Bunny get his Grammy back?\t\n\n\t“I actually don’t know if he took it back,” Cuddeford said. “Knowing him, he might have just left it with the kid, honestly.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRicky Martin \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBad Bunny personally selected Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin as his guests; Martin, of course, is a Puerto Rican childhood idol. And the song Martin sang, “Lo Que Le Paso a Hawaii,” not only resonates in Puerto Rico, but in Hawai’i too.\t\n\n\t“That’s a very meaningful song, almost kind of a plea to not turn Puerto Rico into Hawai’i,” Cuddeford said. “To make sure that it kind of retains its culture and its identity. It was just very powerful to have a Puerto Rican icon whom he deeply loves and respects to join him and to perform that song. It was something that during his residency, he had many guest artists would come and sing that. He’d never managed to align to have Ricky do it, so he was so excited to have Ricky do it at the Super Bowl.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThose guest small business owners, vendors and workers are all real-life people, flown into the Super Bowl for the show.\t\n\n\tThat includes Los Angeles’ own Villa’s Tacos founder Victor Villa, as well as a real piragua (Puerto Rican shave ice dessert) vendor, boxers Xander Zayas and Emiliano Vargas, a real nail technician, barber and more. Even the priest that married the Ontario couple is an actual, ordained minister.\n\n\t“The performance is celebrating normal people, and what it is to be human and love and have joy, and really appreciate one another,” Cuddeford said. “This was to show how much he values his community, to celebrate normal people on the world’s biggest stage, especially people who are of importance in in Latino culture. He’s a very authentic person, Benito, and it’s about just being authentic and very real and very human.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd yes, that was Maria Antonia Cay, better known as Toñita, taking a shot with Bad Bunny inside a re-creation of her famed Brooklyn landmark the Caribbean Social Club.\t\n\n\t“We faithfully recreated this  iconic, very important for the culture, Puerto Rican bar in Brooklyn,” Cuddeford said. “And then we flew Toñita out to be part of the performance. And you saw him do the shot with her at the point in the song when he sings about doing a shot with Toñita.”\n\t\n\t\tThere were few hairy moments, including one that involved a camera crane spinning out of control.\t\n\n\tThat crane, which was used in the beginning sequence around the casita, lost digital connection — “So, literally, it started spinning like a hose out of control,” Hamilton said. “But probably a second before we needed the shot, the camera locked again in perfect position, and we were allowed to take it!”\n\n\tAnd at another point, there’s a bit of a wobble from one of the low angle cameras that’s looking up at the casita. “Basically, everybody’s racing for a shot, and the handheld cameraman taking the shot gets hit by the Chapman dolly trying to make a shot after — and they collide, and that’s why there was a wobble. It’s split-second timing.”\n\n\tHamilton admitted it’s “terrifying” watching the camera operators running around each other as they get their shots. “In the performance of ‘NuevaYol,’ there are moments when the cameras literally get to their point of shooting half a second before they’re on,” he said. “The crane comes out, the cameras run half the way along a football pitch and literally, then run into Benito!”\n\t\n\n\tAdded Cuddeford: “The camera work was insane and so intricate and so carefully planned and such a feat, and could have just gone so wrong at any moment.”\n\t\n\t\tThe use of all those grass people made for a very different kind of staging — and the producers debated for some time on how to make the show visually unique for home viewers while still making it watchable for the fans in the stands at Levi’s Stadium.\t\n\n\t“Probably more than any other show, this was choreographed to the camera,” Hamilton said. “With the grass people, it was quite enclosed. And so there were many debates about  the camera versus the people in the audience in the stadium. For the stadium, they definitely had a restricted view during certain parts of the show. But I think that we ended up with a really good balance.”\n\t\n\t\tThe show’s cinematic look is by design, as the producers switched to cinema cameras for Super Bowl halftime a few years ago.\t\n\n\t“For many years now, we have effectively used cinema cameras in a live television domain, which is really ambitious,” Hamilton said. “It’s very nerve-racking when you’re putting effectively Ferrari-esque technology to work in circumstances more attuned to using a Land Rover. These cameras are not really made to be used and run around a football field and put up in eight minutes. But they allow you to get an image that is significantly different to the imagery available on the game cameras. Until six or seven years ago, we would use the all-purpose sports cameras, which you can throw them off a cliff, and they’ll bounce back. Whereas these kind of digital cinema cameras, they have very specific lenses, and they work in a very specific way. It’s a complicated, challenging workflow, but a lot of people comment on how cinematic it looks. Other people just think it looks great.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSignage that reads “The Only Thing More Powerful than Hate is Love” is displayed on the scoreboard \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBoth Hamilton and Cuddeford felt the message of the halftime show was heard, and resonated with audiences.\t\n\n\t“There’s a real sense of community and commitment to really delivering something that we all knew was going to be full of heart,” Hamilton said. \n\n\tCuddeford said: “People understood the message he wanted to convey. That Latino people felt loved, seen and celebrated, and that people felt joyful. It’s just an incredible thing that he’s managed to do, and that we’ve all managed to support him and to help deliver that into the world at this time is, honestly, a complete honor.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the full performance here:\n\n\n\n",

She said, ‘You have to write something about this.’ And then I did and this is the result of that.”\n\t\n\n\tThe this is “Bookends,” a rom-com written by and starring Ash as an aspiring novelist who finds romance with his grandparents’ doctor (Charlie Barnett) when he moves in with them after he finds out his boyfriend (Spencer Belko) is having an affair with their spin instructor (Jared Reinfeldt).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoam Ash and Charlie Barnett in “Bookends”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAsh’s grandparents died before the movie, directed by Mike Doyle, got made. “They did know that I was writing this, this piece, and that it was really a love letter to them,” Ash says.\n\n\tCaroline Aaron and F. Murray Abraham play Nate’s grandparents. As the movie unfolds, the grandfather begins to show signs of dementia. “For my mom and my aunt, it’s their dad,” Ash says. “When they watched the movie, they were like, ‘Oh, my god, it’s dad.’ My mother asked if I showed Murray videos of grandpa. I was like, ‘No. It’s all in the writing, honey. My mom was like, ‘How does he know the mannerisms and the hand gestures and everything?’”\n\t\n\n\tNot only is Ash openly gay but so is Barnett. Authentic casting was important to Ash and Doyle. “That was something Mike and I discussed a lot,” Ash says. “We also wanted to show that Jews come in all different shades, shapes and sizes and Charlie’s mom was actually Jewish. He was like, ‘I wasn’t raised Jewish. I was like, ‘That’s OK. We’ll claim you.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tF. Murray Abraham and Caroline Aaron in “Bookends”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith an upswing in political attacks aimed at the queer community, Ash admits he initially worried that the movie would have trouble finding a distributor.\n\n\tBut then “Heated Rivalry” came along.\n\n\t“I think they proved that in the absolute biggest way that you can have the steamiest, gayest, most homoerotic show probably ever made for television, and it could also have huge mainstream success,” Ash says. “That has put my mind at ease.”\n\n\t“Bookends” premieres Feb. 9 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\n\n",

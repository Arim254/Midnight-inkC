    "body": "\n\tReinvent Yellow has come on board to handle international sales for “Rocky the Troll” and will launch the film at AFM. It is produced by the team behind “Troll” (2022), the most watched non-English-language film on Netflix.\n\n\tThe family adventure centers on 12-year-old Gaia, who discovers her great-grandfather’s collection of rocks are troll eggs. When one of the eggs hatches, Gaia forms a magical bond that soon draws her into an exciting yet dangerous adventure. Forces beyond her control threaten both her own world and the trolls’ hidden existence.\n\t\n\n\tThe director is Andrea Eckerbom, and the producers are Terje Strømstad, Kristian Strand Sinkerud and Espen Horn. It is produced by Motion Blur, with support from the regional film fund FimInvest, the Norwegian Film Institute, SF Studios and REinvent.\n\n\n\tReinvent Yellow’s deputy CEO, Rikke Ennis, said: “ ‘Rocky the Troll’ is a dream project for Reinvent Yellow. It’s as close as you can get to the iconic family films we cherish from the eighties (such as ‘E.T.’ and ‘Gremlins’). With Motionblur and the ‘Troll’ team behind the film, we have no doubt that it will be a smashing hit, combining great ambition with excellent execution. We are already seeing overwhelming international interest in the project.”\n\n\tHelene Aurø, chief sales officer at Reinvent Yellow, said, “We see ‘Rocky the Troll’ as one of the most commercially promising family adventures in years — it has all the ingredients for strong international sales and long-lasting audience appeal. Launching it at AFM is the perfect opportunity to share our excitement with global partners.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe defining vibes of Valladolid’s fifth edition of Merci market were set at its flagship roundtable, “¿Qué nos preocupa?” (“What’s Worrying Us?”), where Spain’s indie distributors and exhibitors mapped a survival playbook for arthouse films.\n\n\tRunning Oct. 29–31 at Valladolid’s Broadway Cinemas and co-organized by Seminci and distributors’ association Adicine, Merci drew roughly 200 programmers, exhibitors, distributors, platform buyers and TV commissioners and screened 27 late-2025-2026 titles. \n\t\n\n\tComscore Movies Spain had previously supplied a sobering backdrop: as of Sept. 30, 2025, Spanish theatrical admissions were tracking 3% down year-on-year, while the international market rose 4%.\n\n\n\tOctober: 70 New Cinema Releases\n\n\tOctober alone crammed 70 new releases into Spanish cinemas — a choke point that buries indie titles before reviews, campus outreach and social traction can add momentum. \n\n\tComscore also tallied a snapshot of 2025 performance for the 20 Adicine-member distributors, nearly 99% of Spain’s indie distribution sector: a €38 million ($43.8 million) gross box office from 5.9 million admissions off 202 new releases, for a 12% market share.\n\n\tModerated by Kinótico’s editor Matías G. Rebolledo, the session speakers were LaZona Pictures’ Óscar Alonso, Golem programmer Bárbara Fernández, Cines Lys’ programmer Silvino Puig, ICAA secretary general Rocío Juanes de Toledo, Adicine co-president Lara Pérez Camiña, PROMIO president Javier Pachón and FECE president Álvaro Postigo.\n\n\tStronger Education Pipelines  \n\t\n\n\tIndie distributor Alonso flagged the “sleep killer” — a glut of titles that makes misdating fatal — and pushed for stronger education pipelines to reach new audiences. Golem’s Fernández warned that fixed costs are colliding with scanter box office. Puig, recalling the pre-digital era’s five-to-seven weekly openers, said the programming job itself has become a stress test. \n\n\tPachón cited box office concentration and a waning appetite for exploration, compounded by insufficient incentives for theaters. Postigo described a “brutally unstable” environment, pointing to a disordered global release calendar and U.S. studio turbulence; his prescription: E.U.-level coordination on windows and market order.\n\n\tICAA: Bigger Institutional Support for Exhibition-Distribution\n\n\tFrom the institutional side, Juanes de Toledo said the ICAA’s new four-year strategic plan will tilt support from production toward distribution, exhibition and audience renewal — scaling Cine Sénior and Cine Escuela programs, routing schools outreach through non-profit intermediaries and laying groundwork for a long-awaited State Council to codify best practices.\n\n\tCollaboration emerged as a key opportunity at Merci. In a study presented Oct. 31, “Collaborative Models for Exhibitors,” consultant Jon Barrenechea in partnership with Europa Cinemas reported that cinema subscription schemes are delivering a net positive on admissions and exhibitor revenue, acting as always-on marketing that builds community, incentivising programming diversity and strengthening ties both among exhibitors and between exhibitors and distributors. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJon Barrenechea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Emiliano de Pablos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBarrenechea pointed to three concrete playbooks: Cineville, an associative model with cinema ownership that counts with 135,000 subscribers across the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Austria and works with 180 cinemas; Mubi Go’s ticket program, operative in the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Germany, partnering with 260 cinemas and logging 350,000 tickets redeemed since its 2018 launch; and Austria’s Nonstop, launched in 2023 and operating in 29 cinemas nationwide via a subscription card model with more than 10,000 subscribers.\n\n\tSome takeaways from Barrenechea’s speech: Make collaboration long-term and sustainable; expect subscriptions to grow as consumers default to them, and localize branding, pricing and structure per market.\n\t\n\n\tFor their part, Letterboxd’s Ella Kemp — speaking for a platform used by more than 23 million cinephiles globally — mapped how taste-communities can offer bookers a practical bridge from online chatter to local scheduling.\n\n\tAn Unmissable Fall Date for the Industry\n\n\t“In this fifth edition, Merci has consolidated itself as an unmissable fall date for the industry, proven by nearly 200 attendees — about 30% up on last year,” said Adicine’s Pérez Camiña. \n\n\tThe event’s pull is fuelling calls for a second annual meet: “Exhibitors and TV and platform executives have asked for a second edition, and at Adicine we agree it would be beneficial. However, as of today we cannot confirm whether this will be possible — or where.”\n\n\tConcrete incentives landed on Merci closing gala, when La Meseta Distribución unveiled new distribution awards recognizing the best promotional campaigns for auteur film releases: €10,000 ($11,516) to Sideral for Kristen Stewart’s “The Chronology of Water,” $5,758 each to Avalon and MadAvenue for Júlia de Paz’s “The Good Daughter” and Elástica and Revolutionary for Hlynur Pálmason’s “The Love that Remains,” plus a special mention to Beta Fiction Spain for Daniel Sánchez Arévalo’s “Rondallas.” The initiative is backed by the Junta de Castilla y León with Ministry of Culture support.\n\n\tAlso, Valencia’s Cines Lys programmer Silvino Puig received an Honorary Merci Award.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAriana Grande has been forced to cancel her trip to Brazil for the world premiere of Jon M. Chu’s anticipated musical fantasy sequel “Wicked For Good” in São Paulo after a last-minute aircraft safety issue grounded her flight, the pop star revealed in an emotional Instagram post addressed to her fans on Tuesday morning. “Brazil, I can’t believe this is happening and I am beyond devastated to be sending this message,” Grande wrote. “A few hours ago, my team and I had to deplane our flight, as they had to do maintenance on the plane due to a safety issue and it will not be taking off until 1 a.m. tomorrow.”\n\n\n\tGrande, who plays Glinda in Universal’s “Wicked” film adaptation opposite Cynthia Erivo, said there was no possible way to make it to the premiere in time despite efforts made by her team and the studio.  “My team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this,” she explained. “We’ve searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time. Even in attempting a private option, there is a permit necessary in order to fly from here that takes time to attain.”\n\t\n\n\tThe first “Wicked” movie, which came out in 2024 and scored 10 Oscar nominations, was an adaptation of the first act of the hit 2003 Broadway musical by Stephen Schwartz and Holzman. The follow-up, meanwhile, adapts the second act. The sequel has already garnered some early Oscar buzz. \n\n\tThe premiere would have marked Grande’s first in-person appearance in the country in several years. “I am so heartbroken that I’m unable to be there with you all,” she said. “We sincerely tried everything we could and I apologize from the bottom of my heart.”Grande urged fans to “shower my incredible castmates with all of the love that I wish I could be showering you with and have the most beautiful celebration.”The São Paulo premiere of “Wicked For Good” marks Universal’s first major international rollout for the film which screened last week for members of the Broadway company of the musical in New York. The next premieres are set for Paris on Nov. 7, London on Nov. 10 and Singapore on Nov. 13.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDick Cheney, who served as vice president of America under George W. Bush and is considered one of the architects of the Iraq War, has died. He was 84.\n\n\t“Richard B. Cheney, the 46th Vice President of the United States, died last night, November 3, 2025. He was 84 years old,” said his family in a statement. \n\n\t“His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed. The former vice president died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.”\n\t\n\n\tCheney was vice president between 2001 and 2009, and also served as secretary of defense under George Bush between 1989 and 1993. Before that, Cheney acted as Gerald Ford’s White House chief of staff in the 1970s, before spending a decade in the House of Representatives, representing Wyoming. \n\n\n\tHe became most prominently known as a central figure in the “war on terror” following he September 11 attacks in 2001, and an early advocate of the invasion of Iraq. He was widely regarded as one of the most powerful vice presidents in history, pushing for a series of tax cuts, as well as advocating for interrogation techniques and warrantless surveillance that his critics slammed as inhumane and extra-judicial. Cheney’s influence was so great that he was likened to Darth Vader. Cheney seemed to embrace the moniker, dressing up as the “Star Wars” villain during a 2011 “Tonight Show” appearance. \n\n\tCheney recently stunned the political establishment by becoming a vocal critic of Donald Trump after the president’s supporters stormed the United States Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden’s election. Along with his daughter, Liz Cheney, herself a former Wyoming representative and Republican power broker, he threw his support behind Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. election.\n\t\n\n\tCheney said there had “never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump” and accused him of trying to “steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA cross-border collaboration between Taiwanese and Singaporean producers has brought a provocative crime thriller to Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF), exploring the tension between scientific rationalism and spiritual belief systems through the lens of a chilling murder investigation.\n\n\t“The Fundamentals,” from acclaimed Singaporean filmmaker Yeo Siew Hua, follows a superstitious small-town police officer who teams up with a fact-based big-city investigator to uncover a rural cult responsible for murdering people born via caesarean section. The cult believes these killings will restore nature’s balance, forcing the mismatched duo to confront their own beliefs about science, sexuality and spirituality.\n\t\n\n\tThe series marks another collaboration between Volos Films and Akanga Film Asia, following their work on “Stranger Eyes,” which premiered in competition at the 81st Venice International Film Festival and opened the 61st Golden Horse Awards. For “The Fundamentals,” the partnership has assembled a Taiwanese writing room including Jen-Fang Wang, Ting Chi-wen and Becca Chen alongside Yeo.\n\n\n\t“The premise of the project is prompted by the increasing lack of trust in the sciences as observed during the pandemic in those who reject medical expertise,” says Yeo, whose “A Land Imagined” won best original screenplay at the Golden Horse Awards and served as Singapore’s Oscar submission. “The proliferation of information online has eroded our ability to make judgments, which has sometimes led to dire consequences.”\n\n\tWang, a specialist in suspense and female-centric narratives, was drawn to the series’ philosophical underpinnings. “What drew me to ‘The Fundamentals’ was its refreshing core conflict between the reverence for nature and the dominance of human science,” she says. “Through its characters, the series reflects on the notion of belief: in our modern age, science has become its own kind of faith.”\n\t\n\n\tThe writer praised Yeo’s approach to embedding complex ideas within genre entertainment. “What I find most fascinating about ‘The Fundamentals’ is how such a high-concept philosophical premise is told through the guise of an entertaining crime thriller,” Wang says. “Beneath the suspense and emotional entanglement between the characters lies a deeper, thought-provoking meditation on faith, nature, and human fragility.”\n\n\tThe project represents an evolution in the producers’ collaboration strategy. After participating in the Golden Horse FPP Series market and the Serial Bridges Asia workshop, the team is now pitching at TCCF with an eye toward production in 2026.\n\n\t“This project is entirely set, developed and to be shot in Taiwan, with a Taiwanese cast,” says Stefano Centini of Volos Films. “It was conceived on the line of a Chinese language regional series who can reach to audiences in Asia and worldwide, and produced jointly with Akanga to reinforce the mutual collaboration between Singaporean and Taiwanese talents, with the goal to grow together and expand our possibilities and outreach.”\n\n\tThe producers are currently fine-tuning scripts and closing financing. “We are eager to find the right partners at TCCF,” says Fran Borgia of Akanga Film Asia. “As the project is conceived to be filmed in Taiwan, coming back to Taiwan to attend TCCF provides the ideal platform to connect with collaborators who share our vision. We are excited about this partnership between Taiwan and Singapore and the creative possibilities it continues to open.”\n\n\tBorgia, a Spain-born producer based in Singapore since 2003, founded Akanga Film Asia and has produced acclaimed works including “Tiger Stripes,” “Apprentice” and “Stranger Eyes.” Centini, a Taiwanese-Italian producer, founded Volos Films in 2018 with a mission to bridge emerging independent Asian filmmakers with international talents.\n\n\tThe series aims to balance regional specificity with global appeal, tapping into universal questions about belief systems while grounding its narrative in distinctly Asian cultural contexts. Wang noted that the story treats various belief systems — Taoism, indigenous spirituality, Christianity and the fictional cult — as equal, with none positioned as superior to another.\n\t\n\n\t“There are many mysteries in this world that even the strongest science cannot fully explain, yet belief itself holds extraordinary power — so long as it remains steadfast,” Wang says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThai production company BeBrave Entertainment Hub and genre film studio Fearfolks are representing their psychological horror film “Mutelu” (Fortune Seekers) at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF), where the team is seeking to complete fundraising and expand the project’s international footprint.\n\n\tThe supernatural thriller follows Bua, a woman pushed to her breaking point after nearly losing her job and facing the inability to pay for her blind sister’s treatment. In desperation, she purchases mystical amulets to change their fortunes, only to unleash a dark and mysterious force that threatens everything she holds dear.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Mutelu’ may be a Thai film, but it is a universal story about luck, strife and desperation,” says producer Nakarin Narkpreecha. “It is a horror story, packaged with the creeps and the scares, but it really is about winning against all odds. The team found a bit of Bua, the main character, in each one of us, so we felt that the audience would do too.”\n\n\n\tThe project marks a collaboration between BeBraveHub and Fearfolks, a genre-focused film studio. Hans Audric Estialbo, head of Fearfolks and producer on the film, emphasizes the spiritual dimensions of the story. “As one of the producers of ‘Mutelu,’ one of our overarching goals was to convey the terrifying fragility of faith in the face of absolute, incomprehensible evil,” Estialbo says.\n\n\t“The story of ‘Mutelu,’ at its core, is a desperate spiritual battle,” he continues. “We wanted the audience to feel the raw, visceral terror of being completely stripped down – physically, mentally, and spiritually – and then being forced to find a reservoir of strength they didn’t know they had.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film will feature “Hunger” star Aokbab Chutimon as Bua, with the character’s emotional journey forming the backbone of the narrative. “She isn’t a hero; she’s just a scared unfortunate woman who has to choose to do something evil in order to do good things for the people she loves,” Estialbo explains.\n\n\tHelming the project is director Yanyong Kuruangkura, known for “App War” (2018), “Mother Gamer” (2020), and Netflix original series “Ready Set Love.” “Fortune Seekers” marks his first foray into supernatural horror.\n\n\tThe screenplay comes from Ploibutsara Phattrapornphisit, co-founder of BeBraveHub and acclaimed writer behind the “SOTUS” franchise. Her character-driven approach has shaped hits like “Voice in the Rain” for VIU and “Me Always You” for Century UU.\n\n\tCurrently in hard pre-production, “Mutelu” is slated to begin principal photography in Q2 2026, with a tentative release in late 2026 or early 2027. \n\n\t“We primarily aim to complete our fundraising for the film during TCCF,” says Estialbo. “We are extremely proud to take Thai horror to an international stage. While the film has been pre-sold to Malaysia, Taiwan and Indonesia, we also aim to find international distribution partners during the event.”\n\n\tBeBraveHub has produced series ranging from romantic dramas to modern thrillers, including “Catch Me Baby” for WeTV and “Return Man” for VIU.\n\n\tFearfolks has distributed horror titles including “Shelby Oaks” and “Good Boy,” and “The Toxic Avenger” in Thai cinemas.\n\n\t“Horror could draw the audience to the cinemas, but it is the relatability of the story that would make them want to talk about it when they go home,” Narkpreecha notes, summing up the team’s approach to making “Mutelu” resonate beyond genre boundaries.\n",

    "description": "\n\tFrance’s National Film Board is doubling down on Asia as the region emerges as a vital creative force in a shifting global entertainment landscape, ",
    "body": "\n\tFrance’s National Film Board is doubling down on Asia as the region emerges as a vital creative force in a shifting global entertainment landscape, CNC president Gaetan Bruel tells Variety.\n\n\tSpeaking at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest in Taipei, where France arrived with its second-largest delegation of 80 professionals after Korea, Bruel outlined an ambitious strategy that positions France and Europe as rising creative powers.\n\n\n\t“The fact that there is a crisis ongoing at Hollywood, that’s good news for no one, because we need their movies,” Bruel says. “But for too many years, we were just thinking mainly about how the U.S. were organizing the global ecosystem. What’s happening now is that Europe is rising as a cultural and creative power.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Centre National du Cinéma et de l’Image Animée (CNC) chief points to concrete results: This year, one-third of the 86 films submitted for the international feature Oscar category were co-produced by France, with more than 20 directly funded by CNC. The success stems from 80 years of work that has made France the world’s third-largest box office after the U.S. and China, up from fifth place, and Europe’s leading streaming market.\n\n\tTaiwan has emerged as a key partner in France’s pivot toward Asia, particularly in virtual reality. The collaboration began six years ago when CNC and Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA) recognized a natural synergy: Taiwan’s hardware expertise combined with France’s content leadership.\n\n\t“Taiwan is the leading territory for the hardware, for the technology, so it would make a lot of sense for them to take advantage of that, to be also a leading territory for the content themselves,” Bruel explains.\n\t\n\n\tThe partnership has yielded major results. HTC pivoted into VR following these discussions, and Taiwan recently won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival’s VR competition with Singing Chen’s “The Clouds Are Two Thousand Meters Up.” France itself has won the largest number of international VR festival prizes over the past 15 years.\n\n\tA French-Taiwanese co-production between Federation Entertainment’s Pascal Breton and “The Bureau” creator Eric Rochant, announced at TCCF last year, continues to advance. The series represents an ambitious project for both territories.\n\n\t“It’s not only the continuity of ‘The Bureau’ – the same atmosphere, the same topics – but it’s also how different cultures, one of Taiwan, one of France, can be merged into a global future hit,” says Bruel, who has worked on “The Bureau.”\n\n\tBeyond individual projects, CNC is helping position Taiwan as a co-production hub that can work with multiple countries, not just France. In animation, where Taiwan has long served as a supply production system for foreign content, France is now supporting the development of Taiwanese IP. Leading French animation school Gobelins has partnered with the Taiwanese ecosystem.\n\n\tIndonesia represents another major opportunity. While global theatrical attendance dropped 40% between 2019 and 2024, Indonesia’s grew 55%, driven by urban migration and the popularity of Indonesian horror films.\n\n\tFollowing French President Macron’s state visit in May, Bruel traveled to Indonesia in July to develop a multi-pillar strategy. CNC has sent an expertise mission to Jakarta on film preservation, addressing the urgent need to save analog archives as digital expertise replaces traditional skills.\n\n\t“The French model doesn’t cost even a single euro to the state, because it’s a model that just relies on the dynamic of the market,” Bruel says, explaining how France funds its film ecosystem through a 10% levy on movie tickets and streaming subscriptions rather than direct government budgets.\n\n\tThe goal is to help Indonesia build domestic audiences for its festival-acclaimed cinema, which currently struggles to compete with American and Chinese films in local multiplexes. CNC is exploring partnerships on art house cinema networks and film education programs.\n\t\n\n\tFilm education represents a crucial element of France’s international strategy. In Taiwan, CNC worked with the Fubon Foundation 13 years ago to develop a nationwide film education program modeled on France’s approach.\n\n\t“France is not only about cinema as business or just entertainment, it’s about cinema and moving image as culture as a way to emancipate people, to empower countries,” Bruel says.\n\n\tHe identifies a global paradox: People spend more time on screens than ever but less time watching movies and series, as audiences shift to free and social platforms. This threatens premium content models while piracy resurges.\n\n\t“Cinema is both threatened by our relationship with screens, but at the same time, it’s the remedy, is the solution,” Bruel says. “Today, it’s about reinventing cinema.”\n\n\tEurope’s emergence as a creative power stems partly from the AVMS directive, which has created streaming investment obligations in 16 countries over the past five years, with 10 more considering implementation. France was among the first to require streaming services to invest a percentage of local revenue in domestic content.\n\n\tThe approach contrasts with the U.S. market, where streamers face no such obligations.\n\n\tBeyond Taiwan and Indonesia, CNC is actively developing partnerships with Japan, Korea and China. “China is a big topic for us as well,” Bruel notes.\n\n\tFrance’s Taiwan Creative Content Fest delegation spans multiple sectors, including leading independent distributor Carlotta Films, which recently revived interest in late Taiwanese auteur Edward Yang’s films through new releases and publications, as well as top VR companies and festivals including Annecy.\n\n\t“We do not only believe in French cinema,” Bruel says. “Even more importantly, we believe in a universal idea of cinema and of the moving image.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe fifth edition of Red Sea Film Festival will open on Dec. 4 with Rowan Athale’s “Giant,” which tells the story of British-Yemeni boxing champion Prince Naseem ‘Naz’ Hamed. The screening will be the film’s premiere in the Middle East and North Africa region.\n\n\tThe film portrays the relationship between Hamed, played by Egyptian-British actor Amir El Masry, and his Irish boxing trainer Brendan Ingle, played by Pierce Brosnan. It charts Naz’s rags-to-riches underdog tale from his humble beginnings in Sheffield to becoming champion of the world. Sylvester Stallone is one of the film’s executive producers.\n\t\n\n\tWith his dominance of the sport, Naseem faced down the abhorrent racism and islamophobia that swept Britain in the 1980s and ’90s to become a global sporting icon.\n\n\n\tThe film explores the unlikely and tender relationship between Naz and Ingle, and the instrumental role that Ingle played on Naz’s road to success.\n\n\tFaisal Baltyuor, CEO of the Red Sea Film Foundation, said “Our selection of ‘Giant’ as the opening film of the fifth edition embodies an artistic celebration of regional talents who have established their presence on the global film scene. Through the story of an Arab world champion in boxing, the film portrays a journey of perseverance that inspires generations and reflects pride in identity, highlighting the growing presence of Arab stars in international productions alongside global names, reaffirming that Arab cinema today stands as a powerful force in the global film landscape.”\n\n\tThe film is financed by AGC Studios and BondIt Media Capital. The producers are Mark Lane of Tea Shop Productions, Kevin Sampson of White Star Productions and Stuart Ford, AGC Studios chairman and CEO.\n",

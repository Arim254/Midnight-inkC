    "body": "\n\tThere are no better actors for making beautiful music together than Kate Hudson and Jeremy Allen White. Hudson stormed Hollywood at 20 as the hippie muse of Cameron Crowe’s “Almost Famous.” And this year, she delivers a career-best turn in “Song Sung Blue” as one-half of a Neil Diamond tribute band whose true story is as uplifting as it is heartbreaking. White, out of his chef’s apron from “The Bear,” takes on the formidable task of portraying Bruce Springsteen at his most emotionally vulnerable and artistically free in “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” Here they talk tight denim, classic guitars and the rules of romantic comedy.  \n\t\n\tKate Hudson: Jeremy, I want to talk to you about wearing those Bruce Springsteen jeans.  Jeremy Allen White: Very snug. Hudson: Oh yeah. What did it feel like when you first put them on?  White: I felt like I had to stop eating. It was all really helpful – the boots, the jeans, the jackets. It was tight and really informed the physicality. It messed with my posture. Bruce also gave us clothing he wore as a young man, some of his actual pieces.  Hudson: Did you keep any of it?  White: No. I haven’t’ talked about this yet because it feels so precious, but he did give me his St. Christopher medal that he had for a very long time. And he gave me a guitar to learn to play, a 1955 Gibson J 200.  Hudson: That’s my favorite. I have the same guitar.  We both have music films this year, with some pretty iconic names.  White: Giants.  Hudson: I did not go deep into Neil Diamond’s catalogue until I did this movie. But Springsteen? White: Similar for me. I was really familiar with Bruce, like everybody, but I hadn’t heard “Nebraska.” Hudson: You didn’t? “Nebraska” was really personal one for me. \n\tWhite: That was the same for a lot of musicians I spoke to when I started prep. Many had that album in their top five.  Hudson: What did it feel like to take on Bruce’s most artistic album? White: From a technical standpoint I was in luck, because there were very few chords used on “Nebraska.” But also, in the sense that he’s so honest in all of his music. There’s so much specificity in his writing. The canvas of “Nebraska” is so rich with himself and his experience. It was like I had a map. Hudson: How involved was Bruce in this film?  White: Bruce gave the go-ahead for our director, Scott Cooper, to do this movie but was hands-off during the writing process. I got together with him first in London, at Wembley, I got invited to soundcheck. He brought me up on stage prior to everybody coming in. We spent a few weeks together and then he was on set all the time, which was not something that we knew going into it. Hudson: The pressure.  White: Yeah. I’ve gone back and forth about this a lot: I made all my [character] choices prior to showing up, and then I felt like I had to hang on tight once I got there. I find that I’m not super flexible when I’m on set, are you?  Hudson: On the day? I’m probably the opposite. I do a ton of work at the beginning, and I’ve learned that I have to let it all go and be available and flexible.  White: I should probably try that.  Hudson: I don’t know. You’re doing pretty good, Jeremy. Stick with what you’re doing. What you did in this movie was wonderful, as someone who has been writing songs my whole life. It made me emotional because the process of songwriting can be torturous. You internalized it all.  White: You’re so excellent in “Song Sung Blue.” You’re charismatic in everything you do, but there’s such a joy here. Even in the moments where it’s difficult to find, there’s always like some optimism within you. On the other end of the spectrum, I was so internal. My head is down and you’re this beaming light on set. Are you moving with that energy all the time? Hudson: I think in life, I choose to like tackle it with energy and optimism every day. I try to bring that to set. Maybe it has to do with how I grew up. I really like being in the circus. I’m not an actor that goes into a hole in my trailer. Even if I’m having a tough day, you become razor sharp in moments where you have to feel or channel something. White: Has your process changed a lot over time? Hudson: It changes for every job. When I was younger, I was incredibly spontaneous. I work well with people throwing shit at me. I also love comedy. That side of me likes to have fresh ideas all the time and not be too rehearsed. But as I started working with different actors I learned from and admire, you steal stuff. Do you do that?  White: I try to, yeah. \n\tHudson: I’ll never forget looking at Naomi Watts’ script [for “Le Divorce”]. I saw her notes and was like, “Well, I’m really underperforming.”  White: You should see Jeremy Strong’s script.  Hudson: You have to get that highlighter out. Figure out, “Who is this person to me?” But Naomi was so committed to her craft. I was like, “Let’s get wine and smoke cigarettes and party on location in Paris.” She’d sit at home and know her lines. White: But would you have done it differently? Or did you feel like that fed you in the way that you needed to finish? \n\tHudson: What I learned from Naomi is that it’s okay to take risks in your choices. I have a friend who worked with Cate Blanchett who had a similar experience.  White: I want to ask about your music, which is obviously a huge component of “Song Sung Blue,” but does music always play a part in a job for you? Hudson: Huge. Certain songs evoke certain emotions for me. I’m pretty good at accessing emotion, I’m not going to lie. I can cry all the time. But when I can’t get there, there are songs. Actually, “My Father’s House” from “Nebraska” is one of those songs.  White: That was my north star. If I was ever feeling lost or unstable, or I didn’t know what a certain scene was or where Bruce was at, that grounded me. When I recorded that song [for the film], it was the first time I felt really close to Bruce.  Hudson: Sometimes, I’ll get an earwig. If there’s a scene I’m doing that needs energy, I’ll ask for one and just have sound blasting.  White: That’s so nice.  Hudson: Try that one. Since you weren’t so knowledgeable about “Nebraska,” did you listen to the whole album through? On Spotify or ever on vinyl?  White: I listened to it on vinyl once. I was in Chicago. Scott told me to turn out the lights, lay down and let it go. This was before I even read the script. I’d met with Scott and spoke about working together, but he didn’t mention Springsteen at all. He told me to listen to the record before I got a script.  Hudson: What was the first song?  White: The title track is the first song, and it’s wonderful. I don’t want to sell any of the songs short. “Highway Patrolman,” the storytelling is so great. The last track stuck with me the longest. That’s “Reason to Believe.” I love singing that song the most. I see a real romance in that. Hudson: Did it make you want to write music?  White: No. Hudson: Come on.  White: No, not at all. If anything, it made me realize that the writing on that record is so good it was intimidating. I remember, in prep, writing his lyrics over and over again. Not for memorization, but for a shared experience [with the character].  Hudson: It’s so funny how life works. Just yesterday, I was with Cameron Crowe. He has this book out called “The Uncool,” and I went and did a Q&A with him. He was telling this story randomly, about David Bowie. He was interviewing Bowie once, and he kept talking about this artist, this young kid from Jersey who he though was going to be great. He loved his lyrics. How cool is it that we get to be connected to these amazing people in music and then portray certain things on screen?  White: Did you spend time with Claire Sardina?  Hudson: Not really. Our director Craig Brewer was precious about me not spending too much time with Claire. He wanted me to do my own thing and stick to the character as he wrote it.  White: It’s devastating. This is one of the movies where you go into your phone after and search, like, “Surely, this isn’t how this happened.” But at the core of it, it’s such a hopeful movie. You look at all this tragedy and then you are somehow inspired by the grit of these people.  Hudson: The power of escape and the joy of music. Our films are different but they’re stories about music saving people. In our film’s case, it was about a tip jar musician who didn’t get the opportunity to see stardom. They did it because they love it.  White: Because they had to do it. They’re not thinking about what they’re going to get back.  White: What about “Almost Famous”? That experience is not just a little connected to music.  Hudson:  I got the part when I was 19. It was a dream.  I had already started writing music at 18 years old, but to have someone like Cameron be this wellspring of musical information? It blew my mind, and it blew my life open. I have to ask, would you ever consider doing a rom-com?  White: I’d love to. I’ve never done one before but they seem so fun.  Hudson: They’re harder than you think. The rules are different. You want to make it for the people showing up to see it. They want something out of it, too. They want to feel, to laugh.  White: I worry about finding the right character, because I’d want it to be a classic rom-com. Not a flash in the pan, but “When Harry Met Sally.”  Hudson: One of the greats. It’s one of the hardest genres to get right. But it’s a game-changer for your life. You can’t imagine how many people you help feel good.\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tStar Dakota Johnson made a surprise appearance on “Saturday Night Live” this week, playing the mysterious “Madeline” during Lily Allen‘s performance of that track. The song was Allen’s second of the night. \n\n\tDuring the performance, Johnson was mostly hidden behind a screen throughout the song, as Allen sang about the mistress. But Johnson performed the spoken word portion of the song, which appears on Allen’s album “West End Girl.” In the track, Allen notes that she and her significant other “had an arrangement: Be discreet and don’t be blatant. And there had to be payment. It had to be with strangers. But you’re not a stranger, Madeline.”\n\t\n\n\tLater in the song, “Madeline” explains her side of the story via texts to Allen: “I hate that you’re in so much pain right now. I really don’t wanna be the cause of any upset. He told me that you were aware this was going on and that he had your full consent. If he’s lying about that, then please let me know. Because I have my own feelings about dishonesty. Lies are not something that I wanna get caught up in. You can reach out to me any time, by the way. If you need any more details or you just need to vent or anything. Love and light, Madeline.”\n\n\n\tAfter reading those lines, Johnson came out from behind the curtain and walked up to Allen — and gave her a quick kiss.\n\n\n\t“Madeline” is one of the standout tracks from Allen’s new album “West End Girl,” and has led to much speculation over who the mysterious pseudonym is (or might be a composite of). At least one person has  told the press that she is “Madeline,” although Allen has said that it’s actually a composite of several women.\n\t\n\n\tFor her first “SNL” number, Allen performed “Sleepwalking” from “West End Girl,” in a bedroom set under a neon sign. Given the saucy lyrics, Allen did have to censor herself, omitting the lyric, “Why aren’t we fucking, baby?” (She did the same thing with “Madeline,” avoiding part of the line “I’m not convinced that he didn’t fuck you in our house.”)\n\n\n\tAllen appeared on “Saturday Night Live” to promote “West End Girl,” which has been met with wide acclaim for its brutal honesty and craftsmanship. The album addresses her split from “Stranger Things” star David Harbour, without ever mentioning him by name. (As characterized through scathing lyrics on songs such as “Pussy Palace,” “Sleepwalking” and “Madeline.”)\n\n\tIn his Variety review, Chris Willman called “West End Girl” a contender for album of the year. He wrote of “savoring every confessional line and wondering what the hell she was going to tell us in the next one to top it. It’s the pleasure of listening to a master storyteller who makes your jaw drop by seeming to have spilled all the tea almost at the outset, and then the tea just keeps on coming. Not since Boston in 1773, maybe, has anyone dumped it this massively, or this fulfillingly.”\n\n\t“West End Girl” repped Allen’s first album release since 2018. Allen has announced a tour next March to support the album, which marks Allen’s first time touring since 2019.\n\n\tThis is Allen’s second time on “Saturday Night Live,” following an appearance on the Feb. 3, 2007 episode hosted by Drew Barrymore. During that episode, Allen performed the tracks “Smile” and “LDN” from her debut album “Alright, Still.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Weekend Update” anchors Michael Che and Colin Jost brought their usual pop culture snark to “Saturday Night Live” on the Dec. 13 episode, and several topics have been of interest to Variety readers this week. He are some of the punchiest pop culture jokes.\n\t\n\t\tOn Trump’s recent Kennedy Center events:\t\n\n\t“Last week, President Trump hosted multiple events at the Kennedy Center, including an award ceremony for Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor and rock band KISS, as well as a musical performance by The Village People. Which raises the question: Is Donald Trump a gay man from 1978? Trump also said the proposed merger between Netflix and Warner Brothers Discovery could be a problem, adding, “bribe.” In response, Netflix is offering Trump one night with the ‘K-Pop Demon Hunters.'”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOn the Golden Globe nominations:\t\n\n\t“The Golden Globe nominations were announced, with the most nominations going to the movie ‘One Battle After Another,’ and the least nominations going to Michael Che’s ‘Hold Up, Medea Got a Daughter?'”\n\n\t\n\t\tFrom Jane Wickline’s song about the young “Stranger Things” cast, with interjections from Jost:\t\n\n\t“We’re programming monsters we will lose control of soon. They’re taking every job, and singularity is approaching. They may get smarter than us, will they be our doom? I think we all know the topic I am broaching. We don’t have much time to stop them, we must kill them while they’re still weak: The child actors from ‘Stranger Things.'”\n\n\tJost: “I really thought you were talking about AI.”\n\n\t“AI is just a distraction. The real threat here is Sadie Sink and her child co-stars on ‘Stranger Things.‘ ‘Stranger Things’ is ending. They’ll have so much free time. What if they grow self-aware? We need to keep them occupied. They can mobilize their followers, 60 million followers. We need to keep them occupied.”\n\t\n\n\tJost: “I just don’t understand what you think the danger is!”\n\n\t“The ‘Stranger Things’ kids use a cubic mile of water every minute. If there’s a hell, Gaten Matarazzo belongs in it. They’re crushing the environment and killing the economy. Finn Wolfhard’s the devil to me.The six of them are in a room right now, preparing to seize the next election. And for these reasons, I stand with Vecna.”\n\n\tJost: “Vecna! Jane, these kids are harmless. All they do is go on ‘Hot Ones.'”\n\n\t“Colin, things that start funny can get important. Joe Rogan used to make people eat bugs, and now he’s the President of the United States. Everyone’s focused on ‘Stranger Things,’ and they’re ignoring the stranger thing of the strangers on the internet, thinking those six strange kids are no danger, but they’re the devil. We’re estranged from the truth, but I have a plan. I’ll tie some cheese to a string, put a stick under a box big enough to catch six strange kids. I’ll be a hero. I will win an award. ‘You stopped the apocalypse,’ President Chatbot will beam at me. I have to scramble the brains of the six strange kids and make them join the cast of ‘All’s Fair.'”\n\n\tWatch part of this week’s Weekend Update below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains light spoilers from Season 2, Episode 5 of “Landman,” “The Pirate Dinner,” which premiered Sunday, Dec. 14, on Paramount+.\n\n\tDuring the newest episode of the Paramount+ drama “Landman,” no love was shown to the daytime talk show “The View.”\n\n\tIn the episode, Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) is urging his father, T.L. (Sam Elliott), to kill time around the house by watching a TV show and suggests “The View.” When T.L. admits that he doesn’t know what that is, Tommy explains it as, “A bunch of pissed-off millionaires bitching about how much they hate millionaires and Trump and men and you and me and everybody else they got a bee up their ass about. It’s pretty funny.”\n\t\n\n\tT.L. responds, “Don’t sound funny.”\n\n\tTommy replies, “Well, it ain’t joke funny, it’s like ‘fart in church’ funny, you know what I mean?”\n\n\tT.L. retorts, “That don’t sound funny, either.”\n\n\tTommy then clarifies, “Well, it depends on your proximity to the fart.”\n\n\tSheridan, who co-created the series and has the sole writing credit on all episodes in Seasons 1 and 2, often uses Tommy to opine on a litany of topics, ranging from alternative wind energy to country radio DJs. That said, real-life pop culture is very rarely discussed on the show, so it was surprising to hear “The View” brought up as a point of derision.\n\n\tThornton was most recently on “The View” in 2024 for a lively and charming visit promoting the series premiere of “Landman.” Watch the segment below.\n\n\n\n",

It makes sense! His son Cooper (Jacob Lofland) is making some really reckless decisions in both his personal and professional life; his father, T.L.

I could definitely see it happening!\n“You got a cool voice.” Love the respect for Elliott.\nDamn, is T.L. flirting with Shelby (Audrey McGraw)?

    "body": "\n\tLady Gaga paused her concert at Sydney’s Accor Stadium on Dec. 13 after one of her Mayhem Ball dancers slipped and fell off the stage.\n\n\tThe dancer, Michael Dameski, slid off the stage during Gaga’s performance of “Garden of Eden,” prompting the singer to rush to the front of the stage with her arm outstretched to pause the music. The music cut out as Gaga explained to the crowd, “Just one second. We just had an accident on stage. Everything’s OK, just everybody wait a second, please.”\n\t\n\n\tThe singer hopped down to make sure Dameski was not seriously injured before continuing the show. Dameski later posted on his Instagram Story that he was fine and “was able to finish the last show of the year” once he got back up.\n\n\n\tThe moment was captured and posted on the Mayhem Ball‘s X page.\n\nThe show stopped for a second time during Garden of Eden after a dancer fell off stage and was injured because of the persistent rain. “If you could just give us five minutes, I just wanna get some proper grooves on the shoes of the dancers,” Lady Gaga said. pic.twitter.com/fKltrlRQJh— The Mayhem Ball (@MayhemBallTour) December 13, 2025\n\n\n\tThe stage was wet due to rain, and later in the night, Gaga paused the show for a second time so that the dancers could get better grooves on their shoes.\n\n\tLady Gaga released “Mayhem” as her sixth studio album in March. To support the album, she kicked off the Mayhem Ball Tour at Las Vegas’ T-Mobile Arena in July. The tour has since played in cities across North America and Europe before arriving in Australia. It will resume in Japan in January before returning to the United States in February.\n\t\n\n\t“Mayhem” is nominated for six Grammy Awards, including best pop vocal album and album of the year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney is experiencing the highs and lows the box office has to offer. On one hand, the studio’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” returned to No. 1 in North America in its third weekend after sprinting past the $1 billion mark. On the other, the political dramedy “Ella McCay” cratered with $2.1 million in its domestic debut, suffering one of the worst openings in modern times for Disney.\n\n\tTo be fair, “Ella McCay” cost $35 million to produce, which is way less than Disney tends to spend on its theatrical releases. Most of the studio’s movies — including franchise fare from Marvel and “Avatar,” as well as family-friendly sensations like “Inside Out 2” and “Lilo & Stitch” — typically carry budgets above $200 million. Although “Ella McCay” isn’t in danger of turning a profit for Disney, the PG-13 misfire probably won’t cause heads to roll, either.\n\t\n\n\t“Ella McCay,” written and directed by “The Simpsons” co-creator and “As Good As It Gets” filmmaker James L. Brooks, landed behind already low projections of $4 million. It’s not exactly a mystery as to why ticket sales missed the mark. “Ella McCay” is the kind of mid-budget film that studios hardly make anymore because audiences don’t show up to see them. And this one — a comedic drama about a young politician (Emma Mackey) who unexpectedly becomes her state’s governor — was roundly rejected by critics (a 24% Rotten Tomatoes average) and moviegoers (a “B-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls). “Ella McCay” continues a miserable box office run for Brooks after 2004’s “Spanglish” ($55 million against an $80 million budget) and 2010’s “How Do You Know?” ($48 million against a $120 million budget). However, the Oscar-winner could end his theatrical dry spell with Disney and 20th Century’s “The Simpsons Movie” in 2027.\n\t\n\n\t“James L. Brooks defined character storytelling in the ‘80s and ‘90s with a string of award-winning comedy dramas,” says analyst David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. “Today, you can find material like this on television and even on social media, where it benefits from authenticity.”\n\n\t“Zootopia 2,” after ceding the top spot to Universal and Blumhouse’s horror sequel “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” returned to first place with $26.3 million in its third weekend, a 39% decline from its prior outing. The family-friendly adventure has grossed $259 million domestically and $1.13 billion globally to date to stand as just the second Hollywood release this year to cross the coveted $1 billion mark.\n\n\t“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” slid to second place with $19.5 million, a brutal 70% drop from its scary-good $64 million debut. That’s rough, but not as bad as the original “Five Nights at Freddy’s” — which cratered by 76.2% in its second weekend while playing simultaneously on streaming. Still, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” cost just $36 million and registers as an undisputed win for Blumhouse, having already grossed $95 million and $173 million globally after two weekends in theaters.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” remained at No. 3 with $8.5 million in its fourth weekend of release, a 51% decline from its prior outing. So far, Universal’s big-budget musical has earned $312 million domestically and $467 million globally. “Wicked: For Good” appears to be running out of steam much faster than its predecessor, 2024’s “Wicked,” which powered to $474 million in North America and $758 million globally.\n\n\tA standout at the specialty box office includes Chloe Zhao’s “Hamnet” with $1.5 million from 749 venues. (That’s roughly $500,000 less than “Ella McCay” despite playing in a fraction of the number of theaters.) So far, “Hamnet, a well-reviewed tragedy starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal that follows the death of William Shakespeare’s son, has amassed $7 million to date.\n\n\tAfter this glum weekend, overall ticket sales sit at $8.1 billion, a mere 0.5% ahead of last year as well as 22.7% behind 2019, according to Comscore. Cinemas are about to get a major boost, though, from holiday offerings including James Cameron’s epic “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Paramount’s “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” and Lionsgate thriller “The Housemaid” on Dec. 19, as well as A24 Timothée Chalamet-led ping-pong adventure “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson, and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” with Jack Black and Paul Rudd on Christmas Day. Will these blockbuster-hopefuls manage to power the domestic box office past the $9 billion benchmark?\n",

    "body": "\n\tRabbits and foxes and snakes, oh my! “Zootopia 2” is officially the highest-grossing Hollywood release of the year. Disney’s animal-packed animated sequel has earned a staggering $1.13 billion globally after 20 days of release, overtaking the haul of Disney’s live-action “Lilo & Stitch” remake with $1.03 billion. A non-Motion Picture Association (MPA) film, China’s animated blockbuster “Ne Zha 2,” remains 2025’s biggest release with $1.9 billion.\n\t\n\n\tAnother Disney juggernaut, James Cameron’s epic “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” could contend for the 2025 crown — considering its predecessors were $2 billion-grossing sensations. However, the threequel opens on Dec. 19 and will likely earn the majority of its money in the following calendar year.\n\n\n\tOn Friday, “Zootopia 2” surpassed the $1 billion mark after 17 days in theaters, the quickest PG film to achieve the milestone. The sequel stands as the seventh-biggest animated film in history, outpacing the original 2016’s “Zootopia” ($1.025 billion globally) and last year’s “Moana 2” ($1.06 billion).\n\n\n\tOver the weekend, “Zootopia 2” added a staggering $131.1 million from 52 territories in its third outing, boosting its overseas tally to $877 million. It’ll soon become only the second animated movie in history to cross $1 billion at the international box office, following “Inside Out 2.” The follow-up film has been particularly massive in China with $502 million and counting, ranking behind only 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” ($632 million) as the largest MPA release in the country. Those ticket sales are notable because Chinese audiences haven’t been receptive to Hollywood fare in years.\n\t\n\n\tAnother Disney film, the James L. Brooks-directed “Ella McCay,” cemented the wrong kind of records for the studio over the weekend as the political dramedy flopped with $300,000 from five territories. That’s not a wide international footprint, of course, but the PG-13 movie was also rejected in North America with $2.1 million, to rank as the lowest start in modern times for Disney. Globally, “Ella McCay” has grossed a paltry $2.4 million against a $35 million budget. With weak reviews and poor audience scores, the film is unlikely to rebound in the coming weeks. Luckily, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” is expected to end the studio’s year on a high note.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJovan Adepo has been having a busy year. He’s hopped around the world filming for Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey,” and now he’s back in Europe working on the second season of Netflix’s “3 Body Problem” — all as his performance as Major Leroy Hanlon in “It: Welcome to Derry” rolls out on HBO. The actor has always had a restless talent, though. He made his big screen debut in 2016’s “Fences” opposite Denzel Washington (who also directed), and he’s since appeared in Darren Aronofsky’s “Mother!,” Damien Chazelle’s “Babylon” and on television in “Jack Ryan,” “Watchmen” and “When They See Us.” Adepo previous dipped his toe into the Stephen King universe playing Larry Underwood in the 2020 Paramount+ adaptation of “The Stand,” but he’s now becoming a prominent fixture within it as Leroy Hanlon in “Welcome to Derry.” (Season 1 concludes on Dec. 14.)\n\t\n\n\tThe Hanlon family plays an important role in King’s “It” novel and its adaptations: Mike Hanlon is one of the main characters in the book. He is depicted as a child in Andy Muschietti’s 2017 film adaptation (played by Chosen Jacobs), and as an adult (Isaiah Mustafa) in its 2019 sequel. Because “Welcome to Derry” is a prequel to those films, Leroy Hanlon is Mike’s grandfather: one of the few Black men living in the titular Maine town circa 1962. He arrives from Louisiana with his wife, Charlotte (Taylour Paige) his son, Will (Blake Cameron James) and a combat wound on his amygdala that prevents him from feeling fear.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©HBO/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGiven the role that fear plays in Derry, Hanlon becomes an integral player in the military’s quest to infiltrate and extract the town’s dark curse. Despite his condition, though, Hanlon still showcases the gamut of emotions throughout the series, showcasing Adepo’s range while still remaining a steady, assertive presence.\n\t\n\n\tAhead of the finale, Variety caught up with the actor to talk about his part on the show, his relationships with his co-stars and his globetrotting year of performances.\n\t\n\t\tTell us how you landed the role of Leroy on ” Welcome to Derry.”\t\n\n\tI met Andy maybe five or six years ago. We had spent some time together in Vancouver, but we hadn’t worked together before. It wasn’t until the premiere of “Babylon” in L.A. that Andy came up to me after the film. It was obviously good to see a friend, but then my agent was like, “Hey Andy, I know that you’re working on something, and I think Jovan will be right for it.” Apparently they had already been in communication, so he knew what she was talking about. After that, it all happened relatively quickly. We had a couple conversations, and I did one tape with Andy. He just wanted to see if I could do a particular scene that dealt with me and my son. After that, he was just like, “You got the part.” If only all auditions were like that.\n\t\n\t\tWere you a fan of Andy Muschietti’s two “It” films? Had you read the book by Stephen King?\t\n\n\tI had not read the book. I watched the original miniseries starring Tim Curry, and then I watched both films. I was a fan of Andy’s before I met him in Vancouver — at least the first movie had come out, so I was already a fan of him as a filmmaker, and the chance to do the prequel version of this character was really exciting.\n\t\n\t\tThe Hanlon family is really present in the novel, and an older version of Leroy is briefly introduced in Andy’s first film, played by actor Stephen Williams. Did you study any of this source material to better understand the family and character?\t\n\n\tAfter I was cast, I read the book and tried to take as much as I could from it. But Andy was really a great tool — he is so well versed in the entire “It” universe, and the Stephen King universe. If I had any questions or any ideas about Leroy and the Hanlon family, he was the best resource to use. He was really just instrumental in me playing Leroy in a way that honored the the Hanlon legacy in the franchise.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWas Leroy then mostly an invention of of Andy’s, based on the details from the book?\t\n\n\tI think it was a combination of people, Andy and [executive producer] Barbara [Muschietti], of course; Jason [Fuchs] and Bradley [Caleb Kane], the two showrunners; and then also [writer] Cord Jefferson. Cord was a big part of the creation of Leroy, which I was excited about because I worked with Cord on “Watchmen,” so getting a chance to play a character that he had hands in again was very exciting.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLeroy is definitely an interesting character, having this amygdala damage that prevents him from feeling fear. How do you approach playing a character who doesn’t experience fear without making him feel like a robot?\t\n\n\tIt was a question that I had for Andy and Barbara when we first started: “Is he actually immune to fear?” I like to consider that he has just a higher tolerance for it. My concern was finding a way to prevent Leroy from being a boring character. Because if you can’t feel fear in a horror project, what are we doing? Andy and Barbara put my concerns to rest really early, by saying that if he doesn’t feel fear, he feels everything else extra. He still feels insecurity, still feels anxiety. He feels anger, passion, happiness, all of that. He gets opportunities to express pretty much every other emotion on the spectrum. \n\n\tAnd I never felt that he was completely absent of fear, either. I just think that there is something really particular that would trigger it. What scares him is feeling like his family’s in danger, especially if it’s from his doing, or he thinks it’s his fault. The traditional jump scare may not be as as crippling for him as it is to other characters in the show, but I think when it comes down to his son and his wife being in a predicament that he can’t control or he can’t immediately fix, that’s what he’s afraid of.\n\t\n\t\tAnd that’s what makes the character so rich. He’s not just a soldier, but a husband and a father as well. Tell us about building that on-screen family dynamic with Taylour and Blake.\t\n\n\tIt was fun. I met with Taylour first, because as far as I know, we were the first two people cast in the show. We met up, had coffee, and we just sat at the coffee shop. It felt like hours, just trying to figure out what the dynamic was going to be. Obviously, Charlotte and Hanlon are two drastically different characters, but we wanted to find the through line. They very much love each other, but they bump heads on how they see the world. As far as Leroy being in the armed forces, I was lucky enough that my father was in the Air Force. He was an airman from Tennessee, much like Leroy. So I really had a great resource in what it felt like to be a young man raising a family, but also trying to pursue a career in the military. I talked about that with Taylor and we kind of built up a relationship together in our journals, about how Charlotte and Leroy came from Louisiana, are going from base to base, and are doing our best to raise a family. When Blake came into the picture, I remember Andy sent me his audition tape. He was like, “This is the kid that’s going to be your son.” And I was like, “Oh, this kid is fucking amazing.” By the time we had met and he came to do the scenes, it was sort of seamless. Blake, for his age, takes the job incredibly seriously. All the kids in this show take the work very seriously, but I’m partial to Blake because I spent the most time with him. He was eager to learn, very respectful, very driven and ambitious. He’s not afraid to make mistakes. He’s not afraid to try new things. So bringing that kind of variable into the equation of what me and Taylour had already talked about, it just really came together in a really cool way.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLeroy also has a unique dynamic with Chris Chalk’s character, Dick Hallorann. What was it like building that dynamic as two Black soldiers, not just dealing with their unique psyches, but with navigating 1960s America?\t\n\n\tChris is a good buddy. I’ve worked with him before, so this wasn’t like an introduction to Chris Chalk at all. Building the relationship between between Dick and Leroy was really interesting, because they’re coming from different sides of the planet. For Leroy to be ranked officer as a Black man in the early ’60s, he had to have been an exceptional person, an exceptional airman or soldier, because if for any reason they were going to promote somebody, they 100% would have given that job to a white officer. But if they gave it to Leroy, you’d have to assume that he’s just an exceptional guy, and he’s still pretty young. Chris is older than me, but when Dick Hallorann comes into the picture, Dick is still a private. So there’s a dynamic that we naturally had, where I was coming in as a guy who’s earned his stripes and commands respect from everyone. Then Dick comes along, and there’s a lack of respect. I think Leroy doesn’t like him, because he doesn’t understand him and he doesn’t want to understand him. So there’s this weird friction that they have in the beginning where they’re trying to figure out who the other person is, but over the series, you see them kind of figure out that they need each other. They need each other in a way that they probably didn’t realize until both of their backs are pushed against the wall. Getting to play that with Chris was fun, and it was relatively easy, because we know each other pretty well. We know how each other works, but also we’re both very competitive and we both want to push each other to be better.\n\t\n\t\tDid filming “Welcome to Derry” conflict at all with your schedule filming “The Odyssey”?\t\n\n\tNo, it was perfect. We started “Derry” just as we finished Season 1 of “3 Body Problem.” We stopped for like five or six months during the strike, and then we started again. We finished production on “Derry,” then I came home and I got “The Odyssey” and I did pretty much all the locations for it. We filmed in Morocco, we did Greece, and then we went to Italy, we went to L.A., then went to Iceland, Scotland, and then finished in L.A. again. In between those pockets of time, I maybe had like four or five days of pickup shoots for “Derry.” And after that, I went back and finished “The Odyssey.” Production ended in August, and I went straight into “3 Body Problem” Season 2. I was lucky that it all kind of just worked out. The only thing that was tricky was, when we came back from the strike, all the kids grew like three inches, and some of the kids had facial hair. Puberty doesn’t care about the actor strike, but we got it done.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCan you say who you’re playing in “The Odyssey”?\t\n\n\tNope. They’re still keeping everything under lock and key. I can’t even attempt to say anything because I’ll probably get in trouble, but you can’t complain when you’re working with Christopher Nolan. He’s one of the top dogs in the industry and incredibly talented. He and Andy are two filmmakers of a few that I’ve just been really honored to work with.\n\t\n\t\tAnd how are things going on “3 Body Problem” Season 2?\t\n\n\tIt’s been good. I don’t know how much I can say, but it’s a big season of evolution for Saul. He left off in Season 1 being anointed as one of the three Wallfacers and not really wanting the job. This season gives audiences a chance to see if he does the job or not. How he goes about that, I can’t say, but it’s been going well and we’ll be here until the end of January. We’ve gotten most of the of the show in the can. Now we’re just getting the bigger set pieces done. Also the cast is brilliant. We’ve added some new faces to the show, and it’s a think it’s gonna be a fun one.\n\t\n\t\tThe scale of the show— fighting a global threat that won’t arrive for 400 years— is part of what makes “3 Body Problem” unique, but it’s also something that can feel hard to connect with at times. Does the conflict get any more immediate or personal in Season 2?\t\n\n\tI think things become a bit more immediate. The scale of the situation is still the same— it’s still an impending alien invasion. What I think feels different is that the first season was creating the world for the audience. It was introducing the characters and the scientific idea and theory of the Three Body Problem. Season 1 was very science heavy. \n\n\tWhat stood out to me when I read the scripts this season was that, now that we know the context, it feels way more personal. We see more of the the personal lives of the characters from Season 1. All the decisions that they make directly affect the other characters in much more aggressive ways this season. I think that the fans will really enjoy that, because they’ll get a chance to really connect with the circumstances of the story. It’ll be different, but in a good way.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

The bystander reaches down, pulls the weapon right out of the shooter's hand, and then -- in a wild twist -- points the gun back at the suspect.\n      \n\n          Instead of resisting, the suspect slowly gets up, appears stunned, and casually walks away as the bystander holds the weapon on him.\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Bondi Beach turned into a nightmare Sunday evening when gunmen opened fire during a Hanukkah celebration, killing at least 12 people ... including one of the attackers ... and injuring 29 more.\n      \n    \n          The shooting erupted during Chanukah by the Sea, a family-friendly gathering meant to celebrate the first night of the holiday.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Insane Videos\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                          \n                Holidays\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

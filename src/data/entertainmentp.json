    "body": "\n\tIf you really want to know a person, figure out their fandoms. And check out their playlists.\n\n\tA consumer’s fan affinity for music is a reliable guide to tastes in other areas of fandom, such as gaming, film and TV, sports and fashion. That’s one of the conclusions of a new report published by Vevo, the music video platform that is a joint venture of Sony Music and Universal Music Group. “Fandom = Cultural Currency” is part of Vevo’s regular Media Tracker survey that gauges how music connects with consumers.\n\t\n\n\tRob Christensen, executive VP of global sales for Vevo, highlighted the survey results and how Vevo is positioning the value of its audience to top brands in a Variety Strictly Business Spotlight interview presented by Vevo and conducted in New York on Oct. 8. In an era of fragmentation, the company’s pitch is that understanding a consumer’s fave raves in music are a good indicator of other passions and fandoms.\n\n\t“The one thing that a fan isn’t is passive,” Christensen says. “So truly, nobody dives more deeply into engaging in content than true fans. I’m a big music fan, big sports fan, and you just find yourself in those rabbit holes constantly. And as a result, from a brand perspective, it’s a great mouse trap for maximizing brand exposure without over exposing yourself, frequency-wise. And part of the fandom report [is demonstrating that] we know that that fandom leads to action, and it leads to investing, and it leads to being able to affect the wallet of a consumer.”\n\n\tVevo’s report is based on a survey of 6,100 respondents in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia as well as the company’s internal data and analytics. Vevo, which has stepped up its online distribution efforts through fast channels and licensing, pacts with Samsung, LG and other connected TV manufacturers. The platform launched in 2009 now generates 22 billion views a month and 1.5 billion hours viewed per month.\n\t\n\n\t“Music videos still are a massive driver of pop culture, cultural trends and truly exude the passion that artists have for their work,” Christensen says. “Most fans will say that artists and pop culture and fandom are a big part of their identity. For us, we look at our content set as exemplifying that and extending pop cultural trends every single day, throughout the entire year, truly rivaling that of sports.”\n\n\tAmong other data points from the survey:\n\n\tMusic is a great connector. More than two-thirds (69%) of respondents agreed with the statement “Music helps me feel connected to the world around me.” That compared to 62% for sports, 57% for politics and 55% for gaming. \n\n\tGeography matters. Consumers in Australia are 48% more likely that those in other territories to be fans of K-pop, something the study chalks up to Australia’s proximity to East Asia.\n\n\tThe enthusiasm of hardcore fans drives pop culture. “Over a third of viewers will repeatedly binge their favorite artist’s content, and over a quarter end up purchasing that artist’s official merchandise, which includes everything from vinyl and deluxe edition CDs to an artist’s makeup or clothing line,” the report states.\n\n\tOne thing leads to another: Some 68% of respondents agreed that the connection between music and movies and TV is strong, followed by clothing and fashion (51%) and sports (45%).\n\n\tThe report sought to measure the elasticity of demand among superfans and how they’re influenced by advertising. Some 69% of survey respondents agreed with the statement, “I am more likely to spend money with brands who surround my favorite fandoms/fan communities” while 64% concurred with the idea that “I am more favorable towards brands that feel connected to musicians and the music industry.”\n\n\tWatch the full conversation above.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Critics Choice Association has announced the nominees for the 10th annual Critics Choice Documentary Awards, honoring the year’s outstanding achievements in nonfiction filmmaking.\n\n\tLeading this year’s nominations is “Orwell: 2+2=5,” which scored seven nods, including documentary feature, director for Raoul Peck, editing, score, narration by Damian Lewis, archival documentary and political documentary.\n\n\n\tNetflix’s “The Perfect Neighbor,” which was acquired after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, received six nominations, including for best documentary feature and true crime documentary.\n\t\n\n\tHonoring the year’s outstanding achievements in nonfiction filmmaking, the winners will be revealed at a gala event on Nov. 9 at the Edison Ballroom in Manhattan, hosted by actor, writer and producer Aasif Mandvi. The ceremony is produced by Bob Bain of Bob Bain Productions and Joey Berlin of Berlin Entertainment. National Geographic Documentary Films serves as the presenting sponsor.\n\n\tCCA members who have expertise in the documentary field, select the nominees. At last year’s ceremony, “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story” and “Will and Harper” tied for best documentary feature.\n\n\t“The nominated films and series this year remind us how documentary storytelling can illuminate truth, inspire empathy, and deepen our understanding of the world,” said Christopher Campbell, vice president of documentaries for the Critics Choice Association. “We’re thrilled to recognize the filmmakers whose vision and dedication keep the art form evolving.”\n\n\tAs previously announced, the Critics Choice Impact Award will go to legendary documentarian Ken Burns, presented by Christine Baranski. The award recognizes filmmakers whose work has illuminated history, inspired public discourse, and deepened cultural understanding — a legacy Burns has embodied throughout his decades-long career. In addition, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady will receive the CCA’s Pennebaker Award (formerly the Critics Choice Lifetime Achievement Award), presented by D.A. Pennebaker’s widow and collaborator, Chris Hegedus.

    "body": "\n\t“My Father’s Shadow” has been selected as the U.K.’s official Oscar submission for best international feature at the 98th Academy Awards.\n\n\tThe feature debut of Akinola Davies Jr. and from Mubi, Element Pictures and Fatherland Productions, “My Father’s Shadow” — a Yoruba, Naija-Pidgin and English-language film — premiered earlier this year in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard competition, where it became Nigeria’s first title in the festival’s official selection and earned Davies Jr. a Special Mention from the jury. It was chosen to represent the U.K. by a special BAFTA selection committee. \n\t\n\n\tStarring Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù (“Slow Horses,” “Gangs Of London”) and introducing Godwin Egbo and Chibuike Marvellous Egbo, the film spans one day in the life of two young boys traveling with their estranged father from a small village in rural Nigeria to the bustling capital city Lagos. But this journey takes place during the 1993 Nigerian election crisis, a moment of profound historical upheaval and political unrest — when everything is on the verge of change. \n\n\n\tIn Variety‘s review from Cannes, it asserted that”My Father’s Shadow” announced Davies Jr. as a “major cinematic voice.”\n\n\tThe film was shot on location in Lagos and Ibadan, Nigeria by cinematographer Jermaine Edwards, with post-production taking place in London. It was written by Wale Davies and co-written by Akinola Davies Jr., who previously collaborated on “Lizard,” which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance 2021 and received a BAFTA nomination for best British short film. \n\n\t“We are so excited to see the journey of this film unfold and for the film to resonate with audiences,” said the filmmaking team in a statement. “It is a film that is at once intimate and epic. Films open minds and build understanding, bringing different perspectives and experiences from all over the globe to the screen. We are so proud to be telling this Nigerian story and to sit alongside others in the international feature category that curate local to global stories, creating a diversity of storytelling that thrives through the power of collaboration.”\n\t\n\n\t“My Father’s Shadow” is an Element Pictures (a Fremantle Company) production in association with Crybaby and Fatherland Productions. It is produced by Rachel Dargavel for Element Pictures and Funmbi Ogunbanwo for Fatherland Productions. Executive producers are Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe for Element Pictures, Eva Yates for BBC Film, Ama Amapadu for the BFI and Christian Vesper for Fremantle. Dìrísù, Wale Davies and Akinola Davies Jr. also act as executive producers.\n\n\tThe film was developed by BBC Film via Dargavel’s Crybaby, who previously backed Akinola’s short film “Lizard,” and was co-financed by BBC Film and the BFI (awarding National Lottery funding). The Match Factory handled worldwide sales. Mubi owns all rights in North America, U.K., Ireland, and Turkey. \n\n\tAlongside an ongoing festival run, “My Father’s Shadow” was released to critical and commercial success by FilmOne in Nigeria on Sep. 19 and is still playing in theaters there. The U.S. and U.K. releases are set for Feb. 6, 2026, after a limited qualifier in the U.S. \n\n\tThe Oscar international feature shortlist will be announced on Dec. 16 and the final five nominees will be announced on Jan. 22.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmid the mounting concerns over OpenAI’s Sora 2 in the entertainment industry, the estates of Judy Garland, Jimmy Stewart, Burt Reynolds and more late celebrities are being safeguarded in a new likeness and AI protection deal between deepfake detection firm Loti AI and IP management firm CMG Worldwide.\n\n\tUnder the pact, Loti AI’s advanced technology and services will serve to protect CMG’s portfolio of personalities and estates from unauthorized digital use and manipulation, including: Burt Reynolds, Christopher Reeve, Ginger Rogers, Harry Belafonte, Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Raquel Welch, Andre the Giant, Joe Louis, Macho Man Randy Savage, Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, David Ruffin, Albert Einstein, Gen. George Patton, Mark Twain, Neil Armstong and Rosa Parks.\n\t\n\n\tThrough the deal with Loti, CMG says it will gain “continuous monitoring, detection, and takedown capabilities to prevent unauthorized reproductions and impersonations of its clients’ images and voices across digital platforms.” Loti says it “ensures that the world’s most recognized figures are represented with accuracy, consent and respect.”\n\n\tThe deal is a proactive move in the digital rights protection conversation as AI tools like Sora 2, which allows users to create clips using copyrighted IP, make it increasingly easy to develop digital replicas of people who can no longer consent to the use of their likeness.\n\n\t“Each of the personalities we represent has left a lasting mark on culture. Unauthorized digital reproductions not only risk their reputations but also distort history itself,” CMS Worldwide’s Joey Roesler said. “Loti gives us the ability to protect their likenesses and preserve the integrity of the stories and legacies they created.”\n\t\n\n\t“The growing need for technology underscores a new phase in legacy and rights management, as historic estates and modern talent turn to continuous digital protection to defend authenticity, reputation and value in an era of near-limitless content manipulation,” Loti AI CEO Luke Arrigoni said. “We’re proud to work with CMG to protect the likeness and legacy of some of the most well-known and culturally important names across time.”\n\n\tArrigoni added: “This partnership reflects Loti’s commitment to empowering individuals to choose what they share or keep private. As synthetic media becomes more pervasive, these protections are fundamental to preserving trust in the digital world. Families and estates must have the capability to enforce their decisions on how posthumous likeness is used. Protecting the legacy of these icons brings us closer to a future with zero unauthorized content and zero violations of consent across the internet.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCANNES — “The Walking Dead” has many miles to go before the walkers — and everyone else — call it a night. That was the message of the retrospective panel on the franchise at Mipcom to mark the 15th anniversary of the TV series’ premiere on AMC Network.\n\n\tScott Gimple, writer, executive producer and the steward of the “Walking Dead” universe, said the most recent spinoff series, “The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon,” is but one example of the additional material to come from the universe based on the graphic novel series by Robert Kirkman. “Daryl Dixon” bowed in 2023 and was renewed in July for a final fourth season that is in production in Spain.\n\t\n\n\tGimple likened the storytelling possibilities to the intricate canon of stories and characters assembled by DC and Marvel in the comic book realm. “It was all one story. It went in all sorts of different directions,” Gimple said. “Even with characters who have done so many things, we can put them in different worlds where they have different challenges and evolve them through these challenges.”\n\n\n\tThe stars of “Daryl Dixon,” Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride, were on hand for the panel was AMC Networks president Dan McDermott. The 40-minute session was moderated by self-proclaimed superfan Aisha Tyler, who directed four episodes of “The Walking Dead” and has appeared in spinoff series “Fear the Walking Dead.” “The Walking Dead” mothership series ran 11 seasons, concluding in 2022.\n\n\tTyler told the crowd she’s always trumpeted her love of “Walking Dead” even among those who look down their nose at genre fare. “It’s not abut the zombies, it’s about the peple. This is a show asking big questions about what it means to be human,” Tyler said. (That said, there were performers costumed in gory detail as the show’s famous “walkers” lurching around the hallway outside the Grand Auditorium in the Palais des Festivals where the session was held.)\n\t\n\n\tMcDermott echoed Gimple’s faith in the Walking Dead universe’s stamina. “Daryl Dixon” revolves around the story that begins when Reedus’ longtime fan-favorite “Walking Dead” character winds up in France where he encounters an entirely new dynamic among resistance movements et al.\n\n\t“It’s quite possible we could see this group up here 15 years from now,” he said. “There are many more continents to visit. It’s about how [the characters] evolve over time. It’s really exciting to see how far we can take this.” Gimple added that taking “Walking Dead” stalwart characters to new lands such as France and Spain opens up a treasure box of storytelling possibilities. “In a lot of ways, [the locations] give the story to us,” Gimple said.\n\n\tMcBride noted that the emotional tone of “Daryl Dixon” has been markedly different for her character, Carole Peletier, who remains back in the U.S. searching for Daryl. But Peletier endured one tragedy after another during her 11 seasons on “Walking Dead.” \n\n\t“She is a little bit lighter. I like getting to explore that for her. It’s different going to work ehen you can laugh. When carole’s laughing it’s different going to work,” McBride said.\n\n\tTyler pressed Reedus on the physical nature of his job. “I’ve had so many real black eyes on the show that Scott has to write them in the script from time to time,” Reedus said. “I loved shooting Georgia — you were just drenched. It was so humid there. It’s part of the show….It’s very physically demanding. We all care so much about it. It’s just part of the job.”\n\n\tThe panel was introduced by AMC Networks CEO Kristin Dolan. She noted that AMC executives were cautioned back in 2010 when the series premiered on Halloween night that they should have moderate expectations for the ratings. After all, it was a genre thriller, and a zombie apocalypse thriller at that. “We were told it was a niche of a niche,” Dolan said. “It turned out to be quite a niche.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tCartuna has acquired North American distribution rights to “Dog of God,” the animated feature written and directed by Latvian filmmakers Lauris Ābele and Raitis Ābele, following its screening at the Sitges Film Festival. The company will release the film theatrically in 2026.\n\n\t“Dog of God” also reps Latvia in the international Oscar race, and has made the European Film Awards shortlist for best animated feature. Animation may prove to be fruitful for Latvia once again during awards season — earlier this year, “Flow” won an Academy Award for animated feature, Latvia’s first, and it also earned an international feature nomination.\n\t\n\n\tRendered in rotoscope animation, “Dog of God” is a period horror-fantasy set in a 17th century Livonian village. The film follows villagers as a missing relic, witchcraft and a self-proclaimed werewolf called the “Dog of God” upend their fragile order.\n\n\n\tIvo Briedis and Harijs Grundmanis are co-writers on “Dog of God,” which is produced by Kristele Pudane, Raitis Ābele and Giovanni Labadessa. Having premiered at the Tribeca Festival and screened at more than 30 festivals worldwide, including Fantasia and FrightFest, the film has drawn praise for pushing the boundaries of adult animation — described by Variety as “a cult favorite amongst enthusiasts of dark fantasy, graphic novels and genre-stretching absurdist cinema, à la Yorgos Lanthimos.”\n\n\t“’Dog of God’ is one of those films that defies categorization — it’s part parable, part fever dream,” said James Belfer, founder and CEO of Cartuna. “It’s bold, unsettling, and darkly funny in all the best ways. Lauris and Raitis have such a singular vision and we’re thrilled to champion it to audiences who crave something truly new in animation.”\n\t\n\n\tDirector Raitis Abele was equally excited by the partnership, proclaiming, “The distributors I talked to were impressed and afraid. Cartuna was no exception.”\n\n\tCartuna, founded by James and Adam Belfer, champions unconventional voices in animation, producing and distributing projects that push the boundaries of form, tone and technology. Acquisitions this year include “Boys Go to Jupiter,” “Dead Lover” and “Tamala 2030: A Punk Cat in Dark.”\n\n\tThe deal was negotiated by Justyna Koronkiewicz of Media Move on behalf of the filmmakers and James Belfer for Cartuna.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBritish director Julien Temple’s new doc “I Am Curious Johnny,” about industrial heir, photographer, art collector and philanthropist Johnny Pigozzi, is set to world premiere Friday at the Rome Film Festival ahead of its Nov. 3 bow on HBO Max.\n\n\t“I Am Curious Johnny,” the trailer for which Variety can debut exclusively below, follows the French-born Italian heir and CEO of automobile brand Simca, who now lives in Los Angeles. Long before the advent of social media, Pigozzi “invented the selfie” in the ’70s, according to the film’s synopsis, capturing celebrity moments from New York’s Studio 54 to the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills. \n\t\n\n\tThe fun doc features affectionate tributes from Michael Douglas, Martha Stewart, Mick Jagger, Diane von Furstenberg and Graydon Carter, to name a few celebrities the up-until-now elusive Pigozzi has become close with over the past five decades. Pigozzi, incidentally, owns one of the top collections of contemporary African art in the world.\n\n\n\tIn his director’s statement, Pigozzi describes Temple as “an enigma, not unlike a modern-day Mr. Arkadin,” referring to the elusive billionaire in the eponymous Orson Welles film. “Johnny has spent his life escaping from the shadow of his extremely wealthy but cruel and distant father, constantly trying to define who he is through his restless creativity.”\n\n\tThe statement continues: “For over 50 years, he has made an art form out of taking selfies with his friends — the richest and most famous Hollywood and rock stars, socialites, media billionaires and Tech Bros on the planet. A Zelig-like figure, Johnny knows everybody who’s anybody, yet in the context of the wider public, no one knows who he is — until now. It’s a film about wealth and its effects on those who possess it, but also about what to believe and what not to believe about a human being, and humorously explores the potential pitfalls of AI and its ability to hallucinate alternative versions of the truth.”\n\t\n\n\tTemple, a onetime punk-scene enfant terrible, began his career filming the Sex Pistols and turned the footage into the feature films “The Great Rock ‘n’ Roll Swindle” and “The Filth and the Fury.” His more recent work includes “The Eternity Man,” “Oil City Confidential” about British band Dr. Feelgood, “Requiem for Detroit” and his doc about London “The Modern Babylon.”\n\n\t“I Am Curious Johnny” is produced by London-based Jeremy Thomas via his Recorded Picture Company, Temple via his company Nitrate Film and P.J. van Sandwijk at Storyteller Productions.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday turned down an appeal from right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones seeking to overturn the more than $1.4 billio",
    "body": "\n\tThe U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday turned down an appeal from right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones seeking to overturn the more than $1.4 billion judgments ordered against him over his false statements about the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school mass shooting.\n\n\tThe court, as is typical, did not explain its reasoning for denying Jones’ appeal. To date, Jones has not paid any monetary damages to the Sandy Hook families.\n\n\n\tJones and his company, Infowars, filed for bankruptcy after the families of victims in the Sandy Hook mass shooting in Connecticut won judgments in 2022 totaling nearly $1.5 billion against Jones in defamation lawsuits. Jones had repeatedly promoted baseless conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook massacre.\n\t\n\n\tLawyers for Jones, in their appeal filed with the Supreme Court in September, had written, “If this Court allows its decision to stand, it will signal to other courts that the First Amendment’s guarantees for freedom of speech — even vitriolic and hateful speech — can be relaxed if popular sentiment reaches a generalized consensus that the speech offends delicate sensibilities.”\n\n\t“The result is a financial death penalty by fiat imposed on a media defendant whose broadcasts reach millions,” Jones’ filing with the Supreme Court stated.\n\n\tIn December 2012, 20 students and six adults died in the shooting at the school in Newtown, Conn. Families of Sandy Hook victims sued Jones for defamation — and ultimately won the $1.4 billion-plus judgment — after Jones called the mass murder a “hoax” and falsely accused the parents of the children killed at the elementary school of colluding with the U.S. government in a supposed plot to restrict gun rights. During the defamation trial in Texas, Jones testified that he now believes the Sandy Hook shooting was “100% real.”\n\t\n\n\tJones, who is banned from most major internet platforms over hate-speech and harassment violations, was reinstated on X by owned Elon Musk in 2023. “I vehemently disagree with what [Jones] said about Sandy Hook, but are we a platform that believes in freedom of speech or are we not?” Musk wrote in December 2023 explaining the decision.\n\n\tThis past August, a federal judge ordered that Infowars parent, Free Speech Systems, be turned over to a court-appointed receiver to oversee the sale of the company’s assets, as reported by CNN. In a bankruptcy auction last year, satire website The Onion had submitted the winning bid to acquire the assets of Infowars; however, a judge in December 2024 blocked The Onion’s deal, saying the auction process lacked clarity and that the families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims deserved more money than The Onion’s $1.75 million bid (despite the families signing off on the sale).\n",

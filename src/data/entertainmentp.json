    "body": "\n\tLuhki Herwanayogi, whose short film “On Friday Noon” screened at Locarno Film Festival Open Doors in 2020 and who received the 2021 Locarno Open Doors Award, has his feature debut “Our Son” selected for the JAFF Future Project as a work-in-progress, about two childless married couples who raise a son from an illicit affair between the households.\n\n\tThe Indonesia production, directed by Herwanayogi and produced by Iqbal Mohammad Hamdan through production company Catchlight Pictures, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The project won the Purin Award for best project from Southeast Asia at Busan Asian Film School Pitching Project in 2019.\n\t\n\n\t“Our Son” follows Lita, a 27-year-old bank employee who reunites with her ex-lover Sandi, a 29-year-old furniture entrepreneur, after years of separation. Their relationship becomes close again when Lita asks Sandi to furnish her new home. Sandi frequently visits and meets Lita’s husband Bob, who works as a mining employee. Sandi invites his wife Eli to visit Lita’s house. Both families face pressure from relatives to have children, which brings them closer, especially Lita and Eli.\n\n\n\tLita becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son named Aryo. Sandi and Eli often help take care of Aryo as Lita and Bob are busy with work. Several years later, Aryo falls ill and requires a blood transfusion. However, Lita and Bob’s blood types are not compatible with Aryo’s, but Sandi’s blood type is a match — unveiling the secret that Aryo is Sandi and Lita’s child.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Our Son’ explores the issues present in many Indonesian families — about social pressures that give rise to new problems,” Herwanayogi says. “Unfortunately, these matters are often left unspoken, buried, and eventually become a pile of generational issues. For me, it is important to unravel these layers and talk about them through the medium I know best: film.”\n\n\tThe director wants to convey a message about judgment and personal choice. “That every person carries their own problems and their own choices in life, and we have no right to judge them,” he says.\n\n\tProducer Hamdan emphasized their long collaboration and the project’s market potential. “Luhki and I have been working together for more than 15 years, and I’ve produced almost all of his short films and commercial portfolios,” he says. “I trust his strong directorial vision and his professionalism — both essential qualities as we step into the industry with this debut feature.”\n\n\tHamdan believes the film has strong commercial potential. “I also believe that ‘Our Son’ carries a universal theme while remaining highly relevant to local audiences,” he says. “This combination gives me confidence that the film has strong potential to succeed in both domestic and international markets.”\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the team seeks post-production support and distribution partners. “We hope to find partners to support our post-production – especially grading, music, and sound,” the filmmakers say. “We’re also looking for investors who can help strengthen our marketing and have strong connections with domestic exhibitors, as well as festivals and international sales agents for global distribution.”\n\n\tJAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChris C.F’s observational documentary “Aluk,” which follows three generations of a family in Tana Toraja, Indonesia over seven years as they reckon with the loss of their patriarch and their community’s uncertain future, is selected for the JAFF Future Project as a work-in-progress.\n\n\tThe Australia-Indonesia co-production, directed by Chris C.F and produced by Sam Hewison and Wahyu Al Mardhani through production company Cut By Dog Production, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“Aluk” follows four members of a Tana Toraja family: Ne’ Minda, the grandfather; Ma’ Adel, the mother; Pong Kenny, the uncle; and Marsel, the son. The film traces Marsel’s childhood over seven years, as his grandfather reveals his ancestors’ way of life — Aluk To Dolo, one grounded in the maintenance of environmental equilibrium.\n\n\n\tNe’ Minda demonstrates how these practices inform the functioning of their tight knit community — one of the last remaining villages where Aluk To Dolo is still observed in Tana Toraja. The transformations their community face are numerous: a majority of the region’s population has converted to Christianity, many young people have left to seek prosperity on neighboring islands, and climate change is already taking a toll on local agricultural production.\n\n\tThe stories of Marsel’s mother and uncle delineate two paths taken by their generation — to remain in the village or to leave, and the sacrifices each path requires. An immersive exploration of labor, love and loss, the film culminates in the death of Ne’ Minda, as the family reckons with the loss of their patriarch.\n\t\n\n\tFor Chris C.F, the project began with research into how people approach death around the world. “My interest in this arguably morbid topic wasn’t born from a desire to be confronted with, or to confront others with sensational images of dead bodies,” the director says. “My fascination with the way we process death originated at the open casket funeral of my grandfather.”\n\n\tThe director’s grandfather was liberated from German concentration camps and escaped communist Poland to start a new life in Australia. “It was the first time I’d been faced with the physical reality of death,” he says. “In Australia, it’s a realm confined almost entirely to medical professionals, industrialized and sanitized. That period of time spent with his lifeless body had a profound and lasting impact on me. Toraja is a place where people actively elongate these periods spent alongside loved ones passed, and celebrate their lives in the most festive of ways.”\n\n\tChris C.F traveled to Toraja for the first time in 2017 with producer Sam Hewison and cinematographer John Hewison, meeting Ne’ Minda at a funeral. “Unlike most people we met in Toraja who had converted to Christianity, he was an adherent of Aluk To Dolo,” the director says. Ne’ Minda invited them to his home to film a ritual for a new rice barn, and they met his daughter Ma’ Adel and her children.\n\n\tThe team returned in 2019 for two months, meeting filmmakers Wahyu Al Mardhani and Tasya Amaliah from Makassar, who became close collaborators. COVID-19 closed international borders, pausing work on the project until 2022. The crew returned for another two months in 2022, and Chris C.F returned alone in 2023 to continue work with Wahyu, staying with Ne’ Minda — which was sadly the last time they saw him.\n\n\tNe’ Minda passed away at the end of 2023. The family invited the team to attend his funeral in early 2024 and encouraged them to continue filming. “We feel incredibly privileged to have been invited into the lives of Ne’ Minda and his family, and to have had the opportunity to create such strong bonds with them over a period of eight years,” the director says.\n\n\t“‘Aluk’ will be both an ode to Ne’ Minda, who passed away unexpectedly but peacefully at the end of 2023, as well as an immersive exploration of his community’s devotion to their land and those who came before them,” Chris C.F says. “‘Aluk’ will not lean on the mystical or magical, instead focusing on the significance of everyday labor and interaction, on Toraja symbols and their deep connotations, on its sounds and rapturous harmonies, and on the human relationships which keep us afloat in the face of hardship and loss — it’s a film about love.”\n\t\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the team hopes to meet potential collaborators. “We are incredibly excited to meet Indonesian producers that we’ve admired for so long, as well as producers and distributors internationally who might help carve new paths for the film,” the filmmakers say.\n\n\tJAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetanya Yemima, whose short film “The Most Handsome Fish on Earth” premiered at the 20th Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival last year, has her feature directorial debut “To My Dearest, My Dear…” selected for the JAFF Future Project, a time-travel drama about a dying father who leaps into the future to meet the daughter he’ll never live to see.\n\n\tThe Indonesia production, directed by Yemima and produced by Bela Nabila and Bayu Arief, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The project previously participated in Jakarta Film Week Producers Lab 2024 and Platform Busan 2025.\n\t\n\n\t“To My Dearest, My Dear…” follows Adam, a soon-to-be father diagnosed with cancer in 2008 who braces for the end. Until one day, he discovers a way to travel through time. Seizing the chance, he leaps into the future to meet Nadia, the daughter he never lived to see.\n\n\n\tAdam keeps traveling through time to make sure his wife Marsha and Nadia live the future he once dreamed of — even without him in it. But when he visits Nadia at 16, he finds their bond broken and Marsha on the verge of marrying someone new. Desperate to understand what went wrong, Adam grows closer to Nadia. Together, they embark on a whirlwind mission to disrupt Marsha’s new relationship while discovering the fragile, exciting and unexpected bond between a father and daughter who were never meant to meet.\n\n\t“When Bela approached me with the idea for ‘To My Dearest, My Dear…’, I immediately fell in love with it,” Yemima says. “I think it’s a father–daughter story that can be told in a very unique and compelling way. We had lengthy discussions after that, sharing our feelings and our personal relationships with our dads. As we developed the story, we realized that our different backgrounds could enrich it even more and make it resonate universally.”\n\t\n\n\tWhat started as an exploration of time travel and a father-daughter relationship has evolved into something deeply personal. “It’s a story I simply couldn’t resist,” she says.\n\n\tThe director wants to explore the theme of unfailing love. “I reflected a lot on how time and life move so fast. It’s a little frightening that as time flies, nothing stays the same,” Yemima says. “But love, love might stay, and that’s beautiful. Through this film, I want to talk about the theme of unfailing love. It’s about a love that endures even when life, illness, or time itself pulls people apart. A love that gives strength, just as it does for our main character Adam, whose love for his family transcends life and death.”\n\n\tProducer Nabila, who also co-wrote the screenplay, emphasized the personal resonance of the project. “Our feature film debut carries deep sentimental value for both Netanya and me, not only as creators, but as daughters,” she says. “Even though Netanya and I come from very different father–daughter dynamics, that contrast actually became an advantage. It opened up a richer perspective in shaping Adam and Nadia, allowing us to build their relationship with more nuance, empathy, and emotional truth.”\n\n\tThis marks the sixth collaboration between Yemima and Nabila. “In our previous short film, ‘The Most Handsome Fish on Earth,’ her craftsmanship really shone,” Nabila says. “She has the ability to balance something serious with a lighthearted touch, while still delivering an emotional experience that resonates with audiences.”\n\n\tProducer Arief sees the film as a refreshing alternative in the Indonesian market. “In today’s Indonesian market, where horror films dominate, a heartfelt story like this would offer a genuinely refreshing alternative for audiences,” he says. “With the growing diversity of genres in Indonesian cinema especially films that incorporate a hint of fantasy and a thoughtful exploration of the genre, I believe our film can enter this expanding segment of the industry and contribute to the exploration of new directions in storytelling.”\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the team hopes to connect with potential investors, Indonesian production companies and international distributors. “JAFF Future Project gives us the kind of space we’ve been looking for: a place where potential investors, Indonesian production companies, and even international distributors can really engage with the project,” Nabila says. “We’re hoping they’ll feel what we feel, and believe in the story as much as we do.”\n\t\n\n\tYemima’s previous short films include “Sunat Racing,” funded by Jakarta Film Week, and “Rumah Kuta Kita,” which won best film at Semester Pendek 2021. “The Most Handsome Fish on Earth” was developed at LOCK x Full Circle Lab 2023 and received funding from Layar Indonesiana.\n\n\tJAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPraveen Morchhale‘s latest feature “White Snow” follows a mother’s arduous trek through Kashmir’s Himalayan peaks to screen her son’s banned film, marking the director’s continued exploration of artistic suppression and human resilience.\n\n\tThe Urdu-language drama, produced by Barefoot Pictures with co-production from France’s Woooz Pictures and associate producers from Germany and Canada, made its world premiere at the Sao Paulo International Film Festival before screening at the International Film Festival of India in Goa. The film is currently playing at the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, of which the industry component is the JAFF Market.\n\t\n\n\t“White Snow” centers on Fatima, whose filmmaker son Amir sees his work banned after its first community screening following complaints from religious authorities. The film’s transgression: depicting post-partum blood after childbirth. When Amir is arrested on charges of attempting to create social unrest, Fatima embarks on a perilous journey with an old cathode-ray tube television and DVD player loaded onto a yak, determined to screen the film in remote villages.\n\n\n\tThe production represents an international collaboration, with India, France, Germany and Canada as countries of origin. Mohammad Reza Jahan Panah served as cinematographer, with Anthony Joseph handling editing duties. The cast includes Madhu Kandhari as Fatima, Bhavya Khurana as Ameer, and Noor as Kaneez Fatima.\n\n\tMorchhale explains that quietness should not be mistaken for passive surrender. “I wanted to explore the profound political power of silence and personal resolve against the oppression of freedom of expression,” he tells Variety. “A mother’s journey is rooted in resistance and love. She does not shout slogans. It becomes subversive precisely because it insists on dignity and freedom of expression in a place and system that thrives on silencing and erasure.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director believes small gestures often hold the deepest rebellion. “A mother carrying a banned film silently is a moral force and an act of resistance, I believe it is more enduring than any public outcry,” Morchhale says. “I am drawn to characters who do not shout, but who quietly challenge out of love as well as to preserve what is fundamentally important for their survival.”\n\n\tMorchhale drew inspiration from a real incident involving an Indian first-time filmmaker whose simple short film about his mother giving birth to him during a snowy night in a taxi was banned for similar reasons. What struck the director most about the real case was how the censorship was implemented. “It was not just the injustice he faced, but how quietly and gradually it was imposed,” Morchhale says. “A slow and calculated action to remove his film from the public sphere and destroy the creative desire of an artist was very hurting and disturbing.”\n\n\tHe notes a troubling trend beyond overt censorship. “I was disturbed and struck by the fear that surrounded artists like him everywhere in the world,” Morchhale observes. “This atmosphere of invisible suffocation is more chilling than overt censorship. Today’s repression often operates not with bans, but through fear, silence, fringe elements and the slow erasure of opportunities.”\n\n\tThe film’s central image of Fatima carrying a cathode-ray television on a yak across the Himalayas operates on multiple levels. “From the very first visual thought of the film, I saw this journey not just as an event or narrative, but as a poetic contradiction,” Morchhale says. “A fragile outdated TV being carried across one of the world’s most enduring landscapes on a yak back becomes a living metaphor.”\n\n\tFor the director, Fatima’s act transcends simple storytelling. “Fatima’s act is also about preserving a memory no one else wants to carry,” he explains. “The yak moves slowly and steady like truth trying to make its way across a disinterested world. The cathode-ray TV irrelevant to modern-day holds a forbidden story and in that, it becomes a symbol of resistance, defiance, and determination.”\n\n\tMorchhale connects this imagery to the current state of cinema itself. “In a way, cinema today lives under the shadow of fear of disappearance,” he notes. “In the early days of its evolution, cinema journeyed to people. But now, we have arrived at a point where audiences no longer come to the cinema hall. The yak in White Snow becomes a symbol of all of us — the filmmakers and the exhibitors who must carry cinema back to the people.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director approached the material with minimal dialogue, instead relying on visual storytelling. “I have always felt that silence is the most honest dialogue and not a weakness,” Morchhale says. “Silence never lies. In ‘White Snow,’ silence became the heartbeat of the film.”\n\n\tWorking with cinematographer Mohammad Reza Jahan Panah, the team constructed what Morchhale calls a visual rhythm. “We used natural light and long takes to create a contemplative space, where emotion could be felt without being explicitly forced,” he explains. “The landscape speaks as a character, the light and its subtle shifts reveal feelings and hurt more than words could.”\n\n\tThe film’s pacing deliberately creates space for audience engagement. “Even the pauses between movement, or the stillness after an action are full of meanings,” Morchhale notes. “In silence, the audience is not directed what to feel. I want them to enter and travel with the life and moment of the characters. And for this togetherness and intimacy, it was imperative to have stillness and pauses so even a small walking sound or heartbeat can be felt as our own.”\n\n\tFilming in Kashmir’s remote mountain regions presented significant logistical and creative challenges. “Mountain and nature make us realise that we do not control anything,” Morchhale recalls. “The hardest days came when we were filming at high altitude in a remote valley. And these days were endless. The yak, crew, and equipment had to be moved. Aligning ourselves and our visual language with landscape and natural lights was the toughest challenge.”\n\n\tThe environment shaped not just the production but the film’s final form. “These moments taught me something very essential, that we are not in control, and cinema, at least the kind I believe in, must surrender to the natural world,” Morchhale says. “The landscape forced me to rethink pacing and structure. Landscape humbled us, and in that humility, I think the film found its honesty. Film became truthful.”\n\n\tThe film’s title carries particular significance for Morchhale, who describes “White Snow” as reflecting the fragility of memory. “The idea of memory as something delicate like snow that melts when touched but never disappear guided our visual choices,” he explains.\n\n\tThis conceptual framework influenced specific cinematographic decisions. “We framed our characters often at a distance, letting the surroundings dwarf them, emphasising how memory is often swallowed by time and silence,” Morchhale says. “Reflections in mirrors and water distort like a fading memory. We avoided melodrama and let moments linger and dissolve. The light was never overly dramatic like of drifting in memory.”\n\t\n\n\tThroughout Fatima’s journey, she encounters people who attempt to help but face their own limitations in screening the film. “Because real life is rarely about heroes and villains,” Morchhale explains. “In oppressive systems, most people are afraid and submissive. They resign and leave things to fate and become slaves of routine.”\n\n\tThe director chose to portray this systemic helplessness deliberately. “Fatima meets in her journey people who care, who wish things were different, but who also feel powerless to act,” he says. “I wanted to show that silence is often a survival tactic also and not always complicity. This kind of helplessness is more tragic than hatred, because it means even goodness is paralysed.”\n\n\tThe real-life case that inspired the film involved religious leaders objecting to the depiction of postpartum blood. “Censorship is rarely about morality, it is about control,” Morchhale observes. “When a religious leader deems postpartum blood obscene and an official believes it may create revolution, they are not protecting modesty or national interest, they are denying dignity, freedom, and truth.”\n\n\tFor the director, such cases reveal deeper power dynamics. “The act of giving birth becomes offensive only when power fears its own fragility,” he says. “All kinds of censorship fear truth not because it is provocative, but because it cannot be manipulated. Manipulation of emotions is only possible with lies. The most ordinary truth in life — a wound, a cry, postpartum blood — becomes dangerous symbols in such a climate. It shows us how fragile the power system truly is, if a single drop of blood can make it uneasy.”\n\n\tThe film arrives as cinema faces increasing scrutiny and pressure in many regimes. “The air is thick with fear now around the world,” Morchhale says. “Artists feel it even in conversations. I did not begin ‘White Snow’ to make a direct political and religious critique, but I could not avoid the climate we are living in.”\n\n\tHe describes how contemporary anxieties seeped into the film’s texture. “The story came to me, but it brought with it echoes of many real-life incidences I have seen or read about — filmmakers threatened, writers silenced, viewers afraid to speak openly,” Morchhale explains. “All these seeped into the characters in ‘White Snow.’ Their hesitation, their need to whisper, their glances before speaking, all I have seen.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s international co-production structure proved essential to its realization. “The international support was very important in the journey of ‘White Snow,'” Morchhale says. “These partners believed in artistic freedom, in my kind of cinema I wanted to create. They never asked me to explain the pacing or the creative decision. That trust gave me freedom.”\n\n\tThe backing enabled specific creative choices. “We were able to take our time to shoot in remote locations,” he notes. “Their contribution enabled the film to be more honest and meditative.”\n\n\tProducers on “White Snow” include Morchhale alongside Jeremie Palanque and Anja Wendell. Additional associate producers include Hecat Studio (France), Anja Wendell (Germany) and Judy Gladstone (Canada).\n\n\tThe physical and emotional toll of the trek gradually affects Fatima’s mental state, with the narrative building toward what Morchhale describes as a transformative conclusion. “I imagined Fatima’s character with respect and dignity,” the director says. “Her descent into hallucination is not madness in the clinical sense, it is a culmination of grief, fatigue, and isolation.”\n\n\tOne particular scene crystallizes this approach. “For example, her one scene in final act projecting the son’s film to her yak is both absurd and sublime,” Morchhale notes. “It is her attempt to reclaim her son’s voice in a world that refused to listen. We allowed her silence to fill the screen with her pain. That restraint was my way of honouring her pain without turning it into spectacle.”\n\n\tThe film concludes with understated power. “And in the last scene, she stands tall and quiet on a bridge over a gusty roaring river as a symbol of her victory and ready to face the repercussion,” Morchhale says. “She does not pronounce her victory aloud and celebrate.”\n\n\tMorchhale, whose previous features “Widow of Silence” (2018) and “Walking With The Wind” (2017) screened at festivals including Rotterdam, Busan, Sao Paulo and Hamburg, earned National Awards of India recognition in 2018 along with a UNESCO-Gandhi Medal Award. His 2018 Busan International Film Festival selection earned a Kim Ji-seok Award nomination, establishing him as a distinctive voice in contemplative Indian cinema.\n\n\t“Walking With The Wind” received the ICFTT-UNESCO Gandhi Medal and National Film Awards recognition, while “Widow of Silence” earned the Jury Award at Belgium’s Mooov Film Festival. His most recent feature, “Behind Veils” (2023), took home the INALCO Jury Award at France’s Vesoul Asian Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tThe director positions “White Snow” as a continuation of his artistic journey. “‘White Snow’ is the continuation and perhaps the further refinement of everything I have been working toward,” Morchhale says. “In my earlier films, I was still trying how to listen to silence, how to believe in stillness. With ‘White Snow,’ I felt I am ready to strip away even more, further getting closer to minimalism.”\n\n\tHe describes the film using literary terms. “I wanted the film to feel like a haiku where words are short but infinite in resonance and meaning,” Morchhale explains. “I want to leave the audience to resonate with images and meaning without guiding them. For me, ‘White Snow’ is the most inward personal journey I have made, and also the most universal.”\n\n\tMaintaining artistic integrity remains central to his practice. “I make films that are fearlessly independent and honest,” Morchhale states. “I protect my integrity by resisting the pressure to entertain at the cost of honesty. Integrity, to me, means telling the truthful story that I strongly believe in.”\n\n\tHe acknowledges the commercial challenges of his approach. “I do not follow trends, markets, or provocations,” the director says. “I am fully aware that I may not reach millions of audience, but if my work touches a few persons deeply, it is enough. It’s not always easy, but it is the only path that feels meaningful to me.”\n\n\tWith “White Snow,” Morchhale continues his exploration of marginalized voices and social injustice through visually poetic narratives. The film’s international co-production structure reflects growing cross-border collaboration in independent Asian cinema, particularly for projects addressing sensitive political and cultural subjects.\n\n\tMusic comes from Nalin Vinayak, with costume design by Ravi Sataliya and production design by Akhilesh Dogne. Sound design was handled by Hossein Mashali and Omid Mohammadipour.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChina’s theatrical market is losing younger audiences while Vietnam emerges as a breakout territory for pan-Asian content, according to industry executives speaking at the JAFF Market.\n\n\tEric Lin, general manager of international content at Alibaba‘s Damai Entertainment, revealed that Chinese audiences under 24 now represent only 15% of total moviegoers, down from 38% before the pandemic. “We’re losing half of them in five or six years,” Lin said, noting that core frequent audiences have shifted to the 30-49 age bracket. While the year saw “Ne Zha 2” generate more that $2 billion at the box office, the market struggles to retain younger demographics competing with short-form vertical content AKA microdramas. \n\t\n\n\tVietnam has established itself as a crucial territory for Asian films, with Phong Duong, business director at Mockingbird Pictures, presenting market data showing Vietnamese title “Red Rain” generated more than $27 million, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the territory. \n\n\n\tThe panel, moderated by JAFF Market advisor Lorna Tee and presented in partnership with Indonesian producers’ association APROFI, brought together Duong, Lin, Nelson Mok, CEO of Mokster Films, and Shiori Takata, director of international production at Toei. Indonesia’s theatrical market has demonstrated strength with local films capturing over 65% of box office share.\n\n\tMok, whose company handled international sales for “How To Make a Million Before Grandma Dies” and the Taiwanese version of “More Than Blue,” emphasized theatrical-focused distribution strategies. “The similarity between the two films is a when we first bring it to the market, nobody wanted the films,” Mok revealed. “Everybody rejected the movies because it didn’t fit into any sort of computation of what distributor had in mind as a commercial film.” \n\t\n\n\tTakata noted Japan’s domestic market faces challenges with animation comprising 80-90% of content, leaving limited space for live-action films. Toei launched its international production division in 2023, targeting Southeast Asian partnerships in the $1 million to $2.5 million budget range. Multiple panelists stressed production quality’s importance for attracting international buyers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrandi Carlile, Charlie Puth and Coco Jones will be the pregame entertainment for Super Bowl LX, the NFL announced on Sunday. The big game will take place at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, and air live on NBC, Telemundo and Peacock.\n\n\tThe NFL previously announced that Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny will headline the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show, produced by DPS with Roc Nation and Jesse Collins serving as executive producers. \n\t\n\n\tThe Super Bowl pregame entertainment will spotlight powerful American Sign Language (ASL) performances. Renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam will perform the National Anthem and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and Deaf music performer Julian Ortiz will deliver “America the Beautiful.” \n\n\n\tIn a historic first, the signed rendition of the Apple Music Halftime Show will feature a multilingual signing program incorporating Puerto Rican Sign Language, led by Deaf Puerto Rican performer Celimar Rivera Cosme. \n\n\tAll signed performances for the Super Bowl pregame and the Apple Music Halftime Show are collaborations with Alexis Kashar of Love Sign and Howard Rosenblum of Deaf Equality. \n\n\t“Super Bowl Sunday is the world’s biggest entertainment stage, and we’re proud to spotlight artists who embody the very best of music and culture,” said Jon Barker, senior vice president of global event production for the NFL. “Beyond the game itself, the Super Bowl is a global celebration. These artists bring a distinct voice to the moment, helping set the tone for a day that will captivate fans around the world.” \n\t\n\n\t“Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them – alongside our extraordinary deaf performers – on Super Bowl LX’s world stage,” stated Desiree Perez, CEO, Roc Nation. “This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.” \n\n\tCarlile will perform “America the Beautiful.” Carlile is an Oscar nominee, an 11-time Grammy-winner and 2-time Emmy-winner whose latest solo album is “Returning To Myself.” It follows her collaboration with Elton John, “Who Believes in Angels?,” which recently earned a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.\n\n\tGrammy-nominated singer, songwriter and producer Charlie Puth will perform the National Anthem. His performance comes ahead of the release of his highly anticipated fourth studio album, “Whatever’s Clever!”, set for March 6, 2026.  \n\n\t“Lift Every Voice and Sing” will be performed by Grammy-winning R&B star Coco Jones. A multifaceted entertainer and actress, Jones currently stars in Peacock’s “Bel-Air.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatta Cinema Production and Ruang Basbeth Bercerita have commenced principal photography on “My Own Last Supper,” a Chinese-Indonesian family drama helmed by Ismail Basbeth, whose previous feature “Sara” had its world premiere at Busan in 2023.\n\n\tThe feature, introduced at Busan’s Asian Content & Film Market in September, kicked off its 15-day shoot on Nov. 27 during the ongoing Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival and JAFF Market.\n\t\n\n\tThe narrative centers on Encek, a 76-year-old widower who convenes his children for a final dinner, unveiling concealed memoirs of love, loss and generational wounds before choosing the sea as his reunion place with his deceased wife. The story examines the pursuit of life and identity through the lens of a Chinese-Indonesian family across three pivotal periods: the 1960s, 1970s and 1998, addressing unresolved national trauma and historical violence through intimate personal narratives.\n\n\n\tThe production is employing a realistic approach with detailed artistic elements to authentically recreate four distinct time periods — 1960, 1970, 1998 and 2017 — ranging from modest business premises to residential interiors. Senior production designer Ong Hari Wahyu leads the visual design alongside art director Edy Wibowo, who won at the Bandung Film Festival 2025. The creative team also includes Indonesian Film Festival award-winning costume designer Retno Damayanti and makeup artist Faradila.\n\n\tNicholas Anderson portrays the young Encek, with Jessy Davita as young Encim. During JAFF Market 2025, the cast made a promotional appearance, distributing red-wrapped tamarind candies to visitors — a symbolic token of love featured in the film.\n\t\n\n\tThe project reunites Basbeth with director of photography, Satria Kurnianto. \n\n\tProducer Chakalica Widyadipraja of Matta Cinema Production is targeting a 2026 release for the feature.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains very light spoilers from Season 2, Episode 3 of “Landman,” “Almost a Home,” which premiered Sunday, Nov. 30, on Paramount+.\n\n\tAndy Garcia made his “Landman” debut as Gallino in the Season 1 finale, introduced as a cartel boss who spared the life of Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) and menacingly assured him they would be business partners soon … and maybe even friends! Their reintroduction came quickly, once Tommy learned that Cooper (Jacob Lofland) signed a huge oil partnership with Gallino’s investment firm, which led to a heated standoff — as well as drinks at the Cattlemen’s Club — between the two on this week’s episode.\n\t\n\n\tDespite their onscreen friction, Garcia says working alongside his old friend Thornton makes the “Landman” set feel like home.\n\n\n\t“I was embraced first of all by Billy, who’s the most generous,” Garcia says. “There’s a mutual respect there. We already had a friendship from acquaintances over the years, and so it was walking into a place where you felt you already belonged. There’s a bonding that happens with actors: You have to rely on each other to do the best work, because your best work comes from the people in front of you. That’s where you pull it from.”\n\n\tAdditionally, Garcia says the role fit him like a glove because the show’s co-creator, Taylor Sheridan, developed it for him.\n\n\t“When he approached me, he hadn’t written the part yet,” Garcia says. “He met with me and said, ‘I’d like to create this part for you.’ He was a fan of a movie I did many years ago called ‘Eight Million Ways to Die,’ and I played this crazy young drug guy, and he killed people. Not so much like Gallino, but maybe it’s Gallino when he was 18. I think he writes to people. He said to Billy Bob, ‘I’m going to write this character in your voice.’ He wrote Sam Elliott’s character in this thing in Sam’s voice. I think he understood it based on the work he had seen me do over the years, and what he had felt was my voice, my persona.”\n\t\n\n\tGarcia says his real life even helped to shape Gallino’s backstory.\n\n\t“I said, ‘Who’s this guy?’ And he said, ‘He’s a cartel leader in the Permian Basin,'” Garcia says. “And I said, ‘There’s a cartel in the Permian Basin? Is he a local kid? Is he Mexican?’ And he just said, ‘It’s you.’ So immediately that located me as saying, ‘Okay, who is the person as close to who I am, where I’m from?’ And I said, ‘My character is from the Caribbean.’ In my own mind, I’m saying, ‘He got to the Permian Basin because he’s the guy who has access to where the source is, where the product is coming from, because of his access to the Caribbean, South America. Maybe he grew up in Miami, but he ended up in Fort Worth because it was virgin territory to explore. But he’s not a local kid. He’s local now. And he always said, ‘Your character is integrated into society, and he’s living under the radar there.’ That’s all he said.”\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Jokers Films has acquired French distribution rights to Barunson E&A’s “The World of Love,” the top-grossing independent Korean film at the 2025 local box office.\n\n\tThe acquisition deal was negotiated between Manuel Chiche, founder of The Jokers Films and head of Asian acquisitions, and Sylvie Kim, head of international business at Barunson E&A.\n\n\tThe feature surpassed 150,000 admissions in Korea as of Nov. 30.\n\n\n\tDirected by Yoon Ga-eun, acclaimed for “The World of Us” (Berlinale 2016) and “The House of Us” (BFI London 2019), the drama centers on 17-year-old Lee Jooin (Seo Su-bin), an unpredictable high school student whose angry outburst creates ripple effects throughout her world.\n\t\n\n\tThe title has gained traction on the festival circuit, world premiering at Toronto’s Platform competition and collecting jury and audience awards at Pingyao International Film Festival’s Crouching Tigers section, along with the Fipresci Award at the Warsaw Film Festival. The film recently played at the Cork International Film Festival’s Momentum section.\n\n\tThe film recently won the Montgolfière d’Or, the top prize in the international competition section, at the 47th Nantes 3 Continents Film Festival. Previous recipients of the honor include “Hanami” (2024), “The Shadowless Tower” (2023), “Glorious Ashes” (2022), and “Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy” (2021).\n\n\tThe festival jury praised the film for exploring a universally denied subject with depth, tenderness and sensitivity. “Through rich and complex characters who have the courage to refuse to be confined by an imposed narrative, the film tackles a taboo subject without ever looking away, always celebrating life and love above all else,” the jury stated. “For its richness, its power, and its ability to make us think, ‘The World of Love’ receives the Montgolfière d’or.”\n\t\n\n\tFounded in 2014 by Chiche and Violaine Barbaroux, The Jokers Films has built a reputation for handling acclaimed international cinema. The company’s slate includes Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite,” Park Chan-wook’s “The Handmaiden,” Wong Kar Wai’s “2046” and Nicolas Winding Refn’s “The Neon Demon.”\n\n\t“The Jokers are very proud to be the French distributor of ‘The World of Love.’ On a personal note I haven’t been so moved and enthusiastic about a Korean movie since some time,” said Chiche. “Yoon Ga-eun is a brilliant director and some sequences (especially the car wash scene) are absolutely fantastic. Being able to see this kind of talent is the ultimate reason why we are doing this job. We are very thankful to Barunson E&A for their trust.”\n\n\t“The World of Love” is currently playing at the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, which also includes the JAFF Market, and is next at the Red Sea Film Festival. \n",

    "body": "\n\tVirtue Asia has partnered with Goldfinch International to establish V47 Entertainment, a new studio that will create branded entertainment content for distribution across Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. \n\n\tThe Singapore-based studio plans to develop feature films, television series, short-form digital content and other entertainment formats that integrate brand partnerships at the development stage. Goldfinch International handles the Global South financing and production operations for Goldfinch Group, which is headquartered in the U.K.\n\t\n\n\tThe studio’s operations will touch multiple sectors of the entertainment industry, including music, gaming, film, television, live events and digital creator content. \n\n\n\tSeveral projects are already moving through development ahead of a formal slate announcement planned for the first quarter of 2026. The initial lineup encompasses two documentary series, a live event series, a short-form microdrama, a competition format and an animated series.\n\n\tLooking beyond its first development cycle, V47 has outlined plans for a branded entertainment investment fund and an accelerator program designed to convert corporate marketing budgets into entertainment assets with multi-territory distribution potential.\n\n\tThe company name derives from “Vault47,” with the vault concept signaling the studio’s focus on intellectual property management and the number 47 referencing the approximate count of Asian countries and territories where V47 intends to operate.\n\n\t“As we look into 2026, the creative industry is being reshaped by a simple truth: culture leads brands,” said Lesley John, CEO of Virtue Asia. “Audiences no longer want brands to interrupt culture, they want them to actively contribute to it. With V47, we’re giving brands the ability to build signature entertainment properties – worlds, stories, and cultural experiences that audiences choose to spend time with. As AI automates the functional layers of marketing, entertainment becomes the next frontier for brand relevance.”\n\t\n\n\tThe new entity combines Virtue’s expertise in developing brand strategies with Goldfinch’s experience structuring entertainment financing deals. By concentrating on Asian and Middle Eastern territories, V47 is betting on markets where cultural exports are gaining global traction.\n\n\t“Asia is now shaping what the world wants next, reversing decades of west-to-east cultural flow, and brands operating here have an unprecedented opportunity to lead global culture from this region,” John said. “V47 allows brands to build cultural capital where influence is accelerating the fastest.”\n\n\tThe business model represents a departure from conventional product placement deals. Instead of attaching brand messaging to completed projects, V47 will involve corporate partners during the creative development process. \n\n\tPhil McKenzie, COO and co-founder of Goldfinch, said the approach creates more authentic integration. “V47 blends culture, capital and creativity in a way the industry hasn’t seen. It combines the parts of the market we’re most excited about, the rise of the Global South, new financing models, and deeper collaboration with brands,” said McKenzie. “By engineering marketing, storytelling and distribution together from day one, and building content hand-in-glove with brands, we’re generating IP with scale and monetization baked in, creating real strategic and commercial upside for every partner involved.”\n\n\tJustin Deimen, founding partner at Goldfinch International, positioned the venture as part of a broader industry evolution. “Goldfinch has long believed that the next generation of global entertainment will be driven by new partnership models and new centres of cultural gravity,” said Deimen. “V47 embodies that shift. By combining Goldfinch’s financing and production engine with Virtue’s cultural insights and brand relationships, we’re creating a platform where brands can participate meaningfully in storytelling that travels, endures, and resonates.”\n\n\tDavid Webster serves as chair of V47 Entertainment. “V47 is built on a simple conviction: brands have a far bigger role to play in shaping culture than the traditional advertising model allows,” Webster said. “This venture gives brands a seat at the creative table, not as sponsors, but as partners in the development of film, series, formats, and cultural IP. It’s a model built for the markets defining what global culture will look like next.”\n\t\n\n\tVirtue Asia is a strategic and creative agency focused on building brands inside culture. The firm’s roster includes Disney, Google, Spotify, Toyota, Diageo and Shiseido. \n\n\tGoldfinch International was founded by McKenzie, Kirsty Bell, Deimen and Fadi Ismail. The division extends Goldfinch Group’s business model into Asian, Middle Eastern and African markets. The parent organization has backed more than 300 film and television projects with $300 million in total financing. According to company figures, the portfolio has maintained a zero default rate with returns ranging from 11% to 13%.\n\n\tIn May, Goldfinch International launched a production debt fund that lends against tax incentives, distribution guarantees and pre-sale agreements. The financing structure allows producers to maintain ownership of their intellectual property while the fund generates returns from contracted revenue streams.\n",

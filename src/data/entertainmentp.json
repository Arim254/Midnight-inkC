    "body": "\n\tA house in Nancy Guthrie‘s Arizona neighborhood is being investigated in connection to her disappearance, police said late Friday night. Nancy, the mother of “Today” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, has been missing for nearly two weeks. \n\n\t“Law enforcement activity is underway at a residence near E Orange Grove Rd & N First Ave related to the Guthrie case,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement on X. “Because this is a joint investigation, at the request of the FBI — no additional information is currently available.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the New York Times, the house is in the Catalina Foothills neighborhood and just a short drive from Nancy’s residence and that of her older daughter, Annie, and her husband. A grey Range Rover is also being investigated at a nearby Culver’s, the Times reports, though it is unclear if it is in connection to Guthrie. Investigators photographed something inside of the car’s trunk and a tow truck has removed it from the scene.\n\n\n\tOn Thursday, the FBI revealed that it is raising the reward to $100,000 for information that helps locate Nancy Guthrie or leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for her disappearance.\n\n\tThe agency also shared additional identifying details about a potential kidnapper, describing the suspect as “a male standing approximately 5’9” to 5’10” tall with an average build. In the video, he is seen wearing a black 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack,” according to a post on X from the Phoenix bureau of the FBI.\n\n\tEarlier that week, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department told ABC News that an individual had been taken into custody for questioning in connection with the case, and investigators were preparing to search a location tied to that individual. The person was later released. \n\t\n\n\tNancy Guthrie was reported missing on Feb. 1, and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department declared her disappearance a crime on Feb. 2. \n\n\t“We saw some things at the home that were concerning to us,” Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told reporters at the time. “We believe now, after we process that crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime, and we’re asking for the community’s help.”\n\n\tSince her mother’s disappearance, Savannah Guthrie has posted several videos on social media addressing the kidnapper and asking the community to help with the search.\n\n\t“So I’m coming on just to ask you not just for your prayers, but no matter where you are — even if you’re far from Tuscon,” she said in a video message on Feb. 9. “If you see anything, if you hear anything, if there’s anything at all that seems strange to you — that you report to law enforcement. We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tArtificial intelligence is increasingly being used by Indian screenwriters in their work even as long-standing concerns around pay, credit and professional recognition continue to dominate sentiment, according to “The Right Draft: 2026,” a new industry research report released by talent agency Tulsea and media insights firm Ormax Media.\n\n\tBased on a nationwide survey of 254 professional screenwriters, the second edition of the study finds that AI adoption is already widespread across age groups. Forty-one percent of respondents said they use AI tools at least sometimes in their writing process, while half said they do not view AI as a threat to their careers.\n\t\n\n\tAt the same time, the report highlights growing concern about the impact of AI on timelines and perceptions of creativity. Nearly seven in ten respondents said the presence of AI reduces the perceived value of human creativity in the eyes of producers, and 50% said producers now expect faster turnaround times because they assume writers will use AI.\n\n\n\tThree-quarters of surveyed screenwriters said AI can be helpful at certain stages of the writing process, particularly during early development such as pitches, references and first drafts. More than 70% said writers who use AI do not feel comfortable revealing it publicly.\n\n\t“With the second edition of ‘The Right Draft,’ we wanted to deepen the industry’s understanding of writers’ on-ground experiences – across pay, credit, feedback, nurturing structures, and now AI,” said Chaitanya Hegde, co-founder of Tulsea Media. “The data points to some meaningful shifts and some stubborn constants. Our hope is that the report helps move conversations from perception to process, and towards more consistent, fair, and creator-friendly systems.”\n\t\n\n\tThose “stubborn constants” are reflected most sharply in compensation trends, which have deteriorated compared with findings in 2023. Nearly 74% of respondents said they do not feel they are paid fairly for their work, up from 63% three years ago. More than half said payments are not made in a timely manner, and almost four in five reported having to constantly follow up to receive money that is contractually due.\n\n\tPerformance-linked compensation remains rare. Two-thirds of respondents said they have never been offered profit-sharing or bonuses tied to box office or viewership, and have never asked for such structures.\n\n\tCredit and visibility continue to be another major pain point. Over half of screenwriters disagreed with the statement that writers are given fair credit for their work, while nearly two-thirds said there is no defined industry standard for crediting that producers and platforms consistently follow. More than half said they do not receive equal credit when co-writing with directors, and over 60% reported similar experiences when collaborating with senior writers.\n\n\tTheatrical cinema remains the format where scripts are perceived to carry the least weight. Only 6% of respondents said producers value scripts over stars in theatrical films, compared with 83% who said stars dominate. While streaming and television fare better, the perceived value of scripts on streaming platforms has declined since 2023.\n\n\tThe report also points to a decline in access to mentorship and support structures. Just 19% of respondents said they have access to good mentors, down from 30% in 2023, while 76% believe the industry does not provide adequate infrastructure to help writers develop their craft. Fewer than four in ten said they have access to effective grievance-redressal mechanisms.\n\n\t“Writers sit at the core of the storytelling ecosystem, yet too many friction points remain structural rather than episodic,” said Shailesh Kapoor, founder-CEO of Ormax Media. “By measuring writer sentiment across key dimensions, ‘The Right Draft’ is intended to be a practical input into how the industry can build stronger alignment, accountability, and creative ownership.”\n\n\tOrganised across seven sections – The Right Pay, The Right Credit, The Right Feedback, The Right Value, The Right Nurturing, The Right Tools and The Right Environment – “The Right Draft: 2026” expands on the 2023 edition by incorporating emerging formats such as microdramas and examining the impact of AI on writing workflows alongside ongoing structural challenges around compensation, credit and support for screenwriters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBuenos Aires-based FilmSharks has snagged international sales rights to the feature film adaptation of romantic bestseller “All That We Never Were” “(“Todo lo que nunca fuimos”) by Spanish author Alice Kellen. \n\n\tDirected by Jorge Alonso, the film stars Maxi Iglesias (“The Cook of Castamar”), Margarida Corceiro (“Punto Nemo”) and Sebastián Zurita (“How to Survive Being Single”) in a story that follows Leah (Corceiro), a budding young painter who is struggling to recover from the accident that claimed her parents’ lives. Filming took place across San Sebastián, Zumaia, Zarauz and Madrid.  \n\t\n\n\tThe romantic drama is produced by Versus Entertainment, Lyo Media and Bixagu Entertainment, in co-production with Elephantec Global and CRE84U, with participation from HBO Max and Warner Bros. Pictures Spain, which has slated a theatrical release in Spain in June. \n\n\n\tFilmSharks and Warner Bros. previously collaborated on the global hit “Pídeme lo que quieras,” which sold worldwide.\n\n\tSaid FilmSharks founder Guido Rud: “Working on ‘Pídeme lo que quieras’ with Alejandro Miranda and Warner Bros. Pictures was an extraordinary experience; we sold the film worldwide. Now, with this new adaptation of ‘All That We Never Were,’ we hope to achieve great results again, as it falls within the line of high-quality theatrical films with layers of romance and eroticism—one of the few genres that works globally.”\n\n\tKellen’s biggest bestseller, “All That We Never Were” is the first instalment of her “Let it Be” (“Deja que Ocurra”) duology. The second book, “All That We Are Together,” is her second most-read novel. She is known for her stories that deal with universal, crossover themes of love and friendship. \n\t\n\n\tFilmSharks recently closed theatrical and remake rights to “Torment” (“Tormento”), the Morgue-set horror thriller by “Gimme the Power” director Olallo Rubio. South Korea’s Entermode snapped up theatrical rights while Capelight nabbed all rights for Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the U.K.\n\n\tGud is also in advanced talks for the U.S. remake and some Asian versions of “Morgue,” with Vietnam’s Blue Lantern already optioning the remake rights.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tWith “Atlas King,” Michael Bisping plays a role close to home. The UFC Hall of Famer and first British champion in UFC history embodies the titular role as a former fighter skirting the edges of organized crime in a twisty action thriller centered on the world of mixed martial arts fights in Los Angeles. \n\n\t“I have a lot in common with Atlas King,” he says. “As crazy as that sounds. I mean, I’m a former mixed martial arts fighter, so I spent most of my life doing that, so I understand that side of things. And then, sadly, in the world of mixed martial arts, in the early days, there were a lot of unsavory characters, shall we say. So I certainly had a lot of experiences that I could draw upon to put myself in his shoes.”\n\t\n\n\tNika Agiashvili directs with a real flair for capturing the gritty side of L.A. In the film, Atlas (Bisping), a former champion who’s been gone from the scene for 10 years, returns to Los Angeles for the funeral of Dutch, his mentor and father figure. He’s pulled back into the violent underworld he tried to escape while trying to protect Tommy (George Finn), Dutch’s talented fighter son. But the scene is now run by ruthless boss Clay (Cuba Gooding Jr.), leading to a final, violent confrontation.\n\n\n\t“Atlas King” is being sold at EFM by Highland Film Group.\n\n\tWhy did you get involved as producer on this film?\n\n\tNika, [exec producer] Johnny [Edward Lee] and George and I created a production company called Punch It Films. We were trying to get this project off the ground for quite some time, and a lot of people were coming on board and wanting to make changes. It slowly started to become the film that we didn’t want to make. So we put on our big boy pants on and made it ourselves. I think it turned out really great, and we’re very proud of it.\n\t\n\n\tWhat was it like to work with Cuba Gooding Jr?\n\n\tI remember the evening before I’m working with Cuba, I felt quite a lot of pressure. I think I had three pages of dialog on set with Cuba, who’s won an Academy Award for crying out loud! And I hadn’t felt any pressure whatsoever, and then, because I just want to represent the project, I didn’t want him showing up and thinking, what’s this garbage? This guy’s awful! So that brought a lot of pressure. But I tell you what, as soon as I got on set, he was so nice and warm and down to earth.\n\n\tHow much were you involved in choreographing the fight scenes?\n\n\tSo of course, we had a tremendous choreography team. But anything that I was involved with — I wouldn’t say controlling — but I want to make sure it’s good, because if there’s people tuning in from the mixed martial arts world, it’s got to be believable. So I choreographed a lot of my own fight scenes with their help and assistance, of course. Because, as I said, I’ve done martial arts since I was 8 years old.\n\n\tI want to make sure that the brand, shall we say, is represented well. A lot of effort went into the fight scenes, but I think they turned out amazing.\n\n\tWere you involved in making sure your co-stars were authentic-looking fighters?\n\n\tGeorge trained for months and months and months. You know, that guy really showed tremendous discipline. I mean, he was in the gym lifting weights. In the evening, he was learning martial arts. He was training with real life mixed martial artists and UFC guys just trying to understand the sport and move like they do.\n\n\tWhat’s next for Punch It Films?\n\n\tWe have a bunch of projects that we’re going to try and get off the ground. We want to make movies that or shows that get us excited and make the kind of projects that we want to be involved with. And of course, sometimes in this day and age, if you want to get those things made, you got to do it yourself.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia is mounting its most comprehensive presence at the Berlinale in recent years, with six films screening across the festival’s Generation, Forum, Forum Expanded and Classics sections while the National Film Development Corporation of India deploys a strategic market approach aimed at positioning the country as a holistic creative economy hub.\n\n\tRima Das‘ “Not a Hero,” R. Gowtham’s “Members of the Problematic Family,” Madhusree Dutta’s “Flying Tigers,” Amay Mehrishi’s “Abracadabra,” Utkarsh’s “A Circle as the Center of the Whole” and the 4K restoration of Arundhati Roy and Pradip Krishen’s “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones” represent diverse cinematic approaches from established and emerging voices, underscoring the breadth of India’s current independent film landscape.\n\t\n\n\tDas, whose “Village Rockstars” became India’s official entry for the 2019 Academy Awards, returns to Berlin’s Generation section with “Not a Hero,” a coming-of-age story centered on 11-year-old Mivan navigating displacement between urban and rural worlds. \n\n\n\t“Children experience the world without filters,” Das says. “Through Mivan, I was drawn to a way of seeing where confusion, resistance, and tenderness coexist naturally. He does not analyse his emotions, he lives them.”\n\n\tDas notes a significant shift in her working methodology with child actors compared to her previous work. “The children in ‘Not a Hero’ were very different from those in ‘Village Rockstars,'” she explains. “In ‘Village Rockstars,’ the children listened to me. In ‘Not a Hero,’ I listened to them.”\n\n\tThe film’s title deliberately pushes back against conventional narrative arcs. “I wanted to avoid the idea that growing up is about overcoming or winning,” Das says. “Mivan does not arrive as a savior, nor does he conquer his circumstances. His journey is quieter, shaped by listening, failing, waiting, and learning to stay.”\n\t\n\n\t.”The film does not explain emotions or resolve conflicts neatly,” she adds. “It trusts young audiences to sit with ambiguity, discomfort, and tenderness.”\n\n\t“Members of the Problematic Family,” screening in Forum, takes a structurally experimental approach to grief and family dynamics. Director R. Gowtham describes the narrative as intentionally fragmented, mirroring his own speech patterns.\n\n\t“The script itself was written without all those conventional beginnings and ends,” Gowtham says. “During the post we found it has some structure to it. In fact my co-producer Mukesh Subramananiam told me the structurelessness is the film’s structure.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker notes that early test audiences’ confusion was actually a desired outcome during the development process. Despite Tamil-specific pop culture references, the film has connected with viewers beyond its immediate cultural context, according to Gowtham, who cites positive responses at Film Bazaar in Goa from Hindi-speaking filmmakers.\n\n\tIn the Forum section, Madhusree Dutta’s “Flying Tigers” weaves personal memory with World War II history, tracing a massive U.S. military logistics operation across the Himalayas that connected Assam and Kunming. The project originated from the filmmaker’s mother’s childhood memories in a tea plantation settlement and her later struggles with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\t“My mother’s Alzheimer’s-induced memory eventually turned into a lens through which I could see and understand the contemporary web of wars and infrastructures,” Dutta says. The film marks a departure for the filmmaker, who previously focused on urban cultures and feminist narratives.\n\n\t“In my earlier works I have never featured myself,” Dutta notes. “But in this film I felt compelled to place myself as a protagonist. This film is a gift from my mother to me.”\n\n\tThe Berlinale Classics section features the 4K restoration of “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones,” a 1989 campus comedy written by and starring Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. Directed by Pradip Krishen and originally made for Indian state broadcaster Doordarshan, the film is set in a Delhi architecture school in the mid-1970s and has achieved cult status over the decades. The cast includes early roles for Shah Rukh Khan and Manoj Bajpayee, alongside lead performances from Arjun Raina, Roshan Seth and Roy herself.\n\t\n\n\tThe restoration, spearheaded by the Film Heritage Foundation at L’Immagine Ritrovata’s laboratory in association with NFDC and the National Film Archive of India, marks the organization’s first presentation at the festival. The film went out of circulation after a single television screening and has been largely inaccessible for nearly four decades.\n\n\tIn Generation Kplus, Amay Mehrishi’s “Abracadabra,” a U.K.-India co-production, examines identity and belonging through the lens of a school bus journey. The short film follows Agastya as he navigates guilt and unspoken emotions when his best friend chooses to sit elsewhere during a ride that feels both endless and fleeting.\n\n\tThe Forum Expanded section includes “A Circle as the Center of the Whole,” a documentary short by director Utkarsh. The U.S.-India co-production uses Delhi as a site of constant excavation, employing archaeology as both method and metaphor to reveal absences in the ground around which the city forms.\n\n\tIndia’s presence at the festival extends beyond the screening sections. Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, founder of Film Heritage Foundation, serves on the main competition jury alongside director Wim Wenders and other global names. Sundance and Cannes-winning director Shaunak Sen sits on the documentary award jury.\n\n\tBeyond the screening sections and jury representation, India’s presence extends to the European Film Market through the Bharat Pavilion and WAVES Bazaar initiatives, reflecting a broader strategic positioning.\n\n\t“India’s presence at Berlinale and the European Film Market reflects our larger ambition to engage with the world not only through films, but through a holistic creative economy,” says Prakash Magdum, managing director of NFDC. “Through the Bharat Pavilion and WAVES Bazaar, we are creating a structured platform that brings together content, technology, talent, archives, and education – enabling long-term global partnerships and meaningful cultural exchange.”\n\n\tThe Bharat Pavilion, running Feb. 12-18, functions as India’s official hub at EFM, serving as a unified platform for engagement and B2B interactions. Under the WAVES Bazaar framework, the initiative includes multiple market-facing components: four Indian gaming and technology startups participating in WAVES X at the EFM Innovation & Tech Hub, four animation companies engaging in EFM Animation Days from Feb. 12-14, and eight sponsored filmmakers selected for international market participation.\n\t\n\n\tBharat Parv, scheduled for Feb. 13, serves as a flagship networking initiative focused on industry connections, co-production dialogue and partnership building with global stakeholders.\n\n\tThe National Film Archive of India participates in the EFM Archives Market on Feb. 17, highlighting restoration initiatives and archival collaborations. That same day, leading Indian film education institutions including FTII, IICT and SRFTI participate in the Berlinale Film School Summit, positioning India as a hub for film education and talent development.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA mousy teenager with curly hair and a face full of acne, Minnie is the farthest thing from cool — even if the actress who plays her, Katherine Mallen Kupferer, has charisma to spare. Minnie is practically invisible to most of the students at North Little Rock High School, which is what makes her friendship with Callie — the most popular girl in her class — so special. They’ve been close since before such things mattered, and Callie’s the sort of person who always made sure that Minnie was included.\n\t\n\n\tSo what does life without her best friend look like? And how does one balance that loss with what everyone else is feeling, from Callie’s shellshocked mother (Sophie Okonedo, giving the first Oscar-worthy performance of 2026) to those classmates who claim Callie as their own? The latest modestly scaled, sensitively crafted drama from directors Alex Thompson and Kelly O’Sullivan, “Mouse” is a movie without a clever marketing hook, but it’s intelligent, perceptive and true. As in their two previous heartfelt Middle American indies, “Saint Frances” and “Ghostlight,” the couple draw from their own lives and the world around them.  \n\n\n\tHere, they turn their attention south, to O’Sullivan’s home state of Arkansas, setting the film in 2002 — a time before cell phones and social media rewired how we engage with one another. Back then, the world was still skeptical of therapy, and teens consumed pop culture on shiny silver platters. (Minnie meets her first love behind the counter of the local CD/DVD store.) In Minnie’s class, Callie’s the born performer, destined for a life on stage or screen. Everyone else saves dancing for prom or the senior cabaret show — which Callie’s churchy friend Cara (Audrey Grace Marshall) suggests they dedicate to her memory.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s not enough to be sad — we have to do something,” Cara self-righteously announces, commandeering theater class from exasperated teacher Mr. Murdaugh (David Hyde Pierce). There’s a certain amount of entitlement that comes with kids of Cara’s age and class, which O’Sullivan’s script smartly treats as the subtext to a film that might otherwise be compared to “Ordinary People” or “Waves,” in which tragedy nudges an introverted adolescent out from under the shadow of their “most likely to succeed” sibling.  \n\n\t“Mouse” deals with similar themes, but a lot of other territory as well, including a “Lady Bird”-like exploration of how working-class teenagers like Minnie might feel ashamed having a mom like Barbara (Tara Mallen), who’s brash and oblivious, but doing her best. Without Callie around, the chasm between Minnie — who holds an after-school job and eats microwaved junk at home — and Callie’s other friends feels wider than ever.  \n\n\tMinnie takes it out on her mom, a veterinary assistant juggling a house full of rescue animals and a random toddler she’s all but adopted (the boy needs a home, and her heart is bigger than Minnie appreciates). When Callie was there, she spent as much time at possible at her upscale friend’s house, and now that she’s gone, Minnie gravitates to her mother, Helen (Okonedo), an elegant, once-radiant woman — now drained by grief — with a posh British accent.\n\n\tHelen’s grateful for the company, taking Minnie under her wing, and spoiling her with home-cooked meals and private singing lessons. Together, they decide that Minnie can sing a showtune from “A Chorus Line” during the senior cabaret, and though Minnie insists she has no talent, there’s comfort for both parties in Helen treating Minnie the way she would her own daughter. (The movie’s tender piano score is so comforting, we could be eavesdropping on Helen playing to herself late one night.)\n\n\tIn a more conventional film, Helen might unlock some hidden potential in the socially introverted teen, which would then be revealed at the big show. But “Mouse” is grounded not just in reality, but relatability. While not a comedy, it’s full of humor and subtle, wince-worthy moments that feel instantly familiar: the time you made a fool of yourself in front of the entire class, or the harshest thing you ever said to a parent and now wish you could take back.\n\t\n\n\tWhere Minnie grew up not knowing her father, Callie has the kind of dad who stocks the fridge with beers and pretends not to notice if any go missing — which might seem ideal to some, until you consider his daughter’s fate. But “Mouse” isn’t meant as a lecture on such things. Tragedies befall teens all the time, and in this case, the focus is on moving forward, as represented by Minnie’s tentative flirtation with a girl named Kat (Iman Vellani).  \n\n\tA mix of actors of wildly different experience levels, the ensemble meshes together beautifully, reflecting the idea that none of these characters knows quite how to navigate the situation. They’re all fumbling, convincingly so, from the adults to the kids. Pierce has two powerful scenes, including a key moment in which he asks his students to express how they feel in public and in private, silently observing how Minnie differs from her peers. And while Kupferer feels like a discovery — one the directors made on “Ghostlight,” though given a much larger role here — it’s Okonedo and Mallen as the film’s competing maternal forces who impress most.  While the film may seem like a love letter to a lost friend, it’s fitting that it’s actually dedicated to O’Sullivan’s late mother, Eileen, appreciation for whom illuminates every frame. \n",

    "description": "\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Edwin makes his first proper foray into horror with “Sleep No More,” a darkly comic supernatural thriller that transforms labor",
    "body": "\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Edwin makes his first proper foray into horror with “Sleep No More,” a darkly comic supernatural thriller that transforms labor exploitation into the source of terror itself. The film has its world premiere in the Berlinale Special Midnight section.\n\n\tThe feature marks a genre evolution for Edwin, whose previous film, “Vengeance Is Mine, All Others Pay Cash,” won the Golden Leopard at Locarno in 2021. Rather than abandoning the social commentary that has defined his career, Edwin uses the horror framework to sharpen his critique of working conditions and capitalist systems.\n\t\n\n\tThe film follows three siblings investigating their mother’s death at a hair accessory factory, where the tyrannical owner, Maryati, exploits workers through punishing shifts and productivity incentives that prioritize greed over sleep. Putri believes her mother committed suicide due to the brutal conditions, while her sister Ida suspects supernatural possession brought on by extreme exhaustion. Their younger brother, Bona, who possesses an unusual healing ability, becomes a target for a ghostly entity seeking an ideal host body.\n\n\n\t“I think the reality can be portrayed with every genre in cinema,” Edwin tells Variety. “There’s too many crazy stuff in Indonesia in our everyday life which is already serious, so maybe horror-comedy is the perfect genre to be used as a tool to discuss our everyday life problems.”\n\n\tThe production is an Indonesia-Singapore-Japan-Germany-France co-production, with Rachel Amanda, Lutesha and Iqbaal Ramadhan starring alongside Didik Nini Thowok and Sal Priadi. The screenplay was co-written by Edwin with Daishi Matsunaga and acclaimed novelist Eka Kurniawan.\n\t\n\n\tEdwin conducted extensive research into actual factory conditions to design what he describes as a toxic ecosystem rather than simply a location. The film explores how workers remain disconnected from the ultimate purpose of their labor.\n\n\t“I’m really interested in how the factory system now — we don’t know what we work for,” Edwin explains. “Everybody works hard, even a lot of accidents happen because of these targets, but for what? For something that we don’t know.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker cites Jordan Peele’s assertion that horror and comedy are essentially similar, separated mainly by music and sound design. Edwin weaves dark humor and surreal elements throughout what is otherwise a brutal examination of exploitation.\n\n\t“Building terror and building comedy is quite almost similar, and it works really well on expressing critiques, expressing anger,” he says.\n\n\tThe choice to work in horror also responds to the Indonesian market, where the genre draws substantial youth audiences. Edwin sees an opportunity to engage with genre fans while delivering substantive social commentary.\n\n\t“There’s a big market on it, especially in Indonesia. A lot of young people, old people too, they really like to come to cinema to experience the genre,” he notes. “I would love to have a conversation with them. How can I offer something to the horror genre audience?”\n\n\tThe capitalist critique runs deep in Edwin’s filmography, extending back to his short films from the early 2000s. With “Sleep No More,” the questioning has taken on new urgency.\n\n\t“I’m kind of questioning whether capitalism is the perfect system for us,” Edwin says. “I think now it’s even an urgent question whether we should really reflect on what we do with capitalism, the system that creates powerful people that are using capitalism as their machine.”\n\n\tThe film is produced by Palari Films and Beacon Film in Indonesia, with co-producers Giraffe Pictures in Singapore, Hassaku Lab in Japan, In Good Company in Germany and Apsara Films in France. Showbox Corp. handles world sales.\n\n\tEdwin’s previous work includes “Postcards From the Zoo,” which screened in Berlinale Competition in 2012 and won the Edward Yang New Talent Award at the Asian Film Awards. His debut feature, “Blind Pig Who Wants to Fly,” received the FIPRESCI award at Rotterdam.\n\t\n\n\tLooking ahead, Edwin expresses interest in exploring science fiction, Indonesian history and what he describes as more complicated human emotions. His immediate next project will examine how teenagers navigate what he calls a “crazy full of validation looking world.”\n\n\t“In terms of storytelling, yes, I love to explore the plot, but sometimes with plots it’s challenging to explore more complicated feelings, which is more human, complicated and human,” he says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a bold move to take Spain’s biggest comedy franchise to the world, Film Factory has secured international sales rights to “Torrente for President,” created, directed and starring Santiago Segura as the perpetually drunk, self-centered sexist, and racist scumbag ex-cop Torrente.\n\n\tHitting Spain in 1998 with “Torrente, the Dumb Arm of the Law,” hailed by Variety as “deliriously non p.c.” and “a tremendously enjoyable comedy-thriller,” the franchise has punched over 16 million admissions in Spain – over $100 million – making it the highest-grossing series in the history of Spanish cinema.\n\t\n\n\tWhen “Torrente” first bowed, he was regarded as a hilarious parody of a throw back to the times of dictator Francisco Franco, a past which most Spaniards disavowed in a modern democratic Spain. These days, however, there are more urgent and immediate references. \n\n\n\tSet for release in Spain on March 13, 2026 via Sony Pictures, “Torrente for President” will open in the long run-up to general elections in Spain, which have to take place by August 2027. One of the biggest political question for Spain is whether far-right Vox would end up forming part of a coalition governments on federal, regional or municipal levels.\n\n\tPlot for “Torrente” is still under wraps. One scene leaked online shows Torrente addressing a crowd of followers from a balcony above a canvas banner for his party, Nox.\n\n\t“I have my bags ready to leave Spain on March 14,” Segura joked on Spanish comedy chat show “El Hormiguero” this December. \n\n\tFilm Factory announced Friday that the film will feature international cast participation, raising the question whether Trump, Musk or other figures not so far from Torrente’s political creed will also be referenced. \n\t\n\n\t“With a politically charged narrative, razor-sharp satire, and provocative humor, the film positions Spain’s antihero in a bold, contemporary social landscape, engaging audiences both locally and globally,” Film Factory comments on its new pick-up.\n\n\t“Torrente is one of the most powerful and recognisable brands in Spanish cinema. We are proud to collaborate on this new instalment of Santiago Segura’s legendary and iconic saga.” Said Vicente Canales, Film Factory CEO.\n\n\t“It’s going to be the most ambitious film of the saga,” Segura promised. “Torrente always comes back… and always triumphs.”\n\n\tIndeed. if Trump or Bolsonaro triumphed, why not Torrente?\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s a high-stakes gambit to assemble a cast of relative newcomers for a first feature film — especially when that film is set against the sprawling, kinetic, unpredictable backdrop of the Nigerian megacity of Lagos.\n\n\tBut if early returns are anything to go by, British Nigerian writer-director Olive Nwosu struck paydirt with the ensemble cast of her debut, “Lady,” which took home the World Cinema Dramatic Special Jury Award for Acting Ensemble after its world premiere last month at Sundance. \n\t\n\n\tNow Nwosu’s electrifying film, which follows a hard-edged young cabbie’s unexpected journey of self-discovery after befriending a group of sex workers, will travel to the Berlin Film Festival, where it will have its international premiere Feb. 18 in the Panorama section.\n\n\n\tThis time, stars Jessica Gabriel’s Ujah, Amanda Oruh and Tinuade Jemiseye hope to celebrate that triumph firsthand.\n\n\tIn a dispiriting sign of the times, the three actors — along with co-stars Binta Ayo Mogaji, Seun Kuti and Bucci Franklin — were forced to sit out the Park City premiere, after being denied travel visas by the Trump administration, which cracked down this year on travel from dozens of countries, including Nigeria.\n\n\tAs “Lady” was winning over audiences at the prestigious U.S. fest, Oruh took to X to share her heartbreak and anger at having to miss out, posting that “to be denied a visa for something I legitimately earned, because of my nationality plus politics isn’t just disappointing, it’s DEHUMANIZING.”\n\n\t“I felt angry, I felt cheated,” she wrote. “To be honest, I cried for days because I felt ROBBED.”\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety along with her co-stars ahead of the Berlinale, Oruh describes the emotional rollercoaster of scrolling through photos and videos sent by the film’s producers as she followed the premiere from Lagos, at one point donning a fancy dress in her bedroom “to feel what it would feel like if I were at Sundance.”\n\n\t“Looking at the pictures, I was smiling from ear to ear, feeling immense pride for the work we’ve done,” says Oruh, who plays Pinky, one of a tight-knit cohort of boisterous sex workers plying their after-hours trade across the dark underbelly of Lagos. \n\n\t“Beneath the disappointment, we were thrilled that people got to see it,” adds Ujah, who stars opposite Oruh as Pinky’s childhood friend, a taxi driver who dreams of escaping her hard-scrabble life. “Our story lives on [and] is having a life of its own.”\n\n\tIn some ways, the ordeal exemplifies the strength and perseverance at the heart of “Lady,” which follows its titular heroine — one of the few female cab drivers working in the Nigerian metropolis — as she’s reluctantly pulled into the orbit of Pinky and her crew of wisecracking, straight-talking, glammed-up sex workers. \n\n\tOstracized and shunned as readily as their services are exploited, the women find comfort and hope in their shared sisterhood — even as their work, and the roiling political crisis that undergirds the film, exposes them to the brutal realities of Nigerian life. \n\n\tThat on-screen sorority, the actors insist, was a by-product of the very real bonds they forged during production. Credit goes to Nwosu, they say, for “creating an environment where empathy, where vulnerability wasn’t just allowed — it was celebrated,” according to Oruh. Ujah praises the director for building a “community” on set, creating “an atmosphere that made us feel safe to be us.”\n\n\tThat community, says Jemiseye, who plays the fun-loving Sugar, persisted long after production wrapped. “These are my women for real,” she says, choking back tears. “These are my sisters.”\n\n\t“Lady” was financed by the BFI, Film4 and Screen Scotland, with additional funding from Level Forward and Amplify Capital. It was produced by Alex Polunin for Ossian International, John Giwa-Amu for Good Gate, and Stella Nwimo. Co-producers are Adé Sultan Sangodoyin and Jamiu Shoyode of Lagos-based Emperium Films. HanWay is handling world sales.\n\t\n\n\tWith just days to go before the film’s Berlin premiere, the cast’s visa status again remains up in the air — although the actors are hopeful that the E.U. will be a more gracious host than the U.S. proved to be.\n\n\t“Hopefully, Berlin will be a moment that we finally get to sit together as castmates, as sisters, with the amazing director and the producers — to watch it together and see the power of what we’ve made,” says Oruh.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRome-based TVCO has seized worldwide distribution rights – excluding Latin America – to “Hidden Island” (“Isla oculta”), a high-concept sci-fi series from Chile’s Rio Estudios.\n\n\t“TVCO’s long track record in the European market gives us great confidence in successfully positioning the series across diverse markets,” said showrunner Pablo Diáz del Rios who added that his company, Rio Estudios, would be handling Latin American sales.\n\t\n\n\t“Hidden Island” is among the 17 scripted series participating in the Berlinale Series Market Selects, with a screening slated for Feb. 16.\n\n\n\tSet in southern Patagonia, the six-part series follows Fabiola, a strong-willed detective who investigates the disappearance of a Mexican archaeology student who vanished while seeking the mythical Friendship Island. As the case deepens, Fabiola must decide whether it’s an outright kidnapping or something more unusual. Reports about the island warn of strange disappearances, miraculous healings and possible extraterrestrial activity.\n\n\t“The series delivers a compelling blend of thriller and mystery, anchored by a powerful female lead and a strong narrative identity. We strongly believe ‘Hidden Island’ has all the elements to resonate with broadcasters and platforms worldwide, and the European Film Market in Berlin marks the ideal launchpad for its international journey,” said Simonetta Polese, TVCO head of sales.\n\n\tThe series boasts a top-notch talent from Chile, led by star Daniela Ramírez, International Emmy-nominated for her performance in HBO Max’s limited series “Isabel: The Intimate Story of Isabel Allende.”  \n\t\n\n\tWriters include Julio Rojas, renowned for his hit serial podcast “Case 63,” alongside Felipe Carmona (“Prison in the Andes”) and Juan M. Dartizio (“An Unknown Enemy”). Rodrigo Susarte, known for “Gen Mishima” and “Invunche,” directed all six episodes.\n\n\t“I think we didn’t fall into clichés, that we managed to create a more philosophical, more existential series, with nods to sci-fi,” Diaz said in an earlier interview, adding: “Although we didn’t have the budget to make an ‘Interstellar’ or an ‘Arrival,’ I think we held our own pretty well, given the resources we had.”\n\n\t“Let’s say the series ends up talking about artificial intelligence and about humanity — about what we’re experiencing as humanity in current times. Fabiola will feel it as a kind of premonition, and she’ll have a vision for the second season, which takes place in the year 2028,” he added.\n\n\t“Hidden Island” will vie for Berlin Series Market’s newly introduced Studio Babelsberg Production Excellence Award, which will recognize outstanding producing qualities that encompass a creative vision, execution, innovative approaches and robust international appeal.\n",

Pima County deputies swarming a home in the Tucson area, and apparently, taking 2 people into custody.\n      \n    \n          The Sheriff's Department's SWAT unit rolled out Friday night in the rain with a huge show of force ... first reported by NewsNation's Brian Entin, whose crew got the video of cops walking out with a man and woman.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The home is about 2 miles from Nancy's home, and the Sheriff's Dept came ready for anything -- there are reportedly about 2 dozen officers on the scene .. including FBI agents.\n      \n    \n          Entin says it appears the 2 people taken out of the house are a mother and son.\n      \n    \n          It's unclear if the 2 people are suspects or persons of interest ... or if they've been arrested -- but, law enforcement has a search warrant related to the Guthrie case, according to Entin.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    NewsNation\n          \n    \n          A judge apparently issued a search warrant and law enforcement is currently inside the house. NewsNation reports this was all set in motion after cops made a traffic stop of a white van, and the driver has also been detained.\n      \n    \n          Entin says there was no confrontation at the house ... doors were not broken down. He says the 2 people appeared to voluntarily surrender.\n      \n    \n          Story developing ...\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

That's most likely a reference to Mexico, which is less than a 90 minute drive from Tucson.\n      \n    \n          TMZ just received a third email from the man who claims he knows the identity of Nancy Guthrie's kidnapper ... and he has upped his price.\n      \n    \n          The email says he's contacting TMZ because he doesn't trust law enforcement. He's essentially using TMZ as an intermediary, telling authorities -- you don't trust me, and I don't trust you.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          He suggests the reward being doubled to $100,000 was a move designed \"to discredit me.\"\n      \n\n          As we reported, the man demanded 1 bitcoin to give up the name and location of the kidnapper. That 1 bitcoin -- currently worth around $68,000.\n      \n    \n          Now he wants that $100,000 FBI reward, and here's how. He's asking for a fraction of bitcoin worth $50,000, and in return, he will give up the information, and then he expects another $50,000 in bitcoin. He promises not to withdraw the first $50K until the kidnapper is arrested.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          There's another important change ... he says when he gets the initial payment, he'll give up \"the name of the main individual.\" Referring to the \"main individual\" clearly suggests there are accomplices.\n      \n    \n          He refers to the current state of Nancy Guthrie ... we will not be specific.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie Case\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tSean “Diddy” Combs has filed an appeal for his 50-month sentence, claiming that the court handed down an excessive punishment in his federal trial and asking for his “immediate release” from prison.\n\n\tIn the 84-page appeal, filed yesterday and reviewed by Variety, attorney Alexandra A.E. Shapiro argued that Combs’ 50-month sentence was greater than it should have been, laying the blame at the feet of Judge Aran Subramanian and stating that he “acted as the thirteenth juror.” The appeal stated that Subramanian defied the jury’s verdict and found that Combs “coerced,” “exploited” and “forced” his girlfriends to have sex and led a criminal conspiracy, which “trumped the verdict.”\n\t\n\n\t“Defendants typically get sentenced to less than 15 months for these offenses — even when coercion, which the jury didn’t find here, is involved,” reads the appeal.\n\n\n\tCombs was initially convicted in July on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, and was acquitted of the more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that carried heftier sentences. At his sentencing in October, Subramanian made it clear that Combs’ violence would be a factor in his decision, citing the video of the 2016 incident where he attacked his former girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura.\n\n\t“The same power you used to hurt women, you can use to help them,” he told Combs during the sentencing. “I’m counting on you to make the most of your second chance.”\n\n\tShapiro also argued in the appeal that the conviction should be reversed because Combs’ sexual interactions and filming of said acts were protected by the First Amendment, an argument Subramanian had previously rejected.\n\t\n\n\tCombs is currently serving out his sentence at New Jersey’s FCI Fort Dix with a projected release date set for May 2028.\n",

    "body": "\n\tImani Smith, a former child actor who starred in “The Lion King” on Broadway, was found dead on Dec. 21, according to a press release from Middlesex County, N.J., Prosecutor Yolanda Ciccone and Chief Thomas Bryan of the Edison Police Department. She was 25.\n\n\tPolice responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing at 9:18 a.m. on Dec. 21. Upon arrival, they found Smith with stab wounds and transported her to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. After an investigation, Edison police arrested Jordan D. Jackson-Small, 35, without incident and charged him with first-degree murder, second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon. \n\t\n\n\tAccording to the press release, Smith and Jackson-Small knew each other prior to the incident. Smith’s aunt, who started a GoFundMe to raise money for their family, wrote that Jackson-Small was Smith’s boyfriend. He is being held at the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Center.\n\n\n\t“Imani had her whole life ahead of her,” her aunt wrote. “She was a vivacious, loving and fiercely talented person. A true triple-threat performer, she most notably played the role of Young Nala on Broadway in Disney’s ‘Lion King’ — an experience that reflected the joy, creativity, and light she put into the world.”\n\n\tAccording to Playbill, Smith played young Nala in “The Lion King” from Sept. 27, 2011, to Sept. 23, 2012. Her mother, Monique Rance-Helper, is a hair stylist who has worked on the “In the Heights” film, FX’s “Pose” series and Broadway shows “Eclipsed” “Once on This Island,” “The Lightning Thief” and more.\n\t\n\n\tSmith is survived by a 3-year-old son, her parents and her her two siblings.\n",

The James Cameron film, which follows 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” earned more than $450 million globally after its first week of release, including $119 million at the domestic box office.\n\n\tNow, fans of the film franchise can get a behind-the-scenes look at the special effects and animation that went into bringing the characters to life in a new book titled “The Making of Avatar.” Released on December 19, the officially-licensed book has already landed on Amazon’s top movie books charts online.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNEW RELEASE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Making of Avatar\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tFrom publisher DK and 20th Century Studios, “The Making of Avatar” offers an in-depth look into the filmmaking process for all three “Avatar” films, with interviews with the creative team and cast, a peek at the storyboards, plus a look into the digital animation and performance capture process. The 256-page hardcover tome also includes never-behind-seen photos and captures from the set, including an in-depth look into the special effects studio where everything came together.\n\n\tProduced in collaboration with James Cameron’s production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, “The Making of Avatar” features a foreword from the director himself. As a book description states, “The ‘Avatar’ franchise is world famous for its astounding feats of technical innovation, involving breakthroughs in 3D filming,” and the book reveals “the secrets of the incredible special effects that have brought the planet of Pandora unforgettably to life.”\n\n\n\tThis isn’t the only “Avatar” book that’s trending right now: fans can also pick up “Avatar Fire and Ash: The Visual Dictionary,” which offers an in-depth look into every character, environment, weapon and technology used in the new film.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALSO AVAILABLE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAvatar Fire and Ash: The Visual Dictionary\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tReleased in conjunction with Cameron, this is the definitive guide to the world of “Avatar,” with new entries for the new “characters, flora and fauna,” plus “revelatory information about their lifestyles, possessions, and environment,” per a book description.\n\n\tThe 128-page hardcover book includes extensively detailed illustrations and captions for each entry, making it a great trivia piece and collector’s item as well.\n",

She opens the video by talk-singing the chorus of “All by Myself” before launching into a parody of the Grinch’s monologue about his schedule from the Jim Carrey-led 2000 film “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.”\n\n\n\t“The nerve of those Whos, inviting me down there on such short notice. Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn’t allow it!” she says, holding in her lap a small dog wearing antlers like the Grinch’s dog, Max. “4:00 — exercise my voice. 4:30 — wake my children up. 5:00 — solve world hunger. Tell no one. 5:30 — jazzercize. 6:30 — dinner with me. I can’t cancel that again! 7:00 — wrestle with my creative ideas.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m booked!” Dion continues. “Of course, if I bumped my creative ideas to 9:00, I’ll still have time to lay in bed and scroll TikTok videos endlessly. Or I can just simply wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy new year… boring!” She closes the video by beginning to sing “All by Myself” again: “When I was young, I never needed anyone.”\n\n\t“All by Myself” was originally released by singer-songwriter Eric Carmen in in 1975 and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Dion released her famous cover of the ballad as a single ahead of her 1996 album “Falling into You.” It remains one of hre biggest hits in the U.S. to this day.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Maxine Plays Dead,” the Dec. 24 episode of “Palm Royale,” now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\t“Palm Royale’s” Maxine and Douglas may be divorced, but their unmistakable connection crossed the point of no return this week when she was a surprise guest at her own funeral and his devastation sent him into an unhinged frenzy. \n\n\tWhen a body turned up in the Palm Royale pool, everyone assumed it was Maxine (Kristen Wiig) because, well, it looked like her. But society friends Dinah (Leslie Bibb) and Evelyn (Allison Janney) — along with Ann (Mindy Cohn), as Palm Beach’s resident reporter — quickly discovered at the morgue that the deceased is not Maxine.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Perry (Jordan Bridges) delivered “Maxine’s” ashes to a devastated Douglas (Josh Lucas), as the town gathered for the funeral, completely unaware that the very much alive Maxine is hiding inside the casket. The eccentric spiritualist Mary delivered a message from the real dead woman — Maxine’s twin, Mirabelle — then lifted the casket lid and saw that Maxine was there. Chaos erupted: mourners gasp, Mitzi (Kaia Gerber) ran screaming, and an inconsolable Douglas eulogized his ex, telling the “dead” Maxine how much he loves her.\n\n\tLater that night, Maxine and Douglas connected, and she asked if he truly meant what he said at the church, that he loves her… but his answer isn’t exactly what she expected.\n\n\t“He’s untethered, he’s lost, and he’s terrified,” Josh Lucas tells Variety. “He’s in such pain. He’s just devastated… And then you think, is it because he loves her so much or is it because he’s totally a narcissist?”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDouglas (Josh Lucas) and Mitzi (Kaia Geber) attend Maxine’s funeral on ‘Palm Royale.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tErica Parise\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMaxine and Douglas’ love affair has changed since moving to Palm Royale. “When you have a relationship that’s that long — and even though you can dismiss it as these two are silly people — their souls are exploded,” he says. “So I don’t think Douglas is thinking about putting the pieces back together. I think he’s now truly unleashed. … His world has been his oyster, and it no longer is.”\n\n\tIt began with his infidelity and “each piece of it, it just keeps getting worse,” Lucas adds. “He loses Maxine, causes her to have a heart attack, and then when he finally [completely] loses her, I think he’s not a man who’s ever gonna put it back together again. He is not going to therapy.”\n\n\tLucas believes that up to the point he met Maxine, women were truly just “transactional” for him —and marrying Linda/Penelope (Laura Dern) was just “the next right thing to do for his life, career and money.”\n\n\tHe continues, “I think when he met Maxine, he truly fell in love. My sense of him is that he actually did have integrity in it, particularly in his mind that he was loyal and faithful, and he took great pride in that because he was flying all over the world. And sure, he would flirt with stewardesses, but he wouldn’t do anything.”\n\n\tThere is something childlike about Douglas — or dog-like, as Lucas says.\n\n\t“He’s a Labrador puppy, who just is having the best time destroying the house, but then realizes, ‘Oh, my God, I destroyed the house!’” he says with a grin. “Look, he comes from incredible privilege. One of the things I think is so terrific about this show is the candy-coated confection of it all — but in the center of it is kind of this bitter pill all the time of reality.”\n\n\tThat dichotomy was part of the character design from the beginning. “Abe Sylvia and the creators, I don’t want to say in any way are making fun of these people because they’re not. These people exist, particularly back in this time,” he says of the 1970s setting. “But there’s obviously a through line to these, particularly white men of incredible wealth and privilege who just have no real understanding of the world. They’re truly in their own bubble. And Douglas has been in it his entire life.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a way, Maxine and Douglas’ marriage is playing out in a very realistic 1970s scenario, when men had their roles in the family and career, and women had theirs. Pre-Palm Royale, Maxine was a traditional wife, and Douglas was just fine with that.\n\n\t“She talks about it — she’s a trad wife, and she takes great pride in that,” he says. “There’s honor in it. I do think that’s a very interesting thing that’s even going on in today’s time — the value or devalue of that. That’s where the show finds all these lovely through lines — Roe v Wade, women’s rights and the civil rights movement. But Douglas and Maxine are completely devoid of that.”\n\n\tDuring a recent Q&A, Sylvia reminded the audience that during this period of time, in certain parts of this country, a woman could not have a checking account without her husband’s signature.\n\n\t“Those would be things that Douglas would think would be good. And Maxine, her eyes are obviously being opened throughout the show by all these women who are showing her these layers of what’s possible in how society’s changing,” Lucas points out. “But I also think she takes great pride in being a wife who really loves and takes care of her husband. … I think we really try and stay away from pounding any sort of obvious political or psycho sociological message and just purely allow the show to exist as a confection.”\n\n\t“Palm Royale” Season 2 is currently streaming exclusively on Apple TV+, with new episodes arriving weekly on Wednesdays. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat did CBS News management get staffers for Christmas? A memo doubling down on a controversial decision that has roiled the Paramount Skydance news unit and drawn torrents of criticism.\n\n\tIn a note to staff sent hours before the start of Christmas Eve, CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss, president Tom Cibrowski and new senior editors Charles Forelle and Adam Rubenstein insisted a move to delay a “60 Minutes” report by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi was enacted “to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.” The signatures on the memo mark what is believed to be the first tacit appearance of a new CBS News editorial “masthead” that Weiss expects to get more entrenched in the newsgathering process at the company, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\t\n\n\t“Right now, the majority of Americans say they do not trust the press. It isn’t because they’re crazy,” the memo read. “To win back their trust, we have to work hard. Sometimes that means doing more legwork. Sometimes it means telling unexpected stories. Sometimes it means training our attention on topics that have been overlooked or misconstrued. And sometimes it means holding a piece about an important subject to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.”\n\n\n\tCBS News revealed over the weekend that a “60 Minutes” segment reported by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi and centered on the on-screen accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. to prison in El Salvador had been shelved just hours before Sunday’s broadcast. As disclosed by an email sent to colleagues by Alfonsi, the decision was made by Weiss, who insisted that Trump officials appear in the report to comment on camera, even though Alfonsi’s team had made good-faith efforts to secure response ahead of filing the report for legal review. “The public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” Alfonsi said in her memo.\n\t\n\n\tWeiss has, since her arrival in October, insisted without presenting evidence that mainstream media has lost Americans’ trust.  One poll, by Gallup, found just 28% of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in newspapers, television and radio to report news accurately and fairly. The figure is down from 31% in 2025 and 40% five years ago.\n\n\tAnd yet, a September study from Pew Research Center showed that CBS News enjoyed the backing of 51% of U.S. adults who have at least some trust in the information they get from national news organizations. CBS was ranked on par with CNN and PBS, and just a few percentage points behind ABC News and NBC News.The recent decision “may seem radical,” the new memo said. “Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week. And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.”\n\n\tThe “60 Minutes” imbroglio grips CBS News and its parent at an extremely inopportune moment. The news unit is just days away from trying to launch Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of “CBS Evening News,” and looks to be doing so without the weeks of pre-launch promotion such a move would normally warrant. Instead, Dokoupil will go on a barnstorming tour of the U.S. and visit many cities and towns during his first days on the air. What’s more, Paramount is engaged in a heated battle with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, and a continuing series of gaffes under Weiss’ management casts a cloud over Paramount CEO David Ellison’s ability to manage the coropration.\n\n\tMany staffers are aghast over Weiss decision, noting that it came at the end of a long vetting process and after CBS News had already promoted the “60 Minutes” segment to the public. Indeed, many people have been able to watch the report on their own because a Canadian media outlet which airs “60 Minutes” accidentally made Alfonsi’s report available via its digital app. Should a new version of the story surface on the newsmagazine, viewers will be able to see how it was changed under Weiss’ supervision. According to people familiar with the report, Alfonsi had already made efforts to seek comment from Trump officials, and had included a video snippet from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt that offered the administration’s take on the topic.\n\n\tWeiss, a digital provocateur whose opinion site, The Free Press, was acquired by Paramount Skydance earlier this year, has cascaded through a series of unforced errors since her arrival at CBS News. The gaffes have put high scrutiny on a news operation that backs top series such as “60 Minutes” and “Sunday Morning,” but operates weekday evening and morning news programs that have long run behind rivals at NBC and ABC.\n\t\n\n\tSince her arrival, Weiss has faced pushback from the union representing CBS News staffers after asking them to lay out their job duties; nabbed conservative newsmakers and Trump administration officials for various segments for broadcast and online programming; tried to hire big-name anchors by enticing them to leave their current contracts at rival operations; and launched a new series of town halls and debates by moderating a session with conservative activist Erika Kirk that lacked support from mainstream advertisers. Bank of America has signed on as a sponsor for future editions of the series, now dubbed “Things That Matter.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA woman named Molly Watts has paid tribute to late actor James Ransone, who died on Sunday, and revealed that he had once saved her from being sexually assaulted while they were neighbors.\n\n\t“I found out yesterday that @jamesransone died,” Watts wrote on Instagram. “I’m usually private but I want to publicly say I am so grateful that this man existed and don’t know if the trajectory of my life would be the same if he hadn’t.”\n\n\n\tIn her Instagram post, Watts wrote that she had lived in the same building as Ransone in Chinatown and that he had once saved her from an assailant.\n\t\n\n\n\t“I was attacked at the threshold of our building. I screamed for help. No one came. My attacker put his hands around my throat so I would stop making noise. I couldn’t breathe. I remember the certainty that I was going to die or be raped as I was choked unconscious. PJ heard my screams and ran to help. He came running shirtless, carrying a bat or pipe — I’m not sure which, because I never saw him in action. He scared my attacker, who ran. PJ chased him to the building he fled to. Because of the chase, the police were able to identify him, a repeat sexual offender. PJ saved me. I’m not sure if I would have the same life if he hadn’t run down that night.”\n\n\tShe continued, “Even as an adult, I’m not sure how I would have handled the weight of what could have happened or how long it would take to heal — I was already emotionally fragile. What’s especially hard for me with PJ’s passing is that he lived with that kind of violence. What I was spared, he endured in a different form, at an age where there is no emotional defense, and the self is still forming. I get the sense that PJ’s life was haunted by what happened to him then. This world is rarely gentle to people who are hurt, vulnerable, acting out.”\n\t\n\n\tRansone died by suicide on Dec. 21 at age 46. He was known for playing Ziggy Sobotka on “The Wire” and adult Eddy Kaspbrak in “It: Chapter Two.” His other recent credits included “Black Phone 2,” “V/H/S/85,” “Small Engine Repair,” “What We Found,” Poker Face,” “Seal Team,” “50 States of Fright” and “The First.”\n\n\t“Over the years, I have thought of PJ from time to time,” Watts added. I wanted to reach out to him to let him know how grateful I was that he ran towards my screams. I didn’t. I regret that.” She also shared a GoFundMe link to help raise money for Ransone’s family\n",

    "body": "\n\tForeboding title aside, one could reasonably begin watching Charlie Polinger’s “The Plague” and assume that it is a Y.A. coming of age drama— a modern-day “The 400 Blows” or a male “Welcome to the Dollhouse” about a group of teenaged boys spending their summer at a sleepaway water polo camp. However, as the film progresses, not only does its narrative get increasingly sinister, but the look and feel of the film subtly lull the audience away from a vivacious security and into the darkest psychological realms of early adolescence.\n\t\n\n\tBecause of the movie’s water polo camp setting, much of it takes place in and around an indoor pool. Anyone who has been to a YMCA in the early morning knows the harsh fluorescence of these environments. Accordingly, the film’s first two acts are brightly lit, appearing almost sterilized at times.\n\n\n\tIn the opening shot, the camera is fully submerged in the pool, introducing the first of many underwater shots as the boys jump into the water, their legs kicking around and disrupting the aquatic stillness. While the swimming pool’s chlorine-washed blue is unmistakable, cinematographer Steven Breckon says that he and Polinger were trying to avoid cliched underwater shots. “The classic underwater shot is a perfume commercial with a woman in flowy drapery clothing and there’s like a God light beam on it,” Breckon tells Variety. “That’s nowhere close to what we wanted this material to look like and we were actually kind of inspired by more of a deep focus, like a painting.”\n\n\tTo achieve the underwater shots, Breckon explains that the camera operator was beneath the surface, receiving instructions through speakers. “I could basically talk to him through a giant megaphone speaker that is placed underwater, so it was like garbled instructions and he would just nod the camera ‘yes’ or nod the camera ‘no’ to confirm that he heard me.”\n\t\n\n\tEven as the camera becomes less static, circling around the kids treading water, bobbing up and down with seeming serendipity, Breckon says that it was more carefully orchestrated than it appears. He says that the camera was “on a flotation rig that you can deflate to the perfect level where it’s sort of half in and half out. And by pushing it on the surface through those boys and having all the splashing going on, it has a very chaotic energy,” however, “it was very diagrammed out. There really wasn’t a lot of finding it in the moment because we just had to be so safe with the boys. You know, we had lifeguards on every corner of the frame.”\n\n\tThe sequence’s handheld look is complemented by its sound and score, which synchronously cuts in and out every time the camera submerges and resurfaces. “I’m pretty sure that the actual ducking of the sound of the music was done by Damien (Volpe) and Dave (Paterson) in the sound department. But I was there. I went for those sessions,” composer Johan Lenox tells Variety.\n\n\tWhile the cinematography slowly morphs from the deceptive brightness of a bildungsroman to a darkness of a horror movie over the course of the runtime, the music is consistently eerie from the beginning, cluing audiences that not all is well for this group of kids. “The music is scary, but it’s also like, insanely weird,” says Lenox. “We wanted to telegraph early that some goofy and insane shit is gonna happen.”\n\n\tThe foreboding energy is accented by music’s surreal, sometimes liminal qualities.  “You’re just hearing me wailing into this microphone,” Lenox continues, noting that while the music is strange throughout, there are subtle escalations as the movie progresses. “I don’t think there’s a string instrument in the first third or half of the movie. And then these gritty, noisy sounds from string instruments start to creep in on top of the vocals and eventually supplant them just as the fun sort of stops,” explains Lenox. “Then also there are these tense swelling drone sounds pushing into these hallways and stuff like that. I think there’s a shorter one early in the movie and then there’s like a fucking three or four minute long one by the end.”\n\n\t“The Plague”’s sight and sound does have conspicuous breaks from its sinister mold. Notably, when the kids sneak out at night partway through the film, a handheld long take captures them partying in an alley.\n\t\n\n\t“That’s probably the scene that’s the most extreme version of what I describe as ‘the sandbox,’” says Breckon. “There’re these broad strokes that were very set up and diagrammed out, but then within that, it’s just chaos, letting them go every which way. In terms of actually approaching it, I was trying my best to get us to commit to a 180 degree plus area, thinking we’ll flip around and get the other side, but the kids were going in circles and doing everything, so it very quickly became a 360 area and that posed some challenges. As a cinematographer, you want everybody to be in the back light, and you don’t want moments of too much front light. So I was trying to keep up with that scene as it was unfolding in front of us, but there was no version of me being like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. This isn’t the way that I want it to look.’ Instead, it was like, ‘No, the kids are telling us what it needs to be.’”\n\n\tThe scene reaches a crescendo when one of the boys pops a CD into a boom box and an Italian pop song plays. While the song could easily be mistaken for an obscure, but fitting needle drop, it is still an original piece composed by Lenox for the film. “Let’s fucking write our own thing. Like, why not?” reflects Lenox, appreciating how that the film’s “sonic world is 90% of one thing and then this other thing that comes in. It’s intentional. It could not be more opposite to everything else. I really like it as a structure and shape.”\n\n\tThe song is titled “Corsa Notturna” and it features Italian vocals from a child. It is some of the only vocals in the soundtrack that do not belong to Lenox himself. The song returns once more at the end of the film, in a dance sequence that once again showcases innovative camera techniques.\n\n\tAs the main character dances freely, we spin with him until a unique effect takes hold and it seems as if the rotation is continuing while seamlessly cutting between the boy and his revolving prospective. Breckon, however, explains that the shot was not cut at all. The team created a rotating six-sided mirror that the actor was stationary inside of, allowing him to intermittently appear in the reverse shot while maintaining the outward-facing circular motion. \n\n\t“As he becomes part of the image, and it goes from the people looking at him to just him, he’s actually slowing down. He’s not himself spinning anymore, and he’s starting to take stock of the situation in the moment, but its contrasted by the fact that this mirror is spinning faster and faster,” says Breckon. It is a transfixing effect that closes the film, effectively encapsulating the story’s dizzying approach to self-acceptance.\n\t\n\n\tThe influences for “The Plague” are manifold. Between Breckon and Lenox, they mention taking inspiration from “Raw,” “Carrie” and “The Shining,” but also “Full Metal Jacket,” “8 ½” “The Dark Knight” and “Superbad” to shape the look and sound. The result is something wholly unique: a coming-of-age horror movie that explores the social, psychological and physical viscerality of growing up.\n\n\t“The Plague” debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May. IFC acquired its distribution rights in August and will release the film in theaters on Dec. 24.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrank Darabont was still new to retirement when Netlix released the first season of “Stranger Things” in 2016. He had wrapped his final directing gig — the 2013 “Mob City” episode “Red Light”— and moved with his wife to California’s Central Coast, where he could bask in the wake of an incredible filmography that included “The Shawshank Redemption,” “The Green Mile,” “The Mist,” episodes of “The Walking Dead,” “The Shield,” “Tales from the Crypt” and more.\n\t\n\n\tAbout a decade into retirement, however, Darabont received a call from his agent, informing him that Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of “Stranger Things,” were fans of his work. The feeling was mutual, as Darabont and his wife had binged the Netflix series’ first four seasons several times over. The agents set up a friendly meeting between them when the Duffers were still developing the show’s fifth and final season.\n\n\tShortly thereafter, Dan Trachtenberg, who was attached to direct two episodes of “Stranger Things 5,” dropped out due to a scheduling conflict with his next film, “Predator: Badlands.” In a Hail Mary, the Duffers offered Darabont to take Trachtenberg’s place, and after a week’s consideration, he decided to come out of retirement to join the “Stranger Things” team on set.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWinona Ryder as Joyce Byers and Noah Schnapp as Will Byers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDarabont, 66, directed Episodes 3 and 5 of the final season. Episode 3 released in with Volume 1 on Nov. 26. Titled “The Turnbow Trap,” the episode is packed with action and emotion in the Upside Down and the Rightside Up, showcasing a triumphant return for the director. Episode 5, titled “Shock Jock,” will kick off the three-episode second volume on Dec. 25. (The “Stranger Things” series finale releases in theaters and on Netflix Dec. 31.)\n\t\n\n\tBetween the volumes, Variety spoke with the director to hear about his experience working on “Stranger Things” and his return to the filmmaking craft after twelve years since he last sat in the director’s chair.\n\t\n\t\tWe heard that you were a fan of “Stranger Things” before you met the Duffer brothers. How did you get into the show?\t\n\n\tMy wife and I were fans of the show from early on. We actually had watched all four seasons three or four or maybe even five times. It was so good. Then one day out of the blue, my agent called me and said, “The agent in the office next to me represents the Duffer brothers, and he just wanted me to tell you that they’re big fans of yours.” I said, “That’s fantastic. That’s very flattering. I’m big fans of theirs.” So I thought, “Well, next time I’m in L.A., I’ll get together with them for lunch and just compliment them.” I also was fascinated to know where the heck they came from, because I never heard of the Duffer brothers before they created this huge success on Netflix. So I had lunch with them when I was down in L.A. and I think about a week later, my agent called me again and said they’re inviting you to come direct an episode.\n\t\n\t\tAnd what was your initial reaction to that?\t\n\n\tI hadn’t done it in a while, but they said it’s like riding a bicycle: You don’t forget. And they were right. From the first moment on set, there was nothing unfamiliar about the process for me, though it had been about 13 years. The one episode offer wound up being two episodes and six months in Atlanta. It was a hell of a great experience.\n\t\n\t\tThe Duffer brothers told us that you took about a week to consider the offer. What was going through your mind during that week and what made you want to accept?\t\n\n\tWell, once you’re retired, it’s bliss. My wife and I live on the Central Coast in Monterey, where we don’t have the pressures of Hollywood on our back. I’m enjoying life, and for once I’m no longer the workaholic that I was for almost 30 years in Hollywood. So I had to wrestle with that question and, of course, talk to my wife about it, because I wasn’t going to go to Atlanta unless she came also. I love being married, and I’m not going to be in some place for months without her. We also have five chihuahuas that we would have to take. It was kind of a big move, especially once it became two episodes. We were looking at six months living in a different place. When you’re young and single, it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re an old fart like me who has sunk roots in a community and is comfortable being an unemployed bum, you have to ask yourself “Do I really do this?” But ultimately, it was my love for the show and my wife’s love for the show that kind of overruled all those other concerns and we said, “What the heck? Let’s do it!” I’m glad we did.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNatalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhile you were considering, were you allowed to read the scripts for the episodes that you would direct?\t\n\n\tYeah, they had sent me the scripts and I thought they were terrific. I asked for all of the scripts that they had written thus far so I could track what was going on in the whole thing. They were very generous with sending me those, as long as it was kept under strict secrecy. They’re not quite the nuclear codes, but they’re pretty close. The fascinating thing about our culture is how much people want to dig into this stuff instead of wait to be surprised by what they see on screen. I am the ultimate no-spoilers guy. When I was in junior high, I went to go see “Soylent Green” and some asshole fellow students told me before I went in, “Oh, Soylent Green is people.” I’ve never forgiven them. It’s part of the reason why I’m not on social media and I’m also reluctant to watch trailers. Too much is given away. If I have an interest in something, I want to enjoy it fresh.\n\t\n\t\tDid you notice anything different in the process of filmmaking returning to the director’s chair after 12 or 13 years?\t\n\n\tOh gosh, yeah. Only on “Mob City” did I finally transition from film to digital, and I ended up loving it. It helps a director so much because you don’t ever have to call a cut. Whenever a director calls cut, the energy on a set dissipates. Now you can just say, “Everybody back to one” and the energy remains where it needs to be. The actors remain in the same headspace as you roll three or four takes before calling cut. I love that aspect of it. Filmmakers have so many new tools now. [On “Stranger Things”] our DP was shooting with a techno crane, which can sometimes be frustrating, but can do brilliant things. Also the camera operator is no longer where you’d think he is. He’s not by the camera anymore, but often in some tent off to the side. Same with whoever’s pulling focus. They’re longer next to the camera all the time. So much has been outsourced to these technological devices. But I have to praise this crew. They were absolutely wonderful across the board. A director’s relationship with their crew is very important to me, especially the DP and AD, and I had great on both. Brett Jutkiewicz was my DP and Lisa Rowe was my AD, and they were both fantastic. The Duffers know how to crew up a show, and some of these folks had been with them since Season 1. There were so many resources all around me that could help answer any question. It was a great, collaborative vibe.\n\t\n\t\tEpisode 3 has lots of emotional scenes, including heavy dialogues between Will (Noah Schnapp) and Joyce (Winona Ryder), Will and Robin (Maya Hawke) and Holly (Nell Fisher) and Henry (Jamie Campbell Bower). What was it like working with this ensemble to create those dramatic dynamics?\t\n\n\tI’ve always said that if you have the right actor, there’s not much that they need to hear from a director. I learned that on my very first theatrical feature, “The Shawshank Redemption.” Sometimes a director can get too much into an actor’s ear. Tim Robbins, for example, loves conversations with the director. Morgan Freeman does not. He’s a very intuitive, very instinctive actor, and does a brilliant work. Both of them do. I remember midway through the shoot, I was talking to Morgan about whatever scene we’re going to shoot next and I could see his eyes glazing over. He was just being very polite and listening to me, so I stopped myself and said, “Morgan, you really don’t need to hear this, do you?” and he goes “No, just tell me where to stand and how to turn. That kind of stuff.” From that moment on, I let him do his job. It was a great lesson for a first-time director. Every actor is different.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid the cast of “Stranger Things” prefer more dialogue and direction, or did most of them take control of their own performances? Or was there a mix?\t\n\n\tThey’d been doing it for so long, especially the youngsters who were around 10 when they started and now they’re young adults. They’ve been with these characters for half of their lives, so they’re pretty dialed in. There were little, physical things that needed direction, like when Dustin [Gaten Matarazzo] comes out of the van and drops this big bag of tools right in front of the lens. To have it fall exactly where the camera is going to land took a lot of practice and blocking. I think there were five takes or something. There were also things like Caleb [McLaughlin] running down the stairs after he’s thrown acetone at the Demogorgon. I needed him to pause and look back at a certain moment because I knew something was going to be added in post that needed an extra beat of time. You’re sort of doing all this calculus on set to make sure it can be cut together right. That’s usually where I get more specific and precise with an actor, but aside from that, they know their characters. As a director, my job is to provide the raw materials for what you need in the editing room and also to be head cheerleader on set. You’re cheering everybody on and encouraging them. A small bit of encouragement or recognition from the director can fuel you for another 24 hours of exhausting work\n\t\n\t\tHas this experience made you want to direct more, or are you comfortable returning to retirement?\t\n\n\tI really do love being retired. However, I also love being on a set with creative people, as long as I’m not fighting battles with some evil empire, studio, or network. I bless Netflix for being so supportive. If you have a good situation like that and it can be about the creative process, then its a pleasure. So my longwinded answer winds up being, it depends. If there’s a friendly situation and I’m excited enough about the material, then it’s certainly a possibility. I’m not ruling anything out, but it would have to be something special. “Stranger Things” was a special opportunity for me to be a small part of a very large, wonderful thing that so many people love. I’m grateful to the Duffers for that opportunity. It will always be a great memory working with them and that cast and crew. I will love seeing where their careers take them. They all have such potential and they’re such good people.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI know you don’t like spoilers, but what can we look forward to in Episode 5?\t\n\n\tI think in Episode 5 you’re gonna get some really cool stuff with Henry. I don’t think I’m really spoiling anything by saying that you can you see in Episode 3 that we’re kind of heading into his story more. It was a great thrill to do. We have a lot of good acting and good scenes that you can look forward to.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

Director Josh Safdie and casting director Jennifer Venditti assembled an absolute banger of a team, from Gwyneth Paltrow returning to the screen after several years to unexpected cameos from playwright David Mamet, director Abel Ferrera and many moe..\n\n\tMany of the smaller roles have deep ties to the New York indie filmmaking community or to the world of table tennis, adding to the texture of the sprawling sports saga. The featured co-stars are also revelations, from Kevin O’Leary – “Shark Tank’s” Mr. Wonderful — making his film debut to Odessa D’Azion, most recently seen as a headstrong social media influencer on “I Love L.A,” playing a totally different persona.\n\n\tHere’s a guide to the stars and cameos in Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTimothée Chalamet as Marty Mauser\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTimothée Chalamet might not seem like the obvious choice for an exhilarating sports movie, and yet with Marty Mauser, he throws himself into a role that never stops surprising for all two hours-plus. Chalamet reportedly has been practicing table tennis for six years getting ready to play Mauser, a ping pong champion, hustler and showman loosely based on 1950s sensation Marty Reisman. Chalamet’s beguiling rogue character blends comedy, action and romance in a role totally distinct from Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown” or Willy Wonka, just to name a few. He’s been nominated for two Oscars and has been nominated for a Golden Globe for actor in a comedy movie for “Marty Supreme,” so the only question now is how far can he go?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGwyneth Paltrow as Kay Stone\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGwyneth Paltrow plays Kay Stone, a faded but still glamorous movie star of the 1930s in “Marty Supreme,” and despite a notable age difference, Chalamet’s Marty finds seducing her to be his ultimate achievement. Stone is starring in a play financed by her coarse husband (played by Kevin O’Leary) and finds the over-confident Marty to be an intriguing diversion as he woos her from London to New York. Paltrow convincingly jumps into the erotically charged pairing, marking a welcome return to the screen for the Oscar-winning actress who has been focusing more on her entrepreneurial activities of late.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOdessa A’zion as Rachel Mizler\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tShe’s been making waves in the love-it-or-hate-it HBO series “I Love L.A.” this year, but in “Marty Supreme,” Odessa A’zion takes on a totally different role as a spirited young woman on the Lower East Side in 1950s New York. Rachel Mizler grew up with Marty Mauser but somehow got saddled with an abusive brute of a husband and a job in a pet shop. She finds solace with the unreliable but much more charming Marty, and ends up becoming his accomplice in a dangerous caper to retrieve a dog from an enraged farmer. A’zion has starred in movies like “Hellraiser” since starting out in her mother Pamela Adlon’s series “Better Things.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKevin O’Leary as Milton Rockwell\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKevin O’Leary is best known as “Mr. Wonderful,” a successful Canadian entrepreneur who has been a regular on the long-running reality series “Shark Tank” since 2009. In “Marty Supreme,” O’Leary makes his acting debut playing Milton Rockwell, the manipulative businessman husband of Kay Stone, who first charms Marty with his interest in Marty’s table tennis career before turning on him in the most evil ways. “Marty Supreme” marked a reunion for O’Leary and Paltrow, who has appeared on “Shark Tank.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFran Drescher as Rebecca Mauser\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe former “Nanny” star and SAG-AFTRA president plays Marty Mauser’s long-suffering mother Rebecca, who would prefer Marty work at his uncle’s boring but dependable shoe store instead of trying his luck at table tennis. Drescher got her start in features including “Saturday Night Fever” and “This Is Spinal Tap” before starting her long TV career. As a native of Queens, she brings an authentic New York flavor to the role of the beleaguered mom who doesn’t quite get her ambitious and conniving son.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTyler, the Creator as Wally\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTyler, the Creator is known for his music career and long list of music videos, and the hip-hop artist has appeared in TV shows including “The Mindy Project” and provided voices for “Big Mouth” and other animated projects. “Marty Supreme” is his first major film role, and he plays Marty’s loyal friend Wally, a taxi driver who gets caught up in Marty’s wild scheme to hustle local ping pong players and earn a few extra bucks to finance an expensive trip to an overseas tournament.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKoto Kawaguchi as Koto Endo\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJapanese table tennis champion Koto Kawaguchi makes his movie debut in “Marty Supreme” as Marty Mauser’s formidable opponent Koto Endo. In real life, Kawaguchi has won titles in several deaf ping pong championships. The character of Endo is based on Hiroji Satoh, a Gold Medalist in the 1950s who competed against Marty Reisman and was the first player to use sponge-coated paddles. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAbel Ferrara as Ezra Mishkin\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tVeteran New York indie filmmaker and sometimes-actor Abel Ferrara plays Ezra Mishkin, a violent and vindictive criminal with an overzealous affection for his mangy dog, who tangles with Marty when his pup goes missing. Ferrara helmed gritty, atmospheric crime dramas like “Bad Lieutenant” and “King of New York” that appear to be big influences on both Safdie brothers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSandra Bernhard as Judy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tComic actress Sandra Bernhard plays Judy, a yenta neighbor of the Mauser family. The Michigan native is a longtime New Yorker, and with formative roles like Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy,” she cemented her place in Gotham’s film and theater worlds. The famously outspoken actress went on to appear on “Roseanne” and recently made appearances on “Severance” and “Percy Jackson and the Olympians.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDavid Mamet as Glen Nordmann\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of MasterClass\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBefore he was a well-known playwright, screenwriter and director, David Mamet was a ping pong hustler. No, seriously. In college, Mamet and his friend, comedian and table tennis champ Jonathan Katz, hustled onlookers by letting Mamet, the lesser player, win games for money. Later on, Mamet became a habitué of the upper West Side table tennis gym owned by Marty Reisman, the ping pong legend whose life inspired “Marty Supreme.” Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick were among the parlor’s other famous patrons. In “Marty Supreme,” Mamet plays Glen Nordmann, director of the play that Gwyneth Paltrow’s faded star Kay Stone is starring in.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIsaac Mizrahi as Merle\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFashion designer Isaac Mizrahi normally plays himself in his onscreen appearances, in shows such as “Sex and the City” and “Gossip Girl.” In “Marty Supreme,” he takes on one of his few fictional roles as Merle, a cheeky press agent for retired movie star Kay Stone who gets to deliver a memorable line. Mizrahi, an old family friend of the Safdies, had hired Josh and Benny Safdie to do a campaign for Liz Claiborne back in 2009, so he goes way back with the brothers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPenn Gillette, Larry Sloman, John Catsimatidis, Philippe Petit and More\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDirector Josh Safdie packed the cast of “Marty Supreme” with a bevy of intriguing cameos from colorful character actors and non-professionals alike. \n\n\nMagician Penn Jillette has a small but unforgettable scene as Hoff, a grizzled hoarder with an itchy trigger finger.\nMusic writer and NY fixture Larry “Ratso” Sloman plays Marty’s uncle and employer Murray Mauser, who finds Marty to be a disappointment as a shoe store clerk.\n French highwire artist Philippe Petit makes an appearance as an MC at a Brussels ping pong match.\nGrocery store magnate and talkshow host John Catsimatidis plays Christopher Galanis, father to Marty’s friend. \nBasketball star George “The Iceman” Gervin shows up as Lawrence, the owner of the ping pong parlor. Other basketball stars include ex-NBA players Tracy McGrady and Kemba Walker, who play members of the Harlem Globetrotters.\nAuthor Pico Iyer plays Ram Sethi, the head of the International Table Tennis Association.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTPUSA’s AmericaFest Conference Showcased the Right’s Civil War\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe World’s Most Important Motorcycles Can Now Fit on Your Coffee Table\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Give FIFA’s Roblox Deal Context, Look at YouTube\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKate Middleton Wears Favorite Blazé Milano Coat to Royals’ Christmas Day Service at Sandringham\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

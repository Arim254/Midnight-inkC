    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel on Monday went after Donald Trump for his scathing review of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show.\n\n\t“Bad Bunny got a bad review from our bad president, unfortunately,” Kimmel said during Monday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” “He wrote, ‘The Super Bowl halftime show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst ever. It makes no sense. It’s an affront to the greatness of America and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A and around the world.’ This is a man who paid off a porn star who spanked him with his own face on a magazine.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel then went after Turning Point USA’s rival programming, the “All American Halftime Show.” The late-night host joked that TPUSA should’ve “put on the Kristi Noem shoots her puppy bowl because this was not a good program.”\n\n\n\t“[Conservatives] complain about how bad everything is, and then they do it worse,” Kimmel added. “And not only do they do it worse, they do it in jorts. Of course, the gang at Fox News thought it was great, and Turning Point, they seemed happy with it too.”\n\n\tThe show then cut to a TPUSA rep telling Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade that the organization plans to do “another halftime show for the country next year.”\n\n\t“Next year it will be Lara Trump with a Ted Nguyen cover band,” Kimmel quipped. “They’ve got to do it for the country.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKid Rock, who headlined the rival “All-American Halftime Show,” gave his review of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime performance during a Monday appearance on Fox News’ “The Ingrahm Angle.”\n\n\t“Like most people, I didn’t understand any of it,” Rock said of the show (via The Wrap), which Bad Bunny performed entirely in Spanish. “I saw there’s a lot of dancers and a lot of big to-do stuff. And, you know, he said he wanted to have a dance party; it looked like he had one.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “Not my cup of tea, but I don’t fault that kid for doing the Super Bowl, getting in front of a global audience. I fault the NFL for putting him in that position and Turning Point for having to come out and have an alternative for people to watch. You know, it’s just — poor kid.”\n\n\n\tRock wasn’t the only conservative voice with criticism for Bad Bunny, who is largely shunned by the Right for his outspoken objections to ICE and Puerto Rican roots. President Donald Trump posted a scathing review on Truth Social shortly after Bad Bunny ended his set.\n\n\t“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” Trump wrote. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World. This ‘Show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the Best Stock Market and 401(k)s in History!”\n\t\n\n\tBad Bunny hasn’t been without supporters, however. Pop sensation Lady Gaga, who performed alongside Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl Halftime Show, wrote on Instagram that it was her “absolute honor” to sing with the album of the year winner.\n\n\t“Thank you Benito for inviting me and thank you to the entire cast for welcoming me onto your stage,” she wrote. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”\n\n\tBravo host Andy Cohen was also vocal in his support of Bad Bunny. He went on Instagram Threads to troll anyone taking shots at the Puerto Rican superstar. One Threads user wrote that the “All American Halftime Show” had them “fighting back tears,” to which Cohen replied, “Me too. The idea that I can wear jorts while looking like a prune gives me hope about getting older! Kinda getting misty just typing it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichael Douglas revealed at the recent TCM Classic Film Festival in New York City that director Oliver Stone originally disliked his acting in 1987’s “Wall Street” so much that he asked Douglas if he was taking drugs during production. \n\n\t“Okay, so we were finishing the second week of filming, and there was a knock on my door. ‘Hey Mike, it’s s Oliver. Can I come in?'” Douglas remembered (via EW). “I say, ‘Yeah, come on in.’ He comes in the trailer and sits down. He says to me, ‘You okay?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’m okay.’ [He says], ‘Are you doing drugs?’ I said, ‘No, I’m not doing drugs.’ And he said, ‘Because you look like you’ve never acted before in your life.'”\n\t\n\n\tDouglas informed Stone that he wasn’t watching the film’s dailies to check on his performance “because I’m one of those guys that always sees what’s wrong or what’s not going to be in the film… so I don’t pay attention to the dailies. So I said, ‘I guess I’d better take a look,’ and he said, ‘Yeah, you better.'”\n\n\n\t“And then I’m looking at them really hard, and critically, and they seemed pretty good,” Douglas continued about when filming resumed. “So I keep saying, ‘I think it’s pretty good.'”\n\n\tStone eventually came around and agreed with his star, who played the iconic role of Gordon Gekko opposite Charlie Sheen and Daryl Hannah in “Wall Street.” The film centers on the relationship between Sheen’s young stockbroker and Douglas’ wealthy corporate raider. \n\n\t“He was willing for me to hate his guts for the rest of this movie to get that extra little push,” Douglas said of Stone’s original insults, which he did not take personally. “His record of successes with actors is quite impressive. So I’m deeply, deeply appreciative of the fact that it gave me part and the fact that he pushed me to another level.”\n\t\n\n\tDouglas ended up winning the Oscar for best actor thanks to his performance in “Wall Street.” He was also awarded a Golden Globe and the National Board of Review’s best actor prize. He returned as Gordon Gekko in Stone’s 2010 sequel “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.”\n\n\tIn Matt Zoller Seitz’s “The Oliver Stone Experience,” Stone had this to say about Douglas: “I think he was more comfortable [playing a villain], but I think Michael struggles for comfort levels. I mean, he’s not comfortable, per se; he’s always looking. If you notice, he moves his shoulders a lot. When he’s misused, which he sometimes is in films, that cockiness of Gekko can be irritating, smarmy, in the wrong roles. But I like Michael when he’s doing it in good movies, with good material. I liked him in ‘Wall Street’ very much.”\n",

His popularity previously stemmed from his  bona fides as a New York City police officer and a long run as an agent for the U.S. Secret Service.\n\t\n\n\tHe has also hosted popular radio programs, and his old show was used to replace the long-running show hosted by Rush Limbaugh. A one-hour radio show Bongino did for Westwood One also ran at one time on the Fox Nation streaming service.\n\n\n\tHis first stint as a contributor at Fox News started in 2019, and by 2021 he was hosting the weekend program  “Unfiltered With Dan Bongino.” He left the company in 2023, citing difficulties in agreeing on new terms for his next contract. “You know, I’ve been there doing hits and working there for ten years… so the show ending was tough,” he said on his podcast in 2023. “And I want you to know it’s not some big conspiracy.

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart covered the conservative outrage over Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show.\n\n\t“Mr. Bunny killed it, despite being trapped in an inescapable sugarcane hedge maze,” Stewart joked. “He had Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin and The Mandalorian. He threw a wedding! He held a model U.N.! He even had the time to make a con-ed service stop midconcert. He did it all. ‘Just reboot the box and enjoy! De nada.’ It was joyful and infectious and…”\n\t\n\n\tThe show then cut to a clip of conservative commentator Benny Johnson calling the performance “the single worst halftime show in NFL history.”\n\n\n\t“Oh, right. I forgot,” said a dejected Stewart. “For a significant portion of Americans, everything that happens must uniformly be filtered through a particular MAGA-centric worldview and judged on how well it conforms to that traditional vision, which doesn’t include knowing where the biblioteca is.”\n\n\tLater in the show, Stewart played clips of Newsmax anchors claiming that “doing a halftime show in all Spanish is not unifying” and that the performance “divided” America amid great political turmoil.\n\n\t“Why the fuck is it the Super Bowl Halftime entertainer’s job to unify the country?” Stewart said. “Isn’t there another person whose job description is more along those lines? Let me ask you a question… What did that person do to unify the country?”\n\n\tStewart then cut to a clip of NBC News covering President Donald Trump‘s Truth Social review of Bad Bunny’s halftime show. Trump wrote that it was “absolutely terrible, one of the worst ever,” adding that “nobody understands a word this guy is saying.”\n\t\n\n\t“Nobody? I love that he thinks Bad Bunny is the one guy in the world that’s fluent in Spanish,” Stewart joked. “’Nobody understands it. It’s a dead language.’ You know the right has a lot of balls complaining that Bad Bunny didn’t do enough to unify this country when you only found out a few days ago that Puerto Rico’s a part of it!”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNoam Ash was about 27 years old when he and his then-boyfriend called it quits. At the time, Ash didn’t have much money nor another place to live.\n\n\tWhat did he do?\n\n\tHe moved in with his grandparents.\n\n\t“I lived with them for over a year,” Ash tells me. “It was the best year, but honestly, I was so mortified and embarrassed by the whole thing. I did not want anyone to know that I lived with them. But my manager at the time thought it was hysterical. She said, ‘You have to write something about this.’ And then I did and this is the result of that.”\n\t\n\n\tThe this is “Bookends,” a rom-com written by and starring Ash as an aspiring novelist who finds romance with his grandparents’ doctor (Charlie Barnett) when he moves in with them after he finds out his boyfriend (Spencer Belko) is having an affair with their spin instructor (Jared Reinfeldt).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoam Ash and Charlie Barnett in “Bookends”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAsh’s grandparents died before the movie, directed by Mike Doyle, got made. “They did know that I was writing this, this piece, and that it was really a love letter to them,” Ash says.\n\n\tCaroline Aaron and F. Murray Abraham play Nate’s grandparents. As the movie unfolds, the grandfather begins to show signs of dementia. “For my mom and my aunt, it’s their dad,” Ash says. “When they watched the movie, they were like, ‘Oh, my god, it’s dad.’ My mother asked if I showed Murray videos of grandpa. I was like, ‘No. It’s all in the writing, honey. My mom was like, ‘How does he know the mannerisms and the hand gestures and everything?’”\n\t\n\n\tNot only is Ash openly gay but so is Barnett. Authentic casting was important to Ash and Doyle. “That was something Mike and I discussed a lot,” Ash says. “We also wanted to show that Jews come in all different shades, shapes and sizes and Charlie’s mom was actually Jewish. He was like, ‘I wasn’t raised Jewish. I was like, ‘That’s OK. We’ll claim you.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tF. Murray Abraham and Caroline Aaron in “Bookends”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith an upswing in political attacks aimed at the queer community, Ash admits he initially worried that the movie would have trouble finding a distributor.\n\n\tBut then “Heated Rivalry” came along.\n\n\t“I think they proved that in the absolute biggest way that you can have the steamiest, gayest, most homoerotic show probably ever made for television, and it could also have huge mainstream success,” Ash says. “That has put my mind at ease.”\n\n\t“Bookends” premieres Feb. 9 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from  “As I Climb Onto Your Back, I Will Promise Not to Sting,” Episode 7 of Season 3 of “Tell Me Lies,” now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tIf there’s one character on “Tell Me Lies” who could give Grace Van Patten’s Lucy a run for her money when it comes to finding themselves in anxiety-inducing, nail-biting situations, it’s Cat Missal’s Bree.  \n\n\n\tIn the first six episodes of Season 3  of “Tell Me Lies” — the Hulu drama created by Meaghan Oppenheimer — the Baird College sophomore has already gotten herself involved in an array of less than ideal situations. We’ve watched as she befriended — then promptly blew up at —  17-year-old freshman Amanda (Iris Apatow) whom Bree suspected was sleeping with Baird professor (and Bree’s Season 2 love interest) Oliver (Tom Ellis), whose house she later showed up to after a few hours of Valentine’s Day frat party drinking. But instead of finding Oliver there, Bree broke down into sobs on the shoulder of Oliver’s wife and fellow Baird professor, Marianne (Gabriella Pession) — all while still donning her Goth attire. (For the record, Missal is definitely aware of how unprofessional all these student-teacher relationships are: “Marianne should be embarrassed about the way that she acts and interacts with the students,” they tell Variety. “It’s just all so convoluted.”)\n\t\n\n\tIn a rare yet welcome reprieve from Bree’s more distressing plot points this season, we’ve gotten to watch a romance blossom between her and Wrigley (Spencer House) — though that too becomes all the less sweet when you’re forced to remember that Bree is dating Evan (Branden Cook), while Wrigley is still with her best friend and roommate, Pippa (Sonia Mena).\n\t\n\n\tNow, in Season 3’s seventh episode, Bree finds herself at the center of the drama once again; Evan, desperate to hold on to her, sabotages the evening by getting her mom (whom she’s never really known) drunk ahead of Bree’s photography exhibit, turning what should’ve been a celebratory night into a chaotic one. And as if things couldn’t get worse, the long-kept secret that it was Lucy who Evan cheated with freshman year is finally revealed when Bree happens upon a few incriminating Facebook posts.\n\n\tBelow, Missal spoke to Variety about Bree and Evan’s relationship, that nerve-racking photo exhibit and why their character is “kind of a villain” in their eyes. \n\t\n\t\tHow did you and Spencer House feel when you learned your characters would be getting together after two seasons of barely being friends?\t\n\n\tThat was definitely on our radar. We were like, “Have we ever even spoken in the show?” Spencer is such a great actor, so I was really excited to get to play off of him and to create this love story between them. We had this knowing and this understanding, which I was really grateful for, that it had to be good. Because if it wasn’t good and it didn’t feel true, it just wouldn’t make sense. And people would be like, “This is weird.”\n\t\n\t\tPeople love Bree and Wrigley. Are you surprised by that?\t\n\n\tI’m surprised. I haven’t seen too much because I’m not really online. I hear things through my partner and my sisters tell me things. I’m really glad people are enjoying it as much as they are.\n\t\n\t\tThe biggest part of this episode, for Bree, is the doomed night at the photo exhibit with her mom. It’s a tense night, all thanks to Evan, who got her mom drunk in a strange power play. Bree doesn’t know that, though. So how do you think she reads her mom’s behavior?\t\n\n\tI think that she knows she’s drunk. The thing I love about Bree is that she’s so observant and she’s so empathetic. And so even though her mom is there and shows up drunk, she’s still trying to take care of her. She’s not just like, “All right, you need to leave.” She’s grateful that she even showed up at all, and she really wants the relationship to work, which makes it so sad. \n\t\n\t\tDo you feel like Bree was embarrassed?  \t\n\n\tI think she’s more hurt. She doesn’t really get too embarrassed, which is a really cool trait of hers. I wish I was that way. But she often just lets it roll off her back. I think it’s a testament to what she’s been through in her life.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEvan’s actions are all the more sinister considering his earlier exchange with Oliver, who tells him Bree needs to feel like she needs him. In the end, though, it works. Do you think there’s truth to what Oliver says?  \t\n\n\tOh, gosh, there is truth in that. But that’s a manipulative tactic. That is textbook manipulation. [Evan] is entrapping her. He’s just convincing her that he is the only safe space in her life and so that’s why she chooses him again. Who knows if her mom had shown up and wasn’t wasted and [been] able to support her. Say that night went great and then the Wrigley situation happened. Maybe she would have gone to her mom. Who knows! He is making it so that she is isolated, and he is the only person that she can turn to.\n\t\n\t\tIf she knew Evan had taken her mom to drinks, would she have ended it?\t\n\n\tI really would hope so — I don’t know. It’s hard to say, because all of these people just make so many bad mistakes, and seem to just go back to each other. I think Bree has somewhat of a moral compass, but, like, she just doesn’t know. She just doesn’t know what’s up. She just doesn’t have people. She would obviously feel incredibly betrayed and mad at him and heartbroken. But I don’t know if it would change her mind about her mom. She might still feel the same way — like, “You were just so easily convinced by my boyfriend.” \n\t\n\t\tWhat can you tease about the future of her relationship with her mom after the exhibit? She’s clearly not at the wedding…\t\n\n\tThat’s the beginning of the end — or the beginning of the beginning of the end. The relationship can only go downhill from there, which is so sad. I start to say something, and then I’m like, “God, this is so depressing.”\n\t\n\t\tWe also get another conversation between Marianne and Bree, where she says Oliver needs to be stopped. Do you think Bree genuinely feels that way? \t\n\n\tI think it’s actually kind of selfish of her. She’s doing it, seemingly, for Amanda and so that he doesn’t ever do this to other girls. But I think it’s coming from a selfish place because of how she never dealt with any of [her emotions around that]. It’s still just all right underneath the surface for her, and from my perspective, has a lot of her own emotions tied into it.\n\t\n\t\tAt the end of the episode, Bree learns that Lucy was the girl Evan slept with freshman year, right after she learns that Wrigley slept with Pippa. Do you think she would’ve cared so much about Lucy and Evan had that second betrayal not happened? \t\n\n\tI don’t think she would have been in as big of a spiral as she was in. When we were doing the costume fitting, Charlotte [Svenson] was like, “You’re in this for 18 scenes.” And I was like, “What?” Bree just keeps going. She doesn’t slow down. She’s just in a really bad state of mind. So I think she would have been able to process it differently. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tSome may feel that what Bree is doing — cheating on Evan, and lying to Pippa — is worse than the one-time drunken hookup between Lucy and Evan. \t\n\n\tI agree. I think that what Lucy did was for attention, and what Bree is doing is incredibly secretive and way deeper. It just feels worse. I think she just doesn’t know how to operate in what she’s doing. She’s kind of a villain in my eyes. If you wanted to be with Wrigley, just leave Evan! The second you’re like, “Oh, I have feelings for Wrigley,” you definitely shouldn’t be with Evan. She’s just a lost little puppy.\n\t\n\t\tDo you think Evan has any idea about Bree and Wrigley?\t\n\n\tI think Bree is convinced that he has absolutely no clue. Even if he did think, “Oh, that’s a little weird,” she could fully convince him that they’re just friends and she’s got the situation completely under control. \n\t\n\t\tBack to the wedding timeline. We know that Lucy is a bridesmaid, so how did they mend their friendship?  \t\n\n\tThat’s a great question. The only thought that I had given it was that they haven’t talked about it. That it’s something that Bree does — just buries. I think that’s the truth. I mean, I don’t know for sure. I didn’t talk to Meaghan about it. But, seemingly, the way that Bree operates is compartmentalize, compartmentalize, compartmentalize. If they were to have had a conversation, it would have just been Lucy groveling and [Bree] being like, “OK, I’ll forgive you.”\n\t\n\t\tBree’s friendships are also limited, which might play a role?  \t\n\n\tCompletely. That is actually such a joke from Season 1, where I just was like, “Does she just not have any other friends?” We’re at her wedding and she just has Pippa and Lucy here, who are shit friends. It’s kind of a big joke. But I do think that for the sake of the show, it does really drive them back to each other because they are seemingly the only people in each other’s lives.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your reaction to the finale script?\t\n\n\tMy jaw was just on the floor. I was gagged. I was like, “Oh my God, this is going to be crazy!” People are going to lose their minds.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMultiple artists are seeking to leave the Wasserman Agency after details regarding founder-CEO Casey Wasserman’s connection to late financier and convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell emerged in documents last week, sources tell Variety. \n\n\tThe artists’ agents are said to have presented Wasserman with an ultimatum that he step down and divest or sell the company, which he thus far has declined. However, Wasserman is said to be meeting with top executives at the company later this week to determine a course of action. He is chairman of the organizing committee for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where he is also facing pressure to step down.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a house on fire,” one source says. \n\n\n\tSeveral artists, beginning with Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino and including Chappell Roan and top indie acts Wednesday, Water From Your Eyes and Beach Bunny, have posted social-media messages expressing unhappiness with Wasserman and are seeking or beginning the process to leave.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe agency is one of the largest in the music business, with a roster also featuring Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, Lorde, Phish, Raye, SZA, Joni Mitchell, Janelle Monae, Geese and frontman Cameron Winter, Tyler, the Creator, Wednesday and hundreds of others. Wasserman’s artist roster was taken down from its website at some point over the last couple of days, presumably in response to artists’ requests for their names to be removed.\n\n\tHowever, the situation is more complicated for agents, who typically are bound by contracts spanning three to five years, whereas the artists are not. Complicating the situation further, artists often tend to be more loyal to their agents than agencies, and many follow their agents from one company to another over years. Similarly, agents often travel together from one company to another, sometimes over decades.\n\t\n\n\tThe situation was said to reach a “fever pitch” over the weekend, one source says, and has only accelerated from there. The executives, who include such veteran agents as Marty Diamond, Duffy McSwiggin and others, are said to be rallying together in an effort to maintain a unified company in some form. Sources say that several offers have been made for the company, along with the possibility for the executives to buy the division themselves, although it is unclear how serious or realistic any of the proposals are.\n\n\tRepresentatives for Wasserman and many of the above artists either declined or did not respond to Variety’s requests for comment. News of the impending ultimatum was first reported by the Wrap late Sunday, although rumors had been circulating since the latest batch of Epstein documents was released.\n\n\tIn a social media post Monday, the band Wednesday wrote, “Last week we were among the hundreds of artists who were aghast to find out about Casey Wasserman’s communications with Ghislaine Maxwell,” it reads in part. “It’s also important that we acknowledge the team of people we work with at the Wasserman agency as decent and trustworthy people with whom we’ve worked several years dating back to a time prior to their connection with Wasserman.”\n\n\tThe agency was formed in 2021 after a number of agents and artists parted ways with Paradigm, and Wasserman merged that company with his existing sports division. That sports division is not said to be at a similar crisis point.\n\n\tOn balance, Wasserman is not currently connected to any of Epstein’s crimes or misconduct and is documented as riding on Epstein’s private jet once (on a 2002 humanitarian trip with a Clinton Foundation delegation), and exchanging raunchy emails with Maxwell while he was married, years before the crimes became public. He has apologized for the connection, saying he was “terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” He is also the head of several charities.\n\n\tHowever, it is the second such scandal in 18 months for Wasserman. In July of 2024 — ironically, during the Paris Olympics — a damning report emerged in which Wasserman, grandson of the vaunted Hollywood dealmaker Lew Wasserman, was accused of having “serial” affairs with junior employees over many years. These reported indiscretions — on which Wasserman did not comment — caused a stir at the time but seemed to fade as weeks went by. Billie Eilish’s departure from the agency was perceived to be connected to the report, although multiple sources tell Variety she was already leaving when it emerged.\n\t\n\n\tComing so soon after the previous allegations, optics — particularly for a company named after its founder — can matter more than facts.\n\n\t“As an artist represented by Wasserman, I did not consent to having my name or my career tied to someone with this kind of association to exploitation,” Cosentino wrote. “Staying quiet isn’t something I can do in good conscience — especially in a moment when men in power are so often protected, excused, or allowed to move on without consequence. Pretending this isn’t a big deal is not an option for me.”\n\n\tVariety will have more on the situation as it develops.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe ghost in Joko Anwar‘s “Ghost in the Cell” doesn’t haunt – it holds accountable.\n\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Anwar used his Berlinale Forum entry “Ghost in the Cell” to channel societal anxieties about systemic corruption and environmental destruction through supernatural horror, creating a prison-set thriller that treats its genre elements as political instruments rather than escapist entertainment.\n\n\n\tThe film centers on inmates at an Indonesian correctional facility whose fragile power structures fracture when a new prisoner arrives with a vengeful supernatural entity that hunts those with the darkest aura. As the body count rises, survival depends on collective action among the incarcerated population.\n\t\n\n\tFor Anwar, the prison setting provided a concentrated laboratory for exploring societal hierarchies. “A prison is like a miniature of the society and it mirrors hierarchy, power dynamics in it, also fear, violence, morality all compressed in one confined space with politeness stripped out,” the director explains. “Inside a prison, the consequences are immediate. However, while everyone is trapped in the same system, not everyone faces equal consequences including punishment.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker deliberately wove environmental destruction and judicial inequality into the narrative fabric rather than treating them as background decoration. “The environmental and political realities have always been the origin of horror, not only as a sideshow,” Anwar says. “I let the ghost carry the truth that the system made by humans refuses to articulate.”\n\t\n\n\tCentral to the film’s approach is treating the supernatural presence as an active agent rather than pure metaphor. “The ghost was never meant to represent an idea. It has intent, intelligence, and limits. It chooses its victims,” Anwar notes. “So the ghost isn’t a metaphor and becomes an actual character, shaped by trauma and injustice. It doesn’t deliver moral comfort. It delivers consequences.”\n\n\tManaging the large ensemble within the volatile prison environment required extensive preparation. Anwar developed detailed backstories for every character, including day players, and conducted group rehearsals that mirrored the film’s factional dynamics. “I let every actor have other character’s sheet in their group and left other characters from different groups as a mystery so they can feel the danger, suspicion, coming from other groups of inmates,” he explains.\n\n\tThe tonal balancing act proved crucial, mixing violence, satire and uncomfortable humor. “Humor in the film doesn’t release tension, it sharpens it,” Anwar says. “Laughter should come with discomfort. If the audience laughs and then immediately questions why they did, the tone is working.”\n\n\tLanding in Forum, known for championing formally ambitious and politically challenging cinema, aligned with Anwar’s intentions. “Forum is a section where films are allowed to be uncomfortable and unresolved,” he observes, hoping international audiences recognize the systems portrayed as uncomfortably familiar rather than exotic.\n\n\tThe director wants viewers to leave questioning institutional complicity. “I hope they ask themselves who the system is actually designed to protect,” he says. “The film isn’t asking whether corruption or destruction exists, we all know it does. It’s asking why we’re so comfortable letting them become normal.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\tThe production represents another collaboration between Anwar and producer Tia Hasibuan through their Jakarta-based Come and See Pictures, alongside Rapi Films, South Korea’s Barunson E&A – the studio behind Bong Joon Ho’s Oscar-winning “Parasite” – and Legacy Pictures. The ensemble cast features Abimana Aryasatya, Lukman Sardi, Bront Palarae, Aming, Rio Dewanto, Morgan Oey and Tora Sudiro.\n\t\n\n\tBarunson E&A is handling worldwide sales on the project as part of a two-year agreement with Come and See Pictures.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe producers behind Bad Bunny’s triumphant Super Bowl LX Halftime Show had a problem: The NFL wouldn’t allow more than 25 carts to bring equipment on to the all-grass Levi’s Stadium field in Santa Clara, Calif. To pull off Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio’s and his creative team’s tremendous production plans, that meant something would have to give.\n\n\tLuckily,  a solution to one of the show’s most stunning visuals — the pastizales (grass fields and other plants) that harken back to Bad Bunny’s native Puerto Rican landscape — was to make it real people. Production designers Bruce and Shelly Rodgers, as well as Julio Himede recruited around 380 people to dress up as the grass, allowing for easier on-and-off staging.\n\t\n\n\t“That solution of making the plant people, and then the plant people getting on and off in time, plus all the sets and all the performers — it was audacious in every direction,” said creative director Harriet Cuddeford. “There were over 330 actual cast performers in addition to the plant people. It was just huge.”\n\n\tBad Bunny and the event’s producers and directors pulled off what may have been the most intricate halftime extravaganza in Super Bowl history. With superstar guests like Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, a real-life wedding and authentic business owners (including Los Angeles’ own Villa’s Tacos), the “Benito Bowl” was planned with many moving parts that could have gone wrong.\n\n\t“There’s just so many variables in live TV,” Cuddeford said. “Even the weather. It was on a real grass field, and there’s no roof. We had to have backup rain plans. There were so many things that could have caused an issue. But it just kind of almost flawlessly unfolded before our eyes. We were all just like, ‘Wow, it worked!’”\n\t\n\n\tDirector Hamish Hamilton — who has produced countless Super Bowl Halftime Shows, Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and more — said, “It was the biggest team effort of a show I have ever been involved in.”\n\n\tHere are some details Cuddeford and Hamilton shared about this year’s Bad Bunny halftime show.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBad Bunny managed to pull off several stunts while singing at the same time. At one point, much to the producers’ chagrin, the singer climbed a tall utility poll without any safety rigging.\t\n\n\t“He refused to wear a harness,” Hamilton said. “He was like, ‘I don’t need it.’ There are all kinds of legal ramifications to that, which is not really my thing, but interestingly enough, when he decided he wasn’t going to wear a harness, we were able to then put a camera on the pole to look down at him climbing up!”\n\n\tAdded Cuddeford: “There was all safety and rigging and all of that available, obviously, of course, but he didn’t want it. He does his own stunts, that guy, and he learned it in about three minutes. Straight up that pole. At rehearsal, we were all like, ‘Is he gonna be OK?’ But he just went straight up there, and managed his vocals. Very agile. He could just, like, handle anything.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of stunts, Bad Bunny falling through the roof of the pink casita was one thing — but it also had to be perfectly timed to the pre-tape of him doing the same thing as seen by the family watching TV inside.\t\n\n\t“The stunt itself, to fall through the roof, wasn’t so crazy — there’s a trap door,” Cuddeford said. “They just literally open it, and pull it out underneath him. But it required so much meticulous planning, because we cut straight into the pre-tape. Inside the pre-tape was the shot on the TV of him falling through the roof of the Super Bowl — so the family in the la casita were watching the Super Bowl live, and then he fell onto their table. That’s basically two different pre-tapes: The pre-tape inside the house, and then there’s the pre-tape on the field of him falling through the roof during the dress rehearsal. And then comping that all together, then cutting to the transition of him falling through the roof and be able to kick the front door open.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe couple who got married during the halftime show is from Ontario, Calif., and had sent Bad Bunny a wedding invitation on a lark.\t\n\n\tAccording to Hamilton, the engaged couple wound up with 15 extra wedding announcements — so they sent most to local businesses with the hope of maybe getting some free wedding perks. But the last invite? “They were like, ‘Why don’t we send one to Bad Bunny? Lots of people send wedding invitations to him, so why not,’” Hamilton said. “Bad Bunny’s office reached out, and they thought, ‘Amazing, maybe we’ll get a signed photo. But they were invited to a Zoom call, which they thought was kind of weird.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the Zoom call, they learned the plan: Bad Bunny was inviting them to get married at the Super Bowl. “An overprinting of wedding invitations led to a series of events where they wound up getting married during Bad Bunny’s performance at the Super Bowl!” Hamilton said.\n\n\tThe couple had planned to make Bad Bunny’s “Baile Inolvidable” be their first dance. “And so, they went from planning to play it at their wedding to being on the Super Bowl with him live, singing it,” Cuddeford said. “And with the bonus prize of Lady Gaga being the wedding singer as well.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDespite rumors on social media, Bad Bunny didn’t hand his recently won Grammy to Liam, the young boy from Minnesota who had been imprisoned by ICE. But that moment is meant to convey a personal connection to the performer’s childhood.\t\n\n\t“The kid is somebody that we cast,” Cuddeford said. “But the story behind that was Benito’s idea. He’d grown up watching his idols on TV getting awards. In his life now, he stands on stage and gets given awards by his idols. He knew the Grammys were coming up, and he was hoping to win something. And then obviously he won Best Album last weekend. And so, he really wanted to inspire the next generation.”\n\n\tThat’s why the boy at the Super Bowl was wearing an outfit similar to one a young Benito is seen wearing in a well-known photo of the superstar as a young child. “This is really representing a younger version of himself,  with the hope of him inspiring  the kids of today,” she said.\n\t\n\t\tDid Bad Bunny get his Grammy back?\t\n\n\t“I actually don’t know if he took it back,” Cuddeford said. “Knowing him, he might have just left it with the kid, honestly.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRicky Martin \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBad Bunny personally selected Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin as his guests; Martin, of course, is a Puerto Rican childhood idol. And the song Martin sang, “Lo Que Le Paso a Hawaii,” not only resonates in Puerto Rico, but in Hawai’i too.\t\n\n\t“That’s a very meaningful song, almost kind of a plea to not turn Puerto Rico into Hawai’i,” Cuddeford said. “To make sure that it kind of retains its culture and its identity. It was just very powerful to have a Puerto Rican icon whom he deeply loves and respects to join him and to perform that song. It was something that during his residency, he had many guest artists would come and sing that. He’d never managed to align to have Ricky do it, so he was so excited to have Ricky do it at the Super Bowl.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThose guest small business owners, vendors and workers are all real-life people, flown into the Super Bowl for the show.\t\n\n\tThat includes Los Angeles’ own Villa’s Tacos founder Victor Villa, as well as a real piragua (Puerto Rican shave ice dessert) vendor, boxers Xander Zayas and Emiliano Vargas, a real nail technician, barber and more. Even the priest that married the Ontario couple is an actual, ordained minister.\n\n\t“The performance is celebrating normal people, and what it is to be human and love and have joy, and really appreciate one another,” Cuddeford said. “This was to show how much he values his community, to celebrate normal people on the world’s biggest stage, especially people who are of importance in in Latino culture. He’s a very authentic person, Benito, and it’s about just being authentic and very real and very human.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd yes, that was Maria Antonia Cay, better known as Toñita, taking a shot with Bad Bunny inside a re-creation of her famed Brooklyn landmark the Caribbean Social Club.\t\n\n\t“We faithfully recreated this  iconic, very important for the culture, Puerto Rican bar in Brooklyn,” Cuddeford said. “And then we flew Toñita out to be part of the performance. And you saw him do the shot with her at the point in the song when he sings about doing a shot with Toñita.”\n\t\n\t\tThere were few hairy moments, including one that involved a camera crane spinning out of control.\t\n\n\tThat crane, which was used in the beginning sequence around the casita, lost digital connection — “So, literally, it started spinning like a hose out of control,” Hamilton said. “But probably a second before we needed the shot, the camera locked again in perfect position, and we were allowed to take it!”\n\n\tAnd at another point, there’s a bit of a wobble from one of the low angle cameras that’s looking up at the casita. “Basically, everybody’s racing for a shot, and the handheld cameraman taking the shot gets hit by the Chapman dolly trying to make a shot after — and they collide, and that’s why there was a wobble. It’s split-second timing.”\n\n\tHamilton admitted it’s “terrifying” watching the camera operators running around each other as they get their shots. “In the performance of ‘NuevaYol,’ there are moments when the cameras literally get to their point of shooting half a second before they’re on,” he said. “The crane comes out, the cameras run half the way along a football pitch and literally, then run into Benito!”\n\t\n\n\tAdded Cuddeford: “The camera work was insane and so intricate and so carefully planned and such a feat, and could have just gone so wrong at any moment.”\n\t\n\t\tThe use of all those grass people made for a very different kind of staging — and the producers debated for some time on how to make the show visually unique for home viewers while still making it watchable for the fans in the stands at Levi’s Stadium.\t\n\n\t“Probably more than any other show, this was choreographed to the camera,” Hamilton said. “With the grass people, it was quite enclosed. And so there were many debates about  the camera versus the people in the audience in the stadium. For the stadium, they definitely had a restricted view during certain parts of the show. But I think that we ended up with a really good balance.”\n\t\n\t\tThe show’s cinematic look is by design, as the producers switched to cinema cameras for Super Bowl halftime a few years ago.\t\n\n\t“For many years now, we have effectively used cinema cameras in a live television domain, which is really ambitious,” Hamilton said. “It’s very nerve-racking when you’re putting effectively Ferrari-esque technology to work in circumstances more attuned to using a Land Rover. These cameras are not really made to be used and run around a football field and put up in eight minutes. But they allow you to get an image that is significantly different to the imagery available on the game cameras. Until six or seven years ago, we would use the all-purpose sports cameras, which you can throw them off a cliff, and they’ll bounce back. Whereas these kind of digital cinema cameras, they have very specific lenses, and they work in a very specific way. It’s a complicated, challenging workflow, but a lot of people comment on how cinematic it looks. Other people just think it looks great.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSignage that reads “The Only Thing More Powerful than Hate is Love” is displayed on the scoreboard \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBoth Hamilton and Cuddeford felt the message of the halftime show was heard, and resonated with audiences.\t\n\n\t“There’s a real sense of community and commitment to really delivering something that we all knew was going to be full of heart,” Hamilton said. \n\n\tCuddeford said: “People understood the message he wanted to convey. That Latino people felt loved, seen and celebrated, and that people felt joyful. It’s just an incredible thing that he’s managed to do, and that we’ve all managed to support him and to help deliver that into the world at this time is, honestly, a complete honor.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the full performance here:\n\n\n\n",

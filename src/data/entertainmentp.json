    "body": "\n\tThe trailer for Dropout‘s “Very Important People” Season 3 is here, and it’s “absolutely disgusting,” thanks to “the thing behind” Vic Michaelis’s eyes “that desires approval.”\n\n\tThe improv interview series will return for a third season on Dec. 4 with an episode featuring comedian Rekha Shankar in conversation with host Michaelis. In typical “VIP” fashion, Shankar won’t know who she’s going on the show as until she’s had her costume and makeup done blind, and then will be interviewed by Michaelis, playing an aspiring-broadcast-journalist version of themselves that hosts the talk show, “Very Important People.”\n\t\n\n\tAdditional in-character interviewees coming this season include Jeremy Culhane, Brennan Lee Mulligan and Jacob Wysocki paired up (as seen in the image above, featuring Mulligan in the trailer, just as he makes that dig about Michaelis’ need for approval), Angela Giarratana, Eugene Cordero, Demi Adejuyigbe, Lisa Gilroy, Frankie Quinones, Caitlin Reilly, Laci Mosley, Zac Oyama, Katya, Rachel Pegram, Chelsea Peretti and Anna Garcia.\n\n\n\tPer comedy streamer Dropout’s description for the series, “Very Important People” features improv comedians after they undergo an extensive makeover by a talented team of make-up artists to transform them into an entirely new and unexpected person. They create a character for their new look on the spot, and are interviewed by Vic Michaelis, who plays a host also named Vic Michaelis. \n\n\t“Very Important People” Season 3 will launch its first episode Dec. 4 on Dropout, with 15 episodes in total releasing biweekly through June 18.\n\t\n\n\tAdditionally, this season will again release deeper dives into the make-up application and transformation process each Friday following the main series episode in a miniseries titled “Last Looks.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Very Important People” Season 3 below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMara Brock Akil will receive the Norman Lear Achievement Award at the 37th annual Producers Guild Awards, set to take place on Feb. 28 at the Fairmont Century City Plaza in Los Angeles, California. The award is sponsored by Delta Air Lines.\n\n\tBrock Akil began her career as a screenwriter on Fox’s “South Central” at 23, later becoming the youngest African American showrunner on broadcast network television when she created and wrote UPN’s “Girlfriends,” starring Tracee Ellis Ross, Golden Brooks, and Persia White at 30 years old. Brock Akil is the only African American showrunner to have a series on television during every year of the 2000s. \n\t\n\n\tBrock Akil created BET’s first drama series “Being Mary Jane,” alongside “The Game” and its spinoff series on Paramount+ in 2021. Brock Akil previously co-created “Love Is” on OWN. She also collaborated as an executive producer on The CW’s “Black Lighting” with her husband Salim Akil with their production company Akil Productions from 2018 to 2021.\n\n\n\tMost recently, Brock Akil produced Netflix’s “Forever,” an adaptation of the 1975 Judy Blume novel of the same name. The teen drama, which stars Lovie Simone and Michael Cooper Jr., was renewed for a second season in May.\n\n\t“The hallmark of a great producer is the ability to bring stories to life with both purpose and imagination. Mara Brock Akil has done this throughout her career, leaving an indelible impact on television and the industry as a whole,” said PGA Presidents Donald De Line and Stephanie Allain in a statement. “With shows like “Girlfriends,” “The Game,” and “Being Mary Jane,” she has set a standard for excellence that continues with her most recent series, “Forever.” Her body of work stands as a testament to the profound influence producers can have on the medium.”\n\t\n\n\t“I am deeply honored to receive an award that bears the name of Norman Lear, a visionary who expanded the boundaries of what television could be. His work taught us that storytelling can move culture, challenge assumptions, and create community – values that have guided my career,” said Brock Akil. “Storytelling is a privilege, and I’m grateful to the Producers Guild for recognizing the work and the incredible teams who have helped bring these stories to life. This acknowledgment inspires me to continue championing characters and worlds that reflect the complexity, beauty, and courage of our lives.”\n\n\tThe 2026 Producers Guild Awards are produced by Anchor Street Collective. Sponsors include McLaren, Delta Air Lines, Glenfiddich Scotch Whisky and GreenSlate.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Landman” Season 2 has struck oil, with its premiere episode bringing in 9.2 million views in its first two days of availability. \n\n\tPer Paramount, that figure is based on the total minutes viewed divided by the episodes total runtime. The second season debut of the oil industry drama launched on Paramount+ on Nov. 16. \n\n\tParamount also says that the 9.2 million views is an increase of 262% over the series premiere in 2024, while sampling of Season 1 increased 320% since the second season premiere. The latter figure is based on the views for Season 1 for the past 28 days compared to the two days after the Season 2 debut. \n\t\n\n\tBilly Bob Thornton leads the cast of “Landman,” which also includes Demi Moore, Andy Garcia, Ali Larter, Sam Elliott, Jacob Lofland, Michelle Randolph, Paulina Chávez, Kayla Wallace, Mark Collie, James Jordan and Colm Feore.\n\n\n\tThe official logline for Season 2 states, “As oil rises from the earth, so do secrets – and Tommy Norris’s (Thornton) breaking point may be closer than he realizes. Facing mounting pressure from M-Tex Oil, Cami Miller (Moore), and the shadow of his kin, survival in West Texas isn’t noble – it’s brutal. And sooner or later something’s got to break.”\n\n\tTaylor Sheridan co-created the series with Christian Wallace. Both are executive producers along with David C. Glasser, David Hutkin, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, Christian Wallace, Thornton, Geyer Kosinski, Michael Friedman and Stephen Kay. Dan Friedkin and Jason Hoch for Imperative Entertainment, and J.K. Nickell and Megan Creydt for Texas Monthly also executive produce. Tommy Turtle serves as co-executive producer. “Landman” is produced by Paramount Television Studios, 101 Studios, and Sheridan’s Bosque Ranch Productions.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOnce ubiquitous in American theaters (and still quite healthy in Taylor Sheridan’s domain), big-screen Westerns are relatively scarce these days. When such tales do surface, however, they’re increasingly comingled with a genre that’s very much on the rise: horror. The latest such shotgun marriage, “Killing Faith,” is a somewhat murky and unsatisfying one. Still, its intriguing premise, able cast and bursts of violence hold attention even as writer-director Ned Crowley’s execution never quite realizes his concept’s potential. After a limited theatrical stint last month, Shout! Studios’ release is now available on demand. \n\t\n\n\tAn unspecified “great sickness” plagues the Arizona territory of 1849, felling humans and livestock alike. Apparently immune from it is a ranch inhabited by freed slave Sarah (DeWanda Wise) and her young daughter (Emily Ford, whose character is designated only as “The Girl”). They look nothing alike, a fact eventually explained by the intel that Sarah was deeded the place by her late owner-slash-domestic partner, a white settler. It was a relationship more coercive than mutually consenting, we gather. Nevertheless, now she’s a lone Black landholder determined to protect her property and angelic-looking blond offspring, with help from loyal, simpleminded farmhand Edward (Jack Alcott). \n\n\n\tPeople in the town nearby keep their distance, though not (or at least not exclusively) for the bigoted reasons you might expect: They believe the approximately 7-year-old is a supernatural threat. It’s a notion duly supported when we see her instantly kill a horse simply by touching it. Desperate for a “cure,” Sarah decides the two of them must travel across the desolate prairie to see Preacher Ross (Bill Pullman), a reputed faith healer. But that route is full of peril, and no townie is willing to provide them an escort. Forced to volunteer for the job — once he’s officially exiled for recurrent dissolute behavior — is Doc Bender (Guy Pearce), who’s become an ether-addicted wreck following the deaths of his own wife and daughter. Unwilling to be left behind, addlebrained chatterbox Edward makes it a party of four.\n\t\n\n\tThe desert terrain they cross is hazardous. En route, they are accosted by bandits (Jamie Neumann, Keith Jardine) who steal their food, water and weapons; encounter a bizarre if seemingly friendly group of stranded wagon-train emigrants led by Joanna Cassidy; and briefly benefit from the survival expertise of an erudite Native American named Chief William Shakespeare (Raoul Max Trujillo). Most of these interactions end badly for someone, sometimes with the wee Girl’s lethal, otherworldly assistance — even though disbelieving Doc stubbornly insists her “power” can only lie in being a virulent carrier of “the sickness.” Nor do things greatly improve when the surviving protagonists reach their destination, with Preacher Ross proving more foe than friend.\n\n\tIt’s a darkly picaresque tale, mostly set outdoors, whose stark New Mexico landscapes are attractively captured by cinematographer Justin Hamilton. There’s a score by siblings Brooke and Will Blair that effectively straddles suspense and period flavor, while other design contributions evoke the times within limited means, aided by the story’s underpopulated nature. \n\n\tBut a queasy discussion between Doc and Preacher, regarding whether good and evil exist outside the realm of scientific rationalism, only further clouds what never quite comes into focus as a religious parable. Climactic bursts of avenging fire and bullets don’t have the full cathartic force intended when we’re not clear on what they’re avenging — not to mention why various events occur, or just who’s on the devil’s side here. Ambiguity can be effective to a point. “Killing Faith” travels past it, however, finally disappearing into narrative ether.\n\n\tThat eventual letdown might’ve been cushioned had Crowley created more potent atmospherics all along. But his second directorial feature (following another road tale, 2016’s more comedic “Middle Man”) lacks tension, as well as the palpable frisson of unseen threat that’s boosted occult-tinged westerns from the 1973 “Hex” through “Bone Tomahawk” a decade ago. The air of merciless, quasi-Biblical judgement pervading John Hillcoat’s “The Proposition,” the 2005 Australian Western in which Pearce also starred, seems called for here — yet “Faith” never approaches that level of dread, or dramatic intensity in general. It’s got interesting ideas, without the feverish conviction or style to punch them across.\n\t\n\n\tIn the end, it feels pedestrian despite an offbeat narrative gist, as well as the decent work by principal adult actors. Pearce as usual is more than up to his role’s physical and emotional demands, though he can’t singlehandedly provide this watchable-enough effort the thematic or emotional heft it reaches for. Supporting turns are a bit variable, with more asked from juvenile performers than they can deliver, and Alcott stuck providing a comedy relief that comes off as labored. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the lines between traditional journalists and digital influencers start to blur, CAA hopes it can guide reporters walking on either kind of terrain.\n\n\tThe large talent agency, which represents George Stephanopoulos and Mary Bruce as well as Punchbowl, recently hired Becky Van Dercook, a former CBS News producer who recently helped manage communications and media for emerging political influencer Jack Schlossberg, who is also the only grandchild of President John Kennedy. Van Dercook now works as an agent in CAA’s TV-news department, but her expertise will let clients try their hand in a broader array of media opportunities.\n\t\n\n\tVan Dercook is charged with helping established clients broaden their profile online, while simultaneously identifying opportunities outside of legacy media through newsletters, podcasts, live events, and social media content. She will also be looking out for influencers, man-on-the-street reporters, and news personalities skilled in short-form content.\n\n\n\t“Becky is providing a masterclass in social media guidance to our news clients and to our creator clients across the agency, finding creative ways for them to establish, grow, and monetize their brands,” says Rachel Adler, who heads CAA’s news department, during a recent interview.\n\n\tShe adds: “We are very much mission-driven: here to future-proof our clients’ careers and develop new models for how they can develop and distribute the work they do.”\n\n\tCAA is taking steps on a path that many find themselves having to tread. With the economics of streaming draining revenue from traditional media operations, the economics of news have grown more challenging. That has spurred a broad phalanx of popular names to launch a new shingle in digital outposts. Don Lemon, Megyn Kelly, Chuck Todd, Joy Reid and Tucker Carlson are among the familiar faces who have struck out for new video podcasts..  WME, another of Hollywood’s big talent firms, has helped Oliver Darcy, a former media reporter at CNN, to debut his own newsletter, “Status,” Jennifer Rubin, formerly of the Washington Post to launch a new outlet called The Contrarian; and Jim Acosta, the one-time CNN anchor, to move to Substack.\n\t\n\n\tOne reason for the growing digital exodus? Money.\n\n\tThe Interactive Adverting Bureau, an industry advocacy group, projects in a new report released Thursday that ad spend invested in creator-driven media will reach $37 billion in 2025, an increase of 26% over last year, and about four times faster than the overall media business. About 48% of advertisers surveyed by the group feel creators are a “must buy,” ranking behind social media and paid-search ads.\n\n\tVan Dercook is already at work counseling CAA clients. She assisted Alex Wagner, who contributes to both Crooked Media and MSNBC, in launching a TikTok profile and meeting with influential creators. Van Dercook “acted as a spiritual guide for my social media strategy,” says Wagner. “Becky is uniquely talented: she learned the business as a television producer and has adapted seamlessly to the new media landscape. This means that she understands traditional, institutional media but is situated at the crossroads of change — she is a key resource in helping all of us navigate this moment of major disruption in the news industry.”\n\n\tShe also helped ABC News’ Jonathan Karl, who says Van Dercook “was very helpful in finding emerging media opportunities and utilizing my social platforms to promote my new book and bring my reporting to new audiences.” He adds: “It is smart that CAA has decided this is a space worth investing in.”\n\n\tVan Dercook says she’s learned by doing. “I spent the better part of a year working for Jack Schlossberg through the 2024 campaign. Working closely with a talented creator and building his business from the ground up taught me how to succeed on social media and how to be nimble and adjust when things didn’t work,” she says. “This is a moment of change in news, and it represents a great opportunity for CAA to meet consumers where they are — online, listening to podcasts, and reading newsletters.”\n\n\tVan Dercook graduated from Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs with a master’s in public policy and earned her undergraduate degree summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Middlebury College. While at CBS News, she helped produce political coverage across the news division, and helped manage coverage of the 2020 Election, President Biden’s inauguration, and the Capitol insurrection.\n\t\n\n\tThe new hire, says Adler, means “we have a journalist who can speak to our clients not just as their agent, but as a producing partner.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor 40 years, Imagine Entertainment has been virtually synonymous with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, the company’s Oscar-winning co-founders. And even as they remain at the helm of the media company they created, they have empowered a team of younger executives to help them continue to grow their film and television businesses, while also branching out more aggressively into documentaries and branded content.\n\n\t“We’re really proud of this next generation of leadership,” says Justin Wilkes, who was named president of Imagine Entertainment in 2023. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s a group that includes Imagine Features President Jeb Brody, who joined the company in 2024 from Amblin; Imagine Documentaries President Sara Bernstein, who came over to help launch the division in 2018 from HBO; and President of Imagine Brands, IP & Partnerships Marc Gilbar and Executive Vice President of Brands & Business Development Amanda Farrand, who entered the picture in 2018 and 2023, respectively, as the company bolstered its relationships with top corporations looking for innovative ways to raise their profiles. They’ve been tasked with navigating a changed Hollywood landscape, one in which streaming services are the dominant way people watch movies and shows, and new tools like AI are threatening to upend the way entertainment is produced and monetized.\n\n\n\t“There’s always been new technologies, right?” Wilkes says. “There’s been digital cinema, DVDs, and all kinds of disrupters. But the power of a great story, that’s what everybody’s going to point to going forward. We want to make movies or television shows or a documentaries that unite people, that celebrate underdogs, that celebrate brotherhoods and sisterhoods, and that lmake you feel a little bit better coming out than you did when you started watching them.”\n\t\n\n\tImagine first came to prominence making a wide-range of humanistic movies, many of them directed by Howard and produced by Grazer. It’s a collection of popular films that includes everything from “Cocoon” to “A Beautiful Mind,” “Parenthood” to “Backdraft,” “American Gangster” to “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” The duo are still intimately involved in running the company and making new films (they discussed their long-time partnership in a Q&A with Variety). And they are also eager to find and develop stories that can reach a mass audience in a fractured media ecosystem.\n\n\t“Audiences have evolved,” Howard says. “But we are eager to learn where they’re going and see how we can work with that. The heartbeat of what we care about is to engage viewers in an emotional journey.”\n\n\tOn the television front, Imagine is backing a wide range of original programs, as well reboots of some of its most biggest hits and talk shows like “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman.” For Peacock, the company is re-imagining the cult comedy, “The ‘Burbs,” with Keke Palmer and Jack Whitehall as a married couple who move into a family-friendly neighborhood only to discover there’s something sinister behind its well-manicured facade.\n\n\t“It’s told through the perspective of a Black female,” says Wilkes. “So it’s a similar storyline as the Tom Hanks movie, but it turns it upside down.”\n\n\tImagine also convinced Peter Berg and Jason Katims to return to the world of high school sports with a reboot of “Friday Night Lights.”\n\n\t“This new version is set in a Texas town that a tornado had destroyed, and the community has to rebuild,” Wilkes says. “Those are all themes that are very relevant today. You know, look at the floods that happened in Texas not that long. It just felt like that’s a reason to go back into the IP and come up with a new story.”\n\n\tAnd Wilkes believes that the time is right for a return of “24,” the propulsive thriller that became a sensation in the early aughts. \n\n\t“It’s a little bit informal at this point, but if you look at Russia, Ukraine and just the theater of Europe right now, the world needs Jack Bauer,” he says.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJustin Wilkes arrives at the Los Angeles Special Screening Of Amazon MGM Studios “After The Hunt” at David Geffen Theater, The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on October 04, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/WireImage)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWireImage\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s unclear if Bauer will battle baddies as part of a series or a movie. If he does go the feature route, he may be taking one of his biggest risks yet. The film business faces stiff headwinds — the box office has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, and studios are focusing most of their resources on comic book movies and videogame adaptations. Those aren’t the kind of films that Imagine specializes in producing (its movies tend to be $50 million to $70 million affairs that are geared at adults). Yet, the company has nearly a half dozen movies in various stages of production and an active development pipeline. Brody says that they’ve been able to stay busy by finding stories that have a compelling hook.\n\t\n\n\t“You’ve got to be unique,” Brody says. “You’ve got to be different. You’ve got to do something that nobody’s ever seen before. They need to be cluster busters with something you can market.” \n\n\tIn the case of one of their upcoming films, an adaptation of Daniel Kraus’ novel “Whalefall,” that “cluster buster” angle is a premise that sounds like “Pinocchio” mixed with “127 Hours” — a diver is swallowed by a sperm whale and has only 60 minutes to escape.\n\n\t“The majority of the movie takes place inside the belly of a whale,” Brody says. “I don’t know that I could have made that movie 15 years ago. But at this moment, I can because it’s so different than anything anybody has seen before.”\n\n\tThere’s also a Snoop Dogg biopic from the makers of “8 Mile,” as well as “How to Rob a Bank,” an upcoming heist thriller with Nicholas Hoult, Anna Sawai, Pete Davidson and Zoë Kravitz; “Alone at Dawn,” a war film with Adam Driver that Howard directs, and “Spaceballs 2,” a follow-up to the Mel Brooks cult favorite. “‘Spaceballs’ is all about joy and and silliness,” Brody says.\n\n\tThose will all be theatrical releases, unlike “The Mosquito Bowl,” the story of a football game that took place on the eve of the Okinawa invasion and involved former football stars who enlisted in the Marines following Pearl Harbor. That movie will debut on Netflix. “It’s a profound version of a war film,” Brody says.\n\n\tThe Imagine team is also looking at past hits to revisit. \n\n\t“There are conversations around what to do with ‘The Grinch,'” Brody says. “There are conversations around ‘Liar, Liar.’ There are conversations that we’re having around a lot of this IP that we own.”\n\n\tImagine has moved aggressively into the documentary space, producing acclaimed films about cultural icons like Julia Child, Judy Blume, Barbara Walters and Luciano Pavarotti. Bernstein says that Howard and Grazer have tapped their rolodex to encourage people to participate in these intimate looks at their lives and careers.\n\n\t“We work really hard on access, we tend not to really do unauthorized personality projects,” Bernstein says. “I don’t think we come at it like, ‘this is an expose.’ It’s: ‘you tell us your story.'”\n\n\tImagine is at work on several documentaries including Rory Kennedy’s follow-up to “Downfall: The Case Against Boeing,” and a project based on Jonathan Haidt’s “The Anxious Generation,” a look at rising rates of mental illness in children. But the company has not been immune to the challenges facing the non-fiction business. Streamers has invested heavily in the space, but as the media industry has constricted, they’ve made cut backs. Bernstein says not only are they commissioning fewer films; they’re also insisting they be made for less money.\n\t\n\n\t“For us, it’s always about what’s the opportunity within this consolidation,” Bernstein says. \n\n\tThe collapse of cable and the decline of the theatrical film business have made it more challenging for companies like Imagine to turn a profit. That’s led Imagine to work hard to find new sources of revenue. It’s been a pioneer in the branded content space, working with the likes of Coca-Cola, P&G and Ford. Projects have ranged from short films that are intended to play on social media to feature-length documentaries such as “The Day Sports Stood Still,” a look at the global shutdown of pro sports in wake of the coronavirus that was produced with Nike, and “Dads,” an examination of fatherhood that Bryce Dallas Howard made in conjunction with Unilever. In both cases the brands made a profit on their investment when the films sold to HBO and Apple TV+.\n\n\tCompanies are also exploring turning their products into narrative features. \n\n\t“Post ‘Barbie,’ we have started to see more and more brands interested in taking a big swing at a scripted film,” says Gilbar.\n\n\tIn order to land the big clients, it helps that Imagine has its own brand identity. \n\n\t“We’re a media company that is all about telling inspiring stories of humanity,” says Farrand.\n\n\tOver 40 years, it’s been Howard and Grazer who have helped Imagine remain relevant by finding and developing those types of films and shows. \n\n\t“They both bring different superpowers to their partnership,” says Michael Rosenberg, former co-chairman of Imagine. “I’ll give you a sports analogy. Kareem and Magic were great by themselves, but when they were together, they were a combination unlike any other. The same is true of Ron and Brian.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla are among the producers who have spent years crafting a multi-part docuseries chronicling the history of influential Los Angeles alternative radio station KROQ — and five years ago, they seemed to have a proper (albeit, depressing) ending to the story. As reported at the time by Variety, the once-“world famous” KROQ had collapsed in both ratings and reputation as the station lost its two-time Hall of Fame morning show “Kevin & Bean,” while simultaneously blowing up its familiar playlist. “It’s the End of the World Famous KROQ As We Know It,” the Variety headline read.\n\t\n\n\tAnd yet, five years later, there appears to be a bit of a recovery happening at the legendary radio outlet. In October, KROQ posted a 5.8 share in its key adults 25-54 demo — making it No. 2 in Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest marrket. That’s quite a change from even just a year ago, when the station was still pulling a fairly tepid 2.6 share (No. 16 in the market). \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tKROQ is also experiencing a tremendous boost in the mornings, where the “Klein.Ally.Show” hit its best-ever numbers last month — after having struggled to gain traction during its first four years on air.\n\n\t“We have a great frickin’ story here,” says KROQ senior VP of programming Kevin Weatherly. “It was dark times at this station. Many people thought would never come back. A lot of people thought KROQ was dead, and it was dead to a lot of our listeners. But now here we are, five years later. Not only have we come back from that, but we’re back bigger in terms of ratings success, than we’ve been in 15-plus years.”\n\t\n\n\tPer KROQ’s monthly ratings trends, that rebirth really took off this past spring — and it’s probably not a coincidence that the listenership skyrocketed after the return of ex-morning host Kevin Ryder. With his former “Kevin & Bean” partner Gene “Bean” Baxter, Ryder spent 30 years at KROQ until March 2020 — when he and co-hosts Allie Mac Kay and Jensen Karp (Baxter had departed in November 2019) were fired over the phone during the pandemic.\n\n\tRyder returned to the KROQ in afternoon drive this past April 1, a little over five years after being axed — and soon after, another KROQ vet, Doug “Sluggo” Roberts, also returned to the station for regular shifts after a long absence. (During that time away, Ryder and Roberts hosted an afternoon show together on L.A. classic rock outlet KLOS.)\n\n\t“I think Kevin Ryder coming back had the halo effect of really benefiting the radio station from a ratings standpoint,” Weatherly says. “Because it did give people permission that were pissed off, that didn’t want anything to do with KROQ, to go, ‘OK, if he’s coming back, it’s cool for us too.’”\n\n\tAfter a lengthy, dominant streak in the demo (most recently hitting No. 1 in L.A. with a 4.8 share in March 2011), KROQ began to hit major turbulence in the mid-to-late 2010s. Not only was radio facing new competition from podcasts and other sources, but the alternative rock genre was on the skids — leading many legacy stations, including San Francisco sibling KITS-FM (“Live 105”), to get out of the format entirely. In 2017, KROQ parent CBS Radio was acquired by Entercom (now Audacy), causing more uncertainty and change. And at the same time, as KROQ’s music rotation began to sound stale, crosstown rival KYSR (“Alt 98.7”) was proving to be a formidable competitor — particularly after KROQ assistant program director Lisa Worden jumped to that station.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBy 2020, Weatherly (above, with Coldplay’s Chris Martin) — who had programmed KROQ since 1992 — was also ready to leave. “Honestly, I was burned out,” he says. “I was programming three radio stations, and we had a new company.” As Entercom/Audacy started to tinker with KROQ, Weatherly was being recruited by Spotify — and he decided the time was ripe for a new challenge.\n\t\n\n\tThat was March 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. After he left, Weatherly’s replacement, Mike Kaplan (who had previously run Alt 98.7 — which started beating KROQ in the ratings), initiated a wholesale revamp at KROQ. Not only was Ryder tossed, but the station’s music mix was tweaked. Alternative pop (particularly songs hitting it big on TikTok) was given heavy rotation, while Kaplan pulled back on previous rock-intensive core artists.\n\n\tKROQ listeners were angered by Ryder’s firing, and also didn’t embrace the station’s new sound. “I was on the sidelines at Spotify, watching the fucking thing burn,” Weatherly says.\n\n\tAudacy California regional president Jeff Federman now admits that in hindsight, KROQ made some major tactical errors in 2020. “During COVID, everybody wanted comfort food,” he says. “People were coming to us for something they knew, and they weren’t getting it. Not only were they not getting the music, but they also weren’t getting their morning show. So it was a double whammy. COVID was hard enough, but we made it harder on ourselves, certainly.”\n\n\tFederman immediately set out to recruit Weatherly back to the station and perform some triage. “I’m glad I did Spotify. I learned a lot,” Weatherly says. “But there was that yearning to come back to what I’ve done my entire adult life, which is programming KROQ. KROQ means something to me. I care about its legacy.”\n\n\tWeatherly returned in 2022 and immediately restored the station’s reliance on its mostly gold-based rotation — standards from the likes of Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chili Peppers. That’s not necessarily an exciting or forward-thinking playlist, and even inside KROQ, music fans bristle at the station’s reliance on burnt-to-a-crisp songs that have been in constant rotation for decades. But management says research shows that those artists are what KROQ’s core 25-54 audience wants.\n\n\t“Whether it’s your favorite restaurant, or tennis shoes or whatever, people have an expectation of a brand,” Weatherly says. “And the expectation of the KROQ brand is Foo Fighters, Chili Peppers, Linkin Park and Green Day. [Kaplan] kicked all those bands to the curb in favor of these new TikTok-flavor-of-the-moment bands. That’s not what people expect or want from KROQ. It’s just getting back to what people expect. Everyone goes, ‘the station used to play a lot more new music,’ or ‘the station used to be about discovery.’ All those things are still true. It’s just that, our audience is not 12 to 24. Our audience is 25 to 54. These are the people that grew up with KROQ. We’re not chasing something that we’re not going to probably get any longer. We’re going to satisfy the people that are still here.”\n\t\n\n\tStill, Weatherly admits that it’s harder to program radio than it used to be. For one thing, corporate parent Audacy filed for bankruptcy last year and has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs — thinning his staff.\n\n\tAnd in recent years there’s been fewer breakthroughs in rock music because of fragmentation. “It’s just harder and harder for songs to get consensus on newer music,” he says. “Which is why at festivals, there’s so much done around nostalgia. Younger people are discovering these older songs, and so I think we benefit from that.”\n\n\tBut this year, KROQ’s playlist has found some pockets of refreshening from a recent uptick in new and resurgent bands. Weatherly points to fresher artists like Bad Omens, Turnstile, Pierce the Veil and Wet Leg, as well as new hits from veterans like Deftones and Sublime. “I think that we’re benefiting from the fact that there’s a new crop of rock bands that people are passionate and care about,” Weatherly says.\n\n\tKROQ isn’t the only station seeing an uptick from alt rock’s mini revival. Audacy relaunched Live 105 in San Francisco in 2023, around the same time that Cumulus Media brought back heritage Atlanta alt rocker WNNX (“99X”). In August, Windsor, Canada, station CIMX (“89X”), which was modern rock pioneer in the Detroit market, returned after a five year absence. Back in LA, in October’s Nielsen Audio persons 6+ ratings, Alt 98.7 posted a 3.6 share — its best since July 2010 — while KROQ was close behind with a 3.3.\n\n\t“I’ve felt good about alternative product for six months now,” says radio research analyst and columnist Sean Ross. “The chart finally seems to be the mix of pop, guitar rock and ‘none of the above’ that we need. I also think it’s great to see heritage stations like Live 105, 99X Atlanta, and 89X Detroit being relaunched. That’s a vote of confidence for the format, too, particularly when there’s an instant response like there was for Live 105.\n\n\t“That said, the chart is still very reliant on heritage artists… also, this is still a heavily library-based format. Most stations are at 1-2 currents an hour. It’s always a turning point in any format when programmers feel confident swapping a gold for a recent song. We need to get to the point where ‘Believe’ by the Bravery isn’t better than an exciting new song. But as stations grow, it will give them more ability to break new music.”\n\t\n\n\tFor now, Weatherly says KROQ’s mix is probably about 70% gold and 30% current music. And the station is probably even more gold-based now than it was when Weatherly was previously programming KROQ — but he argues that’s true of all radio formats.\n\n\t“Forget alternative, but any contemporary station, whether it’s the hip hop station or the top 40 station, they’re all playing a lot more gold,” he says. “And if you go and look at DSPs (digital service providers, like Spotify or Apple Music), some of the most-consumed music on those platforms is gold-based.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut it’s ultimately not just about the music, as the station’s personalities have also help revive KROQ’s profile. After Ryder was canned, afternoon hosts Kevin Klein and Ted Stryker were moved to mornings, where they faced a backlash over the sudden change. Stryker hopped to Alt 98.7 in 2021, and Klein was paired with Ally Johnson on the renamed “Klein.Ally.Show.” It was a long slog to recruit listeners from there.\n\n\t“It was hard enough to launch a morning show 20 years ago, back when there were only radio stations that people were getting their music and their content from,” Federman says. “But now you have all these other platforms to compete against.” Adds Weatherly: “It took a long time for people to find it, because everything’s so fragmented.”\n\n\tWhen Ryder returned to KROQ, his first stop was on the Klein/Ally show, and Federman credits the visit as a “stamp of approval that, ‘hey, all you other KROQ listeners that used to listen, you can come back.’” Now, “Klein.Ally.Show” has risen to a 7.0 share, No. 2 in the demo — a tremendous leap from No. 14 in March. Ryder’s approval helped, as did a massive awareness campaign for the morning show this summer, which included putting repeats into other dayparts, and briefly extending the show to 11 a.m. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Even with the different changes that the company’s gone through, the one thing that’s been consistent since I’ve come back is their support of our belief that we’re on the right track (with ‘Klein.Ally.Show’),” Weatherly says. “In this day and age, that’s unheard of. To give a show four years to develop before you start to see the payoff, most people don’t have the patience anymore.”\n\n\t(Not every recent experiment has worked: KROQ swiftly shelved an attempt to revive the station’s “Loveline” sex and relationships talk show. “I think we realized pretty quickly that it’s 2025, not 1995 and that people can get this stuff everywhere,” Weatherly says.)\n\t\n\n\tRyder did not leave KROQ quietly in 2020, cracking the mic one last time after being dismissed to share how he was “truly baffled by KROQ’s cold, heartless attitude toward the people who built this station.” But with Weatherly back and new management at Audacy, he was willing to give it another try.\n\n\tStill, he admits he was a bit hesitant to return at first, given how much he had heard about the dark times at KROQ in the years after he left. “It was a strange thing to be doing,” he says of his return. “But now it does feel like I’m fully back, and I’m getting a ‘this is fun again’ vibe at KROQ — which is contrary to the way it has been. I talked to a lot of people who were there for the five years that I wasn’t, and they were like, ‘it’s been so difficult, the management didn’t know what they were doing,’ and everybody was upset. They didn’t treat people well. I think Kevin Weatherly coming back, and the changes at the top of Audacy, have changed the company dynamic. The people who used to run Audacy didn’t understand what KROQ is, and more importantly, they didn’t care to understand what KROQ is.”\n\n\tFor her part, new Audacy CEO Kelli Turner lauds KROQ for continuing to be one of the most recognized station brands in radio. “I wasn’t around for it, but I know when Kevin Weatherly left, when Kevin Ryder left, it definitely went through a bit of a low point. So it’s super exciting to see the energy and momentum behind it now… I think just letting them do what they do, and taking obstacles out of the way to let them do it well, is a big part of my role.”\n\n\tWeatherly is cautious not to characterize this as an attempt to re-create KROQ circa 2005 — even if a lot of the music and the on-air talent is the same. “We want there to be a thread of continuity to the past, but we’re not living in the past, which is why we have a brand new morning show that we think is the present and the future,” he says. “We’re not a classic alternative station. We’re not just saying that we want to be a ’90s alt station. We still look forward but we’re not, and this one of the differences from what the station went through five years ago, trying to distance ourselves from anything that happened before.”\n\n\tUp next for KROQ is its annual “Almost Acoustic Christmas” concert event on Dec. 13, and yes, it leans heavy on older acts like Evanescence, Social Distortion, Third Eye Blind, Rise Against, Papa Roach, Yellowcard and the All-American Rejects, but it does have a few newer faces: Wet Leg and the Paradox.\n\t\n\n\tWeatherly admits that it’s a lot harder to book these one-off events these days. “The major labels, they’re not as invested in rock bands as they used to be,” he says. “They’re a little more interested in chasing whatever the current viral moment is. So a lot of the bands that we play are independents. There’s fewer A-level acts that you can book. And another thing that had made it harder is the proliferation of festivals and the amount of money that they pay these bands. We’re not competing with Coachella.”\n\n\tBut at the same time, he says it’s important to note that bands still “appreciate and understand what radio airplay means. There’s still something about hearing your song on the radio that every band wants to experience.”\n\n\tAnd that’s especially true when a local radio legend like Ryder is the one introducing those songs. KROQ’s ratings surge after his return should prove that on-air talent still makes a difference.\n\n\t“That makes me extremely happy, because, KROQ is and has been one of the top five most important radio stations in the world,” he says. “To see them screw it up as badly as they did, if I can help I get back some of the magic it used to have, I’m in. I spent my whole life on this radio station.” Maybe Kimmel and Carolla do have a new, more redemptive ending for their KROQ docuseries.\n",

Joyce’s “Saget,” about beloved TV dad Bob Saget; and Alex Holmes’ “Beverly & Dereck,” about visionary filmmakers and wildlife conservationists Beverly and Dereck Joubert whose work helped inspire “The Lion King.”\n\t\n\n\tStory Syndicate will produce all three films, with Dan Cogan and Jon Bardin serving as producers and Liz Garbus and Tommy Coriale as executive producers.\n\n\n\tStory Syndicate launched in 2019 and became a power player in the doc space across all major platforms. Recent projects include Apple TV’s “Number One on the Call Sheet,” Roku’s “Solo Traveling With Tracee Ellis Ross” and the Netflix series “Harry & Meghan,” and “Gone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer.”\n\n\tThe eight-figure fund is being financed by private investors and will be used to support three to four feature docs and/or series each year with commercial viability.\n\n\t“We want Story Syndicate to be the first choice for directors, producers, and IP-holders seeking a partner who excels at telling big-tent, culturally-relevant stories that also break new creative ground,” Cogan and Garbus said in a joint statement. “Not only do we have the production expertise, deep experience, and relationships to do this at the highest level, we now also have the capital to do it independently. We’re excited to put this all to work on behalf of undeniable stories, genre-defying artisans and major rights-holders with our initial slate representing the diverse narratives that combine commercial appeal with creative ambition and risk-taking.”\n\t\n\n\tThe equity fund represents something of a return to his roots for Cogan, who founded and ran the leading documentary equity financier Impact Partners for 13 years. Under Cogan, Impact Partners’ productions included the Academy Award winners “Icarus” and “The Cove,” and the Oscar-nominated film “How to Survive a Plague.” Cogan also worked on “The Apollo,” “The Queen of Versailles,” “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?” and “Allen v. Farrow” during his tenure at Impact Partners.\n\n\tThe Story Syndicate equity fund remains actively open to unscripted projects at all stages to finance and produce.\n\n\tStory Syndicate Equity Fund Projects:\n\n\t“Master Thief”Directed by Paul Solet and produced by Glen Zipper, Sean Stuart, Paul Solet, Dan Cogan and Jon Bardin and Executive Produced by Eli Manning for Ten Till Productions.\n\n\t“Saget”Directed by Don Argott and Sheena M. Joyce (Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour | The End of an Era, Kelce) and produced by Story Syndicate, Revue Studios and 9.14 Pictures\n\n\t“Beverly & Dereck”\n\n\tDirected by Alex Holmes (“Maiden”), with Dogwoof and Story Syndicate.\n",

This season, the Parisian home and fragrance brand have unveiled a limited-edition gift set that gets you a trio of candles: Sapin (Pine Tree), Friandise (Sweet Treat) and Étoile (Star), all in Christmas-inspired colors and scents (think: cedar, gingerbread and vanilla). Each candle has a 20-hour burn time.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEdition Candle\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWorld travelers will also appreciate the Edition Candle, a luxe offering from the EDITION chain of hotels. Produced in France, the exclusive candle features the EDITION’s signature scent of black tea, citrus, smoke, chocolate, pepper and fresh flowers. It’ll instantly transport your boss or co-workers back to their favorite vacation — or successful business trip. The 6.7 oz. candle is housed in a chic, black holder that’ll look right at home on a desk or side table.Want to really impress them?

The L’OR Barista System serves up European-style coffee and espresso drinks with the push of a button, with a range of sizes, flavors and intensity levels. L’OR offers a number of different single-serve capsules that are easy to use — and delicious to drink. The machine itself is slim and sleek, great for adding to your office without feeling overly bulky.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPersonalized Brewing Co. 64oz. Growler\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWhether they are using it for beer, cold brew, or just for display, this glass growler is sure to be a hit at the office. Made from amber, colored glass that actually protects your beer from UV rays (which can alter the taste of alcohol), the growler includes a metal cap, and is dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning. The best part: the price includes up to three lines of personalization on the growler label (beer not included). \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTrade Coffee Subscription\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPrefer coffee to beer? We’ve been a longtime subscriber to Trade Coffee’s monthly boxes, which offer beans from local and independent roasters from around the world. Trade’s gift subscriptions come with one new bag of beans each month, roasted to order and delivered fresh (you can increase the number of bags you get monthly too).What we like: through our Trade Coffee subscription, we’ve bee able to discover a literal world of unique beans and flavors, helping to refine our coffee drinking palate while brewing up cups of ‘Joe that even coffee snobs would be hard-pressed to turn up their noses at. For your boss or colleague, get the boxes delivered to their home or office; you can set everything from delivery dates to delivery frequencies online.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCoach Card Case In Signature Leather\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThis structured business card holder is fashioned from luxe pebbled leather, with the iconic Coach logo embossed in a more subtle fashion. Slim, sophisticated and available in more a dozen rich colors and prints (if you prefer something aside from black), the card holder makes a chic and handsome gift that your boss will be proud to use. \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPersonalized Custom Bamboo Engraved Charcuterie Board\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWhether your boss is a home chef or loves to serve up some cheese and charcuterie, this personalized cutting board is a great gift idea.

This year, get him or her this limited-edition Blue Label “Ice Chalet” set from renowned whiskey maker Johnnie Walker instead. This unique Scotch whiskey features a rare new blend crafted by Master Blender Emma Walker, aged in a mix of woods including ex-American bourbon casks and some wine and sherry casks. The liquid, meantime, features notes of creamy vanilla, spiced apple and plum with a “touch of smoke reminiscent of a mountain lodge fireplace.” The bottle is housed in a custom, parka-inspired bag designed by Perfect Moment.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Original Buddha Board Art Set\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Buddha Board is one of the most popular gifts right now for those seeking relaxation and mindfulness. Essentially a water painting easel, the Buddha Board lets you create languid, beautiful images with your bamboo brush, then practice the art of letting go as the water — and images — evaporate. The idea is to release and channel your stress through drawing and writing, and then start over with a “blank slate” as you re-focus and move on.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAura Digital Picture Frame\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore than just a digital photo frame, the Aura Frame has been a hit with both techies and design enthusiasts alike, thanks to its crystal clear resolution display, WiFi-enabled photo sharing, and intelligent facial recognition software (which will call up photos of your closest friends and family members to display). Download the Aura app and anyone (with permission) can send photos from anywhere in the world to the frame – great if you’re checking in from Cannes, for example, or want to share red carpet photos from the latest premiere. Smart sensors on the frame help it adjust to the brightness in the room, and the frame automatically turns off when it’s dark.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAesop Resurrection Duet | Hand Wash + Hand Balm\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tAesop products are instantly giftable (and always appreciated) thanks to their minimalist packaging and luxe-smelling scents. We like this set, which gets you the Aesop Resurrection hand soap and hand cream together in an easy-to-wrap box.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFlamingo Estates Tablemates Balsamic + Olive Oil\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe celeb-loved Flamingo Estates offers this beautiful balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil set, which comes in an embossed gift box that’s finished with a grosgrain bow. The balsamic is made from trebbiano and lambrusco grapes that are harvested by hand and then aged in oak barrels. The olive oil, meantime, features hand-picked olives that are then cold-pressed in Ojai, CA.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSTOCK Studio’s Niels Datema Chemistry Carafe\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tUpgrade their home and kitchen decor with this chemistry-inspired carafe from renowned product designer Niels Datema and STOCK Studio. Use this as a pitcher, flower vase or display piece. This is made from clear glass with a decorative copper sleeve. The carafe measures 6.5 inches tall and 3.5 inches in diameter.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSimply Seat Cushion\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPurple is known for their super comfortable mattresses, and they’ve applied the same technology and design principles to this ergonomic seat cushion. The unique grid design promotes better posture while relieving tension on your spine and glutes. The material also helps to increase airflow so you’re not stuck in a sweaty seat all day. What we like: the seat cushion comes with a machine-washable cover. A grippy bottom keeps the cushion in place to prevent you from slipping and sliding.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSugarfina Pop The Champagne 4-Piece Gift Box\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tA bottle of champagne is always an appreciated gift but if you can’t spring for the bubbly, give this champagne gummy bears set instead. From LA-based Sugarfina, this set gets you four of the brand’s best-selling sweets, each infused with a touch of Dom Pérignon.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Casco Adhesive Document Holder – Chrome and Black\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe next time your boss needs to jot down a reminder, have him or her do it on this hand-crafted notepad holder. From Spanish accessories brand El Casco, who have been hand-crafting luxe office products and housewares since 1920, this tray features hand-polished steel, a sturdy base and a subtle logo etched at the top. A protective felt pad prevents slipping.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBoxbollen Original With App\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tIf your boss or colleague likes to keep it light around the office, gift them the Boxbollen activity ball. The boxing-style game helps train reflexes and coordination as you keep the ball moving, without swinging back and hitting you. Promoted by a ton of celebrities online, the Boxbollen comes with an accompanying app that offers more ways to train, compete and track your stats.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBaseball Case with Custom Personalization Executive Gift Shoppe\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tShopping for a sports fan? This baseball holder features a plastic holder and stand, with a laser-engraved silver plaque that you can customize with the name or phrase of your choice (note: the ball is not included).\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDr Martens Kiev Leather Backpack\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tIf your boss has been lugging around the same beat-up backpack or book bag for years, upgrade him or her to this luxe leather bag from Dr Martens. The same care and construction that goes into the brand’s iconic boots is put on display in this bag, which features a handsome leather material, reinforced stitching and adjustable straps. A top carry handle lets this bag double as a tote. We like the separate outer pocket and the name card holder; inside, find a built-in laptop sleeve.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBirkenstock Zermatt Premium Shearling\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tCozy gifts are all the rage this season and slippers are a great way to get in with the trend without getting too intimate. Your boss will appreciate the warmth and comfort of these shearling slippers, which feature a contoured footbed and genuine suede upper. Though they’re designed for indoor use, the grippy sole lets you take them outdoors in a pinch, say, if you’re walking the dog or picking up the paper. Choose from two colors.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExecutive Pen and Business Card Case Gift Set\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tA classic gift with a contemporary update, this pen and card holder set features a handsome ballpoint pen, and a full-grain leather card holder. Both sit in a padded, cherrywood gift box, ready for presenting.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVintage Sterling-Silver Dunhill Watch Lighter\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tFor something truly spectacular, have your team chip in to get your boss this vintage lighter from British brand Dunhill.The Vault by Robb Report is offering this ultra-rare Art Deco lighter from the 1930s for purchase online as a true collector’s piece.

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Wega Wetzel -- a spokesperson for the assisted suicide company DGHS -- tells TMZ ... the going rate for one assisted suicide is 4,000 euros per person, or 6,000 euros for two people together -- that's about $4,600 and $7,000, respectively. This covers the cost of complete care by doctors and lawyers, including expenses.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Alice and Ellen Kessler contacted DGHS -- which, when translated, stands for German Society for Humane Dying -- more than a year ago because they wanted to end their lives with dignity on the same day together, Wetzel says. They ultimately decided to end their lives in their home in Grünwald near Munich this week.\n      \n\n          We asked Wetzel to give us the rundown of the process ... explaining a physician brings an infusion -- an overdose of anesthetic -- and inserts the patient with the infusion needle. The patients themselves have to open the infusion. Once the client is dead, DGHS informs the police. The company mediated more than 600 cases of assisted suicide last year.\n      \n    \n          This isn't a decision made on a whim, BTW ... according to the company website, candidates must have a membership with DGHS for a minimum of 6 months, submit an application for placement, and meet for multiple consultations with lawyers, doctors and possibly relatives prior to the assisted suicide.\n      \n    \n          The Kesslers were a world-famous singing duo who performed with the likes of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Fred Astaire.\n      \n    \n          Alice and Ellen were 89.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

Is UK's EsDeeKid the Actor's Secret Alias?!?\n                      \n                  \n                        Published November 20, 2025 11:10 AM PST\n                                                                            \n              \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          People are going nuts speculating Timothée Chalamet has been moonlighting as a mysterious UK rapper ... and based on the side-by-side pics, who can blame them?\n      \n    \n          The \"Dune\" actor looks like the spitting image of masked hip-hop artist, EsDeeKid, who's growing a fanbase across the pond with singles like \"Phantom\" and \"4 Raws.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The evidence of them being the same person is really piling up, though it's mostly based on photos of both their sets of eyes ... but c'mon! They really do look identical.\n      \n\n          Plus, we know Chalamet can do a British accent from his turn as a young Henry V in the 2019 film \"The King.\"\n      \n    \n          And that's not all ... he has roots in hip hop. Fans will remember, he went viral for a high-school rap performance as \"Lil Timmy Tim.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Then, 5 years ago, he debuted his $mokecheddathaassgetta character on 'SNL.'\n      \n    \n          Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.\n      \n    \n          Chalamet was also reportedly spotted at a concert British rapper Fakemink held in London earlier this year. The 20-year-old artist is a frequent EsDeeKid collaborator, so ... the suspicious clues start to add up.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          But it doesn't end there, because both EsDeeKid and Chalamet own and have been photographed in the same Alexander McQueen skull scarf! And with EsDeeKid putting out songs like \"LV Sandals\" ... it's safe to say both artists are into high fashion -- coincidence?\n      \n    \n          For Chalamet, he's already collaborated with Kendrick Lamar ... kind of. The Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper and the Oscar-nominated actor interviewed each other ahead of Kendrick's epic Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show this year.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Whether it's true or not, EsDeeKid's upcoming North American tour dates are bound to sell out quick. He's announced dates in Chicago, NYC and L.A. in February. And while his identity is still \"A Complete Unknown,\" time will tell if it's Timmy under that scarf after all.\n      \n      ",

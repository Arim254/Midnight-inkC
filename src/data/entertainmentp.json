    "body": "\n\tPrince William and Kate Middleton have issued a statement on the latest round of documents released from the Epstein files, with a spokesperson saying the royals are “deeply concerned.”\n\n\tAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor — King Charles’ brother who was stripped of his royal title in October over his ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — was mentioned and pictured several times in the over 3 million pages of documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month. \n\t\n\n\tThough Mountbatten-Windsor was not named, a Kensington Palace spokesperson said on Monday (via the Associated Press): “I can confirm the Prince and Princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations. Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.”\n\n\n\tLast week, Mountbatten-Windsor was ordered to move out of his home in Windsor earlier than planned after the latest document release. The former prince is now living at the King’s privately owned Sandringham Estate. \n\n\tMountbatten-Windsor, who had a longtime friendship with Epstein and maintained contact with him after his 2008 conviction of procuring a child for prostitution, has previously apologized and denied any wrongdoing. However, he is now facing renewed scrutiny as the new documents include a photo of him that appears to be with Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with him as a teenager, which he had insisted was doctored. In 2022, he reached a settlement with Giuffre that did not include any apology or admission of liability. Giuffre died by suicide in April 2025. \n\n\tThe royals’ statement comes as Prince William heads to Saudi Arabia for an official visit, where he will meet the crown prince in an effort to strengthen the U.K.’s relationship with the country. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAnna Chlumsky, nominated for the Emmy Awards six times for “Veep,” has signed on opposite Leslie Bibb, Actor Award nominated for “The White Lotus,” in the Cold War crime series “Top of the Rock” from Iceland’s leading production company, Truenorth, alongside Mystery Productions and Vertu.\n\n\tSet in 1983, amid escalating Cold War paranoia, the series follows Captain Diane Goodman (Bibb), a U.S. military police investigator, and MP Sarah Ellis (Chlumsky), both stationed at the NATO base in Keflavík, when an American soldier is found dead under suspicious circumstances outside the base. Forced to work closely with the Icelandic police, Goodman and Ellis uncover a web of espionage, betrayal and political deceit — trapped between duty and diplomacy, the two women must navigate a dangerous network of secrets before more lives are lost.\n\t\n\n\tCreated by Davíð Óskar Ólafsson (“The Valhalla Murders,” “Trom”) and Jón Atli Jónasson (“Arctic Circle,” “The Deep”), and co-created by Ragnar Jónsson (“Black Sands”), the six-part drama will be directed by Ólafsson and written by Jónasson and Óttar M. Norðfjörð (“The Darkness,” “The Valhalla Murders,” “Reykjavík 112”).\n\n\n\t“Early on we knew the role of Sarah Ellis would need to be someone with a formidable screen presence,” Ólafsson said. “Anna Chlumsky’s ability to switch between genres is like no other, and she absolutely embodies every character she’s played across her phenomenal career. We’re beyond ecstatic to round out the leads in ‘Top of the Rock’ with two of the most brilliant actors.”\n\n\t“Top of the Rock” is produced by Kristinn Thordarson, Ólafsson and Ágúst Freyr Ingason, with Truenorth’s CEO and founder Leifur B. Dagfinnsson serving as executive producer.\n\t\n\n\tThe production is developed and financed by Truenorth, Mystery Productions and Vertu, with Baradal/Frédéric Pittoors d’Haveskercke and Lumière as key partners. Casting is led by Emmy Award-winning casting director Alexa L. Fogel (“True Detective,” “Ozark,” “Smoke,” “Black Rabbit”), who also serves as an executive producer on the series.\n\n\tTruenorth is one of Northern Europe’s leading production companies, with over two decades of experience working on studio-backed titles such as “True Detective” Season 4, “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” and “The Northman.” “Top of the Rock” and previously announced “Fury” are the next productions in Truenorth’s expanding slate of original, internationally minded projects.\n\n\tChlumsky is represented by Liebman Entertainment, CAA and Schreck Rose Dapello.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTony winner Ben Platt is set to take the London stage in the U.K. premiere of “Midnight at the Never Get,” a musical from “KPop Demon Hunters” songwriter Mark Sonnenblick.\n\n\tThe production will take place at the Menier Chocolate Factory and is set to be directed by Drama Desk and Tony winner David Cromer (“The Band’s Visit”). Previews begin on July 11, with opening night on July 20 and closing set for Sept. 12. \n\n\n\tWith book, music and lyrics by Sonnenblick — who co-wrote many songs from Netflix smash “KPop Demon Hunters” and just won a Grammy for “Golden” — “Midnight at the Never Get” is set in 1960s New York City, where Trevor Copeland and Arthur Brightman’s romance is against the law.\n\t\n\n\t“In their secret nightclub act, ‘Midnight,’ they perform love songs in an act of defiance of a world that demands they stay hidden,” the show’s synopsis reads. “As tensions rise at the start of a historic movement, Trevor and Arthur are torn between their own surreptitious affair and the oncoming storm of social revolution.”\n\n\tThe production, which first premiered off-Broadway in 2018 and was conceived by Sonnenblick, Sam Bolen and Max Friedman, has been re-worked for its U.K. debut. Full casting will be announced shortly.\n\n\t“I’m thrilled to be undertaking my first full run on the London stage at the Menier as it transforms into the nightclub setting of ‘The Never Get,'” Platt said in a statement. “It’s truly wonderful to work with Mark, who is not only a genius songwriter, but who has also become a true friend. It’s a very special piece, my first wholly original musical since ‘Dear Evan Hansen,’ and we look forward to working with the generationally talented David Cromer to create this singular experience.”\n\t\n\n\tSonnenblick added: “This show means a tremendous amount to me and it’s a gift to collaborate with Ben again — he’s a once-in-a-generation performer. I can’t wait for audiences to experience his performance in the beautifully intimate theatre at the Menier. It’s also a huge privilege to work with the brilliant David Cromer as we realize the piece afresh for its U.K. premiere.”\n\n\tBooking for “Midnight at the Never Get” opens March 2 for Menier Chocolate Factory supporters, and regular priority booking begins March 11. \n\n\tWatch a first clip of Platt singing “Mercy of Love” from the show below.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” again led the China box office for the Feb. 6–8 weekend, taking RMB25.9 million ($3.6 million) and lifting its cumulative total to RMB4.5 billion ($634.1 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tThe market continued to soften in the days immediately ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday frame, with holdovers accounting for all of the top five titles and no major new releases entering the chart.\n\n\n\t“Busted Water Pipes” held second place, earning $2.5 million in its third weekend and pushing its running total to $14 million. The Taopiaopiao release centers on an underperforming local police unit that fabricates minor cases to pad its record, only to uncover a genuine criminal conspiracy after a burst water main exposes a gang of tomb raiders posing as repair workers.\n\t\n\n\tIn third, crime thriller “The Fire Raven” added $2.1 million, bringing its cumulative gross to $65.5 million. Directed and written by Sam Quah, the film stars Peng Yuchang, Alan Aruna and Chang Ning and revolves around a long-dormant murder case that reopens amid systemic corruption.\n\n\tJames Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ranked fourth with $1.8 million, taking its China cume to $164.8 million, while “Return to Silent Hill” rounded out the top five on $1.3 million for a $17.3 million total.\n\n\tOverall, China’s box office generated $17.6 million for the weekend. Year-to-date revenue now stands at $318 million, down 84.4% from the same period last year, as exhibitors await the start of the Lunar New Year holiday corridor later in February.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are, presumably, some well-meaning civilians who have entered politics and found the experience nothing but societally beneficial and personally character-improving — but few to none of them are to be found in the movies. That balance doesn’t change with “Master,” a story about the corrupting effects of power on a small-time Bangladeshi politico, and one with relatively few surprises in the telling. Rezwan Shahriar Sumit‘s film is kept interesting, however, both by regional particularities and universal parallels: It’s an eye-opening look at institutional structures in a country that rarely gets much screen time internationally, and a timeworn tale designed to rouse rage against the machine in local and global audiences alike.\n\t\n\n\tTo that end, “Master’s” victory over some glossier, bigger-name competition in Rotterdam’s Big Screen competition — a section dedicated to more audience-oriented world cinema — bodes well for its future distribution and streaming prospects, while plentiful further festival bookings are assured. Less intimate and more expansive than Sumit’s gentle, promising 2020 debut “The Salt in Our Waters,” it confirms the writer-director as a filmmaker of robust formal assurance and beyond-borders ambition.\n\n\n\tNasir Uddin Khan gives a performance of sturdy, man-of-the-people authority, gradually slipping into nervy self-doubt, as Jahir, a high school history teacher popular with both his students and the general community in the small rural town of Mohoganj. Introduced giving an impassioned lesson on the corrupting effects of British colonial rule — put a pin in this for later — to a gender-segregated classroom, he’s disrupted by a kerfuffle of reporters eager to see him in action. For it turns out he’s also running for Chairman (a mayoral position of sorts, as explained in opening title cards that lay out the Bangladeshi political hierarchy) of his district, with an unusually liberal campaign stressing women’s rights and improved education facilities.\n\t\n\n\tJahir’s socialist ideals prove popular in this deprived part of the country, where residents feel both geographically distant and far from the minds of government bigwigs in the capital city of Dhaka. Buoyed by a relatable family-man image, with the support of his patient wife Jharna (Zakia Bari Mamo) and their young son, he secures an easy victory — ending his teaching career, though he hopes to bring his nurturing values as an educator to local government. It isn’t long before he realizes his naïveté. \n\n\tIf Jahir is unprepared for the heat his new position immediately brings him from local criminals and charlatans threatened by his clean approach, he also has little idea what sharks await him inside the political sphere. Chief among the latter is his region’s unnamed UNO (Upazila Nirbahi Officer), a wily mid-level bureaucrat who presents herself as Jahir’s direct line to the big guns, and persistently pulls rank on him with a disarming megawatt smile. \n\n\tSuperbly played by Azmeri Haque Badhon (the compelling star of Bangladeshi Cannes entry “Rehana” a few years back) she’s the film’s most magnetic and richly drawn character — not a full-scale villain, but a woman who’s learned the moral compromises required to gain authority in a patriarchal society. Meanwhile, as Jahir’s marriage and home life crumble under the pressures of his new job, “Master” stands out for its examination of a male politician primarily through his relationships with women, which mostly undercut the feminist pledges of his early campaigning.\n\n\tSuch nuances give “Master” texture and tension in the first half, though the script — by the director with Sabbir Hossain Shovon — gets less subtle as it goes, and as Jahir’s disillusionment and corruption is hastened, though the bright pastels of Tuhin Tamijul’s lensing do little to betray his darkening soul. When the UNO presses for his allyship in proposing the building of a luxury hotel on the town’s forested fringes, necessitating the razing of a current shanty settlement for the homeless, his principles finally run aground. “You’re a history teacher, but you’ve learned so little from the past,” scolds Jharna — an irony the film could probably afford to leave unspoken.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHoda Kotb joined “Today” again on Monday morning as Savannah Guthrie‘s mother remains missing.\n\n\tKotb, who co-anchored “Today” with Guthrie from 2018 to 2025, briefly appeared on the show on Friday to present a segment on the outpouring of support for Nancy Guthrie, who hasn’t been seen since last Saturday. However, on Monday she opened the show as a co-anchor alongside Craig Melvin, replacing Sheinelle Jones who filled in for Savannah Guthrie last week.\n\t\n\n\t“Hoda is joining us while Savannah remains with her family in Arizona,” Melvin said as the show began. “We’re grateful to have you here.”\n\n\n\t“You know what, Craig, we always talk about our show is a family. We are a family,” Kotb replied. “I’m part of the family, and I’m happy to be with you because we show up for each other.”\n\n\tMelvin and Kotb then talked through the latest updates in the search for Nancy, including further investigations of the 84-year-old’s property and her daughter Annie’s house. Savannah and her siblings also posted another video message to their mother’s potential captors on Saturday, saying that they are willing to pay for her return.\n\n\t“We received your message, and we understand,” Guthrie said in the video. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”\n\n\tNBC correspondent Tom Winter then joined Melvin and Kotb to break down the significance of the video, pointing out that there was no mention of the Monday deadline that was included in one of the unsubstantiated ransom notes, nor did they ask for proof of life. \n\t\n\n\t“So when you look at this video, you say, what was in that second note?” Winter said. “I have not personally seen it, but it does appear that there’s been a shift here, at least a shift in messaging, so we note that.”\n\n\tMelvin, Kotb, Carson Daly and Al Roker also took time during the show to address the unusual nature of having to report on their co-worker and friend’s missing mother.\n\n\t“Our ‘Today’ family continues to navigate uncharted territory, balancing the updates on the search for Savannah’s mom with all the other stories of the day, like we normally do,” Melvin said. “But we know things are far from normal right now, so folks we are asking for your grace as we continue to do this.”\n\n\tKotb added: “I mean, paramount through all of this, Savannah and her family are our top priority. In addition to that, there is also a job to do.”\n\n\t“And we’re going to do our best,” Daly said. “It’s certainly not easy to do our jobs, and we’re doing that obviously for her and for you too, the viewers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLee Jun-ho has mastered the pivot. Fresh off Netflix superhero series “Cashero” — which hit No. 2 globally and cracked the Top 10 in over 70 countries — the K-drama star is plotting his next reinvention as a villain in “Veteran 3.”\n\n\tThe 2PM member, who made history as the first idol-actor to win the Grand Prize at the 2022 APAN Star Awards, has been deliberately reshaping audience expectations with each project. After back-to-back hits with period drama “The Red Sleeve” and romantic comedy “King the Land” — the latter reaching No. 1 globally in Netflix’s non-English TV category — Lee chose “Cashero” as a calculated departure.\n\t\n\n\t“In my previous roles, I played Yi San, the Crown Prince in ‘The Red Sleeve’ and Gu Won, a chaebol heir in ‘King the Land’ — both are composed characters with sharply defined roles and heavy sense of gravity,”  Lee tells Variety. “With ‘Cashero,’ I wanted to step away from that.”\n\n\n\tThe series offered Lee the chance to explore a grounded protagonist that resonated with Korean audiences while maintaining global appeal. “He’s someone that you would encounter in real life in Korea,” he explains of his character Kang Sang-woong. “He is an ordinary guy who saves up to buy a house, but the irony is that he ends up using that very money to save people with his powers. Unlike conventional superhero narratives, his abilities come at a very real cost: every time he uses them, he has to literally pay a price.”\n\n\tThe international response exceeded expectations, particularly the grassroots engagement across markets. “I saw memes where fans from different countries were holding up their own currency, as if they were offering it to Sang-woong so he could use his powers,” Lee says. “Seeing everyone take part in that challenge was genuinely adorable and endearing.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Cashero”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLee’s awareness of balancing Korean specificity with universal themes has evolved across his Netflix slate. While “The Red Sleeve” drew deeply from Joseon Dynasty history, “King the Land” was positioned as accessible comfort viewing for international markets.\n\n\t“While I would love to receive global acclaim for every project, I am well aware that not every story would become a global hit,” he notes. “For instance, ‘Typhoon Family,’ which is set during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, I was worried that such specific historical event might not resonate with audiences abroad. However, seeing global fans connecting so deeply with the story allowed me to put my worries to rest.”\n\n\tThe actor downplays any direct connection between his extensive live performance experience — he’s held over 100 solo concerts and sold out Tokyo Dome — and his screen work. “There’s a misconception that a background in music automatically makes you more expressive on screen, or that performing in a stadium for tens of thousands of people make the camera less intimidating — but that hasn’t been my experience,” he says. “If anything, the only perk is that I’m perhaps a bit quicker at picking up choreography of an action sequence. At the end of the day, both aim to move people’s heart.”\n\n\tLee has also moved into the business side, founding O3 Collective, a company built on three principles: the artist’s identity (“One”), originality in content (“Original”) and structured management (“Orbit”). However, he maintains the venture hasn’t fundamentally altered his project selection process.\n\n\t“At my core, I am still an actor, singer and artist, and I’m focused on doing the work that I want to do,” Lee says. “The decision to establish O3 Collective was driven by a desire to take on a greater sense of responsibility for work, rather than a shift to focus on different role.”\n\n\tThe company is run by professional management handling day-to-day operations, while Lee focuses on his artistic output. “Looking ahead, I would love to bring together like-minded artists under O3 Collective, creating a space where we can collaborate and move forward with a shared artistic mission,” he adds.\n\n\tLee is currently filming “Veteran 3,” which marks another deliberate risk in his trajectory. “As an actor, I have a constant thirst for genres and characters I haven’t explored yet. At this stage in my career, taking risks and rising to new challenges is essential,” he says. “That’s why I’ve chosen a villain role for my next project, ‘Veteran 3.'”\n\t\n\n\tBeyond that sequel, Lee has another project lined up, though details remain under wraps. When asked what kind of role would signal a real shift, he remains characteristically focused on constant reinvention rather than legacy management.\n\n\t“It’s hard to predict what that would look like — perhaps it will be my role in ‘Veteran 3,'” he says. “Above all, my goal is to consistently reinvent myself. I hope that with every project, audiences see a new and unexpected side of me, one that feels clearly distinct from the last.”\n\n\tLee’s brand partnerships include Dior, Godiva, Lotte Duty Free and Diageo, and he currently serves as global ambassador for Berluti and Piaget. Alongside his group activities with 2PM, he continues building a successful solo music career in both Korea and Japan, reinforcing his position as one of the most versatile artists of his generation across acting, music and luxury branding.\n",

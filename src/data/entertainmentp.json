    "body": "\n\tThe Cairo Intl. Film Festival opened this year not by looking outward, but inward, highlighting the expansive archive of Egyptian classics undergoing restoration. During the ceremony, audiences were shown striking before-and-after footage of restored films such as Hossam El Din Mostafa’s “A Crime in a Quiet Neighborhood” and Kamal Al-Sheikh’s “Sunset and Sunrise,” drawing audible reactions as decades-old images re-emerged with new clarity and texture. For CIFF president Hussein Fahmi, the moment signaled a renewed commitment to not only safeguarding, but reinvigorating Egypt’s cinematic heritage.\n\t\n\n\tThe restoration program, spearheaded in partnership with Egypt’s Ministry of Culture-affiliated Holding Company for Investment in the fields of Culture and Cinema, marks one of the most ambitious archival efforts in regional history. Fahmi said the push stemmed from both cultural responsibility and the dramatic shift in filmmaking technologies. “The technology has changed, so I had to change with it.”\n\n\n\tThis year’s edition showcased 21 newly restored titles, all of which now include English subtitles to reach international viewers. But the initiative doesn’t end with festival screenings. “It’s useless if you restore the films and screen them within the festival, and then nobody else sees them,” Fahmi said during a press roundtable. To ensure long-term access, CIFF and the Holding Company are developing a dedicated digital platform for Egyptian classics. “On that platform you can watch all these movies,” he shared, noting that younger cinephiles often have no entry point into the country’s earlier film tradition.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Sunset and Sunrise” (Courtesy of Cairo Film Festival)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe initiative isn’t entirely new; CIFF began restoring and presenting heritage titles in recent editions, steadily expanding the effort into the large-scale program unveiled this year.\n\n\tThe side-by-side restoration footage played at the opening ceremony sparked enthusiasm among festival guests, underscoring the sophistication of Egypt’s studio era and the craftsmanship that, as Fahmi put it, stood “parallel with the American cinema, with the European cinema” in its time.\n\n\tWhile the first restored batch marks a milestone, the scale of the work ahead remains staggering. “We have 1,300 movies to be restored,” Fahmi acknowledged. Still, he sees the size of the archive as a long-term opportunity. Once digitized and available, the collection could form one of the most comprehensive archives of Arab cinema anywhere in the world. “If we have all these numbers, we can have a fantastic platform, with a wide range of films,” he emphasized.\n\n\tFahmi placed the restoration effort within a larger reflection on Egypt’s shifting role in regional production. The country once produced around 60 films annually and exported them across the Middle East and North Africa. In recent years, political turmoil, market losses in neighboring countries, and the pandemic have brought output down to an average of 16 films a year.\n\n\tEven so, he insists that Egyptian cinema maintains a deeply recognizable identity. “When you watch an Egyptian film, you know this is Egyptian cinema,” he said. Its rhythm, themes, and cultural grounding, he argues, are what give it an enduring international appeal: “The more international you become, it’s because you’re deriving from your own society, your own culture.”\n\n\tFor Fahmi, the restoration program is not only about preservation but about restoring a kind of emotional filmmaking he feels is increasingly missing from mainstream cinema. “The disadvantage in what’s happening today is that when watching films, we’re not part of the film,” the veteran actor noted. “The films that we made had a lot of feelings and emotions. You connected to the characters.”\n\n\tHe hopes that reintroducing Egypt’s classic cinema, rooted in character, mood, and emotional proximity, will inspire younger filmmakers to reconnect with storytelling anchored in humanity rather than pure spectacle.\n\t\n\n\tAmid growing competition from regional festivals, Fahmi emphasized the need for CIFF to remain “young in spirit,” even as it reaches its 46th edition. Reviving the national archive, he believes, is one of the most powerful ways to do so by preserving history while giving new filmmakers a foundation on which to build.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“A Crime in a Quiet Neighborhood” (Courtesy of Cairo Film Festival)\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the 46th edition of the Cairo Intl. Film Festival, programmers from some of the world’s leading festivals are finding something they rarely encounter elsewhere on the circuit: a festival where the energy in the market mirrors the energy in theaters. As regional co-production models expand and the Cairo Film Connection strengthens the festival’s profile as a project incubator, Cairo is emerging as a key site not only for discovering new voices but also for understanding what matters to Arab filmmakers right now.\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s expanded Cairo Film Connection, held as part of Cairo Industry Days, signals the festival’s growing weight as a regional hub. With financing structures shifting across Middle East and North Africa and more funds opening conversations with local producers, programmers are watching how Cairo’s evolving market ecosystem could shape the films that eventually land in Europe and beyond. For filmmaker/writer-director Anas Sareen (“The Gods”), Berlinale Generation programmer and CIFF short-film juror, the opportunity lies in the next wave of filmmakers rising through these pipelines. “These structures push emerging filmmakers forward,” he notes, adding that what resonates most is meeting filmmakers “whose sincerity shows in the work.”\n\n\n\tCéline Roustan, director of programming at Palm Springs ShortFest and a NETPAC juror in Cairo, whose background includes programming roles within SXSW, IDFA and TIFF ShortCuts, views Cairo’s industry expansion as part of a broader regional realignment. The shift, she emphasizes, is not only financial. “It’s important for filmmakers to rely on partners from the region,” she explains. “When producers share the same context, the collaboration starts from a place of understanding.”\n\t\n\n\tIf the industry draws programmers in, it’s Cairo’s audience that defines the festival’s character. Both Sareen and Roustan point to something that sets CIFF apart from Doha, Red Sea and other major regional festivals: a deeply invested local audience that fills screenings.\n\n\t“Every seat is filled,” Roustan notes. “You don’t come here to play to an empty room. Cairo audiences go to the movies, they react, they debate. It really matters to them.”\n\n\tWatching films with an Egyptian audience, Roustan adds, reveals narrative nuances that may not surface elsewhere. The ideal film, as she frames it, is authentic to its own world while still allowing international audiences a way in, not designed for Western gatekeepers but not shutting them out either.\n\n\tSareen, attending Cairo for the first time, feels the distinction begins with the city itself. “Cairo is cinema,” he reflects. “Everywhere you look feels like the beginning of a story.” The city’s cinematic lineage, from its foundational role in Arab filmmaking to figures like Youssef Chahine, continues to shape how programmers engage with the films presented today. Cairo’s longevity as the region’s oldest FIAPF-accredited festival, he adds, brings an institutional memory newer festivals can’t duplicate. “It has managed to position itself as a leading place over many years.”\n\n\tThat foundation now meets a generational shift. Roustan points to a rise in films by women and Gen Z directors, reflecting changes in training, access and regional funding. More notable to her is a confidence among filmmakers telling stories intended first for local audiences rather than optimizing for international palatability. “More films are unapologetically themselves,” she notes.\n\n\tSome of that confidence is already visible in this year’s lineup. Roustan points to shorts like “First the Blush Then the Habit,” the kind of film she’s eyeing for Palm Springs, for its precision and strong sense of voice. On the feature side, she points to “Flana,” by Iraqi filmmaker Zahraa Ghandour, which has already screened in Toronto and IDFA, as part of a wave of well-crafted regional films moving fluidly between Arab and international festivals.\n\n\tSareen sees a parallel movement among diaspora filmmakers reconnecting with the region. Many, he observes, are returning with new perspectives shaped by displacement or migration. “There’s a generation trying to shed new light on our cultures,” he notes, pointing to an emerging pan-Arab filmmaking sensibility he finds particularly exciting.\n\t\n\n\tSome themes, however, remain unavoidable. “It’s impossible not to talk about Palestine,” Sareen reflects. “It’s a responsibility filmmakers feel, and they’re proud to take it on.” Conflicts in Sudan and across the region carry similar weight. Politics, he emphasizes, is not a branding device for Arab cinema but a lived reality that inevitably informs the work. Yet filmmakers are equally intent on not being defined solely by it.\n\n\tShort films often register these tensions most quickly. With their rapid production timeline, Roustan views shorts as a sharper pulse of the moment: “They reflect the state of the world faster than features,” she emphasizes. But urgency alone doesn’t justify selection; the filmmaking must stand on its own.\n\n\tBoth programmers consider Cairo a genuine launchpad. Distributors watch how Egyptian audiences respond, and programmers use CIFF as a scouting ground for films that may later reach Palm Springs, Berlin, or other key festivals. “The industry is here,” Roustan says. “Films can be picked up, and filmmakers can build connections that matter.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tFranco-Egyptian filmmaker Namir Abdel Messeeh’s “Life After Siham” is screening in the Special Screenings section of the Cairo Intl. Film Festival, ",
    "body": "\n\tFranco-Egyptian filmmaker Namir Abdel Messeeh’s “Life After Siham” is screening in the Special Screenings section of the Cairo Intl. Film Festival, on Nov. 19 and Nov. 20, having previously received development support at the 2021 Cairo Film Connection. In addition to playing in Cairo, it is also screening in IDFA, Turin and Marrakech.\n\n\tThe autobiographical hybrid-doc is produced by Messeeh’s production company Oweda Films, in co-production with Camille Laemle, via Paris-based Les Films d’Ici, and supported by two Egyptian producing partners – Ambient Light and Red Star. It is distributed by Météore Films. The sales company is Split Screen.\n\t\n\n\tAfter its world premiere at ACID in Cannes 2025, the film screened in Zurich and recently won the El Gouna Star Award for Best Arab Documentary in El Gouna Festival in Egypt. \n\n\n\tThe film builds on themes that Messeeh developed in his debut feature-length documentary, “The Virgin, the Copts and Me,” which screened at Cannes, Berlin and CPH:DOX, and was released theatrically in France, with 112,000 admissions.\n\n\tBoth projects are linked to his parents, who were forced into exile in France in the 1970s, after his father was imprisoned under Nasser’s regime, due to his communist affiliations.\n\n\tIn his new film, Messeeh interacts with his late parents and explores the power of film to revive memories and bring back lost ones. The director spoke with Variety about the film, and its development process, that spanned over a decade.\n\n\tHow did your project come about?After my previous film, my mother told me she’d be willing to work on a new film, but wanted me to make a “real film” this time – with actors, like the classic Egyptian films. I started working on a script, but when I found out she had advanced cancer, I told her, we’re going to make a film together very quickly, but she died soon after, in 2014.\n\t\n\n\tI started to make a film as an act of survival and resistance – to say that she’s still here, in a way. With the help of my camerman, Nicolas Duchêne, we filmed her funeral and then I filmed some sequences with my father. But it was too painful, and I stopped completely for a few years. Much later, I showed the images to a friend of mine who is an editor and he told me I had to make the film. Because it’s a universal story.\n\n\tYou originally planned to include more fictional elements?Yes, I wrote a screenplay in which there were images of my mother and the funeral, but the rest was fictionalized. That’s what we presented at the Cairo Film Connection. But after around three years of development, in which we presented the film to television stations, investors, and the CNC, we couldn’t get funding, I felt like giving up. Instead I decided to film some scenes with my father. I called Camille, my co-producer. We shot some new footage with my father and from the moment we started editing the film with all the documentary material, we realized we didn’t need to shoot the fictionalized scenes. Instead we got the idea of using archive films to try to tell the story – the scenes that were missing from my film. So it’s really a film that was constructed, that invented itself, that rewrote itself completely, during the editing process.\n\n\tHow important was it to have the world premiere at Cannes?We presented it to the Cannes festival because we thought this film has no chance of being released in the cinema and to find an audience unless we showed it in a major international festival. Cannes saw a rough cut of the film and said, “We’ll take it,” and from then on everything accelerated. We showed an almost finished version at Cannes and had a great reception. Then we went back to the editing room because there were still things to finalize… the sound, the music. We finished the final version of the film, which was screened in Zurich, where it received some awards, then we went to the El Gouna Festival, where we received three awards. So the film is starting to have a career.\n\n\tYour father is a key presence in the film.Immediately after the funeral, I filmed a few days with him. Then in 2023 we had this crisis, when everyone was saying no to the film. My father was living in a nursing home, and we learned he was soon going to die, and I thought to myself, I absolutely have to film something before he passes away. I started the film with my mother’s death because I didn’t want to accept that she had died, and the film ends with coming to terms with my father’s death. It’s a moment when we learn to say “I love you” and say goodbye, and accept the fact that life goes on, that death is part of life, which is traumatic for everyone. The film has had a therapeutic dimension for me.\n\t\n\n\tHow have people reacted in the screenings?The reactions have been really very nice. From people who have lost their parents, or whose parents were dying, who saw the film and told us, “We cried, but it made us feel good because it was a kind of permission, to say goodbye. Some people told me that after seeing the film it made them want to go talk to their parents.\n\n\tWhy has it been important for you to screen the film in Egypt, first in El Gouna and now in Cairo?It’s like bringing my parents back to Egypt. They left Egypt in 1970s, not because they didn’t love their country, but due to political and financial reasons. We always have lived in Egypt, in our hearts. In my early years, I was brought up in Egypt by my aunt. My parents always remained Egyptians. My father, even in France, lived in Egypt. He read all the Egyptian newspapers, he mainly had Egyptian friends. In his heart, he was always in Egypt. We were able to return to Egypt in the holidays. But it was an exile, something irrevocable. They were buried in France. Making this film, and showing it in Egypt and receiving prizes, is like bringing them back to their homeland.\n\n\tHow have Egyptian audiences reacted to the film?When we showed the film in El Gouna, it was really beautiful because at first I sensed that the spectators were very disturbed, because I was exposing a personal story, an intimate story in front of the camera, where people talk very openly about death and all that. I think that the audience was a bit unsettled at first, but something really incredible happened. At one point in the film, there was a shift and the audience felt entitled, I can’t put it any other way, to accept the emotions that they themselves experienced while watching the film. They started laughing and they started to cry. At the end of the film, it was incredible. There were spectators who came up to me, who came to hug me, and kiss me. Complete strangers. Even though this involves taboo subject for us. There’s a level of modesty in Arab countries – certain topics are not discussed, even less so in front of the camera. Matters of love and death, everything related to feelings between children and parents.\n\n\tHow important were festivals for development of the film?Very important. The support we received wasn’t large sums, but psychologically it was hugely important, because suddenly there were people who said they believed in our project. Development support included the Atlas Workshops, the Cairo Film Connection, the Arab Culture Fund, the Doha Film Institute and CineGouna. We also had two Egyptian co-producers – Ambient Light and Red Star – who put money into the film. I also invested some of my own money to get the film made. My father passed away, and I invested some of my father’s inheritance. I thought to myself, it makes sense that this legacy can be used to make a film that is a tribute to my parents. Once we were in the editing stage, we also managed to get some assistance from France, from the CNC, and from the Île-de-France region.\n\t\n\n\tWhat role was played by your coproducer, Camille Laemle?She was always my safety net. She was the one who always managed to help me find the balance – of never being too close or too far away from my subject. Camille’s mother died during production of the film and so it wasn’t just my film. Benoît Alavoine, the film’s editor, had lost his father a few years earlier. So in a way we were all orphans.\n\n\tThe archive images from Youssef Chahine’s films play an important role.I used these images to transform my parents into fictional film heroes. By using the images from films directed by Youssef Chahine, precisely because I’ve recovered some old images from his films and used them to recreate a kind of fiction. In a way it’s as if I kept my promise and fulfilled my mother’s wish to make a “real film.”\n\n\tWas it difficult to gain permission to use images from the Youssef Chahine archive?We were really lucky, because Marianne Khoury, Youssef Chahine’s producer, and her associates, who own the rights, knows me, and likes my work, and she really supported us on the project. She made it feasible to use the images. I also hope that this has allowed me to revive certain films and a certain kind of cinema. Next year, it’s the centenary of Youssef Chahine’s birth. I think his films will be re-released in cinemas and I hope that my film will also help to restore people’s desire to discover this type of cinema.\n\n\tWhat opportunities does the Cairo Film Festival offer?Cairo is a festival that attracts large audiences, from the general public. El Gouna has a higher proportion of industry professionals. In Cairo, the spectators come from all walks of life. They’re curious to discover films and otherwise don’t necessarily have access to them. It’s extremely important. Even my family, my Egyptian family, for example, are coming to see the film. So it’s a great accomplishment to screen the film in Cairo.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCynthia Erivo didn’t mince words when discussing the challenges she and co-star Ariana Grande have faced while promoting “Wicked: For Good.”\n\n\t“We have come through some shit,” Erivo told a packed audience at the Saban Media Center Wolf Theater during a Screen Actors Guild NomCom consideration screening Sunday night. “I mean, fuck even this last week, let’s be honest.”\n\n\tThe comments come days after Erivo intervened when a man jumped a barricade at the film’s Singapore premiere and rushed toward Grande on the yellow brick carpet. Video footage showed the intruder putting his arm around Grande before Erivo physically pushed him away as security removed him from the scene. Co-star Michelle Yeoh also helped comfort Grande following the incident. The man was arrested and charged.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the emotional Q&A session moderated by Variety, with other cast members — Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater and Marissa Bode — both actresses opened up about how their roles as Elphaba and Glinda have fundamentally changed them as artists and individuals.\n\n\n\tErivo, who plays Elphaba, reflected on her journey from drama school student to embodying a character that once provided her solace. She recalled being 20 years old in drama school, finding safety in the music from “Wicked” before ever seeing the stage production.\n\n\t“I had not seen the musical. I saw it when I was 25 and took myself for a single date for my birthday, and that place that made me feel safe, I ended up being in,” Erivo told the crowd.\n\n\tThe role forced her to confront personal fears and experiences she had previously avoided, including perceptions of beauty, loneliness and loss.\n\t\n\n\t“I was too scared to look at what beauty is when seeing through the eyes of those who don’t think that you’re beautiful,” she said.\n\n\tGrande became visibly emotional discussing how portraying Glinda reconnected her with her craft after feeling disconnected from it.\n\n\t“I think that spark of connection to my craft was also pretty disconnected for a little while,” Grande said through tears. “It really felt like safe again to fall in love with creating and like maybe I was being seen for the first time.”\n\n\tThe pop star expressed relief that audiences would finally understand the full complexity of Glinda’s character in the second film.\n\n\t“I feel really relieved that people finally will get to see and know and love Glinda the way that I had to play her,” she shared.\n\n\tBoth stars emphasized the lasting impact of their collaboration, with Erivo praising director Jon M. Chu and the ensemble cast for creating an unusually close-knit family on set.\n\n\t“You don’t get a group of people this close often on a set, you don’t earn family like this often,” Erivo reflected.\n\n\tGrande echoed the sentiment, calling Erivo “a lifelong sister” and describing their partnership as “absolutely the greatest gift of my life.”\n\n\tWhen asked about saying goodbye to their characters, Grande suggested the journey isn’t over, joking about Cher’s multiple farewell tours before adding: “These characters will be a part of our hearts always. They’ve changed our lives irrevocably and permanently.”\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good,” the second chapter in Chu’s two-part adaptation of the Broadway blockbuster, continues the story of Elphaba and Glinda as they navigate friendship, power, sacrifice and the mythology that cements their legacies as villain and hero. It’s among the top Oscar contenders this upcoming awards season with many predicting consecutive noms for Erivo and Grande.\n\n\tTogether, the witches of Oz showed that their partnership is as powerful off-screen as it is on it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMelissa McCarthy is returning to host “Saturday Night Live” this December. \n\n\tIt was revealed during this week’s episode that McCarthy will host the NBC sketch comedy series with musical guest Dijon on Dec. 6. It will be McCarthy’s sixth time hosting, and her first time leading the show since 2017. She has also appeared on the show multiple times as former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer among other cameo appearances.\n\n\n\tMcCarthy has received six Emmy nominations for her work on “SNL,” including winning the award for best guest actress in a comedy series for the show in 2017. \n\t\n\n\tDijon will be making his “SNL” debut with his appearance on the Dec. 6 episode. \n\n\t“SNL” recently turned the page on its historic 50th season, which was commemorated with a Peacock documentary series and a three-hour special joined by a myriad of former cast members and A-list guests. Bad Bunny kicked off Season 51 in October with musical guest Doja Cat. Amy Poehler, Sabrina Carpenter, Miles Teller, Nikki Glaser and Glen Powell followed as hosts.\n\n\tThe iconic late-night sketch said goodbye to several cast members heading into Season 51, including Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim, Devon Walker and Michael Longfellow. This season, “SNL” also welcomed Tommy Brennan, Jeremy Culhane, Ben Marshall, Kam Patterson and Veronika Slowikowska to the cast.\n\n\t“SNL” earned seven nominations at the 2025 Emmy Awards. It’s spinoffs, such as “The Anniversary Celebration,” “SNL50: The Homecoming Concert,” “Beyond Saturday Night” and “50 Years of SNL Music,” also scored 23 nominations in total.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeffrey Epstein‘s just-released emails were the topic of conversation on the cold open of the Nov. 15 episode of SNL.\n\n\tThe sketch began with Ashley Padilla’s portrayal of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt taking questions from the press, and, of course, most of the journalists were asking about the 23,000 emails that were released this week as a result of the House Oversight Committee investigation into the Epstein files. But then James Austin Johnson’s Trump showed up to explain himself.\n\t\n\n\t“I am hiding almost nothing — just enough to make it extremely suspicious,” Trump said.\n\n\n\tHe then started trying to reason through the files.\n\n\t“Let me ask you a question,” he asked the reporters. “If there was something incriminating about me in the files, then why would I cover them up? OK, let me go again. If I were innocent, wouldn’t I just release the files? OK, third time’s the charm: Jeffrey Epstein. I barely knew the guy, as evidenced by the thousands of pictures of us together dancing and grinding our teeth at various parties.”\n\n\tThe sketch also mentioned one of the most controversial and viral messages, in which Epstein’s brother, Mark, discussed photos of Trump “blowing Bubba.” Coincidentially, “Bubba” is a nickname of former President Bill Clinton.\n\n\t“I’m going to release all of the Epstein files,” Trump said. “This is great. Each file will be on sale for the low, low price of $800. This is a beautiful, one-of-a-kind printed out screenshot and very low-res. I just ordered the one that says ‘Does Putin have the photo of Trump blowing Bubba?’ We love that one.”\n\t\n\n\tGlen Powell was the host of the Nov. 15 episode, with Olivia Dean as the musical guest.\n\n\tWatch the cold open below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGlen Powell had a special guest in the audience when he hosted “Saturday Night Live.” \n\n\tDuring his opening monologue, “The Running Man” star revealed that he was originally supposed to host “SNL” four years for the ago tied to the original premiere date of “Top Gun: Maverick.” He and his family were celebrating when he got that call to host, a moment they shared with a UPS driver who happened to be delivering a package at the same time. \n\t\n\n\t“So we all took a selfie with him, and this is the selfie to mark the occasion,” Powell said before revealing the actual selfie with him, his family, and the UPS driver. “But then my dream got taken away,” he continued. “‘Top Gun’ got delayed because of COVID, so ‘SNL’ had to take their offer back. Lorne Michaels literally called me and said, ‘Without “Top Gun,”‘ and these are his words, “no one will know who the f you are.'”\n\n\n\tPowell lamented that, for the past four years, that UPS driver thought he was a liar. So when he got the call to host “SNL” again, he and his family decided to make things right. \n\n\t“My sisters tracked him down. The women in my family are terrifying,” he joked. “They found the cell number of this UPS guy. His name is Mitch. So to prove to Mitch that I am not a liar, I flew him all the way to New York…He thought it was a scam, but he still came, and he’s sitting in the audience tonight.”\n\n\tPowell then called Mitch onstage, with the two snapping another selfie together to bring things full circle for the driver and the whole Powell clan. \n\n\t“I had to wait my entire life, plus four years to be here,” Powell said. “But if I have learned anything, it is that the best things in life don’t happen overnight, and no one knows that better than UPS.” \n\t\n\n\tCheck out the full monologue below. \n\n",

    "description": "\n\tIn “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie,” a synthetic holiday trifle whose chief asset is that it knows and even winks at how much it’s a synthetic holiday",
    "body": "\n\tIn “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie,” a synthetic holiday trifle whose chief asset is that it knows and even winks at how much it’s a synthetic holiday trifle, one of the more amusing scenes has the Jonas Brothers showing up at a hotel in Amsterdam to see a cabaret performance by Ethan, an old enemy of Nick Jonas’s portrayed by Andrew Barth Feldman. It seems that the two had been in a Broadway show together — a musical version of “Home Alone,” with Ethan as the Macaulay Culkin character and Nick cast as the dad. Ethan felt patronized by the pop star, and the two didn’t get along.\n\t\n\n\tThe reason the Jonases have shown up is that they want to hitch a Christmas ride home on Ethan’s private plane. (Their own tour jet blew up, because…well, we’ll get to that in a minute. It has something to do with meeting Santa Claus in a bar.) Ethan, scarcely hiding his contempt, calls Nick up onstage, where the two perform a duet from the show, a song that’s at once a pretty power ballad and pretty awful (“I will never leave you home alone ag-a-a-ain!”). But it’s just plausible enough to give you a chuckle. Then, at the song’s end, Ethan’s contempt for Nick comes pouring out, and Andrew Barth Feldman plays this with just enough mean-boy panache to raise your chuckle to a giggle.\n\n\n\tIf you like Christmas movies the way I do, you’ve seen the genre evolve, in a major way, over the last decade. It used to be that we got a handful of them each year in movie theaters. The small screen was reserved for what I thought of as Hallmark-type TV-movies, including the occasional kitsch Christmas cookie like “A Very Brady Christmas” (1988). But streaming changed all that. The small-screen Christmas movie is now an industry, with dozens of feel-good holiday entertainments coming out of the processor, almost all of them some combination of the following: wholesome, silly, romantic, artificial, fizzy, reverent, and too brightly lit, with the Christmas cheer poured on like eggnog spiked with even thicker eggnog.\n\t\n\n\tSo it says something that “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” feels like a disposable stocking stuffer even when compared to the G-rated Christmas-globe world of made-for-streaming holiday fare.\n\n\tThe movie casts the Jonas Brothers as genially stylized versions of themselves, and it sticks them in the middle of a “Can we make it home for Christmas?” plot that’s like “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” made on a streaming budget. As the movie opens, in London, Will Ferrell is taking his family to see the final night of the Jonas Brothers’ latest tour (the joke is that Ferrell loves the Jonases more than he does his own children). As they come offstage, we see that the three have been playing together for so long now (20 years!) that the thrill is kind of gone. They’re not teenage pop stars anymore. They’re grown men with families who’ve come to take their career, and each other, for granted.\n\n\tThat might be just what you’d expect. But Santa Claus (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), appearing incognito as a short-white-bearded eccentric who happens to be sitting next to Joe at a bar, gets an earful of Joe’s troubles and puts an instructional curse on the brothers: They will not be able to make it home for Christmas until they rediscover their bond and start appreciating each other again. Which they will do over the course of 80 minutes of haphazard road-trip-through-Europe adventure.    \n\n\tSome of “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” is standard holiday-special treacle, with all the dramatic richness of a fake fireplace log. But it’s broken up by musical numbers that go down easy, since a lot of them, as composed by Justin Tranter (and sung with sweet vibrance by the Jonases), come off like Michael Bublé heartwarmers. A few of them are staged with a wink; during a production number set in a train station, the brothers do a double take after the dancers perform a hands-under-the-knee homage to a move that became a meme from “Camp Rock 2.” And there’s a romance that wastes no time falling into cringe terrain: On the train, Joe, the swarthy womanizer of the group (he’s the only one who isn’t married with kids), just happens to run into…his old childhood crush (Chloe Bennet)! Who is now a thoracic heart surgeon! And has just broken up with someone!\n\t\n\n\tThe cringe factor almost works for the movie. Kevin, the one who has never left New Jersey, is the nerdish Ringo of the group, and he’s sitting on something he needs to tell the rest of them. We think he’s quitting the band, but it’s really just that he wants the chance to sing a lead vocal. And Nick, though he’s the youngest of the three brothers, acts like the oldest, organizing the tour details, redoing the set list, making it all happen…and no one appreciates him for this. “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” is a very white people problems movie.\n\n\tYet that’s all part of the mild guilty pleasure of it. The Jonas Brothers, in their straight-arrow Middle American dudes-with-purity-rings-all-grown-up way, are likable, in part because they’re always poking holes in each other’s egos. And the movie is willing to be daft and a bit loopy, as in the episode where they find themselves aboard a private plane and the pilot, after trying to take sexy selfies of himself, winds up knocked out cold on the floor, with the automatic-pilot mechanism turned off. It will take crash-landing in the snowy woods, and having to scream at a pack of wolves, to make the Jonas Brothers rediscover their love for each other.\n\n\tThey’re all quite comfortable in front of the camera, but to me the clear stand-out as an actor is Nick Jonas. What he has, that his brothers don’t, is the ability to hold an audience, curious and intrigued, even when he’s doing nothing — it’s just a vibe, a sense of things going on behind his lean, sly visage. I like the Jonas Brothers and hope they continue on, especially if they ever get it together to do another song like “Sucker,” their 2019 hit that’s the best track they ever recorded. (They perform it in concert during the closing credits.) But at this point, as “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” more or less acknowledges, they’re an oldies act. The movie reaffirms their place in the pop firmament, but it also made me think: If they ever do start to get too old for this, Nick Jonas might have the big screen waiting for him.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDan McGrath, an Emmy-winning writer and producer for “The Simpsons,” died on Nov. 14. He was 61.\n\n\tHis sister, Gail McGrath Garabadian, confirmed his death in a Facebook post early Saturday morning.\n\n\t“We lost my incredible brother Danny yesterday,” she wrote. “He was a special man, one of a kind. An incredible son, brother, uncle and friend. Our hearts are broken.”\n\n\n\tMcGrath wrote 50 episodes of “The Simpsons” from 1992 to 1994 and produced 24 episodes from 1996 to 1998. He won an Emmy for his work on the series in 1997, taking home the honor for outstanding animated program for “Homer’s Phobia.”\n\t\n\n\tThe episode features director John Waters as a gay antiques dealer befriended by Marge. When Marge brings him home to meet the family, Homer quickly dissociates and does everything he can to keep Bart away from his influence. \n\n\tSome of McGrath’s standout episodes include “Boy-Scoutz ‘n the Hood,” “The Devil and Homer Simpson,” and “Time and Punishment.”\n\n\tMcGrath got his break writing on “Saturday Night” from 1991 to 1992. There, he became a frequent collaborator with “SNL” legends Chris Farley and Adam Sandler. He earned an Emmy nomination for his work on the iconic late-night sketch show in 1992.\n\n\tHis other writing credits include “King of the Hill,” “Mission Hill,” “Sammy,” “The PJs” and “Muppets Tonight.”\n\n\tBorn in Brooklyn, N.Y., McGrath graduated from Harvard University, where he was the vice president of the Harvard Lampoon.\n\n\tMcGrath’s obituary reads, “His prodigious talents and singular personality will be missed by many devoted friends.”\n\t\n\n\tInstead of flowers, McGrath’s family requests donations be made to his alma mater, Regis High School.\n\n\tMcGrath is survived by his mother, Eleanor; his brother Michael and wife Caroline; his brother Peter and his sister, Gail.\n",

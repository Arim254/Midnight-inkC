    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tGotta build ’em all.\n\n\tLego has officially stepped into the Pokémon universe, unveiling their first-ever line of buildable Pokémon sets and marking a long-anticipated crossover between two of the most powerful global play brands. The debut collection, inspired by iconic characters from Pokémon’s nearly 30-year history, launches worldwide on Feb. 27, with preorders now available on LEGO.com.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDesigned as premium display builds rather than traditional playsets, the initial rollout includes three headline releases featuring five fan-favorite Pokémon: Pikachu, Eevee, Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise. The sets invite fans to “build their Trainer journey, brick by brick,” translating Pokémon’s instantly recognizable designs into detailed, poseable LEGO models aimed at collectors and longtime fans as much as younger builders.\n\n\n\t“Bringing the world of Pokémon to life in LEGO bricks is both an exciting opportunity and a great responsibility,” Julia Goldin, LEGO Group’s chief product and marketing officer, said in a statement. “We’ve worked to combine our worlds in a way that truly celebrates the creativity, adventure, and wonder that Pokémon represents. This partnership opens up a whole new range of possibilities for Trainers and builders alike, and we can’t wait for fans to experience these new Lego Pokémon sets.”\n\n\tAnchoring the lineup is Pokémon Pikachu and Poké Ball, a 2,050-piece build that recreates one of the franchise’s most iconic images: Pikachu leaping into action from an opened Poké Ball. The dynamic display includes a black lightning-bolt base, crackling energy effects and a hidden “25” Easter egg referencing Pikachu’s Pokédex number. Builders can configure Pikachu in either a mid-battle stance or a seated pose alongside a closed Poké Ball.\n\n\n\tThe most ambitious release is Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise, a sprawling 6,838-piece display set that brings the fully evolved Kanto starters together for the first time in Lego form. Each Pokémon features unique articulation and sits atop a shared action base inspired by their respective biomes, with additional hidden details embedded throughout the build. LEGO bills the set as one of its largest character display models to date, positioning it as release for adult fans and collectors.\n\n\tRounding out the launch is Pokémon Eevee, a 587-piece set that features a poseable head, tail and limbs, allowing Eevee to be displayed at rest or in motion. \n\n\tShop through all of Lego’s new Pokémon offerings here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tRom-com fans were gifted this week with Netflix‘s adaptation of Emily Henry’s book “People We Meet on Vacation.” But people who were introduced to best friends-turned-lovers Poppy and Alex for the first time on their screens are now flocking to Amazon to acquaint themselves with the original IP. The book has unsurprisingly returned to the top of bestseller lists following its streaming release.\n\n\tStarring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth, the movie follows the odd-couple pairing throughout many years of travels as the free-spirited Poppy and up-tight Alex grow up and struggle with their increasingly intimate feelings for one another. Poppy and Alex do ultimately end up together, but only after overcoming their fear of losing their friendship.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNO. 1 BESTSELLER\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople We Meet on Vacation by Emily Henry\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tFans might be particularly keen on checking out the book because of its “spicier” scenes, which Henry and director Brett Haley both admitted to toning down for the film. “When Brett first started considering cutting it, that was because they had started doing test screenings and people who, especially people who weren’t familiar with the books, felt kind of like it was a hard right turn in the movie,” Henry told Variety about the book-to-screen changes.\n\n\tAhead of Netflix’s highly anticipated release of People We Meet on Vacation,” the streaming giant announced that it would be adapting several more of Henry’s books including “Funny Story” and “Happy Place.”\n\n\tShop through all of Henry’s books being adapted to the screen here, and check out more of the best book-to-screen adaptations coming out this year here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tBill Maher was convinced he wouldn’t win the Golden Globe he was nominated for because he thinks Hollywood is too woke for his brand of truth-telling.\n\n\tThe comedian and political commentator made the argument during the newest episode of his podcast “Club Random,” which was released on Monday. In conversation with Joel Edgerton, which was taped before the Globes ceremony, it came up that both men were nominated: Edgerton for best actor in a drama film for “Train Dreams,” and Maher for best stand-up comedy for “Bill Maher: Is Anyone Else Seeing This?”\n\t\n\n\tWhen Edgerton mentioned that he keeps his expectations low at award shows, Maher said he’s used to getting snubbed.\n\n\n\t“Sweetheart, I’ve been nominated for 33 Emmys, and they would never give it to me,” he said. “That’s not a gag number. That’s a real number. It’s crazy.”\n\n\tMaher sold himself a bit short, actually getting 41 Emmy nods across his projects, and winning once for outstanding informational series or special for “Vice” in 2014 in his role as executive producer. This year’s Golden Globe nomination was his first.\n\n\tThe comedian went on to speculate that, “Obviously, it’s something I said. Well, it’s everything I said,” and “I speak freely, and this woke town fucking hates that. And that’s okay. I’ve made my peace with that. So I know how this goes. This is not something I would ever … I have good standing. If I win this by some miracle, to go what people always say, ‘I can’t believe it, I’m shocked.’ I really should be shocked.”\n\n\tMaher didn’t have to be shocked, given that Ricky Gervais ended up winning the Golden Globe in the category with his latest special, “Mortality.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen introducing the nominees on Sunday, fellow comedian Wanda Sykes lightly roasted them. Maher looked annoyed as she said of him, “Bill Maher, you give us so much. But I would love a little less. Try less.”\n\n\tWatch the segment below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tApple is pulling together 10 different creative apps into a single bundle for the first time — making them available for one monthly subscription price.\n\n\tThe tech giant announced Apple Creator Studio, which it touted as “designed to put studio-grade power into the hands of everyone.” Apple Creator Studio will be available beginning Wednesday, Jan. 28, priced at $12.99 per month or $129 per year (with a one-month free trial).\n\n\n\tThe suite includes access to video editor Final Cut Pro; music and audio editor Logic Pro and image editor Pixelmator Pro on Mac and iPad. In addition, the Creator Studio includes motion graphics tool Motion, media compression and encoding app Compressor and MainStage (live-performance companion app for Logic Pro ) on Mac.\n\t\n\n\tBundle subscribers also will have access to “intelligent features and premium content” for Keynote, Pages, Numbers and (at a later date) Freeform, which are apps that are included for free with iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\n\tAccording to Apple, Final Cut Pro will introduce new video editing tools and intelligent features for Mac and iPad to “improve the efficiency of even the most complex workflows.” With the Creator Studio bundle, for the first time, Pixelmator Pro is coming to iPad that is optimized for touch and Apple Pencil. Logic Pro is adding intelligent features like Synth Player and Chord ID to “inspire anyone to write, produce and mix a range of popular music,” the company said.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Apple Creator Studio is a great value that enables creators of all types to pursue their craft and grow their skills by providing easy access to the most powerful and intuitive tools for video editing, music making, creative imaging, and visual productivity — all leveled up with advanced intelligent tools to augment and accelerate workflows,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior VP of internet software and services, in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tApple is offering special discounted pricing for college students and educators for the Creator Studio at $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year. Up to six family members can share all of the apps and content included in Apple Creator Studio.\n\n\tThe company will continue to sell one-time-purchase versions of Final Cut Pro ($299.99), Logic Pro ($199.99), Pixelmator Pro ($49.99), Motion ($49.99), Compressor ($49.99) and MainStage ($29.99) are available on the Mac App Store.

    "body": "\n\t“Stranger Things” Season 5 joined Netflix‘s list of its most popular English-language TV titles of all time in the No. 9 position as soon as it was eligible, following the New Year’s Eve release of the series finale. One week later, it has already jumped to No. 6, surpassing Seasons 1 and 2 of “Bridgerton” and “The Queen’s Gambit” with a total of 115 million views.\n\n\tNetflix calculates its all-time list by measuring each title’s viewership in its first 91 days of streaming — or in the case of shows like “Stranger Things,” which released its episodes in three batches, in the first 91 days of each batch. Therefore, the first four episodes will continue to accrue viewership that counts toward the chart until Feb. 24 while the next three will accrue until March 25 and the finale accrues until March 31. The season will certainly continue rising on the chart and seems likely to at least match Season 4 of 2022’s “Stranger Things,” which still sits at No. 3 with 140.7 million views.\n\t\n\n\tIsolated for the week of Jan. 5, “Stranger Things” Season 5 racked up 9.3 million views, ranking at No. 3 for the week. For a seventh week in a row, all previous seasons charted as well: Season 1 took No. 4 with 5 million views, Season 2 at No. 6 with 4.5 million, Season 3 took No. 7 with 4.4 million and Season 4 at No. 8 with 4.1 million.\n\n\n\tAt the top of the chart was “His & Hers,” a limited thriller series starring Tessa Thompson and Jon Bernthal that debuted with 19.9 million views.\n\n\tSee the Netflix Top 10 for Jan. 5-11 below, beginning with English-language TV and movies followed by non-English-language TV and movies.\n\t\n\n\tMore to come…\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichelle Williams will join Cillian Murphy and Daniel Craig in Damien Chazelle‘s next movie. \n\n\tThe untitled film, reportedly set in a prison, was written by Chazelle, who will direct and produce alongside Olivia Hamilton under their Wild Chickens Productions banner. Chazelle is looking for a comeback following “Babylon,” an ambitious look at the early days of Hollywood that collapsed at the box office when it opened in 2022. \n\n\n\tWilliams won a Golden Globe last weekend for her starring role in FX’s “Dying for Sex.” A five-time Oscar nominee, Williams has appeared in “Blue Valentine,” “The Fabelmans,” “Brokeback Mountain,” “Manchester by the Sea” and “My Week With Marilyn.” She is currently appearing on stage at St. Ann’s Warehouse in a production of Eugene O’Neill’s “Anna Christie.” \n\t\n\n\tUp next for Williams is “A Place in Hell,” a thriller written and directed by “Fair Play’s” Chloe Domont that will co-star Daisy Edgar-Jones and Andrew Scott. At various points, Chazelle has been linked to a biopic on Evel Knievel that was reportedly drawing interest from Leonardo DiCaprio, though that appears to have been put on a backburner. Murphy is a recent Oscar winner for “Oppenheimer,” and Craig recently appeared in “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,” as well as “Queer.”\n\n\tParamount Pictures will distribute the Chazelle film. Despite the “Babylon” setback, Chazelle is one of the most acclaimed directors currently working. He won an Oscar for “La La Land” and directed the Oscar-winning “Whiplash.” He also directed the space drama “First Man.” \n\n\tWilliams is repped by CAA and attorney John LaViotte. Deadline first broke the news of Williams’ casting. \n",

    "body": "\n\tClaire Danes is well aware that she’s become quite known – and highly praised – for her onscreen crying.\n\n\t“It’s a thing,” she told me during Variety’s Golden Globes Red Carpet Pre-Show, presented by Fire TV. “I have a very elastic face. I inherited it from my dad. It’s involuntary. It’s just what happens.\n\n\t“Sorry, not sorry?” Danes added. “I don’t know what to say.”\n\n\n\tDanes was up for a Globe on Sunday for her work in the limited series, “The Beast in Me.” While she didn’t win this year, she already has four at home, including her first statue for playing Angela on “My So-Called Life” in 1995.\n\t\n\n\t“I didn’t know what the Golden Globes were,” she said about attending her first ceremony 31 years ago. “I was a child. It was all very shocking. I did not have anything prepared, but it was fun.”\n\n\t“My So-Called Life” was a coming-of-age series about several teenagers in a Pittsburgh suburb. The show, created by Winnie Holzman, ran for just one season on ABC. The cast also included Jared Leto, Wilson Cruz, Bess Armstrong, Devon Gummersall, A. J. Lanfer, Devon Odessa, Lisa Wilhoit and Tom Irwin.\n\n\t“My So-Called Life” picked up four Emmy nominations, including one for Danes.\n\n\tDanes said that she’d be up for a reunion or a reboot of “My So-Called Life.” “I am really, really dear friends with so many people from the show, especially Winnie Holtzman, who wrote the show. So yes, that would be wonderful. I’d be very into some version.”\n\n\tWhere does she think Angela is now?\n\n\t“She’s doing great,” Danes said. “I believe in that Angela. She’s helping people. She’s very balanced. I’m sure she has a few kids. I’m very pro-Angela.”\n\t\n\n\tShe cracked that the reboot could be called, “My Mid So-Called Life.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Mr. and Mrs. Smith” Season 2 has a new hand at the helm. Variety has learned that Anna Ouyang Moench has been tapped to serve as showrunner on the second season of the Amazon Prime Video series. \n\n\tMoench takes over running the series from co-creator Francesca Sloane. It was reported in September 2025 that Sloane had exited the show for an overall deal at HBO that included writing a third season of “Big Little Lies.” Production on Season 2 was supposed to begin in the fall but was then delayed indefinitely. Mark Eydelshteyn and Sophie Thatcher are set to star in Season 2. \n\t\n\n\tIn television, Moench was most recently credited as a writer and supervising producer on the critically-acclaimed Apple TV series “Severance,” while she is also an executive producer on the upcoming second season of “Beef” at Netflix. She is currently developing multiple original projects, while she is also an accomplished playwright. Her most recent stage production — “Your Local Theater Presents: A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, Again” — had a sold out run at La Jolla Playhouse in 2024. \n\n\n\t“Anna is a phenomenal storyteller with an incredible ability to balance character-driven drama, sharp humor, and emotional depth,” said Peter Friedlander, global head of television for Amazon MGM Studios. “Her work on ‘Beef’ and ‘Severance’ speaks for itself, and we’re thrilled to have her at the helm of ‘Mr. and Mrs. Smith’ Season Two as she builds on the series’ compelling world and pushes it into exciting new territory for our global Prime Video customers.”\n\n\tMoench is repped by WME, Heroes & Villains, and Jackoway Austen. \n\t\n\n\t“Mr. and Mrs. Smith” was co-created by Sloane and Donald Glover. Glover also starred in Season 1 alongside Maya Erskine and a stacked guest star cast that included Michaela Cole, John Turturro, Alexander Skarsgård, Sarah Paulson, and Parker Posey. None of those actors are currently expected to return for Season 2. \n\n\tThe series received 16 Emmy nominations for its first season, including those for best drama series, best actor in a drama (Glover), and best actress in a drama (Erskine). It ultimately picked up two Emmys — one for best stunt coordination for a drama and another for best guest actress in a drama (Cole).\n\n\t“Mr. and Mrs. Smith” is a reimagining of the 2005 film of the same name that starred Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Per the official series description:\n\n\t“In ‘Mr. & Mrs. Smith’ Season One, two lonely strangers land jobs working for a mysterious spy agency that offers them a glorious life of espionage, wealth, world travels, and a dream brownstone in Manhattan. The catch? New identities in an arranged marriage as Mr. and Mrs. John and Jane Smith. Now hitched, John and Jane navigate a high-risk mission every week while also facing a new relationship milestone. Their complex cover story becomes even more complicated when they catch real feelings for each other. What’s riskier: espionage or marriage?” \n\n\tGlover and Sloane remain attached as executive producers along with Arnon Milchan, Yariv Milchan, Natalie Lehmann, Michael Schaefer, Stephen Glover, Anthony Katagas and Fam Udeorji. The series is co-produced by New Regency and Amazon MGM Studios. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Universal finally greenlit “Wicked,” casting director Bernard Telsey certainly knew the musical. \n\n\tHe brought Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth to the iconic Broadway cast when it first opened in 2003 and has been seeking actresses to play Elphaba and Glinda on stage for years since.\n\n\tWhen it came to casting the movie, his thought was, “I know Marc Platt, the producer, Jon M. Chu, the film’s director, and I certainly know the musical. Great, let’s go get our favorite people.” He laughs. \n\t\n\n\tTelsey is up for five Artios Awards nominations and, along with his partner, Tiffany Canfield, is shortlisted for the inaugural casting Oscar for “Wicked: For Good.” With years of experience casting film, television, and theater, Telsey admits the casting process for the film “was not that easy.”  \n\n\n\tCasting the musical was different, Telsey explains: “You’re looking for two women that have the stamina to be able to sing those songs eight times a week. There are huge vocal demands in that show and the score. It’s been around for almost 24 years, so people know that material.” He adds: “You need two women who have the vocal chops, and the acting chops, and all of the other stuff that goes with the demands of those roles. But for theater, it starts with the singing.”\n\n\tWhen it came to casting the film, it was a different ballgame. No one got offers, everyone had to come in and go through the casting process “no matter how many Tony Awards or Oscars or theater credits you had.”\n\n\tTelsey spoke with Variety over Zoom to discuss the process and his thoughts on the new casting Oscar.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhen the “Wicked” film was finally greenlit, how many sheets of paper did you and Tiffany have for brainstorming names?\t\n\n\tIt was daunting. The directive from Universal, and from Marc and Jon, was that these two roles are so iconic, and it’s not like most movies. You get a script, and the only people who know what’s really happening are the people involved. Everyone knows who these two women are. They know Idina and Kristen from the album, so the legacy of these two characters, the expectation was, I hate to use the word Olympian, but they were going have to be two amazing people. We don’t care if it’s a girl in college, it’s a girl from Broadway, film, TV or music.\n\n\tEverybody had to come in and do the process. That’s what I love so much about this movie: there’s a process called casting. It’s a verb, it’s an action, and we used the process to find every one of the people. There were no offers. That was our job to convince agents and people, you’re going to have to come in and be a part of it because it’s a work in progress, and it’s not going to be instant.\n\t\n\t\tStarting with Ariana Grande: You’re not watching or listening to the singer and superstar; she really disappears into Glinda. How did you know that when you offered her the role or when you’re seeing her audition, you’re not going to see that come through in her performance?\t\n\n\tWe didn’t know. You hoped. I saw her in “13: The Musical” and “Hairspray Live,” that we were a part of, but you don’t know, and that’s why no one was going to get an offer, no matter how many Tony Awards or Oscars or theater credits you had. She came in. Those were some of the things that Jon and all of us worked with her on, and how to work on Glinda’s vocals rather than Ariana’s vocals. And she did that. She’s got such an incredible instrument and such a wonderful craft. She went and did that work vocally, with her team and her vocal coaches. She did the homework.\n\t\n\t\tWe’ve talked about Jonathan Bailey’s casting as Fiyero, but is there a casting story that has yet to be told that stood out for you?\t\n\n\tIt’s Jonathan, because it was really tough for Tiffany and I to get through. Jonathan Bailey is someone that, as casting directors, Tiff and I both knew. You knew he danced, and I was always a fan. We were almost starting casting, but God bless his manager, Duncan Millership, who was smart enough to call and say, “Johnny Bailey is going to be passing through New York, you want to have a general with him. He was just so wonderful and all that stuff that we now have met, because you’ve all seen him in all the press and all the talk shows, but that quality came through. And to get to know him a little bit, it was like, “Oh, my God, he’s got all the stuff that you need for Fiyero.”\n\t\n\n\tWe were starting “Wicked” in two months, but he was not available. He’d just gotten “Fellow Travelers,” and “Bridgeton” was a hit. We went months seeing every actor and good actors, but we just were not able to find the right magical person for Fiyero. And of course, in the back of our minds, it was like, “It’s Jonathan fucking Bailey.” We would call Duncan every few weeks because you hope that someone’s schedule would change. And this is the only time I say it was the only positive thing about COVID, because COVID happened, and then our schedule changed.\n\n\tWe had already had those two women, Cynthia and Ariana. So, now the stakes were even higher for Fiyero, because it’s such a bigger part than on Broadway. So once our schedule changed, by luck, between “Fellow Travelers” and “Bridgerton”, their schedules shifted. So then he came in, and Jon Chu went crazy and met him, we set up a meeting for all of us in London, and then he auditioned, and it was magical. God bless Jonathan, because I think he was literally shooting all three things at the same time, and going from Toronto to London.\n\t\n\t\tYou talked about Cynthia. What was it like seeing her bring this role to life?\t\n\n\tOh, I get the chills. The challenge was how do we let people know that she’s not just a musical theater gal? You could assume she’s going to do the second half of the film, because she’s so strong and she’s a Joan of Arc being. But is she going to have that first half of the movie and the vulnerability and heartbreak? She came in, and she was so stripped of anything but heart, and she just stood there and sang those songs, and she was so vulnerable and allowed all of the shit that happens to Elphaba, happen. It was so moving.\n\t\n\t\tFor the theater kids, there are so many cameos, but is there one we’ve slept on or one you were really excited about?\t\n\n\tAdam James, who plays Glinda’s dad. I saw him on Broadway. What was great about this one? There we are in London, and we’re going to bring all our favorite stage actors that we know for these parts, from Sharon D. Clark for the bear, to Adam James. He was great, I love that he was in not only the first part, but also in the second part, in the birthday scene. So it’s a personal favorite of mine.\n\t\n\t\tFinally, the Oscars are recognizing casting. How does it feel after all these years?\t\n\n\tThe fact that the Oscars are recognizing this category there’s nothing better. It’s huge because of the visibility. The Oscars are like Mount Everest. It’s not about winning, it’s about the recognition and inclusion. It’s important to see that it’s a career, and that it’s a profession, and those people didn’t just appear in that movie. I think of the Lynn Stalmaster and Marion Dougherty movies, and think of how many Oscars or nominations they might have. It’s really exciting to know that my peers are going to be recognized this way.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEmily Henry‘s “People We Meet on Vacation” Netflix film adaptation debuted to 17.2 million views over its launch weekend.\n\n\tPer the streamer, the rom-com was the No. 1 film on its English-language Top 10 movie list for the week of Jan. 5–Jan. 11 following its release Jan 9. \n\n\tIn addition to “People We Meet on Vacation” film’s strong performance, the source material, Henry’s book of the same name, returned to the New York Times Best Seller list and the Amazon Book Charts ahead of the film’s release.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for Netflix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for Netflix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tStarring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth, “People We Meet on Vacation” follows best friends Poppy (Bader) and Alex (Blyth) as their relationship evolves into a romantic connection over years of annual trips together. \n\n\n\tNetflix went all out to promote the release of the film — the first of Henry’s five planned book-to-screen adaptations, two more of which are also in the works at the streamer — with an in-person event that brought summer to New York City on a rainy day in January via a giant heated dome full of fake sand, mixed drinks, free merch and snacks.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for Netflix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Jan. 10, one day after “People We Meet on Vacation” premiered, Henry, Bader and Blyth appeared during the event. Henry did a live-read of the first chapter of the book, which was hosted by NYC-based romance book store The Ripped Bodice, marking the first time she’s done an in-person, live reading of her work.\n\n\t“I just wanna thank you all for being here and for supporting me and supporting this book,” Henry told fans attending the live reading. “I know for a fact that this movie would not exist without you all. And I know I’ve said that kind of a lot, but it really is true that, this is a very expensive industry, so it’s a very risk-averse industry, and your support and love for this book made it something of like a no-brainer. And luckily Netflix agreed and was really, really supportive and let us all — and I use ‘us’ very loosely because I was not the person making this movie — but they let us make the movie that we wanted to make, and that is so rare and so special, I have come to learn.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for Netflix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHenry, who is currently working on film adaptations of her books “Funny Story” and “Happy Place” at Netflix, and “Book Lovers” and “Beach Read” at other studios, added: “I’m so excited that it’s out, and I hope you guys love it as much as I do. I hope that you keep loving the book and that you enjoy the differences between the two and can soak up both back and forth because I’m going to do that. I’m gonna keep watching this movie over and over again for years.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for Netflix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“South Park” Season 28 delivered a Thanksgiving special on Wednesday, which saw the citizens of the Colorado mountain town running in the annual Turkey Trot while United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth tried to bust Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel out of jail.\n\n\tThe episode opens with the South Park City Council debating who should sponsor the Thanksgiving 5K. Many of the town’s citizens fell on hard times in recent months, meaning local businesses and former sponsors can’t find the funds. However, there is one foreign entity that is flush with cash and eager to spend.\n\t\n\n\tThe show then cuts to a live-action commercial for the annual South Park Turkey Trot featuring the sponsor for 2025: Saudi Arabia. The ad sets this year’s top prize at a whopping $5,000, but it also makes sure to mention that “disparaging remarks towards the Saudi Royal family are strictly prohibited.”\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, at the Park County Police Station, Sergeant Yates gets an unexpected visit from Hegseth, who demands they release Thiel from custody.\n\n\tIn grandiose fashion, Hegeth rappels from the roof into the station. Flanked by two National Guard soldiers live-streaming on their phones, he tells his viewers, “Hey, what’s up, guys? This is Pete Hegseth with the Department of War! We’re here to infiltrate this police station and extract a P.O.I. ’cause that’s what we do!”\n\n\tDespite his efforts to intimidate Sergeant Yates, he easily kicks Hegseth out, denying his request to release Thiel. \n\n\tTrey Parker and Matt Stone brought the show back to more typical “South Park” antics this week after primarily focusing on Donald Trump-centric storylines in previous episodes. Parker and Stone have put the president in some seriously compromising positions throughout Seasons 27 and 28, including in bed with Satan and Vice President JD Vance. In the Season 27 Premiere, they deepfaked Trump into a political PSA which boasted about his “teeny-tiny” manhood.\n\t\n\n\tWhile shows like “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” have caught heat from Trump for far less, “South Park” has largely avoided the president’s crosshairs. During a recent appearance on The Daily Beast’s “Last Laugh” podcast, comedian Patton Oswald said Trump respects the success of “South Park,” and that’s why he hasn’t brought the hammer down.\n\n\t“‘South Park,’ not only does it make insane amount of some money, it gets insane ratings,” Oswald said. “And Trump can only be so angry at that, because what Trump ultimately will respect, even if it doesn’t respect him, is something where the numbers are through the roof, and the money is through the roof. He can’t look at ‘South Park’ and see how brilliant it is, and he can’t look at something like John Oliver and see how equally brilliant it is. All he can think of in terms of, look at this guy’s numbers, look at their numbers, and that’s the only way he sees the world.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Singapore International Film Festival launched its 36th edition with international star Shu Qi‘s first feature as director, marking the event’s most successful opening in its history.\n\n\tThe festival opened on Nov. 26 at Sands Theatre, Marina Bay Sands, with Shu Qi’s “Girl,” a semi-autobiographical drama set in 1980s Taipei. The director attended alongside lead actor Bai Xiao-Ying and actor-singer 9m88, joining festival ambassador Rebecca Lim and guest of honor Josephine Teo, Singapore’s Minister for Digital Development and Information.\n\t\n\n\tTicket sales surged 52% compared to the same period last year, with 33 sold-out screenings to date — four times the number from 2024. The festival is on track to achieve the highest box office sales in its 36-year history.\n\n\n\tMuch of the buzz centered on Hong Kong cinema icon Tony Leung’s appearance at a special presentation of “Silent Friend.” Both that screening and his “In Conversation With Tony Leung” session sold out within 10 minutes of tickets going on sale, ranking among the hottest tickets in SGIFF history.\n\n\tLocal productions also drew strong interest. Singaporean films “The Old Man and His Car” and “Sandbox” sold out within a day. Japanese titles including “Kokuho,” “Two Seasons Two Strangers” and “Bring Me Down to Portable Size” were among the fastest-selling international films. All titles connected to Shu Qi, including “Girl” and “Resurrection,” have sold out.\n\n\t“This year’s response has been truly overwhelming,” said Jeremy Chua, general manager of SGIFF. “The energy we’ve seen from audiences emphasizes the value of the collective experience of film. It has been a challenging year for the cinema landscape in Singapore, but what we are witnessing through SGIFF is proof that there is demand for cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tThe festival runs through Dec. 7, showcasing over 120 films from more than 45 countries, including over 30 made-in-Singapore productions and co-productions. The lineup focuses on stories of identity, resilience and rediscovery.\n\n\tThis year’s “In Conversation With” series features filmmaker Deepa Mehta, recipient of the Cinema Honorary Award; Oscar-winning actor Youn Yuh-jung, who receives the Screen Icon Award; and Hollywood-based Singaporean actor Chin Han.\n\n\tMarina Bay Sands continues its partnership with the festival, hosting the opening film and two “In Conversation With” sessions. Paul Town, chief operating officer of Marina Bay Sands, said the integrated resort’s venues provide an ideal setting for celebrating art and film.\n\n\tA frequent collaborator with Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, Shu Qi embarked on filmmaking at his suggestion. “Girl” premiered at Venice and won her the best director award at Busan International Film Festival. The film follows 10-year-old Hsiao-lee in 1980s Taipei as she navigates domestic dysfunction and forms a friendship with a precocious transfer student.\n\n\tAs an actor, Shu Qi has appeared in over 90 films, including three collaborations with Hou: “The Assassin,” “Millennium Mambo” and “Three Times.” She has won two Golden Horse Awards and three Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\n\tThe opening night red carpet drew prominent figures from Singapore’s entertainment industry, including Chin Han, Tan Kheng Hua, Lim Kay Tong, Hong Hui Fang, Jack Neo, Qi Yuwu, Yvonne Lim, Tay Ping Hui, Jeanette Aw, Lim Yu Beng, Irene Ang, Nathan Hartono and Benjamin Kheng.\n\n\tThe Singapore International Film Festival is part of the Singapore Media Festival 2025, hosted by the Infocomm Media Development Authority.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 1 of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tIn the battle that concludes Volume 1 of “Stranger Thing",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 1 of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tIn the battle that concludes Volume 1 of “Stranger Things 5” — in “Sorcerer,” written and directed by Matt and Ross Duffer — it appears at first that all is lost. The murderous creatures of the Upside Down have breached the military zone, and begin a mass slaughter of the soldiers, who’ve underestimated their foes. Elsewhere, Robin (Maya Hawke) and Murray (Brett Gelman) try to bring some of the endangered school children of Hawkins to safety in a truck, as they’re chased by Demogorgons. Meanwhile, the good guys’ biggest assets, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and Hopper (David Harbour), are in the base in the Upside Down, where they’ve made an important discovery: Eight (Linnea Berthelsen), one of the other telekinetic kids from the Hawkins Lab experiments, with whom Eleven bonded in Season 2, is alive and being held there.  \n\t\n\n\tDuring a lull in the battle, Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) steps through the membrane of the Upside Down to survey his quarry, where Joyce (Winona Ryder), Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and his original prey, Will (Noah Schnapp) — along with the remaining military officers and soldiers — seem to be no match for him. Vecna effortlessly extends his arms to turn their weapons against them, pushing fire back on the soldiers and pulling a pin on a grenade. He then levitates Will, and brings him to him, face to face. “Can you see them, William? Can you see the children?” he asks. “Do you know why I chose them to reshape the world? It’s because they are weak. Weak in body and mind.” He says this as the Demogorgons drag the kids Will and his friends had been trying to save into the Upside Down, where he’s already taken Holly Wheeler (Nell Fisher). Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) helplessly watches from the escape tunnel as one child is sucked into the Upside Down through a wall, and Robin sees that all the kids in the truck are gone.  \n\t\n\n\tVecna, taunting, calls the children “perfect vessels,” as he touches Will’s face almost gently. “And you, Will, you were the first,” he says. “And you broke so easily. You showed me what was possible, what I could achieve. Some minds, it turns out, simply do not belong in this world. They belong in mine.” He lets Will drop, and strides back into the Upside Down, confident that the Demogorgons will finish the job. But just as the massacre is set to recommence, Will remembers what Robin — to whom he’s felt bonded since realizing that she, too, is queer — had said to him earlier: that she’d always had all the answers within her, and she just needed to stop being scared of who she was Home movies begin to play in his mind. He remembers the first time he met Mike, who asked if he wanted to be friends; he remembers drawing things with crayons and showing them to a loving Joyce; he remembers building Castle Byers with Jonathan in woods near their home.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Schnapp and Jamie Campbell Bower\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s then that Will accesses the powers he (and we!) didn’t know he has, stopping each Demogorgon in place before they kill Mike, Lucas and Robin. Will can see through their eyes, he realizes, and — as indicated through arm gestures — he snaps the Demos’ limbs, killing all of them. The final image of Volume 1 is Will raising his head, and wiping his nosebleed with his sleeve, as we’ve seen Eleven do a thousand times on “Stranger Things” — as he stares with purpose into the distance.  \n\n\tIn a long interview with the Duffer brothers for Variety’s Oct. 15 cover story, Ross Duffer said, “We’ve been talking about Will having powers for as long as I can really remember.” \n\n\tBelow, the Duffers delve into what those powers are, the season’s opening flashback sequence, why the climax of “Sorcerer” (and that oner!) was “logistically the most difficult thing we ever did,” how they deployed Max, the return of Eight, the attack on the Wheeler house — and much, much more. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tWe have to start with Will. Will! Does he have Eleven’s powers? Or is it something different?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: It’s different in that he’s able to channel Vecna’s powers. But they’re all related. Vecna and Eleven, their powers are similar. The powers aren’t within him. He’s able to channel these powers from Vecna and use it, sort of puppeteering.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: He taps into the hive mind, and then he can manipulate anything within the hive. You’ll see how far he can take it as you continue to watch. But that’s how he’s able to manipulate the monster. So he can’t open a door, because the door is not part of the hive mind.\n\t\n\t\tIs this something that he always had that Vecna identified, or did he get it because Vecna grabbed him?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: He got it because he got hooked into the hive mind.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: If he’s not close to the hive mind, he’s not able to access or tap it.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: It’s proximity based.\n\t\n\t\tHad he not been taken to the Upside Down…\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Never would’ve happened. So it’s very different from Eleven in that regard.\n\t\n\t\tAnd how long have you known that this was something that Will had within him that you were going to build to?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We’ve been talking about Will having powers for as long as I can really remember.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: He had a dark version of it in Season 2 — he was connected to Vecna. He could see what he saw, but he didn’t realize that at the time he was able to tap into it in a way and use it against Vecna. That’s something he doesn’t learn till this season. It took us a while to build there, but it was something we always intended to do. The details of it were a little rough until we started working on it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Schnapp and Maya Hawke \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think came together for him after the gay pep talk from Robin and what Mike said to him about being a sorcerer? Do you have that thought out, or was it just a feeling?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We knew we wanted him to access these powers this season. Then we began talking about why now, and why is he able to do it now. Some of it is mythology-based in terms of the hive mind’s closer than it’s ever been for him. But most of what we were talking about was how has Will changed. Throughout the seasons, he’s been a little more fearful than the others. He hasn’t been a leader. He hasn’t accepted himself in the way that some of our characters have. So I think it was really talking about if he really is able to at least start to accept himself for who he is, will that give him the kind of strength that he needs in order to access these powers? That’s really where Episode 4 — and really the arc of the first four episodes — led for him.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhy doesn’t Vecna kidnap or kill Will in that moment?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You’ll see as it goes on, but he completely underestimates Will. He perceives him in the way that so many others have in his life, which is as weak, as nothing, as incapable of achieving anything great. So he completely underestimates him in that moment. Whether that’s going to happen again, you’ll have to watch Volume 2.\n\t\n\t\tThe home movie that goes through Will’s mind: How long were you planning to do that sequence?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The original draft of Chapter 4 did not have the flashback footage in it. When we read it through, it’s the same exact storyline with Robin, but because it’s such an internal shift for Will, we needed to be able to show that visually. That’s when we came up with the idea of Robin mentioning that she’d found these old tapes. So that was the only different thing that we changed about her monologue, but it allowed us to visually represent what was going through Will’s mind. Once we did that, we felt like the ending finally had the emotional kick that we wanted.\n\t\n\t\tHow much work was it to find the super young Will, Mike and Jonathan?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I know we were really scared about whether we were going to be able to find someone or not. I mean, initially, obviously there were conversations about, Do we do face replacement? Do we do what we did with Will at the beginning of the season? Budgetarily, it was impossible. It’s just very expensive.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The beginning scene he’s referencing, we were able to model it after Noah at that age, but this is even a younger age. So you start to get into uncanny valley world. It would’ve been extremely expensive, and also look creepy.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: It was really fun, too, to film that with those kids.\n\t\n\t\tSo let’s talk about that opening of the season. Did young Eleven in Season 4 give you the confidence to make young Will in that opening sequence for Season 5? How did you pull that off?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We’re so proud of it. That’s all Weta. We’ve never worked with Weta before, but Betsy [Patterson], our visual effects supervisor, when she brought them on, she was confident that they would be able to do it. Usually when we’re writing this stuff, we don’t worry too much, sometimes to our detriment, about how we’re going to pull certain things off. It just felt absolutely right to start with a flashback of Will, and then you just turn to Betsy and then ultimately Weta to do it.\n\t\n\n\tWe did take a lot of learnings from the Eleven stuff last year, but this was more challenging, because we’ve all seen Will or Noah at this exact age before. We saw this scene, the very beginning of it, in Season 1. So it was very important that it was hyper-real. It’s the first visual effects work that was done on the show. They just did incredibly detailed work and then just kept honing and honing and honing. Sometimes you can’t figure out what’s wrong. You’re just like, “That’s not quite…” — usually it’s the lighting — and just work on every shot to death.\n\t\n\t\tHow long had you known that that had happened to Will in the Upside Down, that he and Vecna had actually crossed paths?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: That’s an idea we’ve had for a while. I can’t remember exactly when, but when we first had that thought, immediately we started talking about Season 5: “That’s where we have to start. We have to bring it back full circle.” It sets up the season the way we want it to, which is everything is going back to Season 1, and everything is coming full circle. We thought there wasn’t really a better way to do that than to go back and see what Will had experienced.\n\t\n\t\tIn some ways, Dustin seems like the only character who’s having a natural trauma response to everything they went through in Season 4. How’d you decide that he’s the one who’s going to be carrying this stuff for them?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Well, he was the closest to Eddie. So the two who are most impacted by the events of Season 4 would be him and Lucas. But at least Lucas is trying, desperately, to keep hope alive [about Max], because it hasn’t been extinguished at this point, although he’s sort of losing it when we see him at the top of Episode 1. But Dustin has lost Eddie, so he’s struggling to remain optimistic because of their friendship and because of what he feels is a need to continue carrying that torch. It felt like the most interesting way to explore grief was through him.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: When we talked about it with the writers, even in Season 1 when Mike and Lucas get in a fight, Dustin’s the one that pulls everything together. He in a lot of ways is the heart of that group. So it immediately puts all of our characters on edge, and the audience hopefully, too.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNell Fisher\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow long have you known that Holly Wheeler would be a major character this season?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: That was a new idea. We did not know until we started working on Season 5, probably pretty early in the process.\n\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: I don’t even think it was in the pandemic. Because we had so long [of a break] that we had time to not only finish [writing] Season 4, but pitch a version of Season 5. I don’t think she was even in that. That was the big breakthrough, having shot Season 4, coming back and realizing the drive of these kids getting taken. Once we realized that, we got really excited about making Holly the focus of that new group of kids.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you approach casting Holly Wheeler?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: If you watch the previous seasons, Holly barely talks at all. So we didn’t really have much of a character there. She was just a little kid. Even Season 1, when we’re filming her, it was basically whatever one of the young twins would do, we would just try to capture it in real time. So we didn’t really have a voice for her.In the initial scripts, Holly was a little shyer and a little more withdrawn. And then as we found Nell, who’s such a character…\n\n\tMatt Duffer: And more of an extrovert.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: …we started infusing Nell’s personality into Holly.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We were really nervous about it. It is not like she had to look identical to the twins who were playing Holly in the past, but she had to resemble them enough that you weren’t totally confused. But more important than that, they have to be an incredible actor.\n\n\tI remember seeing the “Evil Dead Rise” trailer and seeing her. I had not seen the movie. I just saw her in the trailer and I was like, “That’s Holly.” But then I didn’t remember that. [Our casting director] Carmen [Cuba] found her, brought her to us, and I was like, “I knew this like six months ago.” That would’ve saved us a lot of time.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Carmen’s going to get annoyed you’re taking credit for this.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: She always thinks I take too much credit for the casting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNell Fisher and Cara Buono \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of the Wheelers, with the mauling of Karen and Ted in Episode 2, when they’re trying to protect Holly, how did you decide to bring these characters to the front who have been just around since moment one, but have been oblivious?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Oblivious! One of the early ideas was we finally had to bring them into the fold. It was easy, because we could bring anybody in the fold. It was the final season. Karen would’ve moved them out of Hawkins, had she learned any of this earlier. Finally, none of that mattered.\n\t\n\n\tWe’ve always wanted an attack on the Wheeler house, and to give Karen a killer badass moment, have her face down one of these monsters. Cara and Nell bonded. They got really close, and we just had an incredibly fun time shooting what is a very violent sequence. And yeah, Karen’s tough. She miraculously survives.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you decide when and how to reveal where Max is, and what’s going on with her?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We knew we wanted to keep her out of it for the first couple episodes, and we knew she was going to end an episode. At some point, we thought Episode 3 felt like the right time.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: From the end of Season 4 when we kept her in the coma, we knew she was trapped in Vecna’s mindscape, and we knew that was going to be part of her journey, at least for Season 5. But it finally clicked when we realized that Holly could be there as well, and then the other kids. That’s when her storyline really came to life.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I can’t tell you how many hours are spent in the writers’ room discussing the movie “The Cell,” the Jennifer Lopez/Tarsem movie. It’s such a great concept, because they enter the mind of a serial killer. It was the closest thing we could think of that parallels what we were doing. Our serial killer mindscape ends up being pretty different, but it’s probably why we ended up having a desert in there. A lot of desert sequences in “The Cell.”\n\t\n\t\tSo Vecna’s mindscape is that in-between world?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yeah. Holly’s nicknamed it Camazotz.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: The boys are always referencing Dungeons & Dragons, and Holly doesn’t play Dungeons & Dragons, so we thought it’d be interesting if she’s referencing something she’s into.\n\t\n\t\tThe wall: Do we find out what created it?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You find out pretty much everything, is what I’ll say.I mean, there are still some mysteries. We don’t explain everything, but the wall, certainly, you understand.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLinnea Berthelsen and Millie Bobby Brown in Season 2 of “Stranger Things”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe reveal that Eight (Linnea Berthelsen) has been kept captive by the military was a big surprise, in part because you were bringing back a storyline that seemed to have been dropped and set on fire and run away from. What was your thinking there?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yeah, that’s two-fold. We want when someone watches through the entire show, it doesn’t feel like we dropped a storyline or a thread. That it all connects. You see how everything fits together. And that was definitely a loose plot strand.\n\t\n\n\tBut also, we really like Linnea and we felt that that episode [in Season 2] just didn’t give her a chance to do what we know she’s capable of doing. So part of it was to put her back in and give her a moment. But we didn’t want to just do it to do it. As we were breaking the season, we realized that bringing her back really helped us with the Eleven storyline and how we wanted to wrap her story up. So there was a real reason to do it beyond just to not leave this dangling plot thread. \n\n\tMatt Duffer: We were shooting Season 2 really, really fast, because we were trying to hit this Halloween deadline. And the first script we wrote just flat out didn’t work, and then we had one week left to rewrite. I just don’t think we ever nailed it, obviously. I always felt bad that we didn’t figure that out for Linnea. But we felt we had something special with Linnea, so we wanted to bring her back. I think she’s awesome in the season, so I’m pretty excited about that. \n\t\n\t\tThe long battle sequence at the end of Episode 4: How long did it take to plan the extended oner shot in the battle?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Forever. It wasn’t originally written that way. We wanted it to feel very immersive, like you were in the middle of it. Ross and I hadn’t done anything like that before. The finale’s insane, but that sequence was logistically the most difficult thing we ever did.\n\t\n\t\tThe whole battle?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: The whole battle, but specifically that oner, because it involved obviously a lot of stunts and visual effects and actors, but then also children. It is stitched together [from several shots]. I don’t want people to get mad at us when we call it a “oner,” because it’s at night and you’re working with children and stunts. We could only shoot about two hours a night. So we divided it up into, I think, four chunks, and we thought we could accomplish within the time that we had one chunk per night.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: It was definitely the hardest thing we’ve ever done ever in terms of filmmaking.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFinn Wolfhard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX © 2025\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNo one dies in Volume 1, not even Ted and Karen, who seemed like goners for a second there. Did you contemplate having any kind of big death in this part of the season?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Once we decided we knew we wanted to do the Will power stuff this season, we knew that that’s how we had to end Volume 1. So there’s the low point of all the kids being taken, but the high point of Will has these powers. That was always the discussion. Vecna taking these children was the low point we needed for the end of Volume 1.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWill Volume 2 get bloodier?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I’ve said this before: The show is not “Game of Thrones.” I’m hoping it surprises people. But there’s no Red Wedding, if that’s what you’re asking. That would be depressing.\n\t\n\t\tWhen Will gets that image of the temple that Vecna doesn’t want him to see, he sees Holly trapped inside that structure. Is that where Holly is actually physically located in that moment, or is he seeing something in the future?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Do we answer this?\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I think this is OK.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yes. That’s where Holly is at the present moment.\n\t\n\t\tVecna gets a real glow up.\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: That’s one way to put it!\n\t\n\t\tWell, he’s looking good after almost being killed at the end of Season 4. Will we find out where he went after that?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah, there’s a backstory to all of that that is actually never revealed in the show. The idea of it was based a little bit on the original “Hellraiser,” although it’s different than that. But yeah, he retreated to lick his wounds. Nancy blew holes all through his body, so he more or less rebuilt his body into something stronger and hopefully cooler. But it was a challenge because we also wanted his new design to reflect the fact that he had been injured. That’s why we ultimately had to go full CG on his body was because you see holes throughout his body. It was figuring out that balance took a long time.\n\t\n\t\tSo Jamie Campbell Bower is in a motion-capture suit?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: He was just in a leotard, basically. But the important thing is they match his movement. And his face is completely him in makeup. We don’t touch that at all. That’s fully Jamie.\n\t\n\t\tDo we know yet what Vecna wants?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: No.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Nothing good.\n\t\n\t\tHe says that the kids are the way he’s going to remake the world.\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Right. What does that mean?\n\t\n\t\tIt’s safe to assume it’s not a nice world that he wants.\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I mean, depends on your perspective, you know?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSadie Sink and Caleb McLaughlin \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWill we be seeing more of Vecna’s memories in Volume 2?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yes, that’s what we call our new Russia storyline, because it’s very few characters. They’re kind of isolated off on their own, Max and Holly. We’re very happy with how it integrates with the other storylines.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow much of all of that is real vs. a set?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The forest is real.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: And the desert’s real. We went out to New Mexico to shoot any of the desert sequences. You’ll see more of them. The inside of the interior of the cave is a set build. That main outside of the cave is a set build right outside the forest. And the forest is the summertime set. That’s why we had to shoot some finale there when the leaves were green.\n\t\n\t\tIn “The First Shadow,” the prequel play that’s on Broadway and in the West End, there’s a reference to a cave in Nevada near an army base where a young Henry Creel first encountered something connected to the Upside Down. Is that the same cave?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah. When we were working on the play with Kate Trefry, we had Henry’s backstory worked out. There was always a balance that we had to find in terms of how much we were going to put in the play. [The director] Stephen [Daldry] and [the produce] Sonia [Friedman] were always pushing for more and we were pushing back and saying, “Well, we have to wait to reveal that in the show.” You’ll see, especially as you reach the final episode, there’s more overlap with the play.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: And, like, Max finds that “Oklahoma” poster, which people who haven’t seen the play are maybe like, “Why is Henry in ‘Oklahoma’?” But I think it’s nice for us to start to tie those two together.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: But you absolutely do not have to have seen the play to understand. They’re Easter eggs more than anything.\n\t\n\t\tFinally — and you may not want to touch this, so just going dive in — in the play, it felt like the real evil is the Mind Flayer. It’s what seduces Henry to accept what’s in the Upside Down into himself and ultimately what seems to have transformed him into Vecna once Eleven pushes him into the Upside Down. Are we barking up the right tree here?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You’re asking a question that will be answered in the final episode. The next spoiler talk we do, I’ll address it.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKristin Chenoweth took to Instagram Wednesday night to share her thoughts on the recent cancellation of her musical “The Queen of Versailles” and to thank her fans for supporting the show.\n\n\t“Hi everybody, it’s Kristin Chenoweth,” she said. “I just wanted to say, I know some of you may have heard that ‘The Queen of Versailles’ on Broadway is closing Jan. 4. I just want to say that I’m so proud of this new art that we’ve created, and it’s getting harder and harder to do so.”\n\t\n\n\n\tShe continued, “I think about all the shows in the past couple of seasons that have come and gone that not everybody got to see. I just love Broadway so much, and I love audiences and the live art form. If you’ve come to see our show, we thank you, we appreciate you. And if you haven’t, we’re here, like I said, until Jan. 4 at The St. James. We’d love to see you here.”\n\n\n\tThe closing of “The Queen of Versailles” was announced on Monday, less than two weeks after its opening night. The curtains falling on the short-lived musical is part of a larger trend of new Broadway shows struggling to find an audience.\n\n\t“The Queen of Versailles” is based on Lauren Greenfield’s 2012 documentary of the same name, and follows two Florida plutocrats who erect a 90,000 square-foot ultra mansion at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The musical marked a much-anticipated reunion of Chenoweth and composer Stephen Schwartz, who previously collaborated on the 2003 Broadway mainstay “Wicked.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAhead of the release of “Stranger Things 5,” which dropped on Netflix at 8 p.m. EST on Wednesday, series creator Ross Duffer posted a PSA on Instagram, walking viewers through their television settings to ensure that everything is set up for a proper viewing experience.\n\n\tWith the camera facing his TV, Duffer narrates, “A little PSA before you watch tonight. I want to make sure that your TVs are set up properly.” While acknowledging that different TVs will have different displays, he navigates viewers to settings, then picture mode settings and then expert controls before encouraging people to turn all of the expert controls off. On Duffer’s TV, this included dynamic contrast, super resolution, edge enhancer and color filter, all of which he deemed “garbage.”\n\t\n\n\n\tDuffer then goes back to picture options, where he shows that noise reduction should be turned off, as well as, “the worst offender of all, truemotion or smoothmotion,” which creates “the dreaded soap opera effect.”\n\n\n\tDuffer continues that on most TVs, enabling the expert vision— in his case, Dolby Vision-Movie Dark mode— will resolve most of the issues, but not all of them. He thus encourages viewers to double check, and warns that “whatever you do, do not switch anything on ‘vivid’ because it’s gonna turn on all the worst offenders. It’s gonna destroy the color and it’s not the filmmaker’s intent.”\n\n\tDuffer would understand that intent, as he and his brother Matt directed three of “Stranger Things 5: Volume 1’s” four episodes. The one outlier, Episode 3, was directed by Frank Darabont. Volume 2 will release the next three episodes of “Stranger Things 5” on Christmas Day and then the finale will release in theaters and on Netflix on New Year’s Eve.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s less Christmas cheer than anti-Scrooge snark in “Jingle Bell Heist,” a lightweight crime caper doubling as yuletide romantic comedy. Cinematographer-turned-director Michael Fimognari, assuming both roles here, lends a pleasing look and pace to this London-set tale of two strangers uniting to rob a retail magnate during the busy holiday season. There’s a bearable level of contrivance in Abby McDonald and Amy Reed’s screenplay, as well as sufficiently appealing leads in Olivia Holt and Connor Swindells. Arriving the day before Thanksgiving, this Netflix joint isn’t likely to become anyone’s long-term seasonal fave. But it’s a pleasant diversion that springs some decent twists en route to its happy ending.\n\t\n\n\tAfter a brief prologue that sees the protagonists about to commence their inside job on Christmas Eve, we jump two weeks, before they’d met. Philly-raised Sophie (Holt) has moved to the U.K. for the free healthcare — her mother (Natasha Joseph), a native Brit, is gravely ill. When not visiting the hospital, she’s a sales clerk at Sterling’s Department Store, then moonlights at a pub. She has a bit of a Robin Hood attitude, as glimpsed early on when she pickpockets an ill-tempered man to give his money to the sidewalk buskers he’d chased away. That impulse extends to dealing with occasional rude customers at her day gig, where the coworkers are nice but the boss, family-business heir Maxwell Sterling (Peter Serafinowicz), is one nasty cold fish.\n\n\n\tNor is that man beloved by Nick (Swindells), who’s staying in a mate’s (Michael Salami) flat and working at an electronics repair shop while he “gets back on his feet” following a prison stint. What got him handed that sentence (and cost him his marriage) was a conviction for robbing Sterling’s store, after he’d been hired to install its surveillance system. But eventually we glean that was a frame-up. In any case, Nick retains access to that system, such that he catches Sophie pulling a larcenous fast one on-camera. He uses that knowledge to try coercing her into a dual theft effort. She flatly refuses, until a doctor suggests that her mum will now require advanced treatment that can only be accessed in a timely fashion through the pricey, private medical sector. So Sophie decides she’s in, after all.\n\t\n\n\tTheir initially squabbling partnership benefits from different forms of expertise, including the talent for trickery she learned from a grandfather who happened to be both a magician and locksmith. But neither are exactly criminal masterminds, leading to some clumsy intel-seeking cosplay at a Santa-themed party for grownups, then a high-end charity gala. At the latter, socially inept Nick manages to make a conquest of Maxwell’s wife Cynthia (Lucy Punch), who’s disgruntled enough to appoint herself a third plotter against her own husband.\n\n\tNone of this intrigue is terribly inspired, let alone credible, but it’s handled with a certain panache. Fimognari, who’s shot most of Mike Flanagan’s considerably darker-toned projects, eschews the usual overbright Christmas comedy aesthetic for a burnished veneer. He and his design collaborators flatter both London exteriors and luxe interiors without making the production look too much like a consumerist wish-list. Humor is underlined via some zoom-lensing and other visual punctuations, as well as Steve Hackman’s busy, antic score — in addition to the expected mixtape of Christmassy various-artists tracks, here running a less familiar gamut from Run-DMC to indie rockers Low. \n\n\tIf chemistry between Disney child star turned scream queen Holt (“Heart Eyes,” “Totally Killer”) and Swindells (of Netflix series “Sex Education”) never quite heats up, they are individually likable, and supported by a strong cast that brings personality to roles of no great written distinction. The script’s mechanizations do pay off in its last lap, when a decent climactic setpiece gives way to a comeuppance that wisely delivers what we really want: not a romantic clinch, but a villain exposed and undone. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Stranger Things” briefly pulled Netflix into the Upside Down.\n\n\tThe streamer crashed at 5 p.m. PT on Wednesday, just as the highly anticipated fifth season of the sci-fi series premiered.\n\n\tThe service was down for about three minutes and continues to have bugs for some users. Tens of thousands of people who logged on to watch the sci-fi series were met with an image from “Nailed It!” with the caption: “Something went wrong. Sorry, we’re having trouble with your request. You’ll find lots to explore on the home page.”\n\t\n\n\tBy 5:05 p.m., the site seemed to be up and running for most users. Variety reached out to the streamer for comment; according to a Netflix spokesperson, “Some members briefly experienced an issue streaming on TV devices, but service recovered for all accounts within five minutes.”\n\n\n\tThis isn’t the first time Netflix has been overloaded by “Stranger Things” traffic. In July 2022, Variety reported that the streamer was unavailable for a brief period as the final two episodes of Season 4 dropped. Users also experienced Netflix outages during the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight, which was one of the first live-streamed events on the platform.\n\n\t“Stranger Things” returns with the first batch of episodes from its final season, more than three years after the finale of Season 4. The new episodes will find the Hawkins kids as they seek to find and kill the monstrous Vecna. The town is under military quarantine as Eleven hides from the authorities.\n\n\tCreated by Matt and Ross Duffer, “Stranger Things” stars Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Cara Buono, Priah Ferguson, Eduardo Franco, Brett Gelman, Dacre Montgomery, Matthew Modine, Paul Reiser, Jamie Campbell Bower, Grace Van Dien, Robert Englund, Tyner Rushing and Raphael Luce.\n\t\n\n\tThe series remains one of Netflix’s most-watched series of all time.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s been three and a half years since the most recent season of “Stranger Things” kicked off in May 2022. The first episode of the hit series’ fifth and final installment — delayed by dual Hollywood strikes and the mounting production value of a show that’s ballooned from surprise breakout to blockbuster franchise — opens in the fall of 1987. That’s 18 months after the events of Season 4, which concluded with archvillain Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) rupturing the metaphysical border between our reality and the alternate dimension known as the Upside Down, and four years from Season 1, which kicked off in November 1983. Which means that the real-life gap between two individual seasons of “Stranger Things” is dangerously close to that of the entire canonical span of “Stranger Things.” That factoid is absurd enough on its face, illustrating the escalating tax on viewers’ patience from a medium once defined by consistent, predictable output. (“Stranger Things” is far from the sole culprit: “Severance,” another streaming-native genre sensation, is a prime example.) But it also sums up the challenge facing the brainchild of twins Matt and Ross Duffer as their show steers into its home stretch, an eight-episode season broken up into three chunks, with the first dropping on Thanksgiving eve. “Stranger Things” is a story about children — and, more than that, the innocence of childhood, pitting a scrappy gang of bike-riding Dungeons & Dragons nerds against misguided adults who mess around with forces they don’t understand — that’s gone on long enough to see its cast grow up, with all the tensions that come with that glaring contrast. The list of data points is long. Millie Bobby Brown, who broke out as the telekinetic, “E.T.”-esque Eleven, is now the married mother of an adopted baby girl. Voices have dropped; IMDb pages have lengthened. For some of the series leads, the time between their casting and the finale’s premiere will encompass more than half their lives. But what matters to this reviewer is how these changes manifest in the show — or rather, don’t. The truth is that “Stranger Things” itself has not reflected its stars’ obvious maturation with an accompanying complexity. All of “Stranger Things” is an exercise in nostalgia. In Season 5, the show now seems to pine not just for the neon hues and synth-driven pop of the 1980s it conjures so evocatively, but for a simpler time in its own run that can’t be brought back, no matter how high the budget. Though if anything, “Stranger Things” has only gotten less rough-edged over time. Remember when Hopper (David Harbour) was an alcoholic who smoked? The four episodes that comprise Volume 1 unsurprisingly walk back the Season 4 cliffhanger. Hawkins, Indiana, has not turned into a hellscape of Demogorgons and slimy vines. Instead, the town has been put under military quarantine, occupied by the same foolhardy industrial complex that started this whole mess in the first place. With Matthew Modine’s Dr. Brenner now dead, the deep state’s latest ambassador is Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton), a scientist and officer who commands an entire base constructed within the Upside Down. Uncle Sam has stapled over most of Vecna’s rifts with crude metal plates, but left just enough open to use for his own ends. This human-made bubble makes Season 5 more geographically focused than its predecessor, which put thousands of miles between groups of the protagonists. That pays off in more concise run times than the bloat of Season 4, yet the return to Hawkins underlines the familiarity of the setups. In lieu of a mall, this year’s throwback locale is a radio station staffed by lovable burnouts Robin (Maya Hawke) and Steve (Joe Keery), who use the airwaves to send coded messages to their compatriots. The team once again splits up in the name of completing a sequence of self-assigned side quests before inevitably reuniting later in the season. Steve, his ex-girlfriend Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and her current boyfriend Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) continue to litigate their series-long love triangle. The same pieces are on the board, in only slightly different configurations. Season 5 shows us more of the Upside Down, and at a greater scale, than “Stranger Things” ever has before. Hopper embarks on his regular patrol of its terrain to search for Vecna, who’s disappeared since he was injured in the Season 4 finale, and his adopted daughter Eleven joins soon after; the pair remain there for the duration of Volume 1. These scenes showcase the production’s increasing technical abilities, realizing this other world more immersively than ever. But after last season’s revelation that Vecna governs the Upside Down and controls its inhabitants via hive mind, Season 5 hasn’t yet added to our understanding of the realm, either in mechanics or as metaphor. Only the scope changes, not the approach. The “Stranger Things” version of evolution is that our heroes now use radio waves, not D&D creatures, as their analogy of choice for sussing out how the Upside Down functions where science could not. Once, these frameworks were endearing instances of middle-schoolers making sense of the nonsensical. Coming from actors mostly old enough to be college graduates, the relative haziness of the world-building starts to peek through. To the extent “Stranger Things” conveys its main characters’ expanding emotional lives as they plunge ever further into adolescence, it’s through Vecna’s original prey Will Byers (Noah Schnapp), who comes to terms with his homosexuality in tandem with his enduring connection to the Upside Down. Will bonds with Robin, the only other queer person he knows, over his fear and uncertainty. Robin’s advice mostly boils down to “be yourself” platitudes, yet Hawke — who quite literally has stardom in her blood — sells them. But in lieu of giving a similar treatment to the rest of the Hellfire Club, “Stranger Things” shows its hand by effectively swapping them for a new generation of kids who have the cuteness factor they used to. Holly Wheeler (Nell Fisher), the baby sister of Nancy and Mike (Finn Wolfhard), gains new prominence as the latest Hawkins resident caught in the clutches of the paranormal. Her classmate Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly), derided by his peers as “Dipshit Derek,” provides some of the comic relief Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) once did. It’s no coincidence Fisher and Connelly are basically the same age their older castmates were back in 2016, when “Stranger Things” first set the world on fire. Holly’s interpretive lens of choice is “A Wrinkle in Time,” not a fantasy role-playing game, but she’s another kid confronting the unknown using the tools at her disposal, with grown-ups more a hindrance than a help. As it hurtles toward a final showdown with Vecna, “Stranger Things” is resetting the clock rather than riding its forward momentum. The Duffers have always worn their influences with pride, and the specters of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King helped jump-start the series into a phenomenon. But in its last hours, “Stranger Things” remains primarily pastiche, so indebted to inherited archetypes (mad scientist, reformed bully) and references (The Clash, Peanut Butter Boppers) that its main cultural impact comes from extratextual elements like casting and the ascendance of Netflix. By declining to enrich its characters as they age, “Stranger Things” traps itself in arrested development. When you get bigger without going deeper, you end up stretched thin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAndy and Barbara Muschietti are best known as the brother-sister director-producer duo behind the “It” films and the HBO prequel series, “It: Welcome to Derry.” But this year, they executive produced an entirely new project about real-world horrors and disappearances that took place in their home country of Argentina.\n\n\t“Norita” is a documentary directed by Jayson McNamara and Andrea Carbonatto Tortonese. It tells the story of Nora “Norita” Cortinas, the mother of an Argentinian activist who disappeared during the country’s 1970s junta dictatorship. Cortinas’ efforts for the government to reveal the truth about her son’s whereabouts sparked the Madres de Plaza de Mayo movement, where the mothers of revolutionaries protested and pressured the despotic government for information about their missing children.\n\t\n\n\tThe Muschiettis joined the project after watching McNamara’s prior documentary, “Messenger on a White Horse,” which explored English-Argentinian journalist Robert Cox’s bold efforts to cover the Madres de Plaza de Mayo during the dictatorship. \n\n\n\tAndy and Barbara grew up during Argentina’s dictatorial regime, so the topic struck a personal nerve with them. “We are Argentinian. We spent our childhoods in Argentina during the dictatorship. I was five years old when the military took hold of the country, and I was 13 when democracy came back,” Barbara told Variety.\n\n\tIn addition to the Muschiettis, Jane Fonda also joined “Norita” as an executive producer. “Jane Fonda got involved at the same time I did, and my God, I thought I knew everything, but then I met this woman. I’ve never met anybody like her. She is such a powerhouse and relentless,” continued Barbara. “We did a screening at the Museum of Tolerance a month ago, and she came and presented it and her speech moved me to tears. She understands that this movie is about Norita, but it’s also about what the U.S. is living with right now. She understands that there’s a comfort in being American that allows people to think that things like what happened in the film will never happen here, but that’s not reality. The reality is that it can happen and people have to start paying attention.”\n\t\n\n\tThe documentary’s timeliness for America and for any place enduring a tumultuous political climate is self-evident. What is more nuanced, however, is how the doc fits in with the Muschiettis’ larger filmography. While the filmmakers are Argentinian, their most well-known works are Stephen King adaptations about kids fighting off a killer clown demon in Maine. On the surface, it’s a long way off from Buenos Aires.\n\n\tHowever, there are overlapping themes between the projects. “Norita,” in many ways, explores the real-world manifestations of the horrors “It” alludes to. In “It”‘s setting of Derry, Maine, people go missing at troubling rates, yet people remain complicit out of fear. While the culprit in the fictional town may be a paranormal entity embodied by Pennywise the Clown, he is but a symbol of American colonization, racism, trauma and exclusion, as brought to the surface in the many power struggles depicted in “It: Welcome to Derry.”\n\n\t“Andy and I read the book when we were, I believe, 14 and 15. It was two years after the end of the junta and the return of Democracy,” recalled Barbara. “And we fell into that book like we’d never fell into anything before. It was just crazy and a big part of it was that it was about the weaponization of fear, which is what Pennywise does so well. Of course, that felt very familiar to us.”\n\n\t“Norita” had its world premiere at the Dances With Films Film Festival in Los Angeles in June and has since played at over a dozen festivals around the world. It is currently campaigning for awards consideration. \n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tNov 26, 2025 5:15pm PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t‘Stranger Things’ Cast Guide: All the Stars in Season 5 and Everything They’ve Done Since the Show Started 9 Years Ago\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIt’s time to return to Hawkins and the Upside Down one last time.\n\n\tAfter more than three years since Season 4 came out, “Stranger Things” returns with its fifth and final season on Netflix. Season 5 will take place 18 months after the events of Season 4, where the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, is under military control and quarantined as both the Upside Down and the real world collide. As the Hawkins group gets closer to finding and killing the evil monster Vecna, they are faced with the threat of saving humanity before it’s too late.\n\n\tThe main cast is back, including Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Sadie Sink, Joe Keery and more. New cast members for Season 5 include Nell Fisher, Linda Hamilton, Alex Breaux and Jake Connelly.\n\n\tEven though this is the final season, “Stranger Things” will be back for more spooky adventures. An animated spinoff, titled “Stranger Things: Tales From ’85,” will release next year and take place between Seasons 2 and 3. There’s also the hit Broadway show, “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” that takes place before the events of the show and uncovers Vecna’s origins in 1959 with younger versions of the adult cast members.\n\n\tHere’s a guide to who is back for Season 5 of “Stranger Things” and what they’ve done in the nine years since the show began.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEleven (Millie Bobby Brown)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA young girl with telepathic and psychokinetic powers, Eleven is a test experiment from Hawkins National Laboratory who escapes and finds safety in the town. Eleven eventually becomes adopted by Hopper and changes her name to Jane and begins getting adjusted to her normal life with the other kids of Hawkins. Outside of “Stranger Things,” Millie Bobby Brown has starred in the “Enola James” franchise, two “Godzilla” movies, the “Electric State” and more. In 2024, she married Jake Bongiovi, son of musician Jon Bon Jovi, and the couple adopted a daughter in 2025.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe middle child of the Wheeler Family, Mike is one of Will Byers’ best friends and one of the leaders of the Hawkins group. In Season 1, Mike and Eleven get closer to one another and throughout the series, begin a romantic relationship with each other. Wolfhard has co-directed and co-written Neon’s “Hell of a Summer” with Billy Byrk and has starred in projects such as Guillermo del Toro’s “Pinocchio,” “Saturday Night,” and “The Legend of Ochi.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOne of Will’s best friends, Dustin is one of the members of the Party and often teams up with Steve and the rest of the Hawkins team to solve what’s going on in the Upside Down. As a self-proclaimed player of Dungeons and Dragons along with Lucas, Mike and Will, Dustin is always planning ahead strategically. Matarazzo has voiced characters in projects such as “Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy” and “Angry Birds 2” and starred in the 2023 revival of “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” as Tobias Ragg. He also hosted a prank show called “Prank Encounters” for two seasons.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCaleb McLaughlin returns as Lucas Sinclair, an original member of the show’s young ensemble and the on-and-off love-interest of Max Mayfield. Though Lucas briefly separated from the group when he joined the Hawkins High School basketball team in Season 4, by the end of that season, he was back with his friends and at Max’s side when she fought off Vecna. Outside of “Stranger Things,” McLaughlin has starred in “High Flying Bird,” “Concrete Cowboy,” “The Book of Clarence,” “The Deliverance” and more.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWill Byers (Noah Schnapp)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Stranger Things” all began with the disappearance of Will Byers in the first episode of Season 1. Though he is rescued at the end of the first season, Will never quite shakes his unique connection to the Upside Down, often enduring telekinetic and foreboding visions throughout the series. Noah Schnapp has grown up with the character, having been cast as the youngest member of the main ensemble in Season 1. He’s also appeared in “Hubie Halloween,” “Abe,” “Waiting for Anya” and more.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMax Mayfield (Sadie Sink)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSadie Sink made her debut as the clever and fearless Max Mayfield in Season 2. By Season 3, Max was dating Lucas, and by Season 4, they had broken up. Nevertheless, they reunited as she became the target of Vecna. With the help of her friends and a Kate Bush cassette tape, Max played a pivotal role in defeating Vecna at the end of Season 4, but ended the finale comatose and possibly still unsafe as her mind is splintered between the real world and the Upside Down. Sink will appear in next year’s “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” and previously starred in “The Whale,” two “Fear Street” movies, Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well” short film and Broadway’s “John Proctor Is the Villain.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSteve Harrington (Joe Keery)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJoe Keery stars as the high school heartthrob Steve Harrington, a popular student who also happens to be Nancy Wheeler’s boyfriend when the show starts. By Season 2, he and Nancy break up but manage to remain friends. Steve establishes himself as the “unofficial” babysitter for the younger kids, as he is often left to look after them.\n\n\tKeery has since starred in several other shows like “Fargo” and “No Activity” as well as films “Molly’s Game,” “Slice,” “Spree,” “Free Guy” and “Marmalade.” The actor also embarked on a solo music career and has released albums “Twenty Twenty” and “Decide” under the stage name Djo. His recent album, “The Crux,” was released in April 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobin Buckley (Maya Hawke) \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMaya Hawke portrays Robin Buckley, a witty, multilingual co-worker and close friend of Steve after working together at the Scoops Ahoy ice cream shop and later the video store. Their friendship grows after Buckley comes out as a lesbian in the third season.\n\n\tHawke, the daughter of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, has appeared in various projects since joining the series in Season 3. She has starred in films like “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “Do Revenge,” “Asteroid City,” “Maestro” and voiced Anxiety in “Inside Out 2.” Her upcoming projects include roles in “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,” the Billy Wilder biopic “Wilder & Me” and romantic comedy “Wishful Thinking.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJoyce Byers (Winona Ryder)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe mother of Will and Jonathan Byers, Joyce is a single mother who is dedicated to protecting her children and protecting the town of Hawkins from the danger that lurks in the Upside Down. Throughout the show, Joyce teams up with the kids of Hawkins and Hopper as she protects Will after he returns from the Upside Down in Season 2. Since starring in “Stranger Things,” Ryder has reprised her role as Lydia Deetz in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJim Hopper (David Harbour)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJim Hopper is the chief of Hawkins Police Department, where he oversees the town from criminal activity. After the death of his daughter Sara from cancer, Hopper takes in Eleven as her father figure and guides her throughout her adolescence as her powers grow stronger. Throughout the series, Hopper and Joyce also develop feelings for one another. Harbour has also starred in “Thunderbolts*,” “Black Widow,” “Violent Night,” “Hellboy,” “Gran Turismo” and “Creature Commandos.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMike’s older sister, Nancy Wheeler is an inquisitive and ambitious hero, determined to get to the bottom of all of Hawkins’ secrets, be them paranormal or otherwise. Though she has been dating Jonathan Byers since Season 2, their relationship has been rocky and she remains the pivotal vertex in the love-triangle with Jonathan and Steve Harrington. Natalia Dyer has played the character since Season 1 and also appeared in “Velvet Buzzsaw,” “Based on a True Story” and more.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWill Byers’ older brother and Nancy Wheeler’s boyfriend, Jonathan is a reserved young man who has run the gamut of emotions since his debut as a wallflowery teenage shutterbug in Season 1. He is protective and supportive of his brother Will, but sometimes distant in his relationship with Nancy and frequently at odds with Steve as a result. Charlie Heaton returns as the character in Season 5 and has previously appeared in “New Mutants,” “The Souvenir Part II” and more.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tErica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPriah Ferguson plays Lucas’ younger sister, Erica, who often helps out her brother and his friends. An unlikely hero, she eventually became a vital part of the group’s efforts to fight off the supernatural creatures from the Upside Down.\n\n\tFollowing Ferguson’s breakout role in the hit show, she has starred in the Netflix film “The Curse of Bridge Hollow,” voiced characters in animations like “Hamster & Gretel” and “My Dad the Bounty Hunter” and appeared in short films like “Glitter Ain’t Gold.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tVecna (Jamie Campbell Bower)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJamie Campbell Bower plays Vecna, the primary villain of the series and main antagonist of Season 4. His human identity is Henry Creel, and he was born with supernatural abilities. He is also known as Number One and has a shared past with Eleven as subjects at Hawkins Lab.\n\n\tSince taking on Vecna, Campbell Bower has continued his acting career with appearances in the films “Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1,” “Emmanuelle” and “Witchboard.” He will join the new season of “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.” Beyond acting, he formed a band called “Blood Magic” with drummer Kyle Adams, in which they released their debut single “Death / Rebirth” in 2024.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMurray Bauman (Brett Gelman)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBrett Gelman brought to life Murray Bauman, a conspiracy theorist, private investigator, former investigative journalist and longtime friend of Hopper who helps Nancy, Jonathan, Hopper and Joyce in their fight against the Upside Down.​\n\n\tGelman has continued to act in several other projects, including, most recently, starring in the Apple TV drama “Lady in the Lake.” He’s contributing his voice acting skills to other projects such as “I Heart Arlo” and “Inside Job” on Netflix.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSimone Biles’ Newest Athleta Collab Is Up to 40% Off During the Brand’s Black Friday Sale\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaste Test: Heaven Hill’s New Limited-Edition Bourbon Is One of the Best of the Year\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDundon Ordered to Pay $1 in AAF Football League Bankruptcy Case\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Marketplace Bezel Lets You Shop Rare and Expensive Watches From Brands Like Patek Phillipe and Rolex — for Less\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

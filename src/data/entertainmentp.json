    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following story contains plot details from “Eyes Without a Face,” Season 4, Episode 5 of “Industry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tOn “Industry,” heroes are hard to come by. But in the HBO series’ audacious Season 4, Sweetpea Golightly (Miriam Petche) is about the closest the show gets to one. Introduced in Season 3 as an entry-level employee at the since-collapsed bank Pierpoint & Co., Sweetpea fit right into the finance drama’s salacious intrigue, where sex is often just as transactional as the latest high-stakes business deal. In addition to her day job as an eager new analyst, Sweetpea had a side hustle on OnlyFans, where she sold pictures to the same older businessmen who talked down to her on the trading floor. Along with her name, Sweetpea’s extracurricular pursuits helped her quickly stand out even in a cast stacked with rising stars.\n\n\tIn Season 4, however, Sweetpea’s starting from a more vulnerable place. Her anonymous accounts have been made public, thanks to recently disgraced dirtbag Rishi Ramdani (Sagar Radia); now, the only job she can get in her career field of choice is working for Harper Stern (Myha’la), a Machiavellian striver who’s allergic to intimacy, and hardly a reliable boss. But beggars can’t be choosers, so Sweetpea follows Harper from Mostyn Asset Management to her independent venture SternTao. On “Industry,” however, underdogs are always the best motivated to succeed — and in the season’s fifth episode, “Eyes Without a Face,” Sweetpea finally gets her time to shine.\n\n\tHarper had previously bet the fate of SternTao, a shorts-only fund that makes money when its targets fail, on the demise of Tender, a fintech start-up that’s suspiciously pivoted from facilitating porn payments to making growth-minded acquisitions in Africa. With SternTao’s short position squeezed by Tender’s stubbornly ascendant stock price, Harper agrees to send Sweetpea and Kwabena (Toheeb Jimoh), another SternTao trader Harper also happens to be sleeping with, to Ghana so they can take a look at Tender on the ground. There, Sweetpea puts her dogged investigation skills to use and returns with proof hard enough to save SternTao from ruin. Now Harper won’t have to commit fraud to secure more funding!\n\n\tThis being “Industry,” the win comes at a cost. On a quest to track down Swift GC, a company Tender acquired for an eyebrow-raising $50 million, Sweetpea goes to their office (it’s a PO Box), interrogates the M&A lawyer (his tiny office doesn’t scream “massive deals”) and interrogates Tender’s Africa chief Tony Day (Stephen Campbell) under the pretense that she still works at Mostyn. Day smells a rat and gives Sweetpea a blandly threatening phone call while she and Kwabena are kicking back a few beers on the beach. Shortly afterward, Sweetpea goes to the bathroom, where she’s assaulted by a stranger who breaks her nose along with her sense of security. \n\n\tRather than back down, Sweetpea resolves to “run a fucking train” on her adversaries. (She also sleeps with Kwabena to blow off some steam.) The men who look down on her for sex work are mostly faceless, but Tender offers a more specific target for her frustration. Luckily, a family friend of Kwabena’s provides the missing piece of the Swift GC transaction: Tender only said they paid $50 million for the company, which is little more than a decrepit office building. The falsely inflated acquisition was primarily a way of getting falsely inflated revenue off the books before prying eyes could apply real scrutiny. Having uncovered Tender’s house of cards, Sweetpea makes her triumphant return to London — but rather than accept Harper’s offer of a shoulder to cry on, Sweetpea flatly comes clean about the Kwabena hookup, makes clear she expects to be paid, and heads back to her apartment to break down in sobs.\n\n\t“She believes that if she can see this through, then she is of some value that she feels she’s lost,” Petche says of her character’s motivation for seeing the Tender takedown through. A recent graduate of the prestigious Guildhall conservatory, Petche is, like Sweetpea, a relative newcomer who’s quickly established herself in a high-pressure environment. Petche spoke with Variety about shooting on location, how getting doxxed has affected Sweetpea’s mindset and what “Industry” has taught her about the art of making good TV. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThis season is such a great one for Sweetpea overall. Headed into it, did you have a conversation with creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay about where they saw the character going?\t\n\n\tI had a call with one of our producers much earlier on, specifically about Episode 5, before I’d even got the scripts for Episodes 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. So it was more just keeping that conversation alive and making me aware of what was going on, because this episode is so crucial — not only for Sweetpea, but for the arc of the season. I was like, “OK, I need to understand how she gets here. If she’s arriving here emotionally, what do I need to do, working backwards, to build up to this moment? If this is the peak of her arc, how do I plan every step before and then after?”\n\t\n\t\tI assume that call was partly about going on location. Can you tell me a bit about filming in Africa?\t\n\n\tWe actually went to South Africa. We went to Durban in South Africa for, actually, a very short while. Most of the episode was filmed in Cardiff in the U.K. So there were only the shots that we couldn’t really — the ones that were necessary for us to be on location. For example, the beach shot, the moments when me and Toheeb are at the beach bar. \n\n\n\tI mean, going on location is obviously so incredible as an actor, because you’re put into a different set of circumstances. But it wasn’t the entirety of the episode, which was a very interesting way to do it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tChronologically, how did the Durban trip slot into the shoot?\t\n\n\tIt was at the very end. So we had done everything else and then, if I remember correctly, it was at the very end of that episode. It was pretty much 72 hours we were out there. It was a very, very, very short time. It was this whirlwind experience of wrapping up this episode.\n\t\n\t\tAfter what happened to Rishi’s wife in the Season 3 finale, the possibilities for the show widened, and violent, scary things can happen. So as a viewer, the bathroom scene was quite alarming — I was curious what that scene was like for you to film as an actor.\t\n\n\tI personally feel like that scene isn’t played for shock value. I think what matters the most to Sweetpea is this loss of control and safety, and how her sense of agency over the situation very quickly dissipates. And then from that moment on, she becomes different in her approach to Tender, to relationships. It really stays with her for a long time after that moment itself. \n\t\n\n\tWith the practical part, you want to make sure everyone is safe and everyone feels happy. We had stunt coordination. Everyone was checking in with one another. It’s like choreography, like anything that needs to be done with care. You go through it step by step, moment by moment, making sure everyone feels that they know what’s happening. Once you understand the choreography, you can then effectively communicate the scene to the audience. Once you have those steps in place, you can then really engage with the scene.\n\t\n\t\tYou speaking about Sweetpea feeling a loss of agency and control reminds me of how she must be feeling in the wake of this horrible violation and doxxing that she’s experienced. Do those feel like similar mindsets to you?\t\n\n\tI think that in Episode 5, the stakes for her are quite existential. I think she pushes through these extremes, not because she feels admirable or she feels heroic, but because these stakes are so existential for her. This is her career, her credibility — and really, at the end of the day — her sense of self-worth. She believes that if she can see this through, then she is of some value that she feels she’s lost. It’s the lengths that she’ll go to to prove herself, and as seen at the end of the episode, what it costs her to keep going. But I think that loss of agency is implemented at the very beginning of the season, like you said, with the OnlyFans leak. I think this is her grappling with having a sense of control over her own narrative.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen Sweetpea and Kwabena talk about if there needs to be a “why,” I agree your character doesn’t need one for pursuing sex work. But in terms of her motivation for being in this incredibly cutthroat industry and working as hard as we see her work this season, what do you feel like propels her in this financial world?\t\n\n\tI think that she is a person who believes her worth has to be proven, and that’s why she’s drawn to this high stakes environment. Because if she does these things, and if she’s brilliant enough, and if she’s useful enough and indispensable enough, then she can survive anything, even if it costs her emotionally or physically. She thinks that her brilliance is her safety. And I think what specifically this episode shows us is that it doesn’t keep her safe at all. In fact, it kind of collides with everything that’s going on. At the end of the episode, when she breaks down, I feel like that moment is the price of her composure finally being paid off. I wanted that moment to just feel like a relief and a letting go of everything from this season and the episode.\n\t\n\t\tThis episode also moves the Sweetpea-Harper relationship forward. On the one hand, Harper gives Sweetpea this job where no one else will. But at the same time, Sweetpea seems very clear-eyed about Harper’s faults and says no to her coming upstairs. What do you feel like Sweetpea’s attitude toward Harper is?\t\n\n\tTheir relationship is fascinating to me, because when I go back to Season 3 in my mind, when Sweetpea joins Pierpoint, Harper has already left. So all she has is these stories of Harper. I think Sweetpea admires Harper and sees her as this uncompromising, extremely intelligent, self-driven woman. So when Sweetpea has the opportunity to work with Harper, she grasps it with both hands. But then when they’re working with each other, the idealized version of someone gives way to the real person, and you realize what they’re actually like. There’s a frustration from Sweetpea that Harper, particularly at the beginning of the season, isn’t operating at her highest level for the entire team. And it frustrates Sweetpea, because she sees how brilliant Harper is, and how brilliant she can be. \n\t\n\n\tShe’s never really had an issue in saying that to her, or being quite blunt with her about how she feels. When she sees Harper not working for the team’s best interests, there’s this mix of admiration but frustration. When you want someone to be different, it’s a very interesting dynamic. Particularly in Episode 5, when Sweetpea comes back and says, “I want to be paid.” She’s putting up these walls to protect herself from what’s been taken on that trip away. She’s sort of protecting herself from the world.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s also a fascinating contrast between your character and Toheeb’s where Sweetpea comes straight out and says, “I hooked up with this person you’re also hooking up with,” and he doesn’t take the opportunity to be honest. You see that streak in Sweetpea where she’s able to be very straightforward, very blunt. Where do you think that tendency comes from with the character?\t\n\n\tFunnily enough, when I was thinking about who she was in Season 3, I think she observes people around her. I think she observes how people succeed. I think she observed how people succeeded within the world of Pierpoint. She’s aware that it’s a very cutthroat dynamic. And I think that she psyched herself up to say, well, if I want to succeed, I have to be like the people that I’ve seen be successful before me. I have to be cutthroat. I have to be honest. I have to have an opinion. And maybe part of that confidence initially is bravado. Initially, it’s fake it until you make it, and then as time progresses, and particularly within this season, she is a lot more upfront with her genuine opinions and feelings. That bravado has given away to this woman who actually really wants to be very good at her job. So yeah, it’s a mix of learned behavior and also innately what was already there that she’s now giving space to as well.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHarper has become so compromised, and in contrast, Sweetpea is incredibly easy to root for. As the person who plays her, are you worried at all that over the long term, she will become a little more corrupted?\t\n\n\tI am worried for her! I am worried for her, but it’s also one of the things I love about the show. These characters aren’t straightforward. They are morally complex, like human beings can be. They can change over time, and they can be one way one year, and a completely different person the year next. That’s what I really liked when I watched the first two seasons, before I was in the show — that you could be rooting for a character, and then the rug would be pulled from underneath you, and you think, “Oh, no, why did you do that?” That’s what I found endearing about the show. So I suppose, as much as I personally want the best for Sweetpea, I think that in line with the show, if she finds herself in some more complex situations or doing some more compromising things, I would understand why the character might have gone in that direction.\n\t\n\t\tLike a lot of other people who have come into their own on the show, you’re very early in your career. What have you learned from being on this particular show that you hope to take forward with you into other projects?\t\n\n\tI learned how TV is made, to be honest with you.\n\t\n\t\tThat’s important!\t\n\n\tIt really, honestly is. I like to know everything that’s going on. I’m like Sweetpea in that way. And honestly, it’s really helpful as an actor. I went to drama school, and you’re prepared with technique and emotional insight and all of these things. But I wasn’t taught about how a show is made, what it means to be a part of a season, how a set works. I’ve learned so much from this show, not only just technically as an actor, but just professionally.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has settled a defamation lawsuit brought a Vanity Fair staffer who claimed that she was falsely portrayed in the Shonda Rhimes series “Inventing Anna.”\n\n\tRachel DeLoache Williams, a former friend of con artist Anna Sorokin, sued in 2022, claiming that the series gave the false impression that she had abandoned and betrayed Sorokin and depicted her as “snobbish” and “greedy.”\n\n\t“Williams and Netflix have resolved the lawsuit,” said a Netflix spokesperson and her attorney, Alexander Rufus-Isaacs, in matching statements on Friday.\n\t\n\n\tThe series was based on a New York magazine article about the fake heiress, who went by Anna Delvey and who served nearly four years in prison for fraud. \n\n\tWilliams argued that the Netflix series sought to get audiences to root for Sorokin, transforming her from a real-life villain into a more palatable anti-hero. In the process, she alleged that she was turned from a victim into Sorokin’s foil.\n\n\t“Shonda Rhimes and the others responsible for creating and writing ‘Inventing Anna’ believed that the Series needed a villain,” Williams’ lawyers wrote in a court filing. “Out of animus toward Williams, they cynically decided to portray Williams as that villain.”\n\n\tNetflix tried to throw out the lawsuit in 2024, arguing that the show’s creators had a literary license to give their interpretation of events. A federal judge in Delaware denied that motion. \n\n\tNetflix next filed a motion for summary judgment following extensive discovery. That motion was still pending when the case settled.\n\n\tRufus-Isaacs has also filed suits against Netflix on behalf of Nona Gaprindashvili, a Georgian chess champion who alleged she was disparaged in “The Queen’s Gambit”: and on behalf of Francisco “Pipin” Ferreras, who claimed that the film “No Limit” falsely implied that he had killed his wife.\n\t\n\n\tRufus-Isaacs has argued that films based on true events do not enjoy a special exemption from defamation law. While deposing Rhimes in November 2024, he asked her whether she had any rules about fictionalizing the behavior of real people.\n\n\t“We had a position on accurately portraying people based on the facts and their behavior and then fictionalizing moments that made those facts even clearer,” Rhimes said. “I feel like I wanted to capture the essence of what that person was in those moments that we were portraying, and I definitely had a rule that we would never portray a woman in a severely negative way. That’s not what we do. We create three-dimensional people.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFred Smith, bass player for the influential proto-punk band Television, died Thursday. He was 77. The band confirmed his death on its Instagram. \n\n\tSmith started out playing with Angel and the Snake, which then became Blondie. In 1975 he left Blondie to replace Richard Hell in Television. After the band broke up in 1978, he played on solo albums for the Television members Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd, as well as for The Roches, Willie Nile, Peregrins and The Revelons. Smith also played bass and toured with The Fleshtones.\n\t\n\n\tHe rejoined the band when Television reunited in 1992 and played on numerous tours.\n\n\n\tTelevision member Jimmy Rip wrote on Instagram, “The legendary bassist for Television, Tom Verlaine and many others, Fred Smith, was not only my bandmate for 46 years — he was my true friend. He was a great running buddy and exactly the guy you wanted around when road life got wearisome. His sense of humor, much like his musical voice, was dry, subtle, to the point, hilarious and always left you wanting a more. Yesterday, he left this world, leaving so many who loved him wanting so much more…of him.We met in 1980 playing, with Jay Dee Daugherty on drums, in The Eve Moon Band, and soon after, the three of us were the NYC version of Holly and The Italians with Holly Beth Vincent. In 1981 when Tom Verlaine was preparing to tour for his disc Dreamtime, which Fred and Jay had performed on, they recommended me as second guitar, leading to very long and rich musical, and personal friendships.If you are a lover of melodic bass lines and counterpoint, you could go to school on what Fred created so effortlessly. He was a natural — never flashy, always essential — always serving the song in ways that only the greatest musicians can…\n\t\n\n\t“He fought his illness long and hard these last few years, looking always forward to new projects… we had big plans to play Tom’s music live this year… but it just wasn’t meant to be. Thankfully, we were able to say goodbye, “love you” were our last words to each other. I will miss him more than anyone can imagine.”\n\n\tSmith and his wife, Paula Cereghino. founded an artisanal winery Cereghino Smith which was based in Bloomington, New York.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe winter Olympic games are often seen as more of an appendix to their larger summertime counterparts than a tentpole in themselves. But in 2026, the parallels between Milan — which co-hosts the 25th winter Olympics with Cortina d’Ampezzo, a ski town near the Austrian border — and 2024 host city Paris are impossible to ignore. They also paid dividends in an opening ceremony that, much like the Seine-set one a year and a half ago, drew on the traditions of a European cultural capital to deliver a playful, detail-dense tone setter for the weeks to come. (The ceremony was covered live on NBC and its affiliated streaming service Peacock, preceded by an acknowledgement of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie’s absence amid the ongoing search for her missing mother.) Even if Milan’s ceremony didn’t match the Paris one in scale, it made for an equally enthusiastic welcome to the world’s largest sporting event.\n\t\n\n\tFrom a dance number that paid homage to the works of sculptor Antonio Canova to a performance of the iconic Puccini aria “Nessun dorma” by singer Andrea Bocelli, the ceremony’s producers opted to emphasize Italian identity throughout. (Apart from a random-seeming cameo by Charlize Theron to encourage peace among nations, that is. At least Mariah Carey sang a bit of Italian when she covered “Volare”!) The creative portion of the ceremony, bracketing the parade of athletes led by guides in full-length parka gowns, spanned high art and low: a procession of models in suits by the namesake house of the late designer Giorgio Armani in the hues of the tricolor Italian flag and a gloriously goofy, Eurovision-esque dance number led by Sabrina Impacciatore of “The White Lotus” and “The Paper.” The Italian ethos spans both refined tailoring and shiny metallic ski suits paired with face glitter, and the ceremony reflected both extremes.\n\t\n\n\tWhile Impacciatore is known to international audiences thanks to her work in American TV, the ceremony incorporated other Italian talents who have yet to become as recognizable on the world stage. Actress and comedian Brenda Lodigiani performed a miming act riffing on the Italian trope of communicating with one’s hands, while actor Pierfrancesco Favino staged a dramatic reading of Giacamo Leopardi’s famous poem “L’Infinito.” Model Vittoria Ceretti, best known stateside for her romantic relationship with Leonardo Dicaprio, acted as a courier for the Italian flag. \n\n\tThe deployment of local talent, which extended even to figures outside the entertainment industry like astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, was a meaningful gesture. But the apotheosis of the ceremony arrived early, and had little to do with individual personalities. An ecstatic dance to Rossini’s “William Tell Overture” united a rainbow-hued cast — dressed as everything from Rome’s Colosseum to Milan’s Duomo to dress cutouts to Moka pots — under three enormous tubes of paint, each representing a primary color. The segment was a gloriously chaotic tribute to Italy’s successes across the arts, and carried the tone even through slower lulls like a call for peace by rapper Ghali, featuring the aforementioned Theron cameo. (Though it is amusing to think of United States Vice President JD Vance, who attended the ceremony with the Second Lady, listening to Theron’s definition of peace as prosperity regardless of race, class or sexuality. Come to think of it, the entire uniting theme of “Armonia,” an agreeable platitude about harmony among nations, felt pointed in the presence of the isolationist Vance.)\n\n\tLike the games themselves, the ceremony was split between Milan’s San Siro Stadium and Alpine venues like Rasen-Antholz, with two separate cauldrons lit via Olympic flame at the evening’s end. The divided focus could sometimes be awkward; I pity the athletes who had to trudge through a snowy street instead of circumnavigating the stadium. But the ceremony did serve to highlight the breadth of Italian geography along with the breadth of Italian culture. The winter Olympics will likely never feel as major as their warm-weather siblings. They can still create grandeur and hometown pride in and of themselves.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Mystery Science Theater 3000” stars Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett know a thing or two about bad movies. \n\n\tWith the news that the show is being revived for four new episodes and the veteran “MST3K” trio are returning, fans have wondered which movies they might skewer. In an interview with Variety, Nelson, Murphy, and Corbett said that they are zeroing in on just the right choices.\n\n\n\t“[Our] eyes are on films that are more like the ones that we used to do — sort of corny, nothing too absolutely current,” Murphy told Variety. “Sort of classic bad, if that makes any sense, rather than modern bad.”\n\t\n\n\tGiven that their Kickstarter campaign for the new episodes blew past its funding goal in a matter of hours, the audience’s appetite for cheesy movies (and seeing these three riff on them) is as strong as ever. Corbett calls the excitement around their return to the show “great and vindicating and exciting and a little terrifying.” But as they are celebrating the 20th anniversary of RiffTrax — largely the spiritual successor to “MST3K” — the trio has certainly not been sitting idle.\n\n\tStill, this marks their first return to “MST3K” both in front of and behind the camera since the original show signed off the Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy) back in 1999. It is also the beginning of a new era of the show since it was officially announced just a few weeks ago that original creator Joel Hodgson had sold his interest in the series to Shout! Studios parent company Radial Entertainment. \n\n\tBut fans seemingly have little to worry about, as these three are as game as ever to try to keep their sanity with the help of their robot friends. \n\t\n\n\tCheck out the full Q&A below. \n\n\tThis interview was conducted on Feb. 4. It has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n\t\tThe Kickstarter campaign has raised over $1.3 million in just two days. How does it feel to see that kind of support right out of the gate? \t\n\n\tBill Corbett: It feels great and vindicating and exciting and a little terrifying. We have to justify that now, and I think we can. But, you know, it’s been a while. \n\n\tKevin Murphy: It’s really nice that even after all this time, people still have a fondness for the show, the way we did the show. And I think that’s what we’re seeing there. \n\t\n\t\tI looked this up and the budget of the Joe Don Baker film “Mitchell” was $1.16 million, so you did a “Mitchell” in one day. \t\n\n\tMurphy: Wow, we did a “Mitchell!”\n\n\tMichael J. Nelson: We’d have to look at the dollar amount in the calculator and see are we still ahead in today’s money.\n\t\n\t\tWell, no one is ever going to be ahead of Joe Don Baker. \t\n\n\tCorbett: I wouldn’t recommend it. He’d knock you right over.\n\t\n\t\tBut seriously, when did the conversations between RiffTrax and Shout! Studios to bring back “MST3K” start?  \t\n\n\tCorbett: That that was at least six months ago, but more, really, I think. Right, guys? Like maybe nine months ago, eight months ago?\n\n\tMurphy: Yeah, it was last year, I think in the spring, but in the meantime, Shout! Factory went through this merger, which sort of delayed things for a while…And they were in the middle of, as everyone learned, acquiring all the rights to the show from Joel.\n\n\tCorbett: I just want to make it clear, we are perfectly happy AARP guys. They asked us. And I think the thing that we came up with that sounds exciting also sounds risky too, like if we don’t recapture the magic, or if somebody gets a glimpse of me and goes, “Oh my god, what happened to him?!” Me specifically. But the thing that I think ameliorated it for us was we said, “Can we take a relatively small bite and do four?”\n\t\n\t\tKevin, you referenced doing the show the way you guys used to do it. What does that mean specifically? \t\n\n\tMurphy: Well, when I first heard that they might want to do this, I talked to our old DP, Jeff Stonehouse…And he said, “Oh, do it old school. We need to do this old school the way that we did it then.” He was such a wizard at doing in-camera effects. And then having all our props hand built, and not relying on any sort of digital compositing or green screen beyond what we need to do in order to make the shadow work and go through the doors, simple things like that…It really makes the thing that much more fun for us and for everyone involved, because it’s all hands on.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd you guys are celebrating the 20th anniversary of RiffTrax this year. What sorts of things have you learned in that time that you want to bring to these new episodes of “MST3K?” \t\n\n\tNelson: Well, I would speak for Kevin here. Kevin has learned nothing in 20 years.\n\n\tMurphy: Not a damn thing. Really, one thing I know that we’ve learned to do better is to is how to riff. We’ve learned to take our time, let the movie be the straight person, and set up the jokes for us better. So we have a lot of punch lines. And I know we’ve learned to feel like dead space is not what we think it is. People aren’t yearning for us to keep doing an endless stream of jokes.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s strange to me that outside of “MST3K” and RiffTrax, not too many people have tried to take riffing to the level you all have taken it to. Why do you think that is? \t\n\n\tNelson: I think one of the reasons for that…It’s that it’s really hard to to riff the way that we do. And it’s a writing that’s not very rewarding for the average person who just wants to be a writer…This is very technical writing. I happen to enjoy it. I think everyone that works with us enjoys it and loves that outcome of it, but it is really, really difficult. And I don’t mean to say that — we’re not nuclear sub runners here or anything — but I’m just saying it’s hard. And people often go like, “This sounds like fun!” Then they do it for two minutes and they go “Wow, this is really hard.”\n\n\tCorbett: There is almost an element of masochism in writing it. I mean, I think we’ve gotten over it because we’ve gotten good at it. It’s a weird thing to be good at, but we are absolutely the specialists in the world…We are not intimidated by many movies, although some we just feel like that’s not going to be fun, or that’s one we should just pass on. We have a pretty good nose for movies that are just not going to work. And that’s most of them, really.\n\n\tNelson: We always have some people complain. They’re like, “Hey, why would you do this movie? That’s a good movie!” We’re like, “Yeah, we’ve done a lot of good movies, movies that we like,” but the commentary then would match the thing. If you sit with a good friend of yours and you’re watching a movie that you like, and then he’s riffing on it, you’d say, “Hey, man, come on.” So that’s our intent. We also enjoy this movie, and therefore the comments match it, but we’re still being funny. So that’s a challenge that I actually love.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI know you guys are going to reveal the four movies you’ll be doing over the course of the Kickstarter campaign, but what can you share about them? Are you targeting older movies like “MST3K” typically did or more modern ones? \t\n\n\tMurphy: Well, I’d say since we know that we’re revisiting “Mystery Science Theater,” the way that we knew it and loved it, that our eyes are on films that are more like the ones that we used to do — sort of corny, nothing too absolutely current. Sort of classic bad, if that makes any sense, rather than modern bad…We’re casting the net to find just the right bad for us that fits with the puppets, rather than the three of us and our voices. And there is a little bit of a difference there. “Mystery Science Theater” was always more family friendly. RiffTrax tends to be a little bit…more out there these days.\n\n\tNelson: We hate families at RiffTrax.\n\t\n\t\tThen you announced that all four episodes will be released on RiffTrax later this year. Was there any discussion about partnering with a platform like Netflix like they did for the other revival seasons? \t\n\n\tMurphy: I think we always wanted to do it ourselves, because once someone like Netflix is involved, as good as they are what they do, you’ve got more people maybe wanting to tell you what to do with it, rather than just us. We’re responsible for the success or failure of this thing ourselves, and that feels right. And to have other people –as well meaning as it might be — sticking their fingers in the pie, it’s just not something that I think any of us would be comfortable with. We like finger free pies.\n\n\tCorbett: Get out of my pie! I will also add that…we have had RiffTrax stuff go out on other platforms and the way that they pay you changes depending on what mood they’re in. And it only goes in one direction. So, we don’t want to be at the mercy of that so much either.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthew Berry won’t be on the gridiron on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium, but he will notch a milestone for football when NBC Sports begins its five-hour Super Bowl pre-game show at 1 p.m. ET.\n\n\tBerry will be the first fantasy sports analyst and commentator to appear as part of a Super Bowl host network’s pre-game show. It’s sign of how institutionalized fan-driven fantasy sports ventures have become. \n\n\n\tFor a former TV writer who started out calculating sports stats by hand at age 14, being welcomed on to the set of an official Super Bowl pre-game show is something still Berry can’t quite believe is happening.\n\t\n\n\t“The fact that a guy like me is going to be on a Super Bowl pre-game show — it’s crazy,” Berry tells Variety.\n\n\n\tREAD MORE: NFL CMO Tim Ellis on Football’s Campaign to Bring in More Fans: ‘You Have to Be Willing to Not Please Everyone‘\n\n\tThose who partake in fantasy sports create their own team rosters based on the active player list for each of the NFL’s 32 teams. Then they track the performance of each player week by week as the NFL season unfolds, in competition with dozens if not thousands of other players to assemble the highest-performing roster based on each player’s performance stats. As such, what matters most is the touchdown, passes, rushing yards, et al put up by individual players rather than the win-loss record of each team.\n\n\tThe wagering aspect of fantasy sports that has become heightened in the era of legal online betting and prediction market services. But the core of the appeal of fantasy sports is the joy of tracking each week’s games and yakking about it with sports-crazy friends, Berry emphasizes.\n\t\n\n\t“What fantasy football has done is it’s brought people closer to the game. It’s given them interest in players and teams that they normally would not care about,” Berry says. “And it’s helped elevate every single game. Every game matters now.”\n\n\tAt a time when players are more accessible to fans than ever through social media, fantasy football offers a further boost as fans scour team rosters for high-performing players. Berry points to the trajectory of Michael Wilson, who is a wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals.\n\n\t“They were one of the worst teams in the NFL in [2025], and so he’s not somebody who is on the national radar of football fans,” Berry explains. “But every single person that plays fantasy football knows exactly who Michael Wilson is, because over the second half of the year this year, when Jacoby Brissett became the quarterback of the Cardinals and [Cardinals’ wide receiver] Marvin Harrison Jr. went down with injury. Michael Wilson became one of the best wide receivers in fantasy football, putting up just monster points week after week in losing efforts for Arizona. There are 25 players at any given time who are always household names that everyone knows, regardless of who your team is. Everyone knows who Aaron Rodgers is. Everyone knows who Patrick Mahomes is, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, etc. But fantasy football allows you to become fans of so many more players.”\n\n\tBerry got his start in the early 1990s in early internet chat rooms and sports-centric bulletin boards. Gradually, he gained more prominence and he rode the wave of interest in fantasy sports to an on-air gig at ESPN in 2007. He’s had tours at Fox Sports and other TV and digital outlets. At present, he works for NBC Sports, which has this year’s big game starting at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. The Super Bowl is typically the year’s most-watched TV program.\n\n\tBerry studied screenwriting at Syracuse University and then headed west. He wound up working on TV series including Fox’s “Married With Children,” CBS’ “Ink” and NBC’s “Conrad Bloom.” In 1999, Berry was recruited by the startup Rotoworld site to write a column about fantasy sports. That was his foot in the door in turning fantasy sports into his vocation and in building his media profile as an authority in the space.\n\t\n\n\tThe NFL cites the growth of fantasy sports as a big factor in bringing casual, younger and more diverse fans into the football tent. Berry feels it’s a great leveler, especially in business settings where employees put their own pools together. With social media platforms, it’s easier than ever for groups large and small to assemble their own leagues. What the game of bridge was to socializing in the 1950s, fantasy sports is in the modern era.\n\n\t“It’s a way for friends to get together, co-workers to get together, family, college roommates,” Berry says. “It’s the new poker game, it’s the new bachelor party, it’s the new golf game. It’s a way for people to interact socially. It’s a way for the CEO and the kid in the mail room to interact some way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” officially has its first rave reaction, courtesy of the director’s brother Jonathan Nolan. The “Westworld” co-creator and “Fallout” executive producer told CinemaBlend that his older brother’s upcoming epic is “spectacular” and “tremendous.” \n\n\t“I’m not working on ‘The Odyssey.’ I have seen ‘The Odyssey.’ It’s tremendous. It’s an incredible achievement,” Jonathan Nolan said. “I was fascinated by the ‘Iliad’ and ‘The Odyssey’ when I was younger, and I had some fun conversations with Chris about where he’s taking it. It’s a spectacular film… I’m not sure I’m supposed to say that but, yes, it’s tremendous.”\n\t\n\n\tJonathan and Christopher Nolan’s career are tied together as Christopher’s breakout 2000 feature “Memento” was based on Jonathan’s short story. The brothers would go on to co-write “The Prestige,” “The Dark Knight,” “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Interstellar” together. Jonathan also worked on the script for “Batman Begins” but went uncredited. \n\n\n\tMatt Damon reunites with Nolan after “Interstellar” and “Oppenheimer” to headline “The Odyssey” in the lead role of Odysseus. Tom Holland plays his son, Telemachus. The sprawling ensemble also includes Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong’o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron and Jon Bernthal.\n\n\tIn an interview on the “New Heights” podcast last month, Damon marveled over how Nolan achieved the feat of making “The Odyssey” the first Hollywood feature film to be entirely shot with Imax cameras.\n\n\t“Imax cameras are really loud. It sounds like a blender, like a Cuisinart in your face when the camera’s close to you. So there’s never been these dialogue [scenes in Imax],” Damon said. “We couldn’t have this conversation with a normal Imax camera because you wouldn’t be able to hear us. They built this giant thing around the Imax for those dialogue scenes and a system of mirrors so your eye line would be close to the camera and you could talk to the other actor. The amount of work that went into figuring out how to do [that], because he wanted to do 100 percent Imax and he did it!”\n\t\n\n\tNolan told Empire magazine last year that he was interested in adapting Homer’s Greek epic for the big screen as his next movie after Oscar winner “Oppenheimer” because it would give him the chance to do something that’s just not being done in contemporary Hollywood.\n\n\t“As a filmmaker, you’re looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven’t been done before,” Nolan told the publication about why he chose to turn Homer’s “Odyssey” into a movie. “And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with – Ray Harryhausen movies and other things – I’d never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, IMAX production could do.”\n\n\t“The Odyssey” opens in theaters July 17 from Universal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilmmaker Michał Marczak carves out a unique space for his documentary “Closure” within the non-fiction world. The film is set up as a moody mystery about a teenager who disappears one day and his father’s relentless search for him. Yet as it unfolds it cleverly becomes a drama that tries to answer the bigger life questions about family relationships and love. This might sound lofty, but it is actually what this potent humanist film accomplishes. With a standout central protagonist and an urgent quest that is every parent’s nightmare, the film plays like a thriller but manages to deliver honest and piercing emotions at almost every sequence along the way.  \n\t\n\n\t“Closure” starts off with a foreboding scene set along the Vistula river in Warsaw. A man throws a dummy off the bridge into the river, then the camera moves along the heavy currents of the brown water as the same man tries to find the body. This is Daniel, recreating a scenario in which his 16-year-old son Chris threw himself into the river. He’s searching for him and hoping that by recreating this jump, something he isn’t sure even happened, he can find answers. \n\n\n\tChris disappeared one early morning and CCTV footage showed him getting to the bridge. That’s where it ends. Did he jump, taking his own life? Or did he walk back away from the bridge? For months Daniel and his wife Agnieszka have been living in debilitating limbo, hoping that Chris is still alive and will appear back in their lives one day soon. At the same time, Daniel takes matters into his own hands and starts to search the river for his son’s body. While the case is being handled by the police and has been reported in the local media, leading many to join in the search, Daniel’s dogged pursuit becomes his passionate obsession, and he dedicates most of his time to it. \n\t\n\n\tIn Daniel, Marczak found an absolutely spellbinding protagonist. Like a Shakespearean grand character, he is haunted by ghosts of his past while pursuing an almost impossible endeavor in his present. He is always questioning himself, examining his memory for clues of what could have happened to make Chris leave and what he may have missed. Marczak, who shot the film himself, keeps the camera close to Daniel’s face so that the audience is privy to every flicker of emotion and every sign of hope. Marczak captures Daniel in silent despair with his wife Agnieszka, as the parents can’t bring themselves to accept that Chris may never return. Yet Agnieszka also wishes for an end, whatever it may be. In that liminal space, Marczak gives the audience a complete narrative of a family in turmoil and a man conflicted. His probing sensitive camera makes this story utterly palpable. As as the cycle of hope and despair keeps being repeated with hopeful clues that amount to nothing, the audience is engulfed along with the parents into their nightmare. \n\n\tPerhaps most perceptively captivating is the sweetly cunning way Marczak inserts himself into the film. He’s never seen on camera, but his voice is heard probing Daniel to open up and talk about how he is feeling. In these compassionate scenes, “Closure” takes flight and arrives at something resembling its title. Or as close to it as can be in the circumstances. Daniel tries to make sense of losing Chris, and in these conversations he opens up to Marczak, and by extension everyone watching, about what he’s learned and what it will mean for his life with Agnieszka and his other son, Patryk. He arrives at a poignant realization that maybe life is about people helping each other, like he failed to help Chris. Complementing this emotional catharsis is Marczak’s breathtaking cinematography. He plays with light and frame to express melancholy mood. The camera roves around as it follows Daniel in the river under the dense unforgiving water, on the road and into the surrounding forest as the search continues. \n\n\t“Closure” never pretends to be about solving the mystery of a son’s disappearance — instead, it considers the unbearable weight of not finding an answer. Marczak refuses easy answers or narrative release, and that restraint is precisely what makes the film so devastatingly honest. Yet somehow at the same time Daniel, his family and the audience arrive at a complete and moving narrative by the time the film ends. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAudiences will have to wait a little longer to familiarize themselves with “Clayface,” one of DC’s lesser known characters. The superhero film was originally slated to hit theaters on Sept. 11. It will now move to Oct. 23.\n\n\t“Clayface,” for those not steeped in all things Gotham, is a shapeshifting Batman villain. The genre has been described as a body horror, so think Cronenberg. It will be directed by James Watkins (“Speak No Evil”)  from a screenplay by Mike Flanagan (“Doctor Sleep”) and Hossein Amini (“Drive”). Up and comer Tom Rhys Harries stars as Matt Hagen, an actor whose face is disfigured, while Naomie Ackie will play the scientist he turns to for help. James Gunn and Peter Safran, the co-heads of DC Studios, will produce alongside “The Batman” director Matt Reeves and Lynn Harris. DC scored with last summer’s “Superman,” which critics and audiences saw as a return to form for the comic book studio after a string of disappointments like “The Flash” and “Black Adam” that predated Gunn and Safran’s arrival.\n\t\n\n\t“Clayface” was originally going to square off against a new adaptation of “Sense and Sensibility.” Now, the film will slide into the opening date vacated by another Warner Bros. release, “Remain,” which moved into 2027. Also premiering that weekend are an untitled Jordan Peele project from Universal, as well as the Rosamund Pike thriller “Wife and Dog.” \n\n\n\tWith “Clayface” moving, Warner Bros. has opted to shift its sequel to “Practical Magic” to Sept. 11. The witchy follow-up, directed by Susanne Bier, was originally slated to debut on Sept. 18. The film brings back original stars Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics kicked off on Friday with an unprecedentedly widespread opening ceremony that was certainly more somber that the Paris 2024 opener but still delivered a classy spectacle and projected an overall elegance that reflects its Italian spirit.\n\n\tHeld in the two host cities and in several Alpine venues, the event featured more than 1,000 performers — including Mariah Carey and Andrea Bocelli — who celebrated Italian history, culture and fashion.\n\t\n\n\tMilan’s San Siro 75,000-seat stadium was the main venue for the roughly three hour live Olympic opener. The ceremony took place amid tight security with thousands of Italian police officers, aided by surveillance drones and robots that patrolled the area around the stadium where dozens of heads of state, including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, watched the show.\n\n\n\tThe lead-up to the games had been marked by protests over the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who will not be in the streets but are instead there as security for Vance and Rubio, as well as a Russian cyberattack aimed at some Olympics-related websites and hotels. Tensions over the presence of ICE in Italy caused the official hospitality hangout space for the U.S. Olympic team in Milan to undergo a name change from The Ice House to The Winter House.\n\n\tVeteran Olympic ceremonies wizard Marco Balich, who produced the opener, built the multi-location show around the Greek concept of “harmony,” intended to bring together city and mountains, man and nature and the 2,900 athletes from cultures that share the Olympic space.\n\t\n\n\tBalich told Variety that, unlike previous Olympic openers such as the star-studded Paris 2024 opener, “This is the first time we’re going to have a somber ceremony.” Olympics organizers are focusing on deploying less glitz and more ecological sustainability, while still generating lots of excitement.\n\n\tWhich they did, in a more understated manner than the bombastic, and fun, Paris 2024 Olympics spectacle held on the River Seine.\n\n\tRead on for the biggest moments from this year’s Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\n\t\n\t\tWelcome to Italy\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t06 February 2026, Italy, Mailand: Olympia, Olympic Winter Games Milan Cortina 2026, opening ceremony in Milan, San Siro, dancers from the Accademia del Teatro alla Scala perform during the opening ceremony under the motto “Armonia”.

Canova’s 18th century statue depicting the myth of Cupid and Psyche was brought to life on stage, intending to become symbolic tale of attraction, transformation, and union, visually embodying the concept of  “Armonia,” or “Harmony” in English, that organizers say is inspired by the word’s original Greek meaning of a harmony as a dialogue between diverse elements. \n\n\tThe piece, in which the stadium was transformed into a living museum, featured 70 young dancers from Milan’s Accademia del Teatro alla Scala. This segment showcased reproductions of four iconic works by Antonio Canova: the Venus Italica, the Genius of Death, the Bust of Paris, and the Naiad.\n\t\n\t\tItalian Harmony: Fantasia\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMatilda De Angelis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian actress Matilda De Angelis (C) performs during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games at the San Siro stadium in Milan, northern Italy, on February 6, 2026. (Photo by Piero CRUCIATTI / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tItaly’s Matilda De Angelis, who made her international acting breakthrough in Susanne Bier’s “The Undoing” – alongside Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant – took to the stage as an orchestra conductor and launched into what is being called a Symphony of Fantasia celebrating Italian creativity. The music shifted between different registers: from a trumpet reminiscent of Nino Rota’s film scores for Federico Fellini movies to a stadium choir, then from an Antonio Vivaldi aria to the pop music of the late Raffaella Carrà, the iconic Italian singer, actor, and dancer who was a TV sensation across Europe and Latin America. \n\n\tThe musical medley culminated in an electronic remix of of Gioachino Rossini’s opera “La Gazza Ladra” and ended with the aria “Vincerò” from Giacomo Puccini’s “Turandot,” performed by the late great Luciano Pavarotti, in a recorded version.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGrand Parade/Mariah Carey Sings\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMariah Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUS singer Mariah Carey performs during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games at the San Siro stadium in Milan, northern Italy, on February 6, 2026. (Photo by WANG Zhao / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA grand parade of characters inspired by symbolic categories of Italian creativity through the ages culminated in Mariah Carey Carey, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colours on stage, performing entirely in Italian for the first time. Carey sang Domenico Modugno’s “Nel Blu, dipinto di Blu” – known internationally as “Volare.”\n\n\tWritten by Domenico Modugno and performed at the 1958 Sanremo Festival, “Volare,” with its famous refrain – “volare! oh, oh!” – marked a milestone in the history of Italian song, becoming a global phenomenon and winning two Grammy Awards, an unprecedented achievement for Italian music at the time. Carey’s “Volare” performance was conceived as a symbolic gesture, again underscoring the event’s “harmony” theme and the ambition to highlight local culture while giving the broadcast global appeal. \n\n\tCarey segued from “Volare” into her hit single “Nothing is Impossible” from the 2025 studio album “Here For It All.” She wore a an Art Deco-inspired gown featuring beads and crystals on the bodice, waist and skirt. And a diamond necklace, earrings and bracelet, valued at $15 million.\n\t\n\t\tPresidential Entrance, Followed By Giorgio Armani Tribute\t\n\n\tThe President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Kirsty Coventry, took their seats in the San Siro grandstand.\n\n\tTheir symbolic grand entrance was followed by a fashion show inspired by the Italian flag and based on one of Armani’s last drawings before he died at 91 last September.\n\n\tThree groups of models walked the runway wearing Armani creations in green, white, and red, transforming the Italian flag into a living image. It was a moment of collective recognition, a tribute to Italian fashion and the elegance of one of its most celebrated figures.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Models wearing creations designed by Giorgio Armani walk during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tArmani is also the official technical outfitter of Italy’s winter sports athletes.\n\n\tThe flag bearer chosen to embody Milan’s creative and contemporary spirit was supermodel Vittoria Ceretti who is currently romantically linked to Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\t\n\t\tLaura Pausini Sings Italy’s National Anthem\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLaura Pausini\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Laura Pausini performs the national anthem during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGlobal pop icon Laura Pausini, a multiple Grammy Awards winner, sang Italy’s national anthem which resounded simultaneously in both host cities, creating a shared moment between Milan and Cortina where a mountain choir amplified its emotional power.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOlympic Rings/Transition To Multiple Locations\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: The Olympic rings come together as a fireworks display is seen during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMilan joined Cortina in this unprecedented multi-location ceremony, with the Olympic circles multiplying in a dance number that embraced the city and the mountains, until they recomposed into the emblem of the Games, with music played by a Stradivarius violin as accompaniment. As the Olympic emblem appeared, the ceremony shifted into multi-location mode.\n\t\n\t\tFirst Widespread Parade of Athletes\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTOPSHOT – Iran’s flag bearers Danyal Saveh Shemshaki (R) and Samaneh Beyrami Baher parade during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games at the Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium in Predazzo (Val di Fiemme), on February 6, 2026. (Photo by Javier SORIANO / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tReflecting the fact that these are the most spread out Olympics in the games’ history, the athletes’ parade took place in the sites closest to where they will compete. Milan’s San Siro Olympic Stadium is hosting the athletes competing in ice sports. Livigno has the Livigno Snowboard Park. So athletes competing in Bormio and Livigno will compete in freestyle skiing, snowboard, and also men’s Alpine skiing. Predazzo has the ski jumping stadium. And Cortina will host athletes in ski jumping, cross-country skiing and Nordic combined, besides sliding sports and curling, among others.\n\n\tOrganizers are proud of pulling off the feat of transforming the geography of the Games into what they call a single, shared stage with TV coverage weaving it into a seamless narrative. There are more than 2900 athletes from 92 participating delegations, including four skiers from Iran. Benin, Guinea-Bissau, and the United Arab Emirates are participating for the first time.\n\n\tRussian skiers and lugers at the Games are not displaying a national identity with team colors, a flag or an anthem and were not part of the opening ceremony.\n\n\tThe last team to parade was host Italy. As soon as they began, the music switched to the rambunctious “Largo Al Factotum” number from Rossini’s “The Barber of Seville.” \n\t\n\t\tSabrina Impacciatore Dazzles With Time-Traveling Musical Number\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Sabrina Impacciatore performs a musical during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSabrina Impacciatore, known to U.S. audiences for roles in “The White Lotus” and “The Paper,” performed a time-traveling musical number celebrating 100 years of Winter Olympics history featuring a panoply of on-stage costumes, including a fabulous vintage ski outfit designed by Emilio Pucci for jet-setting Princess Soraya of Iran who wore it in Cortina where Italy’s first Winter games were held in 1956.\n\n\tThat year no artificial snow was used in Cortina. But in today’s global warming world there are plans for snow cannons to spew nearly 2.4 million cubic meters (3.1 million cubic yards) of fine-grained flakes. Organisers are vowing to use entirely renewable energy to power the cannons which should guarantee sufficient cover for the 116 Olympic medal events scheduled over 17 days.\n\t\n\n\tImpacciatore’s live stage performance featured scenes spanning from the 1920s to the 1990s, and into the present day, with a musical selection featuring jazz and swing music, and iconic Italian singer Adriano Celentano’s hit song “Prisencolinensinainciusol,” considered the first Italian rap song ever written. The song’s improvised text is an invented language that phonetically mimics English.\n\n\t“Prisencolinensinainciusol,” which is said by Celentano to stand for universal love, features in Spike Lee’s film “Highest 2 Lowest” recorded by Aiyana-Lee with the title “Prisencolin (Americano Joint).”\n\t\n\t\tItalian President Opens the Games – Bocelli Sings “Nessun Dorma”\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Andrea Boccelli performs during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom the presidential box, the President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, officially declared the Olympic Winter Games Milan Cortina 2026 open. Then a pair of torchbearers entered the stadium, kicking off a symbolic relay. The Olympic flame was first entrusted to a group of three Italian athletes and then the relay movement continued uninterrupted. The sequence was segued by Andrea Bocelli belting out Puccini’s aria “Nessun Dorma” culminating in the flame’s exit from San Siro, symbolically opening the path for the Games to kick off beyond the ceremony venue.\n\t\n\t\tCharlize Theron Delivers Message of Peace\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Charlize Theron, UN Peace Ambassador, delivers a speech inspired by Nelson Mandela during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscar-winning actor Charlize Theron addressed the opening ceremony as a U.N. Messenger of Peace, delivering a message of hope inspired by Nelson Mandela.\n\n\t“Peace is not just the absence of conflict. Peace is the creation of an environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste or any other social markers of difference,” Theron said. “Today, this message seems more relevant than ever. So let these games be more than just sport. Let them be a reminder of our common humanity, our respect for one another, and a resounding call for peace everywhere.”\n\n\tThe South African-born actor, known for her performances in “Monster,” “Bombshell” and “Mad Max: Fury Road,” spoke during the ceremony’s protocol segment focused on the Olympic Truce and symbols of peace. Her address concluded a section exploring peace symbols found across different cultures, religions and traditions, representing reconciliation, hope and the rejection of violence.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLang Lang and Cecilia Bartoli Light up San Siro\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Cecelia Bartoli performs a song with Lang Lang performing a piano piece during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter the Olympic flag was raised simultaneously in Milan and Cortina, mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli sang the Olympic anthem accompanied by Lang Lang, clad in white at a white grand piano, and the Teatro alla Scala Children’s Choir. Their performance was followed by the Olympic oath performed in Italian. The oath was first pronounced by Belgian athlete Victor Boin at the Games of the VII Olympiad Antwerp in 1920. The oath of the modern Games was originally written by Pierre de Coubertin, the French educator and historian who founded the International Olympic Committee but it has been modified over time.\n\t\n\t\tGrand Finale: Olympics Flame and Lighting of the Cauldrons\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinal torchbearer Italian skier Sofia Goggia (C) uses the torch of the Olympic flame to light the Olympic cauldron designed by Marco Balich during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Cortina d’Ampezzo, northern Italy, on February 6, 2026. (Photo by Stefano RELLANDINI / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn Milan and Cortina, for the first time in the history of the Winter Olympics, the flame was passed from hand to hand to reach two Olympic cauldrons, one for each host city. The one in Milan is at the Arco della Pace (Peace Arch) that is one of the city’s iconic monuments and represents the idea of peace achieved after conflict. The cauldron in Cortina is in the central Piazza Dibona. \n\n\tBoth cauldrons feature more than 1,400 parts and are modelled after the intricate knot design of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Nodi Vinciani.” Leonardo embedded these intricate knot patterns in several of his masterpieces, including the tapestry in the Last Supper and the decorative embroidery on the neckline of the Mona Lisa. The flame became transformed into Armonia, the ceremony’s overriding theme. Fireworks and a cascade of sparks from the Olympic rings followed.\n\n\tIn the U.S., the Games are getting full-court-press treatment from NBC and Peacock. In Europe, HBO Max is streaming the Olympic competition alongside local broadcasters.\n\n\tAs for American representation, the U.S. is fielding its largest Winter Olympics team ever, with 232 athletes including Lindsey Vonn, whose comeback attempt at age 41 is being threatened by the recent rupture of her left anterior cruciate ligament. We will known on Sunday if Vonn manages to compete.\n\n\tLet the Games begin!\n",

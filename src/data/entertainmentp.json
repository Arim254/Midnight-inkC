    "body": "\n\tThe upcoming Bitcoin biopic from director Doug Liman and producer Ryan Kavanaugh has disclosed in a U.K. casting notice that the indie film may use AI to “adjust” some performances. Actors will also perform on a “markerless performative capture stage and not in any locations, using new Al technologies.”\n\n\tThe casting notice states actors that the film’s producers reserve the right to “change, add to, take from, translate, reformat or reprocess” their performances using “generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and/or machine learning technologies,” including to adjust lip, facial and body movements. It confirms that AI won’t be used to create a “recognizable and identifiable digital replica” of an actor’s voice or likeness without “prior written consent.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a statement, producer Ryan Kavanaugh told Variety: “We were very cautious, sensitive and overly protective of our actors to make sure we only use performance capture AI which means that we will not have any AI-generated actors that do not exist. AI is a tool we’re using to make the filmmaking process more efficient while maintaining all department heads’ jobs, all actor jobs and hopefully helping to grow the industry in a positive way.”\n\n\n\tThe casting notice also states that any performers who agree to sign on to the film “acknowledge they may be sharing scenes with AI-generated performers.” However a source close to the film tells Variety references to AI actors in the casting notice were included in error and that no Tilly Norwood-style creations will be used for the movie.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s not accurate,” said the production source. “Every actor in this movie will be a [real] actor that is acting….You couldn’t get it to a spec you needed for a movie, creating a full AI actor.”\n\n\tThe source did confirm “Killing Satoshi” would be entirely creating the backgrounds and scenery in AI, with no shooting on location, and that AI would be used to tweak actors’ performances in place of re-shoots if necessary. “They won’t be made to say anything they didn’t say but let’s say the way they said it in conjunction with the movement doesn’t look perfect, you wouldn’t need to reshoot it. We’d just use AI to make it look better.”\n\n\tThe issues for actors raised by the disclosures in the “Killing Satoshi” casting notice go squarely to the heart of the compensation and consent debate that is winding its way through copyright claims in the federal courts and also via labor union contract negotiations, particularly in creative industries. SAG-AFTRA, which started film and TV contract negotiations with the major studios and streamers on Feb. 9, is wrestling deeply with where to draw the line on the reuse and repurposing of existing material. The issue of “synthetic” performances versus human labor is fueling SAG-AFTRA and other unions’ efforts to find contractual and legislative means of achieving name/image/likeness protections for actors at all levels in the industry.\n\n\t“Killing Satoshi” is about to go into production in the U.K. and the casting notice is looking for supporting actors who are available from the end of this month through March. As Variety exclusively revealed last year, Davidson and Affleck take top billing in the film about mysterious Bitcoin creator who launched the decentralized finance crypto currency revolution with a 2008 white paper under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The pursuit of the true identity of Nakamoto has become to the digital generation what the search for Deep Throat was to the Watergate generation. It’s been the subject of countless books, articles, documentaries and Reddit threads.\n\n\t“Killing Satoshi” is financed through Kavanaugh’s production company Proxima in conjunction with Aperture Media Partners. “Gran Torino” scribe Nick Schenk wrote the screenplay. Dixie Chassay is casting the project.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSinger Evan Dando, founder of the alternative-rock band the Lemonheads, was hospitailzed Thursday after sending a fan unwanted pornography, the latest in a long series of setbacks for the musician, who has struggled with mental illness and substance abuse for decades.\n\n\t“Evan Dando has long struggled with mental health issues dating back to his childhood,” a statement from his representative reads. “He’s been admitted to a local hospital where he’s receiving comprehensive help from experienced doctors and mental health professionals.”\n\t\n\n\tThe unidentified fan’s alleged account, which was posted in detail Thursday on the website the Underground Bunker, says the fan and Dando, 58, exchanged brief messages on Twitter years ago. She sent him a congratulatory DM last year after the release last October of Dando’s first Lemonheads album in 20 years, and he responded. A brief exchange followed, then a series of late-night DMs from Dando followed by a video of himself masturbating.\n\n\n\tDando is candid about his struggles in his 2025 memoir, “Rumors of My Demise,” which begins with an account of himself destitute amid decades of heroin addiction. “I was in horrible shape, losing teeth,” he wrote, “and living off cheeseburgers — which I could barely chew — Marlboro Reds, purple Powerade (two for the price of one at Cumberland Farms), and a $200 daily drug budget.”\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tPamela Anderson got a bit Method while filming “Rosebush Pruning.”\n\n\tThe family satire ensemble, from director Karim Aïnouz and premiering in competition at the Berlin Film Festival this weekend, follows an American family that has relocated to Spain. Following the mysterious death of their mother (Anderson), adult siblings Jack (Callum Turner), Ed (Jamie Bell), Anna (Riley Keough) and Robert (Lukas Gage) must look after their blind father (Tracy Letts). Things unravel when Jack announces he’s leaving to move in with his girlfriend (Elle Fanning).\n\t\n\n\t“An icon, the kindest, the most generous, amazing person,” Gage said of Anderson when I caught up with him on Saturday at the DGA Awards. “She’s had such an amazing career, but she’s just such a good person. She stayed in character the whole time giving me gifts as my mom. They weren’t part of the script. Just writing me notes and getting me little presents.”\n\n\n\tThe friendship continued after they wrapped. “She just sent me pickles for Christmas,” Gage said. “She has a pickles brand.”\n\n\tGage also remembered he first became aware of Anderson from her work on “Baywatch.” “She was an icon and a role model to many people in Southern California. Everyone wanted to be her.”\n\n\tHe joked about the incredibly good looking “Rosebush Pruning” cast, “They’re way hotter than me.”\n\n\tAs for rumors that Turner is in the running to be the next James Bond, Gage insisted he doesn’t know if he’s been cast. But, Gage said, “Look at him – he’s 6’5”. Sign him up.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLittle Spark Films is making an expansion into becoming a full genre studio based in Arlington, Texas, with plans to release original content, acquire new material for production and join outside productions as co-producers.\n\n\t“There are a lot of projects we’ve wanted to tackle for a long time now,” co-founder Joe Manco said in a statement. “This gives us the privilege to meet other filmmakers and help make their stories ignite. We’re looking forward to getting this fire roaring.”\n\t\n\n\tThe expansion was made possible thanks to a $1 million investment made by producer Chris C. Rushing.\n\n\n\t“I’ve been an observer and admirer of Little Sparks’ hard work in the space over the last few years after a mutual friend praised their on-set drive,” Rushing said in a statement. “So when the opportunity came up I knew it was the right one. On top of that, Joe’s ability to direct and run a set safely and efficiently has always earned my respect. It’s all about making great art and providing as many jobs as possible to people in the DFW area.”\n\n\tManco and fellow LSF co-founder Querida will serve as studio heads, with Manco as president and head of development and Querida as COO.\n\n\tFormer Dread Central editor-in-chief, director and film producer Mary Beth McAndrews has been named director of marketing and social media outreach. \n\n\t“Little Spark Films embodies everything I love about indie filmmaking, and I couldn’t be more excited to join the team to help bring these amazing projects to as many people as possible,” McAndrews said in a statement. “I am a lifelong genre fanatic, so being able to combine that with my professional experience is a dream come true. Joe and Catalina have created something special with LSF, and it’s truly a privilege to be a part of this team.”\n\t\n\n\tAdditionally, author Preston Fassel has been named CCO, creative director and head of development. Dallas attorney W. Glenn Crowell has been named in-house legal counsel, executive managing director and manager of the Little Spark Film Fund, which will allow the company to partner with outside productions.\n\n\tLittle Spark is currently in development of Manco’s original “punk rock horror” project “The Reckoners.” The company is in preproduction on two features to be shot in Texas this year: Cory Ahre’s action film “Bum Rush” and Cameron Hazelwood’s “Bridget Wrona,” a family mystery. Outside of Texas, LSF is also producing Bret K. Hall and James Henry Hall’s “A Ben Evans Film.” And the company is also planning to develop two of Fassel’s projects, including “The Bride in Blue” and “The Alley Man.”\n\n\tLSF launched in 2013 as a platform for music videos Manco and Querida were creating for their band at the time. The company then expanded into short films and other projects.\n\n\tThe pair also plans to create a culture of equity on their sets.\n\n\t“We’ve always prided ourselves on having an on-set culture that encourages freedom of speech,” Querida said in a statement. “We discovered early on that being honest, forward, and direct even in delicate situations is the best way to ensure that people are heard and feel safe. Filmmaking is already hectic, so people having to be on edge due to unfavorable characters on set is something that I don’t think is necessary.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Foo Fighters have released a whole batch of new music on their website — in miniature. The landing page for the band’s site contains 10 new riffs… which, for those hoping for actual new songs from the group, definitely counts as a start.\n\n\tNo context is offered for the music snippets, which last in length from five to 13 seconds, and only one of which includes a vocal. But it’s assumed these are kickoff moments for tunes that will constitute a new album, which would be their 12th, and first since 2023’s “But Here We Are.”\n\t\n\n\tThe instrumental snippets are accessed — in old-fashioned CD-ROM hover-and-click style — by clicking on band posters or photographs pictured as being taped or otherwise affixed to a wall in a bedroom with a guitar, stacks of CDs and some dirty clothes.\n\n\n\tOnly a few of the excerpts include vocals, and even then, it’s limited to mostly ooh-ing or howling — although one of the links does feature the sound of frontman Dave Grohl repeatedly singing the phrase “Turn the cameras off.”\n\n\tSimilarly, the band had posted a short melange of heavy riffing on its Instagram page four days ago with imagery that repeated the phrase “Here we go again.” The group’s latest IG post featured the same image seen on the home page along with one of the furious-sounding “na-na-na” snippets and the message, “Consider this an evaluation.”\n\n\t“Reminds me of the days of cryptic marketing,” remarked one fan on social media.\n\n\tThe Foo Fighters recently did their first show of 2026 in Australia, where Grohl said, “We might have a whole new record of fucking songs that we just finished the other day.”\n\t\n\n\tMuch more live activity is in the offing, with festival shows set to take place in May and a North American stadium tour that runs Aug. 4 through Sept. 26. It will be the group’s first tour with new drummer Ilan Rubin, from Nine Inch Nails.\n\n\tMeanwhile, former drummer Josh Freese has given an interview to Modern Drummer magazine in which he says he still has no concrete reason why he was sacked.\n\n\t“I think I have a pretty good read on people, and I did not see that coming,” Freese told the magazine. “One day it was nothing but laughs, we’re onstage, and Dave’s looking at me every night like, ‘You’re killing it dude.’ And then it was just over.” Freese noted that he harbors a “couple small theories” for being let go but “can’t really go into them right now.” He added, “I did really enjoy the two years I spent with those guys, however, and they were good to me until they weren’t…. I loved having Dave Grohl as a bandleader. I truly respect him so much as a drummer first and foremost. To me, he’s a drummer first and everything else is second. I’ve listened to him on all the great records he’s played drums on more than I’ve listened to any Foo Fighters stuff.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn many ways, R&B music is like reggae or other highly specialized genres of music that are ultimately more about feeling than technique, which is why novices and dilletantes fall so hard when they try and fail.\n\n\tThat’s also a reason why an album by an artist like Brent Faiyaz, hailed by many as a leading light for R&B, crushes so many of the other hopeful entries into the genre: The man is such a gifted singer and songwriter that he could probably sneeze and it would sound soulful.\n\t\n\n\tThe sound of “Icon,” his second and latest full-length (amid multiple EPs, a mixtape, singles and features with Drake, Alicia Keys, 21 Savage and more), is fully forward looking while acknowledging and building on the foundation of multiple influences and forebears. There’s the innovation of Prince, Lauryn Hill, D’Angelo and Frank Ocean (Faiyaz’s voice is sped-up or slowed-down in many places on this album) but also flashes of more mainstream precedents like Luther Vandross, Jodeci and Usher. \n\n\n\tThe arrangements are largely electronic, particularly the beats, but the most vivid instrument is his versatile, multi-tracked voice, which recalls the best work of Mary J. Blige, Beyonce and of course Prince in making one voice sound like many. His voice(s) take on the supporting melodic role ordinarily played by keyboards, guitars and horns, making for a sound that your ears know is different, but it’s done so skillfully that you don’t immediately realize why it’s different.  \n\n\tYet even when he’s not laying it on thick, his voice is a marvel, flipping into a loverman or yearning falsetto (especially on “World Is Yours”), Michael Jackson bite or Motown playfulness with ease.\n\t\n\n\tThe album is barely a half hour long — that’s including a two-minute orchestral intro track — but covers loads of territory. The mid-tempo, sultry R&B grooves of the aforementioned artists is the main course, but there are ballads, pop songs and even a semi-acoustic track.\n\n\tA key to the album’s soulfulness and consistency is executive producer Rafael Saadiq, who has added that refinement to albums and songs by D’Angelo, Solange, Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu and many others.\n\n\tAnd a key to Faiyaz’s slightly under-the-radar profile, even though he’s been releasing music for a dozen years, is the fact that he is a fully independent artist, releasing this album under ISO Supremacy, the label and creative agency he co-founded in 2023.\n\n\tAt 31 minutes, “Icon” is over much too soon — we kinda wish he’d gone full Summer Walker on it — but the album is so musically versatile and multifaceted that you can play it over and over without getting tired of it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMargot Robbie and Jacob Elordi are heating up the Valentine’s Day weekend box office with their new take on “Wuthering Heights,” an R-rated romantic drama directed by Emerald Fennell (“Saltburn,” “Promising Young Woman”).\n\n\t“Wuthering Heights” has made $3 million at the box office in Thursday previews. It’s expected to make between $50 million and $55 million over the extra-long President’s Day weekend. Internationally, it’s on track to add $30 million to $40 million, which is a strong start for the $80 million-budgeted Warner Bros. film.\n\t\n\n\tAfter producing “Promising Young Woman” and “Saltburn,” Robbie finally stars in one of Fennell’s movies as Catherine “Cathy” Earnshaw in this adaptation of Emily Brontë’s 1847 novel. The high-society Cathy falls for the lower-class Heathcliff, played by “Euphoria” and “Frankenstein” star Elordi, in this more erotic, steamy take on the classic tale. The cast also includes Hong Chau, Owen Cooper, Shazad Latif, Ewan Mitchell, Alison Oliver and Martin Clunes.\n\n\n\t“Wuthering Heights” will easily take the No. 1 spot after a particularly barren winter box office and beat its fellow newcomers this weekend. Sony Pictures Animation’s “Goat,” a family-friendly, talking-animal story about a basketball-playing goat, is on track for second place with $20 million to $25 million. It made $1 million in previews. The animated film stars Caleb McLaughlin, Gabrielle Union, Stephen Curry and features the voices of several other NBA and WNBA players.\n\n\tAlso opening this weekend is Amazon MGM’s heist thriller, “Crime 101,” starring Chris Hemsworth, Halle Berry, Mark Ruffalo and Barry Keoghan. It made $1 million in previews and is on track for third place with $15 million to $17 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChile continues to hold its own against major players from Latin America, far exceeding what its size (pop. 19.7 million) would suggest, with a presence on a par with Mexico and Brazil. This year, Chile weighs in with three films and three series – led by Prime Video’s ambitious 8-episode family saga “The House of the Spirits”–  at the Berlin Film Festival, along with various projects at the EFM.\n\n\t“We believe this is the most significant — or the largest — Chilean presence we’ve ever had. Of course, there have been previous occasions. For example, when ‘Gloria’ was presented and we received a major award, and with other films as well,” says Diego Rougier, the new president of the Chilean Film & TV Producers Association, APCT.\n\t\n\n\tLeading the troika of films is Netflix’s “A Child of My Own” by two-time Oscar nominee Maite Alberdi (“The Mole Agent” and “The Eternal Memory”) who shot her docu-fiction hybrid in Mexico. Speaking of her experience, she tells Variety: “It was wonderful because it’s a huge industry and the idiosyncrasies are somewhat similar to Chile’s.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAna Celeste Montalvo as Alejandra in “A Child of My Own” Courtesy of Netflix / Netflix ©2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix / 2026\n\t\n\n\n\n\tParticipating in the Berlinale Perspectives sidebar is “Red Hangar” (“Hangar Rojo”), the fiction feature debut of documentarian Juan Pablo Sallato. As a co-production involving Chile’s Villano Prods., Argentina’s Brava Cine and HD Argentina as well as Rain Dogs, Berta Films and Caravan from Italy, it’s a testament to Chile’s savvy co-production capabilities.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Red Hangar,” Courtesy of Villano Prods.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGiven the size of the country’s market, Chile has been co-producing for years. Rougier notes: “I believe we’ve reached a level of maturity in how we carry projects through. We’ve demonstrated seriousness, responsibility and talent — and that has opened the door to trust. I think co-producing is fundamentally about trust. As you attend markets, you meet producers, begin developing projects together, and relationships grow over time. Trust becomes the driving force behind these productions. And I believe Chile has shown that it is a serious and reliable partner in co-productions.”\n\n\tThe third pic, recent college graduate Diego Fuentes’ “Matapanki,” also a feature debut, was funded through a mix of university funds and various crowdfunding platforms and events that matched the film’s punk spirit, such as live shows and self-managed activities, says producer Tomas Santelices.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Matapanki” Courtesy of Minerva Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDescribing their creative process, he says: “We shot on a Canon C300, designing a workflow that let us ‘dirty’ the digital image while applying our VFX. We aimed for a grainy black-and-white look, like a photocopy, refined through meticulous, hands-on rotoscoping to achieve the film’s intended aesthetic.”\n\n\t“Because our market is very small, we rely on a lot of ingenuity and creativity in order to keep producing,” Rougier comments, adding: “The truth is that we’re constantly searching, and we’re all pushing for more and better tax incentives, like what other countries have. We’re always striving to achieve better conditions and, in the meantime, we depend on a great deal of creativity and productivity.”\n\n\tChile’s best tool for co-productions is the IFI Audiovisual program, he says, which is ideal for productions with large foreign investments in Chile. “It’s a kind of cash rebate – not a direct cash rebate, but it works on a similar mechanism. The key point is that all production expenses can qualify for the rebate when foreign money is involved,” he explains. Location shoots in the metropolitan region or in the capital can apply for a 30% reimbursement for local expenses and 40% for location shoots in the rest of the country.\n\n\tAfter a few false starts, the country finally launched a film commission in December, now led by coordinator Yerko Martinez Carrere. “Chile’s experience with co-productions, combined with its incredible locations – from deserts to snow, the sea, forests, the Araucanía and Patagonia regions –and its highly skilled technical crews, makes it ideal for large productions. It’s a great moment to launch a Film Commission and attract not only local projects but also international productions to shoot here,” Rougier notes.\n\t\n\n\t“We have a strong industry, but it’s not enough. We need to keep growing to stay competitive and earn the recognition Chilean audiovisual work deserves. Step by step, the productions we’re making speak for themselves and pave the way for what comes next.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you work in entertainment, you’ve definitely seen a Funko Pop figure. The modern, more sophisticated versions of bobble-head toys are among the first consumer products that an IP secures a deal for if it wants to engage a proper fandom. From Star Wars to “KPop Demon Hunters” to European football teams, if you’re a brand that desires to be an obsession, you’ve got a Funko.\n\n\tWhether or not consumers have the means to buy all those Funkos is a valid question.\n\t\n\n\tAs New York Toy Fair kicks off Saturday, Funko’s new CEO Josh Simon is ready to discuss his strategy for the iconic collectibles brand just half a year into the job. Formerly vice president of Netflix’s consumer products division, where he oversaw the ever-expanding lines of merch for “Stranger Things,” “Bridgerton” and more titles, Simon is aware of the uphill battle Funko faces in an uncertain economy where people have less spending money. But he’s confident in the company’s ability to right size, noting Funko has more than 900 active licenses and has sold more than 1 billion Funko Pop figurines since being founded nearly 30 years ago.\n\n\n\tIn behind-closed-doors meetings with big retail brands and media partners at New York Toy Fair this weekend, Simon will be showcasing Funko’s 2026 lineup, including looks at its Pop figures for upcoming titles including “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” Netflix’s “One Piece” Season 2, “Toy Story 5,” the live-action “Moana,” DC universe titles, Greta Gerwig’s “The Chronicles of Narnia,” “Minions 3” and the new “Spider-Man” and “Avengers” franchise films.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Stranger Things 5” Funko Pop figures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd if you think consumers don’t have the money — or the space — to sustainably be repeat Funko customers, Simon would debate you on that.\n\t\n\n\t“There’s a couple dimensions to that,” Simon said during this week’s episode of Variety‘s “Strictly Business” podcast. “Right now we’re really at the center of a kind of amazing evolution in consumer trends when it comes to the toy industry. Currently, about one in six toys that are sold fall into the collectibles category, and that’s grown by almost 30% last year. So it’s a high growth category. The other thing I’d say is on the license piece of that category — licensed IP versus original license — is outperforming all the other categories of toys by close to 10 or 20 percentage points. And then I would say the third corner of that triangle is this craze in what everyone is calling ‘kidult’ now: adults who are buying toys.”\n\n\tListen to the full podcast:\n\n\tAccording to Simon, in 2025, nearly 40% of adults bought toys for themselves. \n\n\t“And if you break it down into further cohorts, about 65% or so of 18-34 year olds bought a toy for themselves or for another adult last year,” Simon continued. “As a category, it’s growing. That’s why I would debate you on how much free space you have in your apartment. Because I think, ultimately, people are finding space for these things. And I think as the world continues to become more digital and online and on social media, I think the counter to that is there’s almost more value for something that’s physical and tangible and that you can hold and that you can gift. And when you look at the proliferation of content, and how quickly you can swipe through something on TikTok or Instagram, capturing that moment in a physical way, I think, becomes increasingly important to consumers. It’s a pretty big world out there, and I think that the trend of physical ownership and capturing those moments in physical form is only going to continue.”\n\n\t“Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tAs a young executive at New Line Cinema and recent Los Angeles arrival from the U.K., Donna Langley recalls becoming a BAFTA member for the first time and attending numerous special screenings put on by the British Academy. One of these was for Ang Lee’s 2000 hit “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.”\n\n\t“And the projector broke,” she says. “But it was really fun, because I got to stick around. I was very young in my career and I just got to talk to a lot of people, and it was, to me, very representative of the community. And of course there were lots of Brits in the room. It was a nice moment.”\n\t\n\n\tMore than 25 years on and Langley — now chair of NBCUniversal Entertainment and one of the most powerful and respected execs in the industry — is probably attending fewer BAFTA screenings. But she is about to be celebrated on stage by the British Academy when she receive its highest honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, at the BAFTA film awards ceremony on Feb. 22.\n\n\n\t“I’m incredibly honored, and really chuffed,” she tells Variety, adding that she was told by BAFTA some time ago and the news has been a “fun one to keep secret” until the announcement was made earlier this week.\n\n\tLangley — who was made a dame by the late Queen Elizabeth in 2020 — also makes history with Fellowship. While it’s largely reserved for top-tier actors, directors and occasionally producers, she becomes the first Hollywood studio boss to receive the honor.\n\n\t“It just adds to the gravitas of it,” she says, while adding that other execs, including Kathleen Kennedy, have been awarded the honor previously. “It is nice to be able represent the executive branch, if you will, of the industry, and accept this on behalf of that part of my community.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a community of execs that could, however, be shrinking at least if Netflix’s industry-shaking acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery goes ahead.\n\n\tWatching the back and forth play out as Paramount continues its efforts to win over WBD shareholders, Langley notes that there are “twists and turns that have already happened, and I assume there will continue to be twists and turns.”\n\n\tAnd while the future of another major studio hangs in the balance, Langley underscores what NBCUniversal offers in the meantime.\n\n\t“We have stability, we have longevity and we have got plenty to be getting along with and not get distracted by the industry noise around this, and quite honestly, provide a place for people to come and work that is stable, that is making plenty of movies every year and releasing them in movie theaters, and doing the same on the television side and streaming side,” she says. “So we’ve got enough to be getting along with and not to get distracted by what’s happening across the street.”\n\n\tPlenty to be getting along is an understatement, not least in a year where, on the movie side alone, NBCUniversal is releasing massive, potentially billion-dollar smashing tentpoles in “The Super Mario Galaxy Film,” Minions 3” and Christopher Nolan’s next major piece of event cinema, “The Odyssey,” the $250 million all-star retelling of Homer’s ancient Greek poem.\n\n\tLangley won’t reveal much about what she’s seen of “The Odyssey” beyond the recently released trailer other than to say it’s “looking like a wonderful Christopher Nolan movie.” But she does offer that the director — who she first brought to NBCUniversal for the box office and Oscar winning smash “Oppenheimer” — only presented her with the screenplay for “The Odyssey” in early 2025, before going almost immediately into the shoot.\n\n\t“He went into full prep on the film and then into production in a fairly short period of time,” she says. “That’s the way he likes to work. He likes efficiency and he likes to get on with it.”\n\n\tAn expensive swords-and-sandals epic doesn’t necessarily translate into a slam dunk at the box office, as the modest performance of “Gladiator II” underlines. But Langley is unsurprisingly confident about the bet she’s taken.\n\t\n\n\t“The thing that Christopher Nolan represents is pure cinema. And I think what we’re seeing with audiences, and we certainly saw how they showed up for ‘Oppenheimer,’ is that there’s an audience that wants to show up for a Christopher Nolan movie and there’s an audience that wants to show up for pure cinema,” she says. “And I believe that audience is growing and it’s getting younger, and there’s an audience that wants to see big entertainment on the best screens in the world.”\n\n\tWith this is mind, plus Nolan’s expertise and the A-list cast he assembled, Langley asserts that giving “The Odyssey” the greenlight was a decision she didn’t take long to mull over.\n\n\t“While any big movie, any big swing, is a ‘risk’, this one was not a difficult yes.”\n\n\tThe risk already appears to have paid off, at least in terms of pre-sales, with NBCUniversal releasing tickets to select Imax 7mm screenings exactly a year in advance of its July 16. release. Many sold out in minutes.\n\n\t“It was a gamble on the one hand, but one the other hand we know that there is a rabid, dedicated audience for seeing Christopher Nolan’s films in that kind of format,” she notes. “And we knew that to be able to mark your calendar a year in advance and know that you’re one of the lucky ones with that golden ticket would be exciting to enough. But having said that, we were absolutely thrilled with those results. It was a tactic, if you will, that paid off.”\n\n\tWould Langley give this special treatment to any other films? “Maybe! We know it when we see it.”\n\n\tWhile “The Odyssey” prepares to set sail into cinemas this summer, another major title is just about to start revving its engines. After several false starts in terms of its release, the next “Fast & Furious” movie has now been officially dated for March 17. 2028 — a five-year wait from the previous installment — and given the title of “Fast Forever.”\n\n\tThe latest news was announced on social media in typical fashion by Vin Diesel, but aside from his involvement in the film, who else will return — The Rock? Gal Gadot? — is merely speculation at present. Sadly Langley won’t provide more clues.\n\n\t“We’re keeping it under wraps! Follow Vin Diesel — if there’s breaking news he’ll be the one to do it.”But Langley did confirm that efforts would be made to shoot at least parts of “Fast Forever” in Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\t“The franchise started in LA. It really has its roots, firmly planted in LA car culture, and in some ways, this movie is absolutely a tribute to that culture and a tribute to Los Angeles,” she says. “Some of the story, not all of it, does take place in Los Angeles. We’re just in the process of getting a production plan together, but it is absolutely our hope that we can bring some of the production back to Los Angeles and California. I think we as an industry are very focused in revitalizing the industry here as much as we can.”\n\n\tA franchise planted far away from Los Angeles (and actually shot in the U.K.) that has already done gangbusters at the box office is “Wicked.” Another potentially risky big swing, the two-part adaptation of the hit musical now has a combined box office in excess of $1.24 billion (off a budget of around $300 million). While it was only ever supposed to be two movies, given the huge win “Wicked” has proved for NBCUniversal, Langley confirms there are aspirations to continue the adventures in Oz.\n\n\t“It’s very early days on ‘Wicked,’ but we are hopeful that after the amazing success that we’ve seen with the two movies there are other ways that we could branch out with the world-building,” she says. ‘And of course, we do that with our rights holders and in conjunction with them, so when they’re ready.”\n\n\tNBCUniversal broke Disney’s 8-year reign at the top of the box office in 2023, thanks largely to the success of “Oppenheimer” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” Given that this summer sees the release of Nolan’s next film and the Mario Bros. sequel, plus “Minions 3” (the previous film earned $940 million in 2022), there are hopes it may be able to take back the crown from the Mouse House again.\n\n\t“I hope so — we feel really good about our year,” says Langley. “These are big franchises and a big, epic original movie with ‘The Odyssey’ and other things besides it. I don’t know, but I’m excited. But then our competitors have good years as well. And you know, there’s, there’s good films coming from everyone. So I’m excited to see how hopefully the box office can just start — and I feel like we have been talking about it since 2023 — some rebounding with really good cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tAs for the non-Universal films Langley herself has been enjoying recently, she says she “loves ‘Sinners’ — I’m a big fan of Ryan Coogler” and also “Marty Supreme.” “I know it’s a polarizing choice, but I absolutely loved it,” she says adding that it was also loved by her husband and two teenage boys. “It’s so rare that we can all go and find a movie that we can all enjoy.”\n\n\t“Sentimental Value,” she says is “wonderful film,” while she’s also delighted for her “old friend” Paul Thomas Anderson and the success of “One Battle After Another.” “I’m really happy to see him getting the attention that he so deserves.” Outside of the awards films, Langley says she also was a fan of “Weapons.”\n\n\tBut her “absolute favourite” film of the year? Perhaps predictably (because it comes from Universal’s Focus Features), it’s “Hamnet.”\n",

The homeowner who posted the vid says the would-be intruder fled when their dogs started barking.\n      \n\n          A high-ranking law enforcement source, connected to the investigation, tells TMZ ... the FBI and Pima Co. Sheriff's Dept. are aware of this video, and they're treating it as a potential lead.\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          The dark-haired individual does have facial hair that seems similar to the person seen in the FBI-released images captured by Nancy's doorbell camera.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Although that person was wearing a knitted ski mask, you can still see a goatee or beard underneath the material.\n      \n    \n          As we reported, the cops are asking residents within a 2-mile radius of Nancy's home to check security cameras for anything suspicious during the entire month of January ... as you know, Nancy was reported missing on February 1. This particular video is making the rounds on social media, so citizens are answering the call.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          We're told this is one of hundreds of leads cops are chasing down, as they've been flooded with video and tips.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Savannah Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie Case\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

We’ll see what happens!!!”\n      \n\n          Retirement chatter has followed the All-Pro tight end throughout the offseason ... with Kelce himself admitting he’s thinking about how much longer his body -- and mind -- want to handle the grind of NFL life.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Still, he’s also made it clear his love for football hasn’t disappeared ... saying last month on his \"New Heights\" podcast, \"If my body can heal up, rest up and I can feel confident that I can go out there and give it another 18, 20-21 week run, I think I would do it in a heartbeat.\"\n      \n    \n          Kelce built a Hall of Fame résumé (he's a first ballot lock) over 13 seasons, helping lead the Chiefs to three championships ... but faces a crossroad as he balances the physical toll of the game with a booming life off the field alongside fiancée Taylor Swift.\n      \n    \n          Inside the Kelce family, there’s no pressure campaign pushing him toward one choice or the other. Donna made it clear her role is simple: support whatever decision Trav makes.\n      \n    \n          Whatever he decides, Kelce’s place in NFL history is already cemented -- the only question is whether he’s ready to close the book or add another chapter.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donna Kelce\n              \n                          \n                Travis Kelce\n              \n                          \n                Taylor Swift\n              \n                          \n                Family\n              \n                          \n                Kansas City Chiefs\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                In The Field\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "description": "\n\tAfter a few marathon days of telephone and video calls, emails and text message chains, the $82.7 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. ",
    "body": "\n\tAfter a few marathon days of telephone and video calls, emails and text message chains, the $82.7 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and HBO Max was clinched Thursday night around 10 p.m. ET.\n\n\tBut there was no chance for high fives or a group huddle among the managers of the freshly betrothed media giants. In modern fashion, the sale negotiations were mostly conducted at arm’s length via phone and electronic communications, with Netflix and WBD executives and legal teams spread across New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and other locales.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the final hurdles to securing the initial agreement was WBD’s insistence that Netflix commit to a record-setting $5.8 billion breakup fee should the deal run into resistance, regulatory or otherwise. \n\n\n\tOpposition to the deal assembled, swiftly and fiercely, from unions, consumer watchdogs and politicos on both sides of the aisle. “This merger must be blocked,” the Writers Guild of America urged on Friday. \n\n\tIn the end, about six weeks after Paramount CEO David Ellison’s pushy overtures put the studio in play, the Warner Bros. Discovery board got what it wanted – a pedigreed, market-leading buyer with firm financial foundation and a clear strategic need to make the most of Warner Bros. and HBO.\n\n\tOn the surface, the Netflix deal would seem an echo of the AOL-Time Warner transaction completed in January 2001. A highflying beacon of what was then called “new media” buys a legacy entertainment company with brands that seem to be ripe for exploitation in new ways.\n\n\tThe AOL takeover of Time Warner, of course, was nothing less than disastrous. The grand thesis of the merger unraveled in barely a year’s time after the dot-com bust and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This time around, the Netflix acquisition signals the (near) conquest of Southern California’s most dynamic industry by one of the world-beating tech giants that sprang from Northern California.\n\t\n\n\tThe WBD board leaned toward the Netflix bid because the company has such a strong balance sheet. Its stock has been one of the most consistent and durable performers over a turbulent decade for media and entertainment. Unlike AOL in 2001, when its growth was powered by offering basic dial-up internet access, Netflix has a strong underlying business model that can’t easily be outmoded by new tech or undercut on price by rivals. TV shows and movies are, after all, very sticky – ask any “Bridgerton” or “Strangers Things” fan.\n\n\tNetflix’s long-horizon outlook stands in contrast to Paramount Skydance, which began its pursuit of WBD shortly after Skydance Media sealed its $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Communications. It’s a sign of the times that the parent company of Paramount Pictures and CBS – two entertainment institutions that have been around for more than 100 years – are a bigger risk than a much younger venture that has been in the original programming game for about a dozen years. \n\n\tParamount Skydance faces an uphill climb in turning around the fortunes of its studio and legacy cable networks and restoring strong free cash flow. The company is also carrying more debt on its balance sheet than Netflix, proportionate to its earnings power. All of these factors were a consideration for the WBD board. In the case of a black-swan event for the macro economy, how would Paramount fare? \n\n\tThe lack of certainty there helped sway WBD board members that Netflix was the better fit and safer option for shareholders than Paramount or even Comcast, which was the third contender for the studio in the whirlwind bidding process that began in earnest in early November. The process quickly crystallized into a test of wills between two Davids – Ellison and WBD CEO David Zaslav. There’s been endless industry chatter that Zaslav was angling for a deal that left him with a high executive perch in the resulting company. Ellison slammed the WBD leader in a legal letter sent to Zaslav on Thursday accusing him of having “abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process” in order to steer the deal to Netflix.\n\n\tWBD board members were already put off by Paramount’s unsolicited offer and the whispers around Hollywood and D.C. that only Ellison and his familial connections to the Trump White House would be able to secure regulatory approval for such a big merger.\n\t\n\n\tBut Donald Trump is famous for working his phone, and Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is definitely in his contacts. President Trump respects Netflix’s rags-to-riches growth as a modern American business success story. And while Trump often expresses hostility to Hollywood as a bastion of touchy-feely liberalism, the reality is that he has long been fascinated by the industry, especially after he became a TV star via NBC’s “The Apprentice.”\n\n\tSources close to the situation emphasize that even in Hollywood, ego takes a back seat to business rationale when the enterprise value tops $82 billion.\n\n\tNetflix and WBD leaders including Zaslav are preparing to make a strenuous case for the consumer benefits of the deal as well as the positive impact that the enlarged company will have on the creative community.\n\n\tZaslav, Sarandos and Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters are bracing for a long fight. The leaders are projecting a closing timeline of as much as 18 months given the scrutiny on the companies and the political crosscurrents. \n\n\tThere are points to be gained for elected officials on the left and right by railing against another big media merger. That could make for a long drawn-out battle in Washington with the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department. The FCC is not expected to play much if any role in this review because of the nature of assets involved – WBD does not own broadcast TV stations (a la Paramount) or cable systems (a la Comcast).\n\n\tSources said the Netflix and WBD teams are confident that on the antitrust merits it’s hard to prove the enlarged company would have anything close to monopoly power over the content marketplace –particularly at a time when Netflix, HBO and others have for-real competition for the hearts and minds of younger viewers from likes of YouTube and TikTok.\n\n\tIn their first presentations about the deal on Friday, Netflix and WBD emphasized how little overlap there is between the companies. Netflix has stated its intention to maintain HBO Max and Warner Bros. studio operations as standalone businesses under the Netflix tent. Anyone who has experienced a Hollywood merger in recent decades knows that no matter what is said in the moment, the long-term arc of any business leans toward streamlining, efficiencies and eliminating redundancies. Consolidation will eventually affect some on the list of accomplished senior executives who are spread among Netflix, Warner Bros. and HBO.\n\t\n\n\tFor the most senior executive at WBD, however, the future does seem to be coming into focus. Sarandos and Peters are firmly installed as Netflix co-CEOs. Zaslav has been telling friends and colleagues that he’s focused on helping to get the merger to the finish line and to deliver a healthy Warner Bros. and HBO Max to Sarandos when it’s time to hand over the keys.\n\n\tIf the deal goes through as it was outlined to investors today, Zaslav will eventually lose his CEO perch but he’ll gain many, many millions (as will a host of senior WB and HBO executives through stock options), as well as the satisfaction of having gone out on his own terms.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was a hectic time in Elkan’s life, and the Sierra Leone-born producer’s phone was constantly buzzing. Taking refuge from the barrage of calls, he began singing repeatedly in the shower: “Who’s calling my phone?” \n\n\tHe recorded the hook, which eventually became the centerpiece of Drake’s “Nokia,” one of the biggest rap songs of the year. “It turns the pain into praise,” Elkan says, calling the track a “miracle record” that “brings the fun back to the party and makes people forget about the nonsense in their lives.” What started as a plea to be left alone turned into a joyful anthem about hitting the dance floor and ringing your friends to find the action. \n\t\n\n\t“Nokia” opens with that cooing hook — “Who’s calling my phone?” — before sliding into a bouncy retro beat that Drake skates over: “Where the fuck the function?” Trickling in the background are marimba-like melodies reminiscent of a mid-2000s ringtone, coupled with R&B vocals and futuristic synths. \n\n\n\t“When I’m making music, I’m always thinking, ‘What does 2050 sound like? What are my grandkids going to dance to?’” Elkan says. \n\n\tHe started making the beat for “Nokia” in his sister’s spare bedroom, sitting on the floor and playing with a MIDI keyboard. He was drawn to the catchy melodies of childhood. “I love lullabies. When I started making music, I would babysit my stepsister, and I always had Cocomelon on,” he says, referring to the kids’ sing-along channel. “Those melodies permeate my brain, and it’s something that I put into my music.” He also mentions the Eurodance sensation Crazy Frog as an inspiration: “It’s annoying, but it’s memorable.” ‘\n\t\n\n\tEventually, Elkan sent the beat to Drake and was “euphoric” when he first heard the rapper’s verses. “This was something I’d been working on for years,” he says. “To hear the record was thrilling.” \n\n\tAs for advice for other artists, Elkan says high-quality equipment isn’t essential to making high-quality art. “A lot of producers and musicians are all about the gear,” he says. “Honestly, you don’t need any of that. It’s all about you as a human.” \n\n\tAnd in another memorable if annoying turn, the producer can barely ring up a friend these days without hearing his infectious catchphrase on the other line: “Who’s calling my phone?”\n\n\tSongwriters: Drake, Elkan \n\n\tProducer: Elkan \n\n\tLabels: OVO Sound, Santa Anna Records & Republic Records \n\n\tHitmakers: \n\n\tElkan, co-writer and producer \n\n\tTheo Skudra, video director \n\n\tKelly Jeffrey, cinematographer \n\n\tMr. Morgan, president, OVO\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Timeless,” the brooding trap collaboration between the Weeknd and Playboi Carti, made its live debut before it was actually completed. According to XO co-founder Amir “Cash” Esmailian, it was backstage at the Weeknd’s “One Night Only” concert in São Paulo that the Canadian artist, aka Abel Tesfaye, said, “Let’s perform the song we worked on today.” \n\n\tIt was a high-profile debut, witnessed by thousands in the stadium and on the livestream. “We knew we had to capitalize,” says Republic’s Marleny Reyes. Afterward, the internet was ablaze with anticipation for a studio version. “For us, it’s always about following Abel’s lead and augmenting his vision,” she says. “Nobody is better at organically building buzz than he is.” \n\t\n\n\tWhile its arrival was near instantaneous, “Timeless” had been gestating for months. “I got the rough track early on, before Abel even laid down vocals,” says producer Mike Dean. “Backstage in São Paulo, the vibe was right.” So Dean dusted off the file and added “piano chords, lead lines and some layers” to piece it all together. \n\n\n\tThere’s even a clip that captures the moment when Dean learned that he was flipping a beat from a fellow production legend. “You can see me in the video asking Carti who started it,” he says. “That’s when I found out it was Pharrell.” \n\n\tThe track’s hypnotic atmosphere was heightened by Ojivolta and Twisco. “Abel is one of our favorite artists,” Oji (aka Mark Williams) says. The goal, according to Volta (Raul Cubina), was to create “a song that resonated with the world but had an atypical structure.” Twisco, for his part, used “analog sources like SOMA’s Lyra-08 in juxtaposition with granular resynthesis” to build out the soundscape. \n\t\n\n\tFor Dean, the song exemplifies their many years of collaboration. “We don’t really have to talk much anymore,” he says. “It’s pure flow.” Then it was up to Republic and XO to nurture their creation. “The song has continued to thrive for well over a year,” Reyes says. “We’re always looking beyond the first day, week and month.”\n\n\tSongwriters: Abel Tesfaye, Jordan Terrell Carter, Pharrell Williams, Mark Williams, Raul Cubina, Tariq “BL$$D” Sharrieff, Kobe “BbyKobe” Hood, Devon Chisolm (Lawson), Jarrod “Twisco” Morgan, Mike Dean \n\n\tProducers: Mike Dean, Ojivolta, Twisco, Pharrell Williams \n\n\tHitmakers:\n\n\tMike Dean, producer \n\n\tOjivolta, production duo \n\n\tPharrell Williams, producer \n\n\tAmir “Cash” Esmailian, manager, XO\n\n\tMarleny Reyes, general manager, Republic\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran documentary filmmaker Ondi Timoner and her wife, Morgan Doctor, were working on a film in Budapest when they got a phone call informing them their home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Altadena had burned to the ground in the Eaton Fire. It was Jan. 7, 2025.\n\n\tTimoner, known for docus like “DIG!,” “We Live in Public,” “Last Flight Home” and most recently “All God’s Children” had lived in the home for 14 years. The director lost all of her physical possessions, including her film equipment and hard drives containing footage from past films, as well as cash, jewelry, valuable paintings and her son’s artwork. But despite the traumatic loss, when Timoner returned to LA she decided to film her and Doctor’s return to their nonexistent dwelling. The director teamed with producer Maggie Contreras and cinematographer Elle Schneider, and her nephew, Eli Timoner.\n\t\n\n\tTogether, over a six month period, the small crew captured what the aftermath of the fires looked like for Timoner and her neighbors, many of whom had their generational wealth wiped out overnight and were now at risk of being displaced and losing their homes permanently. Timoner also filmed with Altadena community organizer Heavenly Hughes and the nonprofit organization My Tribe Rise as they attempted to restore the lives of those in need during the aftermath of the catastrophic fires.\n\n\n\tThe result of Timoner’s efforts is the 38-minute documentary “All The Walls Came Down,” which captures the resilience and solidarity of a community determined to rise again. The director uses her personal loss as a way into a larger story about a community rallying together in the wake of the fires. The doc also chronicles how the Black community of West Altadena is being pushed out despite still making mortgage payments on houses that are no longer standing.\n\t\n\n\t“I am so glad I did film when I returned to the ruins of my home, despite really feeling hopeless and overwhelmed,” says Timoner. “It gave me the material with which to transform the experience from an utter nightmare which we are still living through, to something that can protect and heal. We made the film fast and kept it a short film to try to help an urgent situation in my town.”\n\n\tIn September, “All The Walls Came Down” premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. On Sunday, the film will screen at the Sun Valley Film Festival, where Timoner will receive the Impact Award. (The short doc is eligible for an Oscar nomination, which Timoner has never received.)Since the doc’s debut, it has been used to raise financial and tangible resources, such as Airstream trailers for families who lost homes. Working as a team with My Tribe Rise, Timoner has held screenings of the doc for financiers and organizations that can help Altadena and its struggling residents.\n\n\t“All The Walls Came Down” has shown me the true power of filmmaking – giving me the opportunity to turn an unimaginable tragedy into a rallying cry and a shield to protect the town and its most vulnerable,” says Timoner. “It’s felt like practicing alchemy to tell my intimate story of grief and loss in order to get help for my neighbors to keep their land and rebuild.”\n\n\tCurrently Timoner and her team are working to get the film out to help build signatures on a petition to stop the foreclosures in Altadena.\n\n\t“We have reached over 1000 signatures and we are just getting started,” says Timoner. “We ask Governor Gavin Newsom and the California State Legislature to issue an immediate moratorium on mortgage payments, interest accrual, foreclosures, and evictions for all residents impacted by the Eaton Fire of January 2025 until claims against Southern California Edison and related insurance issues are resolved.”\n\n\tOn Jan. 7, the Los Angeles Times will release “All The Walls Came Down” on its documentary platform.\n\n\t“We want to continue to use the film as a way to help the community heal from such a traumatic event that spanned from the Palisades to Altadena,” says Timoner. “We also hope to raise bridge funding to aid Altadena families in need in their recovery.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe White House’s social media team had to back down this week on including Sabrina Carpenter‘s “Juno” in a post touting ICE’s migrant arrests — but they’re hardly going away quietly. Shortly after deleting the initial X post, the administration snapped back by posting a new clip of Carpenter doing a commercial for her recent “Saturday Night Live” appearance, with the audio overdubbed so that she appears to be calling cast member Marcello Hernández “illegal” instead of “hot.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the original, unaltered “SNL” commercial, Carpenter stood alongside Hernández and said, “I think I might need to arrest someone for being too hot.” “Oh well, I turn myself in,” responded Hernández, extending his hands, as if to be cuffed. “You’re under arrest!” she cooed. But with the White House’s alteration of the clip, the overdubbed audio now has a voice like Carpenter’s saying “…too illegal,” as the highly popular Latino cast member puts his wrists out.\n\n\n\tThe caption for the TikTok and X video reads: “PSA: If you’re a criminal illegal, you WILL be arrested & deported.” Following the altered footage of Carpenter and Hernández’s repartee, the remainder of the White House’s post — as with the previous, now-deleted video that appropriated Carpenter’s music — consists of footage of immigrants being chased down and arrested.\n\n\n\tCarpenter’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\t\n\n\tIn the case of the previous video with the “Juno” soundtrack, Carpenter made her feelings clear, writing, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”\n\n\tThe earlier video consisted of the repetition of the “Juno” lyric “Have you ever tried this one?” accompanying shots of migrants being tackled and detained. It’s not known whether the White House voluntarily deleted the tweet; a version of it on TikTok remained, with the contentious audio removed.\n\n\tThe White House’s initial response to the pop superstar’s objection to having her music used as a soundtrack for the video was to mockingly use Carpenter’s lyrics against her, in a statement. Spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN: “Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”\n\n\tThe White House has seemingly delighted in taunting pop stars and their fans with posts twisting their messages to support pro-ICE or pro-Trump videos. On Nov. 3, the administration’s social media posted a video using Taylor Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” as the soundtrack for a Trump-glorifying montage. That video remains online.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeon Thomas was chilling with his dog Terry while watching the “Elvis” biopic in 2022 when the idea for his breakthrough solo single, “Mutt,” came to him. “[The film] talked about the hound dog, and I was like, man, I want to be on some Black Elvis shit — but find my own way to make it happen,” he recalls.\n\n\tThe 32-year-old Brooklyn native had only recently moved into the foreground as a solo musician, having previously gained fame as a child star on Nickelodeon’s “Victorious” and a hit songwriter for SZA (he was a Variety Hitmaker in 2023 for his work on her smash “Snooze”), Ariana Grande and others. He’d released mixtapes and EPs here and there, but signing with Ty Dolla $ign’s EZMNY Records as its flagship artist in 2022 opened the lane to release his debut album, “Electric Dusk,” and its follow-up, “Mutt,” last year.\n\t\n\n\tThomas wrote the title track knowing it would be the project’s banner single. He already had the chorus in pocket and developed the verses over text with Bizzy Crook before fleshing out the song with producers D. Phelps and Freaky Rob. For the song to hit, Thomas was “looking at it from a pace level,” speeding up the tempo about 10 BPMs for more urgency. “I also knew it was going to be a good radio record because the hook was catchy and singable. I like to call it the ‘drunken fun’ method: Can somebody sing this drunk at a club or at your shows? If it’s not that easy to sing, it’s probably not gonna travel too far.”\n\n\n\tThe theory paid off: Following its release last August, “Mutt” slowly but surely ascended the charts, becoming the third-longest climb to the Top 10 in Billboard Hot 100 history. Now, he’s up for six Grammys, including best new artist. “It’s gratifying, you know?” he says. “I think now is a great moment of just showing how God can develop a human being into what I’m supposed to be at the right time. And there’s no mistakes here.”\n\t\n\n\tSONGWRITERS: Leon Thomas, Rob Gueringer, David Kenneth Phelps, Lazaro A.

    "body": "\n\tAmong the many burning questions about Netflix‘s potential acquisition of Warner Bros. is: What would happen to HBO Max? Would customers continue to subscribe to both, or would it ultimately roll into Netflix?\n\n\tAt least immediately, Netflix has said HBO Max would continue as a separate entity — but makes no promises that it wouldn’t ultimately be consumed into Netflix. HBO becoming a tile on Netflix, just like Hulu being slowly taken over by Disney+, is a likely possibility.\n\t\n\n\tBut here’s one that no one seems to be asking: What about the linear HBO service? You know, the pioneering network that essentially ushered in the cable age when it launched in 1972? HBO, the channel that revolutionized “prestige TV” with “The Sopranos,” and everything that came after that?\n\n\n\tEven if HBO as a brand survives this merger, the idea of HBO as a standalone enterprise may soon be history. And it would also pretty much double as the last nail in the coffin of “premium cable” as we knew it. \n\n\tAlready, Paramount has destroyed the one-vibrant Showtime brand — first, by killing the standalone Showtime app, and then even renaming to remaining linear channel to “Paramount + With Showtime.” Now, there’s no Showtime infrastructure to speak of, and the cabler’s last remaining shows — like the “Dexter” spinoffs and “Yellowjackets” — are instead promoted as Paramount+ originals. Showtime, a flagship premium cable network that first launched in 1976, may live on in bits of leftover branding in some corners of the media universe, but it’s mostly dead.\n\n\tFX wasn’t officially a premium cable network since it’s free on basic cable, but it evolved into a “premium” brand, inspired by the success of HBO in delivering its own diet of high-end, quality fare. Like HBO, FX changed the programming game and for a moment made basic cable a hot place for creators to bring their passion projects, as did AMC during the “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad” eras. FX still exists, but mostly as a tile on Hulu. Not all of FX’s fare airs on the linear channel — which now mostly schedules library movies and repeats. When people talk about “FX,” they’re not talking about the linear channel anymore. (Meanwhile, with the writing on the wall for linear, AMC has attempted to migrate its viewers to its AMC+ streamer, with mixed results.)\n\t\n\n\tAmong the smaller premium channels, MGM+ remains a linear/stream hybrid under Amazon ownership, while Starz also programs a linear suite of channels, even as it prefers to focus on its digital platform. But both would prefer you think of them as digital brands, not legacy TV channels.\n\n\tAnd that brings us to HBO. Even under Warner Bros. Discovery, the pay cabler has been pulling back on its linear offerings: Earlier this year, the company shut down multiplex networks including HBO Family, ThrillerMax, MovieMax and OuterMax. \n\n\tThose cuts came from a company with leadership that was rooted in cable. Imagine, now, how much patience Netflix’s Ted Sarandos might have for what’s left in the HBO linear stable. (The answer? Not much.) Sarandos and Netflix have never shown any interest in owning or operating linear properties, after all. Netflix purposely didn’t include the channels being spun off by the “Discovery” portion of “Warner Bros. Discovery” in its bid. So how long would it tolerate programming HBO linear, rather than forcing those remaining customers to move to digital?\n\n\tRight now, HBO linear subscribers still get free access to HBO Max — which was part of the promise of HBO Max when it initially launched in 2020. Would Netflix put up with those hybrid linear customers accessing the streamer that way? When it comes to cutting costs in the merger, will Netflix decide having a linear network infrastructure still makes sense, or will it be an easy thing to whack off the spreadsheets and the bottom line?\n\n\tJust like the sunsetting era of basic cable, the fate of premium cable perhaps had already been sealed no matter what. In 2024, HBO averaged just 154,000 viewers in primetime — down 7% from the previous year, but a huge slide from recent years (including 726,000. in 2017) as viewership continued its migration to streaming.\n\n\tNetflix launched its original programming efforts in the early 2010s by emulating the HBO model — starting with high-end fare like “House of Cards.” It wanted to out-HBO HBO, and eventually got so big that it went from boutique to warehouse. Now, Netflix has out-broadcast the broadcast networks instead, while HBO remains a high-end bespoke destination, but mostly on HBO Max. Netflix garners a large awards nomination haul thanks to its sheer output volume, but HBO also dominates thanks to its quality curation. \n\t\n\n\tIf Netflix does buy Warner Bros., it will be only a matter of time until premium cable dies. HBO would be just one more brand to add to the Netflix’s bulging menu, alongside the WWE, the NFL and more. The narrative of Netflix vs. HBO has ruled over TV discourse, particularly in the awards space, for more than a decade. But now Netflix might not have to be HBO anymore, nor would it have to beat it — instead, it would just consume it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are eight weeks left on the holy Hollywood awards calendar until Oscar nominations are announced, and it’s not just artists and craftspeople hunting for trophies. Momentum has been building in the auction for the TV rights to air the Academy Awards, Variety has learned through many recent conversations with sources close to the negotiations.\n\n\tThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been seeking a new broadcast licensing agreement for the better part of 2025 – an all-important strategic partnership and revenue source that keeps the AMPAS coffers full, and the industry focused on glorifying movies for theaters as the highest art form in the town (anything else happen today that could threaten theatrical movies?). The Academy is seeking a deal term of 5-10 years for its next contract, numerous sources said.\n\t\n\n\tABC has long been the Academy’s broadcast partner and currently has rights to air the show through 2028, which will culminate in the milestone 100th Oscars ceremony. Over the summer, media reports said a slew of unconventional buyers had come into the mix as potential suitors, including Netflix and YouTube. The field has narrowed as concerns swirl over the real cost of mounting the Oscars in a sector wracked with financial anxiety.\n\n\n\tFor starters, Netflix is out, two sources familiar with the ongoing talks told Variety. While the streamer kicked the tires mid-summer, one of the sources was definitive that the new presumptive owner of Warner Bros. is no longer involved. CBS, owned by David Ellison’s Paramount, was never meaningfully engaged in conversations despite earlier reports.\n\t\n\n\tNBCUniversal has gained ground as an interested party, according to three sources familiar with those Academy discussions. Following a triumphant show with 2024 Summer Olympics, the Comcast company is leaning further into its identity as a producer of live entertainment (look at this month’s ratings for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, a record-shattering 34.3 million viewers across linear TV and Peacock). It also makes perfect sense that NBC would want the Oscars as a tentpole given Universal Pictures’ standing in the filmmaking community. NBCUniversal Entertainment and Studios Chair Donna Langley arguably has the best talent relationships in town, and the studio has more overall talent deals (over 20) than competitors like Warner Bros., Sony, Paramount, Walt Disney Pictures or any of the streamers. One insider with knowledge of the ongoing talks said a particularly attractive selling point for the Academy would be the forthcoming Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028 – where NBCU could unleash a firehose of marketing synergies to hype its first perspective Oscars broadcast in 2029.YouTube also remains an active bidder in the process, two sources familiar with those talks said. The Google subsidiary has exploded as a viewership juggernaut, representing the most-connected TV app in the U.S. and abroad for the past two years, per Nielsen. One person intimately familiar with YouTube’s wares pointed out that it earns far more viewership on clips and speeches from past Academy Awards broadcasts than the broadcast partners earn for the live event itself.Then there’s ABC. The Disney network has aired most Oscar telecasts throughout history and has been AMPAS’ consistent network partner since 1976. NBC carried the telecast on TV and radio in 1953. The Oscars moved to ABC for a 10-year run in 1961. NBC was back in the mix from 1971 through 1975.\n\n\tBy 2028, ABC will have aired 50 consecutive ceremonies. Sources close to ABC said its Academy relationship goes beyond that of a traditional distributor, with much of the institutional memory surrounding the show hanging in the balance. Two sources were doubtful ABC will make it to the finish line with a new deal and painted the network as “less aggressive” than others involved. There’s also the glaring fact that ABC just negotiated a 10-plus year deal to air the Grammys across linear, Disney+ and Hulu, ending CBS’ long partnership with the recording academy. Another individual familiar with ABC disputed this, saying the network is heavily invested in its Academy partnership. They also extolled the value of Disney’s own corporate synergy – which sees the Oscars promoted at theme parks, on cruises, even in bits and story arcs on scripted programming for ABC and Hulu. The insider was optimistic about the Oscars remaining at ABC, and added that the Grammys in no way diminishes its commitment to Hollywood’s biggest night.\n\n\tWhat the deal comes down to, as it always does, is not gold but green. Dollar figures for what the Academy is asking from each of its potential new partners were difficult for sources to express. In some instances, talks have yet to result in a hardline financial ask for the telecast rights. But there’s a resounding feeling from sources close to NBCUniversal, ABC and YouTube: “We’re not overpaying.”\n\n\tThree separate sources said that ABC spends about $120 million annually for the Oscars, which includes spending on the rights, ceremony production and other institutional support. That figure is eye-popping for top dealmakers in show business, especially given the steady ratings decline all awards shows face in the streaming era. This year’s Conan O’Brien-hosted event pulled in a 5-year ratings high on ABC and Hulu at 19.69 million viewers, but that number is far off the nearly 40 million that watched the show a decade ago.\n\t\n\n\tThe financials get even more complicated for YouTube, as two insiders with knowledge of those talks said the Academy would expect a big premium to sell its rights to an exclusively digital buyer. Filmmakers and talent could revolt at the idea of celebrating cinema on a streaming platform owned by the biggest tech company in the world. Sources at the studios also pointed out a problem in the Oscars having proximity to other content that powers the video service. \n\n\t“Are you going to have the Academy Awards roll into an autoplay of Ms. Rachel?” asked one source, referencing the extremely popular children’s educator who makes her bread on YouTube.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER WARNING: This story contains spoilers from “HDP,” Episode 6, Season 1 of “Pluribus,” now streaming on Apple TV. \n\n\tSet amid the backdrop of Albuquerque, New Mexico, the world of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seahorn) has forever changed in Apple TV’s “Pluribus.” After the sudden loss of her partner, Helen (Miriam Shor) and the realization that everyone around her has been infected with a seemingly incurable extraterrestrial virus, Carol finds herself in a crossfire of grappling with her grief while simultaneously trying to figure out how to save the world from happiness. As one of only 13 individuals who are immune from the virus, Carol is introduced to others like her who have been spared from The Joining, only to find that those who have not been infected want nothing to do with her plan to find a cure.\n\t\n\n\tIn Episode 2, audiences are introduced to Koumba Diabaté (Samba Schutte), who whisks the other immune people into Air Force One — which he has commandeered — where his desire for opulence and his extravagant personality take center stage. In Episode 6, titled “HDP,” we learn that Koumba has been staying in Las Vegas, living out his wildest fantasies with those in The Joining. When Carol arrives to reveal that the infected have been harvesting and eating human carcasses as protein to survive, the two find themselves at odds in how they are approaching humanity’s demise, all while being monitored from afar.\n\n\n\tSchutte spoke with Variety about Koumba and Carol’s dynamic, Koumba’s inner loneliness — and what he thinks The Joining really think about his character.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat were some of your early conversations with “Pluribus” creator Vince Gilligan leading up to Episode 6?\t\n\n\tEpisode 6 was the first episode I filmed. What I loved about was that it informed me immediately who this guy is, and what he wants. When I talked to Vince, he was very clear that this guy is not a sleaze bag. He’s a kid in a candy store who’s just got access to a genie in a bottle who will give him everything he wants. He did not come from a life of opulence, and then suddenly the world has changed. So of course, he’s going to live it up and be James Bond and have Lamborghinis and self-portraits of himself everywhere.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a scene in the beginning of the episode where Koumba and some of those who’ve been infected are playing a game of poker, and because they’re infected  only to spread happiness, he asks them to “play along” to replicate experiencing anger. How do those infected view him, do you think, since he’s one of only 13 people who hasn’t become a member of The Joining?\t\n\n\tUp to this point, we’ve seen him embrace this new world and enjoy seeing that these others are so happy and live in harmony. There’s a side of him who’s fascinated by them. He’s fascinated by Zosia [Karolina Wydra], and that she’s all about love and unity and harmony. He sees them as angels on earth who will give him everything he wants. But really, it’s asking who is using who.  \n\n\tAt the end of the day, the others are very clear that they want to turn the original humans without their consent because they will understand once they join. To them, he’s one of the most fascinating people in the universe, because he’s immune to their virus, and at the same time, they see him with love — like, they love Carol unconditionally. They want him to have everything he wants until they can find a way to turn him. There’s a side of him who is very much like, “Yeah, I know what your end game is, so I’m just going to live it up as much as I can while finding a way to keep my individuality too.”\n\t\n\t\tKoumba is essentially the only person who cares about Carol, and continuously tries to make her feel comfortable after she’s been excluded by the others. Does he care for her because he sees pieces of himself inside of her internal loneliness and grief?\t\n\n\tWhat he finds in common with Carol is that loneliness. Both of them don’t have family members. He’s surrounded by supermodels, but he doesn’t have anyone in his life. He sees that she’s lonely, and he’s asking the others [that are not infected] to help her. He cares about her that way, because when she comes to town, everyone just abandons him. He realizes that she’s a lonely person, and he really wants her to not be, and to help give her answers that she needs so she can move on and accept this world. They both just handle it differently.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s almost like a sibling dynamic between the two, especially during the moment where they’re sitting at the table eating breakfast and he copies making her avocado egg sandwich.\t\n\n\tIt was so fun to agitate Rhea, because all her notes when we were acting that scene just said, “I want to strangle you.” So yes, it’s very much sibling energy!\n\t\n\t\tKoumba reveals to Carol that unless they consent to having their stem cells extracted from their body, The Joining will not be allowed to change them. Carol makes it clear that she will never consent to it, and it’s revealed that Kouma also didn’t consent to the procedure. \t\n\n\tHe has been doing his own research about what are the rules of the game, and how long does he have left. He’s learned the rules, and he’s so excited to hear that they can’t turn him — because that means he can keep living his wildest dreams. That’s why he’s so excited to find out that they get to enjoy this world, because they will never become one of them without consent. \n\t\n\t\tWe don’t get to see who Koumba was before The Joining began. What would you imagine his upbringing was like?\t\n\n\tWhen I first got the audition, his name was Mr. Koumba. In my culture, Koumba is a woman’s name, but the only way you get a woman’s name is if you take your mother’s name after she’s passed away during childbirth. I thought that was a really interesting detail, and I told that to Vince and he had no idea. We kept that detail, and it really informed who he is. He does not have family members. He came from a place of poverty, did not have opulence. Vince said he did not have a good life before the world changed, and experienced discrimination and racism. Because of this new change in the world, he can just live out his greatest fantasies. He’s seen how rich people act, and there’s that side of him that has this childlike eagerness and curiosity to experience things in life.\n\t\n\t\tIn the final moments of Episode 6, Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga) begins his journey to find Carol in Albuquerque. Since Koumba and Manousos are both on opposite ends on how they are coping with The Joining, how do you think they will get along when they inevitably meet?\t\n\n\tI love Vesga so much, and we keep talking about these two very contrasting guys meeting! Manousos wants to change the world, and save it by killing everybody. Carol wants to save the world by scientifically reversing it, and Koumba wants to save it by stopping people from starving to death and living in harmony. I think that aspect of it is gonna be so fun. Koumba will be like “Relax, here’s a martini! Let’s go to Hawaii!” to Manousos when they meet.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Everything Trying,” the Season 1 finale “The Last Frontier, now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tThe season finale of Apple TV+’s “The Last Frontier” would have looked a lot different if its creators had stuck to their original plan.\n\n\tIn the final hour, CIA agent Sidney (Haley Bennett) and Havlock (Dominic Cooper) corner their former boss Jacque (Alfre Woodard) at a conspicuously vacant but operational dam, pressuring her to fess up to a career of burning agents and feeding them to the wolves –– some of whom had showed up to back the married couple’s coup. But in the chaos of a gunfight, Jacque breaks free and fights Sidney with a literal axe before being sent over the dam to her watery and chilly grave. While fending off Jacque, Sidney is stabbed, leaving U.S. marshal Frank (Jason Clarke) to use a dog sled to transport her to the hospital for a life-saving blood transfusion. Does it get any more Alaskan than that? Then, Havlock fakes his own death while Sidney recovers and faces prosecution, giving the appearance that everything from the season premiere’s plane crash (remember when this was a prisoner-of-the-week show?) is finally cleaned up.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut Frank isn’t buying it. In the end, his plans to open a bed and breakfast with his wife Sarah (Simone Kessell) in their once-quiet corner of the world are immediately jeopardized when Havlock calls his former sparring partner with a warning –– ”Your corner of the world is now the center of everything,” Havlock professes, as he gets ready to stage a prison break for his incarcerated wife, Sidney.\n\t\n\n\tBut none of that was supposed to happen, at least not yet, because creators Jon Bokenkamp and Richard D’Ovidio originally discussed leaving the audience with the bombshell that Sidney was behind the plane crash orchestrated to expose the agency’s secrets. Instead, that revelation came in Episode 7 of the 10-episode first season.\n\n\t“Richard and I had talked for a long time about how the reveal that Sidney was behind the plane crash felt like a great gut punch to take you out at the end of the season, in a Keyser Söze sort of way,” Bokenkamp tells Variety. “But in a time where there are so many cliffhangers on so many shows that stop and come back two years later to pick up the story, we felt like the most fair thing to do for the audience was to have that reveal a little bit earlier. It’s the end of our second act, and then you live with it and let it unfold and see the ramifications of that through the finale.”\n\n\tWith big reveal about Sidney out of the way, the series was able to bring its real villain to the forefront –– Woodard’s cold, calculated bureaucrat Jacque. Originally, the role was written for a “crusty, old white man,” Bokenkamp says. But when Woodard expressed interest, she asked they change only one thing: the character’s name went from Jack to Jacque. Otherwise, Woodard was on board for the incredibly physical finale set piece that begins with a declaration fit for a battlefield  –– “If I must be painted the villain, please, please paint my colors bright,” Jacque screams into the universe as she jams a knife into a guy’s neck.\n\n\t“She was all in,” Bokenkamp says of the Oscar nominee. “She was on those wires clear up in the sky, hanging off sets. She was carrying that axe. It was very physical. She didn’t want to take the edges off, and that got us excited.”\n\n\tSpeaking of the axe, Jacque is out for blood, and she wields an axe to get it from Sidney, who is trying to upload Archive 6 to expose Jacque’s misdeeds. “That axe fight was Daniel Hargrave, our stunt coordinator, and his team,” Bokenkamp adds. “We can script that there are axes in the scene, but it’s not until Daniel and his team get in there that it’s like the crazy cousins at Christmas who go nuts trying to figure out how to make it bigger and crazier.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tUltimately, Jacque’s desperate measures end with her and Sidney dangling from the dam wall, and Jacque has the unfortunate fate of joining the fishes at the bottom. Even with a game Woodard in their arsenal, the creators never second guessed killing her off. They only doubted whether or not they should prove it to the audience.\n\n\t“We needed the satisfaction of somebody going into the drink and knowing that they’re not coming back,” Bokenkamp says. “We had scripted that we found bits of Jacque down the river, but we didn’t quite go that far.”\n\n\tWhile it takes Frank’s sled-dog skills and a tremendous amount of blood, Sidney survives her encounter with Jacque, only to awaken to the crushing reality check of what she has done. In order to avenge her father, she downed a plane with her husband on it, lied to Frank and jeopardized the safety of his entire town. In front of her may be jail time, but she is far more concerned with the personal reckoning that awaits her, even if Frank tries to soothe her guilt with kind words –– “Your father would agree that you’ve spent yourself on a worthy cause.”\n\n\t“She certainly regrets what happened,” D’Ovidio says. “When she found out that the plane was full of inmates and innocent people, that’s where we meet her in the opening scene when she starts drinking in the car. We come back around to that moment to show why she was in so much pain before she goes into that party. She has to put on this face where she pretends she doesn’t know anything about the disaster in front of her. So when you watch it again, I think you will see she was changed all the way back in the beginning.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor now, Frank is also a changed man. After he confessed to his wife and son about really happened in Chicago –– that he planted evidence to get the wrong man convicted of his daughter’s murder –– they come home to the cabin with one request: He must bury the remaining evidence so they can move on (we would have chosen to dispose of it in a river that isn’t a popular fishing hole, but that’s just us). In a flashforward, the family is all smiles as they give the cabin a face lift ahead of the bed and breakfast’s opening. But that’s when Havlock calls, cautioning Frank to not get too comfortable in his quiet life.\n\t\n\n\t“I hope what’s relatable about Frank is that he will always answer that call,” Bokenkamp says. “He doesn’t have to, but it’s who he is. It is his self-concept, you know? I relate to that. We invest so much of ourselves in our work, and it’s not just a job. Frank very much feels that way, perhaps in a little bit of a romanticized way. But that’s a difficult thing to switch off. Whatever the case of the season or week, or who the bad guy is, he’d answer that call if it was a cat in the tree. That’s the impulse Frank has to fight.”\n\n\tBokenkamp and D’Ovidio have already pondered possible Season 2 stories off Havlock’s call, although the series is still awaiting a greenlight from Apple.\n\n\t“I think that we’ve discussed many avenues to take with the second season, but we’ve pretty much exhausted a lot of stories in Alaska,” D’Ovidio says, acknowledging the show changed drastically from the plane crash premiere to the government espionage finale.\n\n\tWith Havlock poised to spring Sidney from jail, a Bonnie and Clyde-style vigilante duo could be one possibility for the future. “We’ve certainly talked a lot about where they end up, maybe a beach somewhere.” Bokenkamp says. “But it also occurs to me that the U.S. Marshals hunt bad guys around the world. Sidney and Havlock represent a problem to Frank, but that doesn’t mean they are his only problem.”\n\n\tSo fans probably shouldn’t bother booking time in the quaint bed and breakfast the Remnicks are building, huh?\n\n\t“Season 2 could certainly involve a bed and breakfast, but it probably won’t be quite like ‘Newhart,” Bokenkamp says with a laugh. “Frank might have to let that one go.”\n",

The move was intended to remove any risk of danger to the other children in their home.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Shauntel reportedly revealed this information Friday during a custody hearing. The court appearance stemmed from Shantel's ex-husband, Thomas Hudson, reportedly filing an emergency custody motion requesting that a judge grant him custody of their youngest daughter, who lives with Shauntel and Christopher.\n      \n    \n          Thomas's motion was possibly out of concern the stepbrother might harm the daughter he shares with Shauntel.\n      \n    \n          Remember ... Anna was found in a room she was sharing with her stepbrother, asphyxiated from a choke hold. While the FBI is investigating the stepbrother, no charges have been filed and officials have not named a suspect.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Anna was reportedly found by a cabin steward on November 8 -- wrapped in a blanket and tucked under a bed -- during a Caribbean cruise with her family.\n      \n    \n          A recent report claims Anna’s stepbrother allegedly had a weird infatuation with the teen cheerleader ... even climbing on top of her in bed once, according to Steven Westin, the father of Anna’s ex-boyfriend.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Anna Kepner\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Momsen sang high praises of Jim Carrey after reuniting for the first time in 25 years at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday.\n\n\tUpon reuniting with her “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” co-star, the musician told People how watching Carrey’s work ethic as a child actor inspired her at a young age. \n\n\t“I just love that he was very protective of me,” she said. “He was always very kind. And just the entire experience of filming ‘Grinch’ and getting to know him so well, even in all the makeup, was just wonderful.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “As a young person watching an artist at work and taking their craft so seriously, that left a really powerful, lasting impact on me as an adult now. And I’m excited to be able to tell him that as a grownup.”\n\n\tWhile posing together on the red carpet, Carrey told reporters, “We haven’t seen each other since ‘The Grinch.’”\n\n\tMomsen followed up with “Yeah, it’s been 25 years. This is insane.”\n\n\tMomsen was five years old when she played the role of Cindy-Lou Who. She acted alongside Carrey, who portrayed the titular, grumpy Dr. Seuss character who hated Christmas.\n\n\tBeyond “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” Momsen’s most prominent acting role was playing  Jenny Humphry in “Gossip Girl.” Her other acting credits also include “Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams,” “Underdog” and “Paranoid Park.”\n\n\tIn 2010, the actress stepped away from acting to focus on her music career as the lead singer of the rock band, “Pretty Reckless.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLondoners will soon get to shrink down to toy size in Andy’s room from “Toy Story” in a major immersive Pixar experience heading to the British capital in the new year.\n\n\tMundo Pixar Experience, a multi-sensory exhibition featuring the animation studio’s most celebrated films, is set to open in Wembley Park on Feb. 13, 2006.\n\n\tFollowing its success in Brazil, Mexico, Belgium and Spain, where it welcomed over 3.2 million visitors and received widespread acclaim, Mundo Pixar Experience now arrives in the U.K. for the very first time. It also arrives ahead of the release of new Pixar titles next year, “Hopper” in March and “Toy Story 5” in June.\n\t\n\n\tSet in a purpose-built venue in Wembley Park, the exhibition will span more than 3,500 square metres, and will feature 14 Pixar universes including over 25 sculptures. Guests will be able to explore recreated environments from “Toy Story”, “Monsters, Inc.”, “Cars”, “Finding Nemo”, “Inside Out”, “Coco”, “Up” and others. According to the organizers, each space “combines detailed set design, ambient music, and specially crafted scents to immerse visitors in Pixar’s most beloved stories.”\n\n\n\tPresented by Golden Peak Live Entertainment, in collaboration with Proactiv Entertainment, RG Live, Senbla and Luna, the London edition will include a brand-new room created exclusively for this stop on the world tour. Alongside Andy’s room, the attractions will include the Scare Floor from “Monsters, Inc.” and Riley’s emotional headquarters from “Inside Out 2.”\n\n\tBeyond the immersive sets, guests can take part in a special Pixar Ball Treasure Hunt, searching for the famous yellow ball with a red star hidden throughout the exhibition — a nod to the Easter egg that appears in many Pixar films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBBC’s director general Tim Davie and the CEO of News Deborah Turness both resigned on Sunday. The shock decisions came after the BBC’s flagship documentary show Panorama was accused of doctoring a Donald Trump speech to make it seem like he encouraged the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\n\t“This is a sad day for the BBC. Tim has been an outstanding Director-General for the last five years. He has propelled the BBC forward with determination, single-mindedness and foresight,” said BBC Chairman Samir Shah. “He has had the full support of me and the Board throughout. However, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. The whole Board respects the decision and the reasons for it.”\n\t\n\n\tIn an exit statement to BBC staff, Davie wrote, “Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility.”\n\n\n\tIn her own statement, Turness said she has “taken the difficult decision that it will no longer be my role to lead you in the collective vision that we all have: to pursue the truth with no agenda.”\n\n\tTrouble for the BBC began on Nov. 3, after The Telegraph published details of a 19-page dossier on BBC bias by a former independent external advisor to the BBC’s standards committee. In the report, Panorama was accused of splicing together footage that made Trump “‘say’ things [he] never actually said.” One of the most damning clips shows Trump declaring he would walk with his supporters to the Capitol and “fight like hell,” when he actually encouraged them to “peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”\n\t\n\n\tThe dossier also claimed that the BBC’s top brass ignored complaints and suggestions by the standards committee.\n\n\tDavie has faced a number of major scandals since being named director general in 2020, including the resignation of the BBC’s top new anchor Huw Edwards and accusations of bias from both sides over its coverage of the war in Gaza. Earlier this year, the BBC apologised over the documentary “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone” after it emerged that the 13-year-old narrator’s father held a position in the Hamas-run administration, an omission that regulator Ofcom said was a “serious breach” of broadcasting rules.\n\n\tDavie first joined the BBC in 2005 as director of marketing, communications and audiences. Turness was named CEO of BBC News in 2022 and previously served as president of NBC News.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Predator: Badlands” clawed its way to $80 million at the global box office, ranking as the biggest debut in the nearly 40-year-old franchise. Director Shane Black’s 2018 reboot “The Predator” previously held the record with $73.5 million, not adjusted for inflation. \n\n\tThose ticket sales include $40 million in North America and $40 million in 52 international markets. “Badlands” also overtook the domestic record from 2004’s “Alien vs. Predator” with $38 million, also not adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, this marks the franchise’s second-best international start after “The Predator” with $48.9 million. Top overseas markets were China with $7.4 million, the United Kingdom with $3.2 million and Mexico with $2.3 million.\n\t\n\n\tDan Trachtenberg directed “Predator: Badlands,” which is the ninth installment in the series and the first theatrical entry since Disney acquired 20th Century Fox. That’s where the franchise began, with 1987’s “Predator,” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trachtenberg returned after helming the two most recent “Predator” adventures, 2022’s “Prey” and this June’s animated “Predator: Killer of Killers,” both of which skipped theaters and landed directly on Hulu. This chapter cost $105 million to produce and follows an outcast alien hunter (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) and his unlikely ally (Elle Fanning), who embark on a dangerous journey to defeat a menacing adversary.\n\n\n\t“Badlands” is benefiting from several factors, including solid reviews, stellar word-of-mouth and outsized interest on Imax and other pricier premium-large-format screens. And this film is rated PG-13 (most of the other “Predator” films are rated R), which is broadening its appeal to family crowds rather than just the target demographic of boys and men.\n\t\n\n\t“Predator: Badlands” is reinvigorating the box office after a dismal October. November should remain strong with “Wicked: For Good” and “Zootopia 2” around Thanksgiving, while December offerings like “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” Sydney Sweeney’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash” should help end the year on a high. \n\n\tElsewhere at the box office, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” is nearing a major milestone. The comedic action thriller, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, has earned $196.8 million globally (including $127.4 million overseas) and will soon surpass the $200 million mark. That’s a notable benchmark for an original, R-rated film that’s nearly three hours long. It’s by far the highest-grossing film of Anderson’s career, overtaking the 2007 Western “There Will Be Blood,” which earned $76.4 million globally. And it’s likely to be a major Oscar player in the new year. However, Warner Bros. spent more than $130 million on the film, and since theater owners get to keep about 50% of ticket sales, “One Battle After Another” is tracking to lose $100 million in its theatrical run.\n\n\tIn another benchmark, Sony’s “Chainsaw Man – the Movie: Reze Arc” has surpassed $150 million worldwide. The anime adventure has grossed $158 million to date, including $121 million internationally and $38 million domestically. “Chainsaw Man” is the second consecutive win for Sony’s Crunchyroll banner following September’s sleeper hit “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,” which is the biggest anime film ever with $591 million globally. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“In Your Dreams” was made for Netflix by a team of artists who cut their teeth at Pixar (the director, Alex Woo, was a story artist on films like “Ratatouille,” “WALL-E,” and “Incredibles 2”), and it’s one of those animated movies that keeps reminding you of other animated movies (not all of them Pixar), which even if you like the films in question is not really a good thing. “In Your Dreams” is built around great swirling mounds of imagistic energy, yet it feels secondhand at its core.\n\t\n\n\tStevie (voiced by Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), a precocious 12-year-old, discovers that her parents may be breaking up. They were once a local indie music duo called Hypsonics, but Mom (Crisin Milioti) now wants to move to Duluth to become an assistant professor, while Dad (Simu Liu), a roly-poly slacker, is content to stay planted, whiling away the days diddling with the album he’ll never finish. (Given that they can’t pay the bills, there aren’t really two sides to this rift.) So how will Stevie, who shares a bedroom with her obnoxious little brother, Elliot (Elias Janssen), keep the family together?\n\n\n\tBy escaping into a world of dreams, which sounds fancifully original but translates, at heart, into a knockoff of “Inside Out,” with tween angst trying to work itself out in a lavish alternate cosmos. The way that Elliot’s stuffed giraffe, Baloney Tony, comes to life through the rapid-fire smart-mouth voicing of Craig Robinson feels like an overly pointed gloss on Eddie Murphy’s Donkey in the “Shrek” films. And the fact that Stevie and Elliot zoom around on a possessed bed frame seems to have come right out of the fondly remembered 1971 Disney clunker “Bedknobs and Broomsticks.” Then there’s the Sandman, a kind of Wizard of Oz of the cosmic dunes voiced by the British-born Omid Djalili, who sounds like Jude Law impersonating Santa Claus.\n\t\n\n\tStevie and Elliot discover that they can be inside the same dream at the same time. As the two plunge in and out of dreams, the movie serves up a series of florid set pieces, most of which serve no narrative purpose beyond their eyeball-tickling show-reel dimension. The kids are first dropped into a cardboard-castle land inhabited by walking, talking items of food (donuts, strawberries, avocados, French toast, hard-boiled eggs), which a few minutes later turn moldy and rotten and threatening. And that’s the way it goes with most of these dreams; they become nightmares, which peter out the moment Stevie and Elliot wake up. “Why did I wake up when you woke up?” asks Stevie. Why? Because that’s the arbitrary rules of the movie they’re in. At one point there’s a bad-dream montage, set to (inevitable needle drop #1) “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),” and it’s at that point the audience realizes that none of this is actually affecting the characters’ waking lives, so how much investment can we have in it?\n\n\tYou just know that the Sandman, at one point heralded by (inevitable needle drop #2) Metallica’s “Enter Sandman,” is going to turn out to be less nice than he seems. But it’s what he represents that’s the problem. “I want everyone to be happy,” he says, sounding like the spirit of psychotropic big pharma. And when he finally places Stevie and Elliot in a dream that will heal their parents’ split and make everyone’s lives perfect again, that’s the problem: It’s only a dream. Do they want to live inside a feel-good illusion? That should have probably been the film’s premise rather than just another anything-goes gambit. “In Your Dreams,” minus the closing credits, is only 77 minutes long, and it packs in a great deal of frenetic dreamscape pageantry, but I wish there were more of an imaginative heft to it. It’s like the surface of a Pixar movie without the engine of ingenuity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday afternoon to celebrate the exit of the BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the CEO of News, Deborah Turness. The shocking step-downs came days after BBC’s documentary program Panorama was accused of doctoring Trump’s Jan. 6 speech to make it look like he incited the Capitol riots.\n\n\t“The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th,” Trump wrote. “Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\t\n\n\tAs noted by Trump, The Telegraph put the network in hot water after publishing the details of a 19-page dossier on BBC bias by a former independent external advisor to the BBC’s standards committee. The report claimed that Panorama spliced together footage that made Trump “‘say’ things [he] never actually said.” One of the Panorama sound bites shows Trump declaring he would march with his supporters to the Capitol and “fight like hell,” when he actually told them to “peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”\n\n\tIn an exit note to BBC staff, Davie wrote, “Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility.”\n\t\n\n\tTurness, in her own statement, said she had “taken the difficult decision that it will no longer be my role to lead you in the collective vision that we all have: to pursue the truth with no agenda.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBob Broder was allergic to small talk. In his heyday as one of the industry’s top literary agents, he was known as “Darth Broder.” He loved to ski. He loved to play poker, make fig jam and smoke cigars. And he loved his family and his golden retrievers with all his heart.\n\n\tThat is how Broder was remembered Saturday at a memorial service held at the Steven J. Ross Theater on the Warner Bros. lot, where he spent the last dozen years of his career as the business chief of Chuck Lorre Productions. Broder died Sept. 23 at the age of 85. The gathering of several hundred people reflected a who’s who of executives and leaders across the industry as well as longtime friends and family. More than a few rival agents came to pay their respects.\n\t\n\n\tLorre, the prolific showrunner and co-creator of “Two and a Half Men,” “The Big Bang Theory,” “Dharma & Greg” and a host of other shows, followed the powerful opening eulogy delivered by Rabbi Steven Z. Leder of Wilshire Boulevard Temple. With so many comedy writers on the bill, the Broder tribute was no somber affair. It was also full of revealing personal details about a man who was never accused of over-sharing. (Who knew Bob Broder managed snack bars on the beach in Santa Monica while he was in law school at UCLA?). As James Burrows, another longtime client observed, “He knew about the money; I knew about the funny.”\n\n\n\tIn addition to Lorre and Burrows, the other speakers were: Norman Kurland, his longtime business partner at the Broder Kurland agency; younger siblings Madelynn Broder Kopple and Bill Broder; Chris Silbermann of CAA, who reflected the generation of now-senior agents who learned the ropes at Broder Kurland; Eddie Gorodetsky, a writer-producer long associated with Lorre and one of Broder’s cigar buddies; Revata Bowers, former head of UCLA’s Center for Early Education, where Broder served as a trustee and board president; Tom Hoberman, a top entertainment lawyer and longtime friend; and, in closing, the “Cheers” trio of series co-creators Glen Charles and Les Charles, who were longtime Broder clients, and star Ted Danson.\n\t\n\n\tHere is Chuck Lorre’s tribute to Broder in full. His opening line got one of the biggest responses in a memorial full of laughs, because it was so true. “Bob would have gotten me out of this,” he deadpanned.\n\n\tMy name is Chuck Lorre. Bob Broder, aka Darth Boder, was my agent for 25 years, my business partner for 12 and my friend for oh gosh, I gotta say six, seven months…not in a row. Bob liked to tell people that he worked for me, but we both know that wasn’t true. Broder worked for me the same way a zookeeper works for the monkeys.\n\n\tThose of you who know me know I’m somewhat emotional in my behavior, and let’s say anger is my sweet spot, righteous indignation my happy place. And I think we can all agree that Bob Broder was none of those things. He was always calm, judicious, analytical, not to mention ferociously smart. As a result, every time we disagreed on something which happened a lot, I was wrong. I was wrong so often it got to where I knew I was wrong as the words were coming out of my mouth, I could look at Bob and actually see him trying to not roll his eyes. To make matters worse, he’d always let me spin out ranting and raving about some high-class injustice I was forced to suffer, like when we negotiated a new overall deal with Warner Bros. He waited till I was done spewing then slowly and patiently explained why it was wrong for me to call overhead of distribution charges the skim.\n\n\tOne of my fondest memories, I flipped out over a profit participation statement. He tried to calm me down by explaining how Warner Bros. and Fox and Disney, basically all the production companies, played a game called Legally Steal Money from your partners and how it wasn’t his job to stop the game. It was his job to limit the grift to an acceptable number. Or, as he so succinctly put it, Chuck, they’re gonna fuck you. I’m just gonna make sure they bring some lube. His words, not mine.\n\n\tI still argue with Bob, only now the arguments are in here [points to his head], and the results are the same. I’m still wrong. That’s OK. Instead of getting upset, I’ve learned to pause to breathe and ask myself, What would Broder do? And you know what he tells me? In fact, he has been telling me for 25 years, not by lecturing or being pedantic, but by the way he behaved, the way he carried himself, the way he treated people in business. In town dominated by egos he seemingly had none. He always was the grown up in the room which created a safe space for the children. And by children I mean me, and if he smoked enough pot, Jimmy Burrows, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It was right there. \n\t\n\n\tBob was beloved by all who knew him. He was a wildly successful literary agent, good father, loving husband, trusted friend, tough but fair production executive, great skier and a world class poker player. The only thing he couldn’t do is chit-chat. If, after completing the business of a phone call, I said, “Hey, did you see that episode of ‘Succession’ last night?” His response would be, “Goodbye.” If I felt the need to chit chat, I had to call Peter Roth.\n\n\tI was recently asked by somebody if I plan to replace Bob as the head of my company. My answer was, why would I do that? He’s here and he’s here [points to head and heart]. Thank you.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore there was the self-proclaimed Midwest Princess, there was the queen of Queens in New York. They came together in a glittery cosmic convergence Saturday night at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony as Chappell Roan formally inducted Cyndi Lauper, giving an earnest speech that touched on her own adoration for the honoree as a teenager and ongoing respect for her as one of pop’s most longstanding allies to the LGBTQ community.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInductee Cyndi Lauper and Chappell Roan speak onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWireImage\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Cyndi embodies every quality of an artist that I admire,” Roan said from the stage of L.A.’s Peacock Theatre. “She’s a born performer and a revolutionary songwriter, a forever fashion icon, and a fierce advocate and ally. And from the very beginning, she owned every ounce of who she was — the manic, panicked hair, all of those rad Fingerless gloves and those unbelievably layered, dynamic and one-of-a-kind vocals… Can I hear a little commotion for the vocals?”\n\t\n\n\tRoan looked back to Lauper’s impact at the very start of her nascent career: “One of Cyndi’s most inspiring songs to me personally is ‘True Colors.’ When I was 14 years old, I performed ‘True Colors’ at a talent show in my hometown in Missouri. That was my first time ever winning a competition for singing, and that has been so important to me ever since. ‘True Colors’ has gone on to be an anthem synonymous with love and acceptance in the LGBTQ+ community and beyond — a message that still stands the test of time.”\n\t\n\n\n\tLauper was as truly colorful as ever in that particular regard when she sang “True Colors” as part of a multi-artist performance segment in her honor, pausing the song as a vertical rainbow/pride flag unfurled from the top of the stage behind her, in a striking and pointed camera angle.\n\n\tIn her acceptance speech, Lauper thanked “my badass female band I always dreamed of having” — which, for this occasion, included guest drummer Gina Schock of the Go-Go’s — and then positioned herself as part of a middle generation in the history of women in rock.\n\n\t“So now to make a long story short…” she quipped. “Oops, too late for that. But I just want to say that I know that I stand on the shoulders of the women in the industry that came before me, and my shoulders are broad enough to have the women that come after me stand on mine. And the other thing that I thought was really important, which is why I really came here tonight, is to tell you that the little kid in me still believes that rock ‘n’ roll can save the world.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan and Cyndi Lauper arrive at the GBK Brand Bar & Meals On Me Backstage Lounge at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for GBK Brand Bar L\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRoan began her speech by saying: “I think we can all agree the best art comes from the most authentic people. When artists stay true to themselves, even when some people say they’re too much, too loud, too eccentric, or all of the above, that honesty becomes their greatest strength.” \n\n\tIn an awkward but charming moment, Roan came within an inch of dropping an F-bomb on Disney+ as she realized she was losing her place. “I f…” She stopped herself, explaining, “I messed up so bad by refusing to get contacts. Holy cow.”\n\n\tQuickly regaining her composure amid audience chuckles that will not be heard when an edited version airs on ABC New Year’s Day, Roan continued: \n\n\t“It’s that courage that not only creates incredible art, it gives everyone who experiences it the permission to be themselves. It opens their hearts, it changes their mind, and that is its power. Tonight, we honor a woman who redefined what a pop star could look like, sound like, sing like and be. A music legend whose authenticity has inspired us for the last four decades with her four-octave range, the amazingly fabulous Cyndi Lauper.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 08, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter extolling her heroine’s vocal prowess, Roan noted that “before the whole world knew that voice, Cyndi spent years singing in cover bands and working random jobs trying to find her way. And it wasn’t until her band Blue Angel that people in the business started to notice her. The band eventually broke up, but Cyndi finally got her much-deserved, well-earned, overdue break in 1983 when she released her debut solo album, ‘She’s So Unusual’,” which she said “marked a cultural shift and earned Cyndi the Grammy for best new artist… ‘Girls Just Want to Have Fun’ was more than a hit. The song became a global feminist anthem, and the video a touchstone for her unmistakable style. ‘Time After Time’ is arguably one of the greatest love ballads to ever exist, and the naughty ‘She Bop’ and her iconic rendition of ‘All Through the Night’ further cemented Cyndi’s status as a global superstar.” \n\n\tContinued Roan, “Over the time of her 12 album releases and more, Cyndi spread her magical musical wings that have her venturing outside of pop and into blues, country, jazz and even Broadway, for which she won a Tony. Some of her incredible accomplishments also happen outside of the studio. They happen when she advocates for gay rights before the U.S. Senate. They happen through her non-profit, True Colors United, fighting to the end — fighting to end homelessness among LGBTQ+ youth. And they happen when she paves the way for artists like me to freely express myself. Cyndi Lauper has shown us that you can be bold, quirky, loud, glamorous and have any hair color you want. She’s empowered generations, opening our hearts, our minds, and broadcasting the beautiful message that we have the power to be who we authentically are.”\n\n\tLauper started her own speech on a more irreverent note: “See what happens when you let the riff-raff in?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCyndi Lauper at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 08, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAmong those Lauper thanked were “my mom, who would’ve liked to be here because she wouldn’t have had to worry if I was gonna win or not,” and “all the record executives and producers that I worked with, and probably drove crazy — just ask them, some of them are sitting there right now — who had faith in me and created it with me.” Her kudos extended to “every band, including the cover band,” and her road crew and “the people that helped me string my dulcimer, which nobody was happy I was playing.”\n\t\n\n\"My shoulders are broad enough to have the women who come after me stand on mine.\" — Cyndi Lauper accepts her 2025 Rock Hall Induction and gives thanks to all the women who came before her.  #RockHall2025 pic.twitter.com/IKrHRSTduF— Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (@rockhall) November 9, 2025\n\n\n\tShe noted that, when she uses the R&R term for herself, she is thinking in terms of the same big tent that the Hall itself has used for years in bringing in acts from different genres under that attitudinal umbrella.\n\n\t“Rock ‘n’ roll is a big, wonderful quilt of a lot of different styles of music. Thank goodness,” she said. “And all of that music has influenced me and my work, and without it, I don’t know what kind of music I’d be making. So I just want to say, now of all times, let’s come together again and do good in the world because it needs us…\n\n\t“You know, I always was part of the rock ‘n’  roll community anyway. You just didn’t wanna talk to me because, you know, they thought I was a little crazy. I don’t know why. Anyway, all kidding aside, I love you. Thank you very much to the Rock Hall of Fame. I’m so happy you’re bringing women back in. There are a lot of us. And long live rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\n\n\tThe performance by Lauper that came near the end of the four-hour-plus proceedings included, besides the aforementioned rendition of “True Colors,” a duet with Raye on “Time After Time” and a climactic “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” that had Avril Lavigne trading lines on the verses and Salt-N-Pepa making a group cameo at the end.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCyndi Lauper and Brandi Carlile at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n",

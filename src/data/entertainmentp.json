    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 2 of “Stranger Things, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tIn one week, we’ll have all the answers. But for now, we’ve got a lot of questions.\n\n\tDuring the Christmas Day release of Volume 2 of “Stranger Things 5,” many key plot points were fleshed, and we received a lot of information heading into the series finale, dropping on Dec. 31. We learned things we never knew — like, that Eleven’s powers come from Henry’s blood, as transfused by Dr. Brenner, and that the Upside Down isn’t its own dimension, but instead is a wormhole connecting our world and Vecna’s, which Dustin has named the Abyss.\n\t\n\n\tAs we process “Shock Jock,” “Escape from Camazotz” and “The Bridge,” the latest “Stranger Things” episodes, we’ve rounded up the biggest burning questions ahead of the finale.\n\n\n\tBIG QUESTION: What is the ultimate importance of Nov. 6?\n\n\tIt’s the night Will Byers went missing in the series premiere in 2016, and it’s the night Vecna wants to enact his plan to use the children he’s kidnapped to bring the Abyss and Earth together — but why on this date? What was the significance in the first place that led Vecna to take Will?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAND, why does Vecna want to bring the Abyss and Earth together?\n\n\tIs he just a nihilist who wants to burn it all down at this point? Or is something else going on?SOMETHING WE’D LOVE TO KNOW: How did Hopper, El and Kali get out of the Upside Down?The Upside Down was in chaos, falling apart at the seams, and Nancy, Jonathan, Steve and Dustin were still stuck down there — but Hopper, El and Kali managed to get out off-screen. By the start of Episode 7, Hopper and the girls are back in Hawkins, but we don’t see how they managed to get out amid the chaos after Nancy shot a hole in the exotic matter barrier. What did they do to get back out?\n\n\tWHILE WE’RE AT IT: What blocked the Demogorgon from getting into the elevator to get Max and Lucas?\n\n\tThat Demo was coming right at them and when it jumped, something prevented it from getting through. And Karen Wheeler could only do so much in a day to save the kids, so what else was going on there?\n\t\n\n\tBIG QUESTION: What stopped the white goo from spreading in the Upside Down?\n\n\tNancy and Jonathan were saved from certain death in the Upside Down when the world stopped melting into white goo around them, and hardened enough that they could walk on it. While this happened just in time to keep the two alive — but not their relationship — it’s not clear what caused it all to stop and stabilize, as the Upside Down is still seemingly compromised after Nancy shot through the barrier.\n\n\tSOMETHING WE’D LOVE TO KNOW: Also, what happened to the ring?\n\n\tNo, it’s not that important, but it was flung on the floor and ultimately, it was what showed them that everything had hardened so… did someone pick it up?\n\n\tBIG QUESTION: Who is the man young Henry finds with the briefcase down in that mine shaft in the Nevada desert?\n\n\tFans who have seen the Broadway play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” will have a leg up on what is going on here, but it’s still largely a mystery. We know Henry had a traumatic experience in the desert as a child, after which he was never the same. “First Shadow” reveals Henry entered an alternate dimension, known as Dimension X, and returned after 12 hours with altered blood, a changed personality and psychokinetic powers. Who is the stranger Henry came across, what was he holding onto — and what exactly happened to Henry to make him into this darker person?\n\n\tBIG QUESTION: What is the connection between Dimension X, the Abyss and the Upside Down?\n\n\tWe now know the Upside Down is a wormhole that connects Earth to this other world Vecna inhabits, the Abyss. Vecna was banished to the Abyss at Hawkins Lab by El back when he was Henry/One. Despite their shared mistreatment from Brenner, El refused to join Henry in his plans for world domination and ripped a hole in reality that pushed him through to the Abyss. And Brenner, the other scientists and the military put up the exotic-matter barrier that stabilizes the Upside Down and separates the wormhole that goes between the Abyss and Earth from nothingness. And are the Abyss and Dimension X the same thing?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBIG QUESTION: Will Eleven sacrifice herself?\n\n\tAt the end of Episode 7, Kali told El that, for everyone’s benefit, they should kill themselves after defeating Vecna. It’s a sacrifice, Kali says, the two need to make so that the military cannot use their blood to try to create new kids like them, ending the cycle that began when Brenner gave Henry’s blood to pregnant women to create El, Kali and the other telekinetic kids at Hawkins Lab. But will El actually go through with that?\n\t\n\n\tBIG QUESTION: Will any main characters die in the finale?\n\n\tIn Episode 5, El got very angry with Hopper for having revealed that he would have tried to fight Vecna alone, and for wearing the suicide vest as a failsafe. But now she’s hiding her own secrets — from Hopper, and from everyone — about Kali’s plan. If Eleven does somehow make it out alive, doesn’t someone have to die, even if Matt Duffer told Variety that the show “is not Game of Thrones'”? (And will it be Hopper, in some incredibly noble way?)\n\n\tALSO: Is Will going to reveal his feelings to Mike?\n\n\tWill came out in Episode 7, and was embraced by support and love from his friends and family members. And he seems to accept himself for who he is, and, on Robin’s advice, not to rely on reciprocated feelings from someone to feel validated. But does that mean Will won’t have a more direct conversation with Mike about his crush before the end of the series? And if he does, how will Mike react to it? (Also, not that Mike understood this slight, but was it kind of mean for him to refer to Mike as his Tammy?)\n\n\tBIG QUESTION: How much will Max be able to get inside Henry’s head?\n\n\tAfter Max died and was brought back to life in the Season 4 finale, her physical body was in a Hawkins hospital — but her mind was in the Abyss with Henry, in Vecna’s mindspace. As Max makes it clear to Holly, she’s spent the past 18 months exploring that terrain as she successfully hid from him. She knows he’s afraid of the cave, and that he has vulnerabilities. As they gear up for their final battle with Vecna, Max tells Eleven to call upon her so they can use that knowledge against him.\n\n\tAND FINALLY: Will Nancy and Steve end up together?\n\n\tLet’s end with some silliness. Now that Nancy and Jonathan have called it quits, does this pave the way for Steve to get his dream of having a bunch of little nuggets with his ex? Just because “Jancy” is over and she said nothing was really there with Steve, we all saw the chemistry. At the very least, it does open a door that has been firmly closed since Season 2.\n\n\tEmily Longeretta and Kate Aurthur contributed to this list.\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 2 spoilers• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 1 spoilers• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 2 of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tEver since “Stranger Things” first debuted on Netflix in 2016, it was evident that Noah Schnapp‘s Will Byers was different from his friends. His own father derisively called him queer, as his mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) recounts early in Season 1. And while he shared his friends’ affinity for playing Dungeons & Dragons, biking around town and geeking out on the latest pop-culture, fantasy or scientific phenomenon of the show’s 1980s setting, Will disappeared during the very first episode, setting the wide-eyed, bowl-cutted boy apart from the group.\n\t\n\n\tDespite his friends rescuing him from the Upside Down at the end of the first season, Will only grew more distinctive as the series continued. As his friends came of age and found girlfriends, he remained outside the group, not only from his traumatic abduction, but from a more elusive feeling of isolation. In Season 3, Mike (Finn Wolfhard) snaps at Will for not liking girls, which further sparked fan speculation regarding the character’s sexuality.\n\n\n\tThose speculations seemed to be confirmed, though never explicitly stated, in Season 4 when Will breaks down trying to profess his feelings toward Mike. However, it’s not until Season 5, Episode 7, “The Bridge,” when Will finally admits to his friends— “I don’t like girls.”\n\n\tThe emotional monologue rounding out the series’ penultimate episode is a powerful, touching and poignant delivery on Will’s highly anticipated coming out. It pays off on Will’s arc toward self-acceptance and assurance. While the character has spent much of the series as the victim, he takes center stage as a hero in Season 5, revealed to have sorcerer-like supernatural abilities in the season’s fourth episode that concluded Volume 1.\n\t\n\n\tThese triumphant moments also demonstrate Schapp’s growth as an actor over his 10 years playing Will. The coming out monologue is Schnapp’s most emotionally intense and verbose in the series. The performance is further accented by Schapp’s real-world relationship to the topic, having publicly come out as gay in 2023.\n\n\tVariety spoke with Schnapp to unpack the distinguished scene, how he shaped it with series creators Matt and Ross Duffer and director Shawn Levy and his feelings about closing the book on his decade-plus role in “Stranger Things.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAt what point did you find out that Will was going to come out in Season 5, Episode 7?\t\n\n\tYou know that it’s coming. This season, we read the first six episodes together, and I was like “OK, it didn’t happen yet, so it’s going to be in Episode 7 or 8,” which hadn’t been written yet. So then from January of filming on through the year, I kept texting the Duffers, “Is it done? Did you write it? Is it in 7 or 8? How are you gonna write it?” Eventually, they said they had it, and I read it by the end of the year in August or September. And I was just in tears. It was perfect.\n\t\n\t\tDid you get the opportunity to workshop the script with the Duffers or with Shawn Levy, who directed “The Bridge” with the Duffers?\t\n\n\tI was worried that I might need to, but honestly, it was perfect. I really had no notes about it.\n\t\n\t\tDo you recall your co-stars’ reactions the first time that you rehearsed the scene, or did a table read? Shawn Levy told us that the reactions on camera were genuine.\t\n\n\tHonestly, I was so wrapped up in my emotions and what I was feeling that I kind of blocked out everyone around me. I kind of had to because it was so nerve-racking to know that the entire cast was there watching me. I had Winona next to me, and the boys and Maya [Hawke] around me. It was all a blur. I don’t really remember anyone’s reactions, but watching it back, it was nice to see. It did feel genuine.\n\t\n\t\tHow many takes did you do of the scene?\t\n\n\tOh my God, it was endless. It was like a 12-hour day of just that monologue. And we weren’t even done after the 12-hour day. We came back a week later to reshoot certain parts of the scene for another 12 hours. It was like, “Oh my God, how many more times can I do this scene?” But it was also nice because it allowed me to try so many different things. I never felt stuck to anything. I got advice from Maya on how to prepare for it, because there were so many lines, more lines than I’d ever had before. Maya speaks like a madman so I asked, “How do you learn all these lines and not think about it in the scene?” She said, “It’s not about how well you know it, it’s how long you’ve known it for, so just prep for months before.” So I’d just go through it morning and night every day for months before shooting, but I wouldn’t prep how to say it or how to feel. It would just be plain saying the lines out loud with no emotion, just to sink it in. But then on the day, I was able to explore the feelings and emotions, and it was fun to have those 12 hours to play and feel. The cast was so gracious. I’ll never forget how supportive they were on that day and how respectful and giving they were to me, because they had to sit there through an entire night just hearing me ramble. They were supporting me on all these angles where they weren’t even caught on camera. They could have gone and sat in Video Village or hung out, but they all sat there in their spots through the whole day. It was really special.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIn those 12 hours of takes, did you film versions of the scene that are different from what ended up in the final cut?\t\n\n\tThere were so many different choices in the different takes. I remember being asked, “Do you want to do your close up first or do you want to do it at the end of the day?” Because that was the most important shot. So I could either start with a wide and kind of explore it and feel out the scene and then go to the close up, or go straight into it. I was really struggling with whether I was ready to bang it out first or get comfortable before it. I decided last minute, “Let’s just start with the close up. I’m ready to go and I just want to do it.” And then it was like one of the first takes of the day, and that was most of the meat of the scene. It was so nice because it hadn’t been exhausted yet. It was real and raw and I’m glad I did it that way.\n\t\n\t\tWas there anything that surprised you in the final cut of the scene and the way it was edited?\t\n\n\tLiterally for every scene, I’m like “Oh I didn’t expect that.” You don’t realize the power of editing and how it can change a scene. For this scene, it was nice because there were moments where I tried the first paragraph of the monologue to the boys where it was a lot more sad, and then there were times when I was a lot more happy reliving the memories with them. I’m glad that they edited it the way they did, where it’s nice to see him not just sob through the whole scene, but kind of smile through the memories and give that lighter feel. It makes it hit harder.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s interesting that Will says “I don’t like girls” rather than “I’m gay.” How was that wording decided on? Was there fear about being too explicit, or do you think Will is still sort of figuring out his identity?\t\n\n\tYeah, I noticed that and I spoke to the Duffers about it specifically. We have to remember that its the 1980s. When I came out, I didn’t say the word “gay.” It’s hard, and it feels scary to say it. In the ’80s, I can’t imagine how much more pressure there was and how much more there was to lose. When Will is first coming to terms with it in front of his friends, he’s probably scared to use that word, but there’s nothing wrong with it. I think he just felt more comfortable phrasing it that way.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo you think discovering that he’s a sorcerer has given Will the confidence to embrace what makes him different? How has discovering Will’s newfound power changed your approach to the character?\t\n\n\tI think it helps him accept himself, and you totally see it from the beginning of the season. He’s kind of more assertive and self-assured. It’s nice to play that side of him, and not just play someone who’s always walked all over. Even with the coming out scene, having that much dialogue and actually getting to express myself through my words, which this character has never really done until then, was so nice.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tA lot of those scenes you share with Winona Ryder. What was it like working so closely with her this final season after having played her son for almost a decade?\t\n\n\tIt was really special. I was kind of sad in Seasons 3 and 4 that I got separated from her, and I really missed working with her. She’s one of my favorite scene partners and people, and it was so nice to be with her for most of this season. I feel so comfortable around her, and it was hard to say goodbye. I didn’t expect to have such trouble letting go of her on that last day. I didn’t want to let her go, and I realized she really became this motherly figure to me at work during these 10 years.\n\t\n\t\tYou also share a lot of scenes with Maya Hawke this Season. How was collaborating with her?\t\n\n\tWe definitely got closer. I’d barely spoken to Maya before then. I mean, I don’t even think we were friends. Now, we spent the whole season together, and she’s part of my little “Stranger Things” family.\n\t\n\t\tLastly, you had the ability to collaborate with younger actors this season. For so long, you and the main ensemble were the youngest people on the show. What was it like to now have new rising actors on set who might have looked up to you?\t\n\n\tIt definitely helped me realize, “Wow, we’ve come so far. We’re not kids anymore.” They’re looking to us. You always feel like you don’t know anything and you have so much more to learn, but then it makes you realize that we’ve spent 10 years here, and we do have some experience now. It was nice to get to work with them and they were so cute. They just brought this childlike energy that reminded us that we were still kids too. I was making handshakes with them and I felt like I was 12 years old again. It was so fun.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 2 spoilers• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 1 spoilers• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was a holiday-tastic mix of Snoop Dogg‘s greatest hits and Christmas favorites that livened up Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium during the halftime break for Netflix‘s Christmas Day telecast of the NFL’s Detroit Lions game against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\tSnoop Dogg, Lainey Wilson and Huntr/x of “Kpop Demon Hunters” fame brought their own brand of Christmas cheer to the event. Martha Stewart introduced the “Snoop’s Holiday Halftime Party” segment with a Snoop Dogg spin on “Twas the Night Before Christmas,” with lines such as, “Fans forgot about their beef, because gin and juice filled the air.”\n\t\n\n\tSnoop entered the arena in a fire engine-red double breasted suit topped by a long red coat with fuzzy red trim. He walked through a clever medley of his signature hits, starting with “The One and Only,” that shifted into “My Favorite Things” and then into “Nuthin’ But a ‘G’ Thang.” He was backed by a small orchestra that assembled on the gridiron, along with energetic dancers dressed in suits that suggested candy canes. A high-energy marching band and drummers added to the wall of sound presented.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSnoop Dogg performs U.S. Bank Stadium on Dec. 25, 2025, in Minneapolis. (Julian Dakdouk/Netflix via AP Content Services)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJulian Dakdouk/Netflix via AP Content Services\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere was some chatter online about the weak audio quality on Snoop’s vocals for telecast viewers. The challenge of delivering strong sound in a live broadcast was probably compounded by the fact that Snoop moved all over the stage and field during his performance.\n\n\tSnoop was joined after a few minutes by Huntr/x, the trio of singers behind Netflix’s smash hit “Kpop Demon Hunters” movies, for a pop take on “The 12 Days of Christmas.” \n\t\n\n\tCountry star Lainey Wilson then joined the scene in a white sleigh for a spirited rendition of “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.” Beloved Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli came out with his son, Matteo, to close out the show with a powerful duet on “White Christmas.” The elder and younger Bocelli were, of course, joined at the end by Snoop, Wilson and Huntr/x in classic network TV special closing number form.\n\n\tThis marks the second year that Netflix has carried two Christmas Day NFL games with a high-profile musical performance in between. Last year the appearance by Beyoncé added superstar status to Netflix’s inaugural “Christmas GameDay” telecast. This year, Snoop Dogg and friends, which included rising singer Tonio Armani, provided a modern spin on a feel-good, sing-along musical Christmas event. The segment closed with a cuddly picture of Snoop surrounded by his many children and grandchildren, all wearing holiday pajamas.\n\n\tEarlier Thursday, Netflix carried the first of its two games, in which the Dallas Cowboys beat the Washington Commanders 30-23, in Washington.\n\n\t(Pictured top: Lainey Wilson and Snoop Dogg)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSnoop Dogg performs the halftime show during the game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions at U.S. Bank Stadium on Dec. 25.

    "body": "\n\tIn the new film “Marty Supreme,” a fondly remembered legend of the screen is attempting a comeback. This actress, still resplendent, emerges onstage and receives a round of applause, a bit of homage from an audience that knew her years before, and is waiting to see what she can do now — how time has changed her. To this point, we’ve seen her deny her ambitions, as well as her lust for the film’s title character: She’s too composed to give herself away. Now, though, the audience cannot see her face as she turns her back on them, but the camera follows her and so we can. She has burst into the gladdest grin, remembering, all at once, what the attention of the crowd felt like.\n\t\n\n\tThe performer is Kay Stone, a fictional mid-century star who’s receded into private life. And the performer playing her is Gwyneth Paltrow, whose very public life has, for years now, not made room for acting. To see Paltrow at work is to be reminded of what a vital and urgent screen presence she is, how alive she manages to be in every moment and how adept she is at showing the way her characters hide that vividity behind shades of cool. It’s also to be aware that perhaps Paltrow needed the time away to conjure a performance quite this majestic.\n\n\n\tPaltrow made no secret of her ambivalence about acting after becoming a mother; her business interests, in the form of her Goop suite of media entities and products (kicked off with a newsletter in 2008), have allowed her to more proactively define her brand, and what roles she’s held on to have plainly not been that exciting anyhow. (She practically seems to delight in going viral when, in various on-camera interviews, she can’t remember appearing in various Marvel films.) Many actresses, past 40, find opportunities drying up. As if to pre-empt the question, Paltrow stepped away from the set and found opportunities elsewhere.\n\t\n\n\tThat choice compels us in other ways. Many people who are not inherently interested in wellness culture, or in self-help jargon, or in a woo-woo redefinition of the concept of “divorce” as “conscious uncoupling,” got on board the Goop train, at least as gawkers. I reserve judgment on whether the ideas Goop puts forward are valid. They’re interesting to the onlooker because the figure speaking about them has that Paltrovian assurance and composure.\n\n\tBut while Paltrow has been making her way in the world of business, something’s been missing on-screen. The passionate anger thrumming under Margot Tenenbaum’s seen-it-all glare in “The Royal Tenenbaums”; the lust for life Viola de Lesseps must tamp down under boy drag in “Shakespeare in Love”; the slowly dawning repulsion Marge Sher- wood struggles to hide in “The Talented Mr. Ripley”: Those weren’t flukes. They were proof of Paltrow’s particular interest in playing with the concept of concealment, of showing us just how hot her blood can run under the hauteur. The defining pre-Goop image of Paltrow in the public imagination is of her facade breaking while accepting an Oscar. Done up in princessy Ralph Lauren, she openly, loudly wept: The passion underlying the pink couture is what she’s shown us in movies too.\n\n\tThat’s also at work in “Marty Supreme,” and perhaps it’s no wonder the script appealed to Paltrow. By contrast to the frosty but secretly yearning Kay Stone, Timothée Chalamet’s Marty Mauser is all bravado, pushing his career as a table-tennis player forward through his insistence that he is destined for the pantheon. (Marty, too, makes for a metatextual meal for the actor playing him — Chalamet is as un-shy about his ambition for himself as any star currently working.)\n\n\tTheir pairing is one of opposites: Marty seems, for much of the film, resistant to the idea of an inner life. Life, for him, is meant to be lived aloud. Kay, though, has been seasoned enough by the Hollywood system and life’s disappointments to know just how much of herself to keep in reserve. And so when Paltrow lets loose and shows us the flare of uncontrollable emotion undergirding Kay’s careful control, we who have missed this talent of hers are powerless to do anything but mirror the audience on-screen, and let out a cheer.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristmas albums still have a bit of a stigma among fans of higher-cred artists. It can be difficult, first, to overcome the expectation that they’re either cash grabs or sops to sentimentality, and secondly, to come up with an original take on seasonal music, even with the best intentions. Should an artist deign to embark on a full-on Christmas music tour, suspicions might be even more aroused. What, other than opportunism, could be the reason for that much devotion to the season?\n\t\n\n\tSo God bless the occasional singer-songwriter like Ben Folds who sees Christmas as a way into writing the kinds of songs he would usually write, not just for the purposes of a new album but a proper concert outing. His recently wrapped Tis the Season tour was a veritable Christmas Star in shining a light on the right path to undertake doing this kind of thing, as was the album of mostly original material that precipitated it, 2024’s archly titled “Sleigher.” Folds brings to the concert state a satisfyingly holistic approach to holiday music, give or take a couple of “ho’s.”\n\n\n\tEven before Folds recorded “Sleigher,” there was a body of solid evidence that he was the right man for the task. That was the fact that he’d already written and recorded a number of songs that mention Christmas or the holidays either prominently or incidentally — prior tunes that, combined with the “Sleigher” material, easily added up to a full set, before getting to any non-seasonal numbers thrown in as bonus tracks for the encore. Most notable of these, as any fan would know, is his late ’90s hit “Brick,” a ballad about taking one’s girlfriend to get an abortion on Dec. 26. Once you’ve written that as your first “Christmas song,” you’ve established a fine outer parameter for how far you’re willing to stretch the genre, such as it is. \n\t\n\n\tAt one of two sold-out appearances at L.A.’s new Blue Note Cafe, where he was among the few non-jazz artists booked thus far in the young life of that club, Folds and his combo naturally performed “Brick,” along with a few other pre-existing holiday songs that tended toward that outer edge, like the novelty songs “Bizarre Christmas Incident” and the indelicately titled “Bitch Went Nutz.” But being subversive about Christmas is not actually really his thing, or his current thing, anyway. And the “Sleigher” album, despite its irreverent name, tends more toward the center, with earnest songs that aren’t afraid to at least skim sentiment, if not indulge in it, even if the sentiment is loneliness. In the overall course of the set, Folds was able to play Christmas for comedy, but more often than not came up for something more earnest, all the way to covering Mel Torme and Vince Guaraldi without apology.\n\n\tRight at the outset, he explained why he came to see the season as a meaningful setting for original songs.\n\n\t“I like a good rhyme, and that’s why I guess I’ve bothered to write a whole Christmas album, plus a few other songs in my past,” he told the Blue Note audience. “There were Christmas songs and a whole slew of songs that mention it” in his catalog, “and I think the reason is because it is so all-pervasive once a year. It is such a bully of a holiday — it takes over everything. It’s the holiday that’s too big to fail. And it’s the same shit every year. It’s the same colors, the same sights, sounds, songs, everything… same ads… And that’s the gift.”\n\n\tHe would have to further explain that, and did. \n\n\t“Because when everything is the same and it just feels like a continuation of yesterday, which was 2024, and the day before that was Christmas 2023, the only thing that’s changed is you. And I think that’s the reason I’ve been interested in the topic. You could be at at dinner at Christmas and realize that only two days in Christmas time ago, there were a couple people that used to be here that are not here anymore. And then you’re sitting and talking to nephews who weren’t even here what seems like a couple days ago, and now they’re bald and telling you about their bankruptcy. It’s crazy. So, by having that as a marker, it makes it a rhyme. That’s what a rhyme is for. It is at the end of a phrase or a couplet to sound the same. Everything seems like it ought to be same, but it’s a little bit different; you actually learned something in the last 10 syllables.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Folds at the Blue Note\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMajor Caldwell IV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith that, he went into “Christmas Time Rhyme,” which, as he explained, was originally supposed to be the title track of his holiday album last year, before “I thought of ‘Sleigher’ and I thought, ‘Man, I gotta use that. That’s better.'” It’s a lovely song tracing those noble thoughts about cyclical thoughts and time speeding up and slowing down and putting us back down where we were, the same and different. And it also puts that poetry aside to cut to the chase: “Precious moments like these, they mean the world to me/ Listen, you’re all fuckin’ freaks, but we’re family / So we do what it takes to be in one place, if just for a day.”\n\n\n\n\n\tAlong with the more familiar cover chestnuts that also peppered his set, Folds introduced his audience to “You Don’t Have to Be a Santa Claus (When Christmas Comes Around),” a fairly obscure oldie dating back at least to 1955, when the Mills Brothers recorded it. (Folds said it was written during the Great Depression.) “I thought it might be relevant these days because it’s about how you might think about helping someone out on other days besides Christmas, and that at the time was a controversial statement, like it is now, to help someone else out.”\n\n\tCloser to home, he got at what it’s like to be truly solitary at Christmas — or at least other than the companionship of a pet — with his original “Maurice,” written in Nashville in “one of those really everything-looks-the-same sort of suburban neighborhoods that’s not that inspiring. And all the neighbors had the same exact Christmas decorations in their front yard — an inflatable Santa that’s about two stories high and an inflatable reindeer next door; every House down the street almost had the same thing in the front of the yard. Maurice fucking hated the reindeer. He said so many inappropriate things to them in their reindeer language… Our yard was right next to I-40, which comes out here too. And Maurice would dig holes in the snow, and I sort of imagined he was trying to dig a path out.”\n\n\tThe funnier songs of the past had their own stories. “Bitch Went Nutz” was about a young, conservative lawyer on the rise inviting a liberal barista to be his date at the office Christmas party, only to have her wind up in a screaming political argument with his right-wing colleagues. “Bizarre Christmas Incident” was written as his first misguided attempt at an end-titles theme for “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”; he regaled the Blue Note audience with the tale of how horror-stricken the music supervisor was when he turned it in: “Ben Folds, it’s a fucking kids movie. I’m not showing this to Ron Howard!” He then followed that in concert with the much more appropriate song he turned around in the next 24 hours that successfully made it into the movie, “Lonely Christmas Eve.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tMost plaintive was a song he co-wrote with Nick Hornby, “Picture Window,” about the celebrated novelist and his wife spending New Year’s Eve with their chronically ill son in a London hospital room. The refrain: “You know what hope is? / Hope is a bastard, hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease / Hope comes near you / Kick its backside / Got no place in days like these.” The holiday season doesn’t get any more sobering than that, notwithstanding the Blue Note’s drink minimum.\n\n\tWhat do you do after that full spectrum of holiday fare than sing “The Christmas Song”? Along with, come the encore, unseasonal chestnuts from his own catalog, like “Philosophy,” from his more keyboard-pounding Ben Folds Era, before circling back to Charlie Brown with “Christmas Time Is Here,” sung by duet partner Lindsey Craft, to send the audience out into the non-chill on a note of buzzed tranquility.\n\n\tFolds remains one of our most reliable songwriters, so it’s not surprising that his Christmas material would be as solid as the rest — and that he, unlike most of his contemporaries, would recognize that the mass audience’s hunger for seasonal songs is something worth sating. Because, if nothing else, it does represent a twelfth of our lives, give or take. He has a song called “Sleepwalking Through Christmas,” but it’s to his credit he doesn’t sleepwalk through the task of coming up with this stuff. Here’s hoping for “Sleigher 2” and a perennial touring season.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRukmini Vasanth is having a moment. Fresh off Rishab Shetty‘s blockbuster “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1,” the Indian actor has Yash‘s “Toxic” and a Prashanth Neel film with NTR Jr. on deck, and her approach is clear: women with agency who make decisive choices.\n\n\tThe Royal Academy of Dramatic Art graduate, who gained recognition for her nuanced work in the critically acclaimed “Sapta Sagaradaache Ello” films (2023) opposite Rakshit Shetty, tells Variety that her performance as Kanakavathi in Rishab Shetty’s mythological prequel was carefully architected from the start. \n\t\n\n\tSet centuries before the events of the 2022 sleeper hit, “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1” follows the conflict over sacred forest land, with Vasanth’s character harboring secret ambitions that ultimately drive the narrative. The pivotal nature of her role was established from her first meeting with Shetty and his writing team of Anirudh Mahesh and Shanil Guru, with the character’s carefully concealed motivations and dramatic reveal integral to the film’s structure from the beginning.\n\n\n\t“When Sir [Rishab Shetty] called me in for my first narration with him, and he told me upfront that this is all going to hinge on this girl’s sudden twist and the deep-held desire of hers to take over this land that she doesn’t reveal until the last moment,” Vasanth says. “That was very much planned, and that was something that I walked into fully aware of from the first meeting.”\n\n\tThe actor acknowledges the responsibility was daunting, particularly given the massive success of the first “Kantara” film. However, the prequel’s distinct historical setting and visual identity helped establish different audience expectations.\n\t\n\n\t“From all the material that the film’s team had released, audiences were kind of prepared for the fact that this is a very different world that we’re going into,” she explains. “It’s not the same 1990s Kundapura that we had seen in the previous film. This is a very different world, and I think that leveling of the ground helped me because I didn’t feel as if people were expecting to see a certain kind of character.”\n\n\tBringing her London drama school training to bear, Vasanth discusses the challenge of calibrating performance style to match the scale of “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1” while maintaining emotional authenticity – a marked departure from her breakthrough work in Hemanth M. Rao’s “Sapta Sagaradaache Ello” films, which she describes as prizing silence and spaces within dialogue and interaction.\n\n\t“One of the beautiful things that I’ve been able to learn over my career is which style and where it belongs,” she says. “In the world of ‘Kantara: Chapter 1,’ some of the more restrained stuff can look too subtle to register because the scale is so large that you need to be able to match that scale.”\n\n\tVasanth uses a vivid analogy to explain her approach to calibrating performance. “You kind of need to regulate what is needed of you,” she says. “It’s like speaking – in a quiet living room, you can afford to whisper, but if you’re in the tube, you need to shout a little bit.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRukmini Vasanth – “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHombale Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe actor credits her disciplined approach to her background, with a father in the military and a mother who is a dancer. However, she emphasizes that her time at drama school was where she truly internalized the necessity of preparation and consistency.\n\n\t“The discipline and preparation gives you the ability to show up regardless of what the outside variables may be,” Vasanth says. “You can’t really be too precious about the kinds of environments that you require in order to put out a good performance for a film that deserves that.”\n\n\tShe describes the challenging production conditions on “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1,” with constant rain and limited shooting windows. “You’d have the crew members carrying these giant rigs up and down a hill. So at that point you can’t really be like, it doesn’t feel right to me. You just have to get on with it and do it as well as you possibly can.”\n\t\n\n\tLooking at her filmography, Vasanth has gravitated toward characters who are emotionally decisive, even when constrained by circumstances. She attributes this pattern to what makes for compelling storytelling.\n\n\t“Characters that make decisions, that may not be the right ones necessarily or the wrong ones, but that make decisions of some kind, and then that pulls the story along – I think I know what to do in those moments,” she says. “It’s just women with some sort of agency doing things.”\n\n\tVasanth’s upcoming projects include “The Elder One” director Geethu Mohandas’ highly anticipated “Toxic” opposite “K.G.F” star Yash, and a film with “Salaar” and “K.G.F” filmmaker Prashanth Neel featuring “RRR” lead NTR Jr. \n\n\tOf “Toxic,” she says that it has challenged her in unprecedented ways. “It’s unlike anything that I’ve taken on before, which has equal doses of nerves to see how it unfolds,” she says. “The working style has been really, really fascinating and very different from anything I’ve encountered. The way that Yash Sir and Geethu approach this film, the scripts, the way that we’ve gone about shooting has been an incomparable experience for me.”\n\n\tAs for working with Neel and NTR Jr., she praises their continued enthusiasm for the craft. “It’s always very lovely when you work with people who come with such a strong body of work, but are very unencumbered by whatever that may have brought. You still see the sense of play and the sense of enjoyment.”\n\n\tOn the topic of pan-India casting, Vasanth suggests the label is more relevant to the commercial side of cinema than the creative. She points to historical precedents, including actor-director V. Ravichandran’s multi-industry production “Shanti Kranti” (1991). \n\n\t“I think pan-India films have been happening. They’ve been attempted for a really long time,” she says. “Those are just labels and actors have been working across multiple industries all the time. We’re all very lucky that it’s successful and lucrative also now.”\n\n\tVasanth is now working across multiple South Indian film industries, with upcoming projects in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu cinema, representing a new generation of actors operating fluidly across linguistic markets. She declined to comment on reports of a collaboration with director Mani Ratnam.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “The Cottage,” the Season 1 finale of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry”",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “The Cottage,” the Season 1 finale of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” finally took its hockey lover boys to the cottage, and everything has changed.\n\n\tIn the Season 1 finale of HBO Max’s smash-hit romance, Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rosanov (Connor Storrie) settled in for two weeks at Shane’s remote cottage, and immediately made a pact. For the first time in their more-than-a-decade-long history, they would use their uninterrupted alone time to tell each other the truth about how they feel. No more burying their emotions or expressing them in a language the other can’t understand –– no matter how beautiful Ilya’s Russian revelation was in Episode 5.\n\t\n\n\tIt didn’t take long for them to make good on that promise. Ilya teased Shane about maybe marrying his best friend, Svetlana (Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova), or another woman so as not to blow their cover. But then he admitted he had a problem –– none of those women were Shane. Shane, in turn, pulled an all-nighter churning out a plan for them to slowly ease the world into the idea of their relationship, starting with Ilya joining the Ottawa team to be closer to him in Montreal, and then they would co-found a charity to start melting the supposedly frigid animosity between them. It was a long-game plan, but the mere mental gymnastics of trying to set up their future together moved Ilya to tears, and left him coughing up those three words–– “I love you.” Shane immediately reciprocated it with lightning-fast urgency, obliterating one of the last barriers between them.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHudson Williams, Connor Storrie, Dylan Walsh and Christina Chang \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom there, the tenor of their cottage getaway changed, and ultimately felt more romantic than ever. That is, until Shane’s dad, David (Dylan Walsh), walked in on them kissing and fled before his son could explain. Shane had put off telling his parents about being gay or loving his archrival. But now, Shane and Ilya both went to see David and Yuna (Christina Chang) to break the news. It was a tough pill to swallow, but not because they don’t approve of their son. Rather, it completely shatters his hockey-loving parents’ 10-year-plus belief they hated each other. Instead, they finally see two young men, who have been crazy about each other since rookie year (or rather, the summer before!), now sitting at the Hollanders’ dinner table as a couple. Ilya even comforts Shane in a moment of panic by calling him his boyfriend, a simple but monumental step for Hollanov, as the internet has dubbed them.\n\n\tSeason 1 ends as the boys drive back to their refuge away from the world, staring down a beautiful sunset that hides everything that waits on the other side of their cottage chapter, which will play out in an already-ordered Season 2. That’s a little different from the conclusion of Rachel Reid’s book, on which the series is based, in which they launch their foundation to lay the groundwork for the future. However, series creator/writer/director Jacob Tierney wanted something more romantic for his final shot, just in case the series didn’t become the phenomenon that it has.\n\n\t“I wanted to leave the viewer with what the book left me with emotionally, which was the warm, fuzzy feeling of them getting to be happy together,” Tierney tells Variety. “I thought of doing something with just a bit of elegance, and there’s a simplicity to the two of them in a car, driving off into the sunset, and not over a cliff. That was all I ever wanted out of this story.”\n\n\tBelow, Tierney tells Variety about how he pulled the much-anticipated cottage episode together; whether fan-favorite couple Scott (François Arnaud) and Kip (Robbie GK) will play a bigger role in Season 2 — and why he thinks women have gravitated toward this unabashedly queer love story between two men.\n\t\n\t\tThere are some things that happen at the cottage in Rachel Reid’s book that aren’t here in the finale. Shane and Illya playing against each other in Shane’s hockey training facility, and a pretty explosive oral sex scene that could have been an homage to the beginning of “Queer As Folk.” How did you figure out what would make the cut for your version for this chapter for Shane and Ilya?\t\n\n\tI wanted to make sure we were still on the same journey with them, and still learning things about them. If we are talking specifically about the sex scenes in the book, they’d eaten ass in Episode 2, so I didn’t really feel like I needed to hit that hard here. I wanted to make sure that we were still watching this change and evolve for them, and the sex that we were seeing this time around was more intimate, playful and sweet. And as evolved as it could be, particularly from the stuff that we were seeing in Episodes 1 and 2. Ultimately, the stuff that mattered to me at the cottage was the stuff that continued the journey of understanding them and their relationship. There was no set agenda. It ended up being the stuff I remember from reading it, if I’m being honest.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBy the end of the episode, they have learned to better communicate with each other. Not perfectly, but previously sex was their only means of doing that. Does that mean you envision less sex in Season 2, and more sitting on the couch scrolling their phones and touching toes now that they can use their words more efficiently?\t\n\n\tOh, the touching toes! I love that scene. You know, Rachel talks a lot about the promise that I made to her to take her characters seriously. She takes them very seriously in “The Long Game,” and that doesn’t mean there’s no sex. There’s quite a bit of sex in “The Long Game.” But I think it functions differently in the second book, and that’s just what I want to do. The journey of this show, no matter how long it goes on for, will always be centered around the relationship between Shane and Ilya. Sex will always be a big part of it, like it is with any romantic relationship. But it’s really about continuing that progress of what happens after that first blush of love, what happens after you decide you’re in love and how do you sustain it? That’s a very adult question: “We love each other, and now what? Does that mean everything’s easy?” No, it does not. There’s loads of challenges that get thrown Shane and Ilya’s way. Beyond what’s in the books, I really don’t have an agenda besides that I love this couple and I love these characters, and I want to just hang out with them more and watch them grow more and watch them become better for each other.\n\t\n\t\tSince you loved the touching toes scene, was that something you planned ahead of time or was it a choice you and Hudson and Connor made in the moment while filming?\t\n\n\tNo, that was planned. What I really wanted to be part of the cottage episode was that, when you’re in a relationship, you’re just doing things like being on your phones at the same time. I want them to live in the real world, and to do those little things that people do when they are in a relationship, because Shane and Ilya are. They can’t always be fucking. God knows, that’s just exhausting! I just wanted to capture little normal couple moments and I don’t think I’m the only one in a relationship who occasionally sits on a couch scrolling on our phones separately and then showing our partner what we are seeing.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIt certainly shows how far they have come since their fleeting hotel meetups. But there is still a little bit of Reid’s book that you don’t cover in the finale. In the book, months later they announce Shane’s big plan to start a foundation together, the first step in chipping away at their rivalry until they can come out as a couple. But your season ends with them riding home from Shane’s parents’ house in the car, just holding hands and laughing. Do you see Season 2 starting with that announcement, or was this your end to the first book?\t\n\n\tWell, books are so different from TV and I didn’t know if I was even going to get to make more of these. As much as I care about their charity and what they’re going to do, I don’t know that we need a bunch of exposition at the end of a season of TV like this. I wanted to leave the viewer with what the book left me with emotionally, which was the kind of warm, fuzzy feeling of them getting to be happy together. I thought of doing something with just a bit of elegance, and there’s a simplicity to the two of them in a car, driving off into the sunset, and not over a cliff. That was all I ever wanted out of this story.\n\n\tPart of the balancing act of the storytelling for me was always that you get this big moment with Scott and Kip in the last episode. It is this massive rom-com public declaration of love, and what I love about Shane and Ilya’s story is that you get another version of that kind of happiness, which is this small moment with the two of them just being allowed to be in love. That was the sweetest ending I could come up with for them, for now.\n\n\tSpeaking of Scott and Kip, there has been such an enthusiasm for them, maybe more than some people expected. Last week’s episode, which ended on Scott bringing Kip out on the ice to announce their relationship, now shares the top spot on IMDb’s list of the highest-rated episodes of television of all time. Does that encourage you to include more of their story in Season 2, or do you foresee keeping this format of seeing them when they intersect with Shane and Ilya?\n\n\tThis will continue to be Shane and Ilya’s story, and Scott and Kip will continue to intersect with them on occasion. But just because “Heated Rivalry” is Shane and Ilya’s story doesn’t mean that precludes potentially doing stuff with Scott and Kip outside of that specific show. We optioned all Rachel’s books, and part of the reason we did that was because, obviously, these characters appear throughout all the books. There’s a real richness to a lot of the stories there, and fans will know that Scott and Kip feature very strongly in “Common Goal.” They are all over the place. I don’t know exactly what we’re going to do yet, but there are places we could go with them that I would definitely be excited to explore.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIn the finale, we get a scene with Shane and his mom, Yuna, after he comes out. This is a bit of a change from the book, where the conversation is entirely between Shane, Ilya, Yuna and David. Why did you give Shane and his mom this separate moment?\t\n\n\tYuna is such a crucial character in the story. I know it’s not always on display in this season, but as fans of the books know, Yuna is such a big part of both Shane and Ilya’s lives moving forward. In trying to take this stuff seriously, I wanted to show complicated, interesting adult relationships here, and that includes the parents. It was just really important to me for Shane and Yuna to have a conversation. They needed to have a moment together. They’re obviously very close. They’re obviously very similar, and his mom has very similar blinders that he does. So there’s something really important about reminding people that even though we can hurt each other in these relationships, and they can be difficult, there is love and allyship there as well. Sometimes, it just requires a little conversation.\n\t\n\t\tThe queer community is understandably hooked by this show, but there has also been an intense embrace from female viewers, specifically straight women. Why do you think that is?\t\n\n\tI think that’s a very complicated question, and there are a lot of answers to it. Women love these books. These are books written by a woman. These are books largely consumed by women. So I wouldn’t want to speak on behalf of a female audience, but I think that what women are presented in romance is not always something that interests them in that way. I think that women are also, in real life and in culture, endlessly exposed to sexual violence. Seeing things like this, that are depictions ultimately of male vulnerability, can be very refreshing. From what I’ve heard, from the women who have written to me and Rachel and the boys, there’s a safety in seeing a woman being removed from the conversation. So you’re watching something happen between two men, and there is no fear of violence. There is no fear of things turning into stuff that women have to deal with too much in real life, and don’t want to deal with in their fantasies, and ultimately, this is a romantic fantasy. I think it’s also that maybe romance — which is a genre that women love and write and read and are the primary consumers of — just doesn’t get treated with a lot of respect. Nor do the people that make it, or those that adapt it either. So I think that they are responding to, at least I hope, the fact that we came to it pretty fullhearted, and as fans and as people who want to honor this material and want to honor the genre and make it as romantic as we can. That’s certainly what I wanted to do.\n\t\n\n\tEvery week, despite the soaring success of your show, you have had to respond to controversies and people wanting to tear it down. This week, Hudson responded to Deuxmoi’s comments about his personal life, and who he might be dating. But Deuxmoi also said the show has no plot and bad acting. What do you say to opinions like that?\n\n\tThis show wouldn’t work if any of that were true. I mean, it just wouldn’t. Nobody would give a shit about this if the acting was bad, or if there was no story. I think this is a show that actually requires you to pay attention. If you’re glib and you’re on your phone the whole time, or you’re looking to not pay attention, then God bless, and do whatever you want. But you have to be there in the moment if you want to watch. This is a show where there’s a lot of communication between the lines. It’s a lot about behavior. It’s a lot about watching. And if you don’t have the attention span for it or the interest, then I’m gonna be super honest with you. I could give a fuck what Deuxmoi’s criticism is of the show. I literally don’t even know who these people are. I don’t give a fuck what they think about anything. But I understand that, from what I have read multiple times now, people say this is a show that is not a co-viewing experience. You can’t be on your phone. If you wanna get what it’s doing, you have to pay attention to it. It’s definitely made to hold your attention. And if it doesn’t, then that’s a good criticism too. This is not for everybody, and that is A-OK. But I think at a certain point, the show speaks for itself, and the reaction to it speaks for itself, and there’s no way that these boys would be on the receiving end of the attention that they’re getting if they weren’t good. The papa bear in me does not like comments like this, obviously, because I know how hard they work. I think they’re fucking amazing. But we also live in a time where everybody gets their opinion, then they get to put it out on whatever platform they have, and so I get it. Keep doing your thing, Deuxmoi!\n\n\tLooking ahead to Season 2, you’ve spoken about how you haven’t started writing yet, but is there anything specific you are most looking forward to adapting from “The Long Game?”\n\n\tThere’s so many new characters that are going to be really fun to bring in. But I think that next season will end up feeling different because it’s a more focused book. It takes place over a shorter amount of time. There’s more a sense of getting to know that team in Ottawa that Ilya is going to play for and getting to know Hayden and Jackie more. And there’s more Yuna and David. Hopefully what will happen, like with any good second season in general, is that we will get to enrich the stuff you already know and how those threads began, and then pull on them and really get into it. But I’m also really looking forward to seeing Ilya in therapy. It’s probably a really good thing for him. I know that my therapist has been crucial to getting through the past few months.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFamily films flourished, video game adaptations triumphed, and superheroes flew too close to the sun. Welcome to 2025 at the multiplexes!\n\n\tIt was a roller-coaster year at cinemas and for the studios tasked with keeping their screens filled. Warner Bros. enjoyed an epic run at the box office, fielding hits as diverse as a vampire flick set in the Jim Crow South (“Sinners”), an old-school star-driven racing drama (“F1: The Movie”) and a sandbox-game-turned-big-screen-smash (“A Minecraft Movie”). Meanwhile Paramount, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars on yet another “Mission: Impossible,” barely released anything that turned a profit.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then there’s Disney, which backed three movies that topped $1 billion (we’re assuming that will be the case with “Avatar: Fire and Ash”) and stands out as the only studio to cross a combined $6 billion globally. But the studio also distributed nearly twice as many big-budget duds (“Elio,” “Snow White” and “Tron: Ares,” to name a few). More troubling, Marvel, once Hollywood’s biggest hitmaker, struggled to regain its mojo. It’s all coming down to next year’s “Avengers: Doomsday” to get the franchise back on course.\n\n\n\tOur annual report card includes the five major studios as well as A24, which is nominally an indie, but spent lavishly on “The Smashing Machine” and “Marty Supreme.” But it doesn’t include streamers such as Amazon and Apple, which didn’t release enough movies in cinemas for us to judge their slate. Come on, guys, start spending those Bezos bucks!\n\t\n\n\tAs 2025 draws to a close, it’s time for Hollywood to get its report card. Some of you may not want to hang it on your fridge.\n\t\n\t\tDisney\t\n\n\tHighs: “Lilo & Stitch” ($1.03 billion against a $100 million budget), “Zootopia 2” ($1.31 billion against a $150 million budget), “Freakier Friday” ($153 million against a $42 million budget), “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ($506 million and counting against a $250 million+ budget)Lows: “Captain America: Brave New World” ($415 million against a $180 million budget), “Snow White” ($205 million against a $250 million budget), “Elio” ($154 million against a $150 million budget) “Tron: Ares” ($142 million against a $180 million budget), “Predator: Badlands” ($181 million against a $105 million budget), “Ella McCay” ($4 million against a $35 million budget)Takeaways: Disney deserves props for fielding two (and likely three after “Avatar: Fire and Ash” gets through the holiday season) billion-dollar hits, a feat that illuminates the chasm between the studio and its rivals, none of whom had a single film cross $1 billion since 2023. Yet almost nothing else worked for Disney beyond the live-action “Lilo & Stitch” remake, “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar 3.” Marvel continued its lousy streak, producing three consecutive commercial duds in “Captain America: Brave New World,” “Thunderbolts” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” (Next year’s Sony-produced “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” and “Avengers: Doomsday” can’t arrive soon enough.) “Elio” underscored Pixar‘s continued struggle to launch original animation. Meanwhile, “Snow White,” “Tron: Ares” and “Predator: Badlands” proved that some aging properties are better left in the vault. That’s a problem for Disney, which relies almost entirely on recycling what’s worked in the past. Let it be a mantra for Hollywood: Brand recognition doesn’t equal box office dollars.Grade: B\n\t\n\t\tParamount\t\n\n\tHighs: “Smurfs” ($124 million against a $58 million budget), “The Naked Gun” ($102 million against a $42 million budget), “Regretting You” ($90.4 million against a $30 million budget)Lows: “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” ($598 million against a $400 million budget), “Roofman” ($33 million against a $20 million budget), “The Running Man” ($68 million against a $105 million budget)Takeaways: In its defense, Paramount spent most of the past year stuck in a painful limbo as it waited for government regulators to approve its sale to Skydance. That left studio executives — many of whom correctly deduced they’d be shown the exit as soon as David Ellison’s crew took over — punching the clock. Paramount did write a blank check to Tom Cruise, only to find that he had embarked on one impossible mission too many. It also gambled that Edgar Wright and Glen Powell could crack “The Running Man,” the second adaptation of the Stephen King novel; the first attempt flopped when it hit theaters with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sadly, the pair shouldn’t have bothered lacing up their sneakers. Paramount fielded a few cost-effective hits, like “Smurfs” and “The Naked Gun,” but these are not the kind of modest successes one expects from one of Hollywood’s most storied studios. Will the new management fare better?Grade: C\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSony\t\n\n\tHighs: “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” ($664 million against a $20 million budget), “Chainsaw Man” ($153 million), “One of Them Days” ($51 million against a $14 million budget), “Karate Kid: Legend” ($117 million against a 45 million budget), “28 Years Later” ($151 million against a $60 million budget), “I Know What You Did Last Summer” ($64.8 million against an $18 million budget), “Materialists” ($71 million at the international box office)Lows: “Caught Stealing” ($32 million against a $40 million budget), “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” ($20 million against a $45 million budget)Takeaways: Sony didn’t have any home runs, but it also avoided any strikeouts. It wasn’t a terribly strong year for the studio, to be sure. But we’re grading based on what’s been released and not what could have been. Anime was a massive boon, with Crunchyroll’s “Demon Slayer” and “Chainsaw Man” scoring back-to-back wins while demonstrating a voracious appetite for manga adaptations in the U.S. The studio also kept the theatrical comedy alive with the Keke Palmer and SZA-led “One of Them Days,” and turned A24’s romantic drama “Materialists” into an international hit. Neither “Karate Kid: Legend” nor “I Know What You Did Last Summer” were necessary sequels, but both films scraped together modest grosses. As for “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” the collective wattage of Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell couldn’t overcompensate for terrible reviews and bad buzz. Star power only gets audiences to theaters if the movie is, ya know, good.Grade: B\n\t\n\t\tUniversal\t\n\n\tHighs: “How to Train Your Dragon” ($636 million against a $150 million budget), “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($868 million against a $180 million budget), “Black Phone 2” ($132 million against a $30 million budget), “Wicked: For Good” ($488 million and counting against a $150 million budget), “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” ($206 million against a $36 million budget)Lows: “Wolf Man” ($34 million against a $25 million budget), “Love Hurts” ($17 million against a $18 million budget), “M3GAN 2.0” ($39 million against a $25 million budget), “Him” ($28 million against a $27 million budget)Takeaways: Sequels and reboots delivered in a big way for Donna Langley and her team. On paper, rebooting “Jurassic World” a mere three years after the last installment in the “when dinosaurs attack” franchise might have seemed like a bad idea. But it turns out people really like watching velociraptors dine out on some pesky humans, especially when Scarlett Johansson is trying to avoid becoming dessert. The studio also scored with follow-ups to “Wicked” and “Five Nights at Freddy’s” that won’t do anywhere near the same business as their predecessors but should turn a tidy profit. There were flops, of course. But failures like “Wolf Man” and “M3GAN 2.0” didn’t cost much to produce. The main issue that Universal faced is that Blumhouse, which made both those films, was uncharacteristically inconsistent. “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” and “Black Phone 2” helped the company get back on track, but it needs to deliver new franchises instead of just servicing old ones.Grade: B+\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWarner Bros.\t\n\n\tHighs: “A Minecraft Movie” ($958 million against a $150 million budget), “Sinners” ($367 million against a $90 million budget), “Final Destination Bloodlines” ($315 million against a $50 million budget), “F1: The Movie” ($631 million against a $250 million+ budget fronted by Apple), “Superman” ($616 million against a $224 million budget), “Weapons” ($268 million a $38 million budget)Lows: “Mickey 17” ($133 million against a $118 million budget), “The Alto Knights” ($10 million against a $50 million budget), “One Battle After Another” ($204 million against a $140 million budget)Takeaways: It’s the comeback of the year. After a rough end to 2024 (“Joker: Folie à Deux,” anyone?) and a rocky start to 2025 (“Mickey 17” and “The Alto Knights” were pricey bombs), the studio rebounded the old-fashioned way — by banking on bold directors and new ideas at a time when reboots and sequels reign supreme. Seven consecutive releases, from video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie” and Ryan Coogler’s vampire thriller “Sinners” to the Brad Pitt-led sports drama “F1: The Movie” and Zach Cregger’s genre-bending mystery “Weapons,” opened above $40 million domestically, a first in Hollywood history. Although Paul Thomas Anderson’s comedic adventure “One Battle After Another” isn’t in danger of turning a profit against its hefty $140 million budget, the film surpassed the $200 million mark and achieved a milestone by getting adult audiences to theaters for original fare. Plus, “One Battle” could be valuable beyond the balance sheet as a major Oscar contender. This might be Warner Bros.’ last year as a stand-alone studio. If that’s the case, it went out with a bang.Grade: A\n\t\n\t\tA24\t\n\n\tHighs: “Materialists ($104 million against an $18 million budget), “Bring Her Back” ($39 million against a $10 million budget), “Friendship” ($16.5 million after being acquired for $3 million), “Eternity” ($28 million against a $12 million budget)Lows: “The Smashing Machine” ($21 million against a $50 million budget), “Eddington” ($13 million against a $25 million budget), “The Legend of Ochi” ($4.9 million against a $10 million budget), “Warfare” ($33 million against a $20 million budget), “Death of a Unicorn” ($15 million against a $15 million budget)Takeaways: The indie studio is trying to play with the big boys by moving beyond its low-budget roots. But it found out the hard way that spending more money doesn’t always result in bigger profits. Benny Safdie’s “The Smashing Machine,” featuring a change-of-pace performance by Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson as a troubled MMA fighter, was too dark for the actor’s fans and failed to earn the critical acclaim it needed to pack in art-house audiences. Oh, and it cost $50 million to produce and millions more to market, making it one of the year’s bigger bombs. The same was true of Ari Aster’s “Eddington,” a political satire set during COVID that discovered that most moviegoers would rather memory-hole the pandemic. A24 did score with “Materialists,” a starry rom-com from Celine Song that became a true mainstream hit. And it has a chance to end things on a high note with “Marty Supreme,” a table-tennis drama starring one-man hype machine Timothée Chalamet. If it scores, A24 deserves some extra credit.Grade: B-\n",

    "body": "\n\tLast week, President Donald Trump’s name was emblazoned across the Kennedy Center’s building façade, website and social media accounts. The organization’s new name, after what the White House claimed was a unanimous vote by the board of trustees, is “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Experts say the renaming of the Kennedy Center is illegal.\n\n\tBut the Kennedy Center is not the current owner of trumpkennedycenter.org or trumpkennedycenter.com — because back in August, comedy writer Toby Morton registered those two domain names, expecting Trump and his allies to add Trump’s name to the D.C. landmark.\n\t\n\n\t“As soon as Trump began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year, I thought, ‘Yep, that name’s going on the building,’” Morton recently told the Washington Post. “The Kennedy Center has always been a cultural institution meant to outlast any one administration or personality. It’s meant to honor culture, not ego. Once it was treated like personal branding, satire became unavoidable.”\n\n\tSnapping up domain names and using them to troll politicians has been an active pursuit for Morton, who has “South Park” and “Mad TV” writing credits (and once provided the voice of Scott Tenorman, the half-brother and nemesis of Eric Cartman, on “South Park”). Morton, whose bio on BlueSky says he is a “Creator of Anti-Fascist websites,” hasn’t launched websites on trumpkennedycenter.org or trumpkennedycenter.com at this point. But he pledged that when he does, they will “absolutely reflect the absurdity of the moment. Lots of surprises. Some things are truly hard to parody, though.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety has reached out to the Kennedy Center’s press office for comment.\n\n\tMorton, in a post on BlueSky this week, marveled at supportive comments from readers responding to the Post story. “I’m so used to hate comments that these from the Washington Post article feel downright refreshing. Also, a few longtime heroes of mine are quietly on board now, which helps. PRO TIP: Maybe don’t mess with an institution like The Kennedy Center? The support is growing. Watch this space.”\n\n\tPer the Washington Post, Morton operates about 50 political parody sites. Those mtg2026.org, which lampoons Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia); nancymace26.com, a fake site mocking Rep. Nancy Grace (R-South Carolina); and resignchuck.com, aimed at Democratic Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-New York).\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 2 of “Stranger Things, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAfter four-and-a-half seasons of questions prompted by “Stranger Things,” in Volume 2 of the show’s fifth and final season, creators Matt and Ross Duffer offered answers aplenty, while also setting up the potentially tragic stakes of the series finale. That deadly new question — whether there’s any world in which Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) can live without her blood being the key ingredient for future weapons of mass destruction — will be answered when the show’s series finale, “The Rightside Up,” which drops on Dec. 31.\n\n\tBut for now, let’s enumerate the big pieces of “Stranger Things” mythology we now understand after seeing “Shock Jock,” “Escape From Camazotz” and “The Bridge,” as well as how the show has continued to tie up emotional threads within this tight group of friends who’ve become a large, extended found family.\n\n\tTop of mind is how Will (Noah Schnapp) finally — finally! — comes out to his mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), his brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and his friends, as they all geared up to head into the Upside Down to fight Henry/Vecna/One (Jamie Campbell Bower) for the final battle. In “Sorcerer,” the climactic conclusion of Volume 1, Will harnessed his connection to Vecna, which had been forged when he was kidnapped into the Upside Down on Nov. 6, 1983. Channeling his Eleven-like powers, Will slayed Demogorgons, stopping them in mid-air, and the episode’s final image was him wiping his bloody nose (as Eleven does) from the exertion of it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Schnapp \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWill had received those powers directly from Vecna: The first scene of Volume 1 revealed that Vecna plugged him into the hive while he was in the Upside Down. Will can use his powers for good, as we see, but Vecna can also use his connection to Will against him. He’s been creating the tunnels under Hawkins with his mind, using Will as his spy, just as he was in the second season. In Volume 2, Vecna uses Will to spy again to see where Max (Sadie Sink) is — a hospital bed in Hawkins — which puts her in physical danger. Not wanting any secrets to come between him and his friends, Will decides to come out to them, first by saying, “I don’t like girls,” and then going on to say that Vecna showed him a world in which he was alone because of his sexuality. “It just felt so real,” Will says, through tears. “You’ll never lose me,” Joyce tells Will, as Jonathan and then all of Will’s friends say the same, reinforcing their love and support for him before engulfing him in a hug.\n\n\tOther interpersonal storylines resolved in Volume 2 are the ongoing questions of what would happen to Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Jonathan as a couple, and why exactly Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) has been so angry at Steve (Joe Keery). After Nancy shoots what turns out to be the exotic matter that’s holding the Upside Down together, it causes a literal meltdown that threatens to drown them in goo. So, Nancy and Jonathan get real with one another, confessing everything from her hatred of The Clash to the fact that he never applied to Emerson for college (and that she knew). Jonathan takes out the engagement ring he’s been carrying around in a John Coltrane cassette, and says, “Nancy Wheeler, will you not marry me?” They remain, of course, bonded forever – but just as friends from now on.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSpeaking of friends, after getting into a physical fight in the basement of the lab, Steve and Dustin separate in an angry snit. But after hearing the ruckus on the upper floors, Steve runs up the stairs to help Nancy, recklessly so. Dustin breaks down, saying he can’t lose Steve after he’s already lost Eddie for trying to be a hero. As Dustin sobs, Steve hugs him, finally understanding why Dustin has been protecting himself from getting hurt again by putting up a hostile front.\n\n\tAs for the larger “Stranger Things” mysteries, it’s Dustin who figures out, having found the journals of Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine), that the Upside Down isn’t its own world or own dimension, but instead is a wormhole: a bridge to another world, one that Dustin names “the Abyss.” The Abyss, that red, Mars-like space we’ve seen before, is where Eleven sent Henry when she was a small child in Hawkins Lab after he revealed to her that he wanted her by his side in his plot to change (aka destroy!) the world. It’s where Henry evolved into Vecna, and where, at Brenner’s instruction, Eleven found Henry by using her powers, creating the Upside Down. “When you made remote contact with the Abyss, the bridge formed,” Dustin tells Eleven and the rest of the group as they formulate their plan. “And ever since, Henry and his army of monsters have been using it to cross right back into Hawkins.” The Abyss is also where Vecna retreated after he was nearly defeated in Season 4, Dustin says, to “lick his wounds” — which is why Eleven couldn’t find him.\n\n\tThe show also begins to reveal how Henry’s powers came to be before the Creel family moved to Hawkins in the late 1950s. Max and Holly (Nell Fisher) tour Henry’s memories in an effort to get them out of Vecna’s mindscape, which Holly has named Camazotz, using the terminology of her favorite book, “A Wrinkle in Time.” They end up at the bottom of a mine shaft, watching as young Henry comes upon a panicked stranger protecting a silver briefcase — he shoots Henry in the hand so Henry, just a child, beats him to death with a rock. (This development is alluded to in the stage play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” when Brenner, Henry’s keeper after he murdered his parents, mentions that Henry had been found in a cave in Nevada after going missing on his 8th birthday. After that, Brenner says, Henry was different.) Henry opens the case, but we don’t see what happens after that — because Max pulls Holly away. “We will see that briefcase again,” Ross Duffer says.  “You’re going to get the answers to those questions in the final episode.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNell Fisher and Sadie Sink \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHenry’s powers (and their transmissibility) are essential to Eleven’s existential dilemma heading into the series finale. Kali/Eight (Linnea Berthelsen) reveals to Eleven she’d been held in a military lab because Dr. Kay was transfusing her blood into pregnant women in the hope that the fetuses would eventually develop her telekinetic powers. That’s how she learned, Kali then tells Eleven, that Brenner had similarly infused the biological mothers of all the kids in Hawkins Lab with Henry’s blood — resulting in Eleven becoming his perfect replica (and the other kids also developing powers). “They will find you,” Kali says. “And they will create more. Like Henry.”\n\n\tThose are the stakes of “The Right Side Up,” the Duffers say. Is Kali correct in saying that she and Eleven should hang back in the Upside Down as it’s destroyed, removing the threat of them ever being used again as weapons? Or is Mike (Finn Wolfhard) right when he says to Eleven that they’re the ones who get to decide how things will end? “You, me, Lucas, Will and Dustin,” Mike tells her. “Because this is our story.”\n\n\n\t“How can there be a happy ending here?” Matt Duffer asks rhetorically. “That’s the question going into the finale.”\n\n\tIn the interview below, the Duffers delve into that question, as well as writing Will’s coming out scene, when they decided what the Upside Down is, Henry’s backstory, how Max can help Eleven in the series finale — and much more.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Schnapp \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWill’s coming out scene! For Volume 1, we talked about how you wanted it to be that as Will “began to accept himself,” he’d be able to achieve the kind of strength he needed to access his powers. Did you always know you wanted Will to have a huge coming out scene with everyone as the final battle approached?\n\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Will’s coming out is something we’ve been talking about and wanting to do for a very long time. Originally, it was going to be in Season 4, and we just realized we didn’t have the space to do it properly. And I’m glad we didn’t, because it really gave us time to arc an entire season toward this — toward this one moment. And yes, he is starting to embrace himself, which we see in Volume 1.\n\n\n\tBut what he realizes is that there’s still something in there that Vecna exploits — which is that he hasn’t told anyone about this. That ultimately led to the coming out scene. Originally, it was just going to be Joyce in the original draft of the outline. And the scene was not hitting properly. We realized that Joyce is an important part of this, but he really needed to do it in front of everyone.How did you work with Noah Schnapp on that scene, both in the writing of it and on the day of filming it?Matt Duffer: Ross and I spent longer writing that scene, I think, than certainly any other scene this year — if not ever. We were so concerned about getting it right. There were a lot of things that went into it. I mean, we’re definitely nervous about how it’s going to go over with everyone. But not as nervous as we were handing it over to Noah. Because ultimately, it needed to resonate and be truthful for him. We really were writing it to and for Noah. He wrote us sobbing after he read it. So it really worked and resonated for him, which was great.\n\t\n\n\tOn the day, frankly, there wasn’t really much direction at all. Noah spent a long time — I mean, months — prepping for that scene, that moment. Luckily, that script was done well in advance. I know he did a lot of work himself. It was a lot of pressure on the day, because not only are you performing this scene that you know is the most important scene for you in the season, you’re doing it in front of not just a crew, but basically all his fellow actors. And they were all there for him. The only thing we said was, “How do you want us to start? Where do you want the camera to be?”\n\n\tAnd most of what’s in there is the first take. It’s just one of those moments you always hope for when you’re working with an actor — he seemed to access something incredibly truthful. It didn’t feel like he was acting. I think Noah completely lost himself in that scene, and that take is what wound up in the show.\n\n\tWill doesn’t actually say, “I’m gay” — the way he frames his coming out is in different ways. Can you talk about how you wanted him to express himself?\n\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: For us, it was just trying to make sure that the scene felt unique to both Will and unique for a coming out scene. For us, it was about the fears — because that’s what Vecna does. He preys on the fears, which allows us to explore whether it’s someone like Max, who’s dealing with trauma and depression, or in this case, Will.\n\n\tThe fear is something that Vecna, what he’s talking about, feels really real and grounded to Will, which is not that everyone’s going to make fun of him or be mean to him. It’s that everyone’s going to slowly withdraw from him. Talking about it like that, and then getting the reassurance from them — once we had that, then the arc of the scene seemed to make sense, and it felt very specific to both something that Vecna would do, but also to Will as a character. That’s when it really clicked, and that’s why it also helped to have everyone there, as opposed to just Joyce.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I would just add that another thing that helped click it for us, and why he says, “I don’t like girls.” This came about once we added the other actors, his friends, into the scene: It’s about how they are so similar in every way. He’s talking about everything they share in common, and how little difference there is between them, and at the end of the day, there is no difference. They’re the same people they always were. There’s just one thing that’s different about him. That’s what he’s scared of sharing with them. And that’s why it felt right for him to express it that way.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLinnea Berthelsen and Millie Bobby Brown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSwitching topics! When, in writing the show, did you decide there were two different things, the Upside Down and the Abyss?\n\n\tMatt Duffer: That was something that I can say was early on. That was all the way back in Season 1: Netflix just wanted us to explain the mythology to them, because we were very adamant early on, “We don’t want to explain it in the show. We like that there’s mystery, and that there’s a lot that you don’t understand by the end of the season.” They said, “That’s fine, but we would like to know.” I think it was actually a really good exercise — we spent quite a bit of time with our writers figuring out exactly what the Upside Down was. We wrote a 20-page mythology document. It wasn’t called the Abyss at that point; it was called Dimension X, which is a Ninja Turtle reference.\n\n\tBut yeah, that’s been in there, baked in there, for a while. We’ve been holding those cards back for so long; it was a real relief to actually be able to show our hands here.Can you talk about creating the life and death stakes for Eleven going into the series finale? That if she survives, the military will just continue to hunt her down and make more of her from Henry’s blood?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: This is one of the reasons we want to bring Kali back — there’s really been dual threats throughout the run of “Stranger Things.” There is the supernatural threat, which is represented by Vecna this season. But the military has always posed a threat, from Season 1 on. Even when Brenner is gone, he gets continually replaced by someone else. In this case, in Season 5, by Kay. So we needed Kali to represent maybe a more pessimistic, but perhaps realistic, version, compared to Mike’s worldview of we’re gonna have butterflies and rainbows. And Kali’s going, “How is this going to work? And what is the solution here, that you can live a normal life?” That’s really a huge part of Eleven’s journey this season.\n\n\tSo did Eleven create the Upside Down? Because this is a debate we’ve been having at Variety since Season 4.Matt Duffer: Oh! Yes. The answer is yes. Not her fault, I would say!It was Brenner’s fault.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: She was forced to do that.\n\n\tWhen did you come up with the idea that Brenner had used Henry’s blood to create more Henrys — with El being the most successful manifestation of that — presumably to be Cold War-era weapons?\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I think that came about when we were working both on the play and Season 4, if I recall. Because so much of it ties into Henry, into One. Once we started to really explore that, we felt that it was interesting to then use that to explain and delve into where these powers actually originated from.Is there a way for Eleven not to have Henry’s blood in her?\n\n\tMatt Duffer: The idea is no, because we like that this is something that’s in her DNA. It’s unchangeable. There’s no magic antidote that’s going to solve this issue. And we like that, because it just creates a very complicated, messy situation.\n\n\tIt’s very easy to say, “Hey, we’re going to go fight the bad guy and defeat the evil!” But even if they’re able to do that and survive that, there’s this other, almost even darker, more complicated question on the other side of that. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoe Keery and Gaten Matarazzo \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHow is it that Steve, of all people, came up with the final plan of what they’re going to do?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Well, Steve’s grown up a lot over the years. And particularly this season, he’s been beaten up a little bit by Dustin. He’s a little behind a lot of time; he’s like Donnie in “The Big Lebowski” sometimes, where he’s just a step or two behind. But Steve is a smart guy, and I think he’s shown that over the years. As we were working on that penultimate episode, we thought, “Who better to come up with the final — and arguably the most important plan — they’ve ever had than Steve ‘The Hair’ Harrington?'”\n\n\tMatt Duffer: And his favorite childhood story was “Jack and the Beanstalk.” That’s the other thing.\n\n\tIs the Abyss/Dimension X, the other world where Henry is, the place he originally entered as a child?\n\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Correct. Yes. I don’t think in the show we ever call it Dimension X — maybe that was in a script, and maybe we’ve referred to that in interviews. But it was never officially Dimension X. So that’s now always the Abyss, just to keep things as confusing as possible.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJamie Campbell Bower \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShawn Levy told my colleague Jenny Maas in a postmortem coming out soon that the answer is no to them being the same thing. He said to ask you guys! He said he doesn’t think the Abyss is Dimension X. \n\n\tMatt Duffer: I’m gonna have to text him and clarify this for him.\n\n\tThe man with the briefcase that young Henry meets in that mine shaft — is there more to that story of how Henry got his powers that day that we’re going to see in the series finale?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yes, we will see that briefcase again. You’re going to get the answers to those questions in the final episode.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You’ve only seen half of that core memory.\n\n\tI wanted to ask about other beats you wanted in Volume 2 as you wound the show down. We talked about Will coming out — Nancy and Jonathan figure themselves out, Dustin and Steve make up. Can you just talk about tying up threads and what you felt was essential to do?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: It was really important for us that all of our characters, as they head into the final battle, have really resolved those tensions or conflicts. That they’re all working on the same page — whether those conflicts are external with others, or internal with themselves. Because in our mind, if the party’s actually going to be able to defeat this great evil, they have to be all working at the best of their ability, and be all on the same page. So it was important just to resolve those tensions and conflicts. There’s one left, really. \n\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: The Eleven one. The Eleven one is sort of the big outstanding issue that has not been resolved going in finale.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMillie Bobby Brown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMeaning, can Eleven survive and have the world be safe? \n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yes, exactly. How can there be a happy ending here? That’s the question going into the finale. Is Mike right, or is Kali right?\n\n\tCan you talk about how you resolved the Nancy-Jonathan story? Like, like an “I choose me” situation?\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah, that was probably the scene we spent the second longest on. It’s quite a long scene; it’s complicated, what they’re going through. It’s very messy, because they do love each other very much, but we always felt that at the end of the day, they need to let each other go in order to grow as people and be independent.\n\n\tBut at the same time, there’s a very real — and I think a lot of people experience this — conflict, in the sense that they have gone through something very unique, and in their case, challenging. And how could anyone else ever understand them the way, say, Jonathan understands Nancy or vice versa, having not gone through this? Can they ever form a connection with someone that is as meaningful as this? But also, how do you grow as a person on your own? You need that independence. \n\n\tSo that was the idea behind the scene, and what we really wanted to explore. We had been planning to get there for a while, just figuring out how to exactly articulate that was challenging. But we’re really proud of that scene and, and specifically, how good Charlie and Natalia are. \n\n\tWhat was that goo, and why did it stop dripping, or whatever it was doing?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We just wanted to put Jonathan and Nancy in a situation where they thought they were going to die — and, of course, don’t. But the backstory is that when the exotic matter, or dark matter, is disturbed, it disrupts the environment around, in this case, the lab, causing it to melt. But at a certain point — as you see earlier in Episode 5, when Jonathan and Nancy are on the upper levels of the lab — they see that this goo, this melted stuff, has hardened. At a certain point, it does harden. And in this case, we show how long it takes.Matt Duffer: You can think of it like the sun — the exotic matter is circular, and then as it dies down over time, the melting slows and stops. The nightmare scenario for Jonathan and Nancy would be end up like those soldiers you saw in the prior episode, where they get trapped.You guys answered so much in 5, 6 and 7, but — \n\n\tMatt Duffer: The table is set, so to speak, going into the finale. But the big thing is Henry’s backstory specifically, and his connection to the Mind Flayer. So those are the two areas that I think are the most revelatory or impactful as we move into the final episode. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSadie Sink and Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHow useful can Max be, having spent a year and a half in Vecna’s mind?Ross Duffer: Pretty useful, because she knows she knows his memories, and that is where Eleven is going — she’s going into his mind, or into “Camazotz,” in order to fight him. So I think if Max hadn’t spent all that time there and hadn’t learned her way around, it would make this final battle nearly impossible.\n\t\n\n\tThe last time we talked, you still had work to do, and you weren’t there yet in terms of feeling like this experience was coming to an end. Where are you now? \n\n\tRoss Duffer: Well, we don’t have work to do anymore!\n\n\tMatt Duffer: It’s a weird feeling. We finished last week — or it was yanked away from us last week. I mean, we would be working on it for another year if we could.\n\n\tIt feels very odd. But on the other hand, we’ve been working on it for three years, and it felt right — the right time to let it go. And we’re just excited for people to finally see it.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 1 spoilers• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him\n",

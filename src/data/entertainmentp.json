    "body": "\n\tNetflix is gearing up for the Dec. 16 return of hit reality cooking competition “Culinary Class Wars” with the release of its main trailer, as anticipation builds for the sophomore season of the unscripted series.\n\n\tThe trailer launch comes as excitement mounts for the show’s return. The format made history last year as the first Korean reality series to top Netflix’s Global Top 10 (Non-English TV) list for three consecutive weeks. The show also earned recognition as “the most beloved series among Korean viewers” in Gallup Korea’s September 2024 survey.\n\t\n\n\tThe first season was widely credited with revitalizing Seoul’s dining scene, which saw increased restaurant bookings and renewed interest in the city’s culinary talent.\n\n\n\tSeason 2 introduces new rules and heightened competition, including the return of two masked contestants seeking redemption. The format retains the signature blind tastings that became the show’s calling card, with judges evaluating dishes purely on flavor to eliminate bias.\n\n\tThe White Spoon lineup features two-Michelin-star chef Lee Jun and Son Jong-won, who holds one Michelin star each in Korean and Western cuisine. Venerable Sunjae brings expertise as Korea’s first master of Buddhist temple cuisine, while Hou Deok-juk contributes 57 years of Chinese cuisine experience and Park Hyo-nam offers 47 years in French cuisine. The roster also includes popular chefs Jung Ho-young, Sam Kim, Raymon Kim, MasterChef Korea Season 4 judge Song Hoon, and Hansik Battle Season 3 winner Im Seong-keun.\n\n\tThe Black Spoons return with competitors bearing colorful monikers including “Three Star Killer,” “Seochon Prince,” “Culinary Monster,” and “Barbecue Lab Director.” Newcomers “Culinary Innovator” and “Wok Rider” promise to add fresh dynamics to the competition, with hints of unexpected alliances in store.\n\t\n\n\tThe announcement comes as Korean drama “Physical: Asia” continues to hold a spot in Netflix’s Global Non-English Top 10 list for its third consecutive week.\n\n\tWatch the “Culinary Class Wars” Season 2 trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAubrey O’Day, who was picked to be in Sean ",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAubrey O’Day, who was picked to be in Sean “Diddy” Combs’ girl group Danity Kane during the third season of “Making the Band,” has joined the voices speaking about the rap mogul’s alleged pattern of abuse during his time in the music industry in the just-released Netflix docuseries “Sean Combs: The Reckoning.”\n\n\n\tO’Day began telling her story by saying how she was treated as a member of the Danity Kane. “Diddy made it clear that I was ‘the looker,'” O’Day said. “I remember that phrase a lot. He was separating me and there was a different set of expectations from me, and I just naturally float into the grooming.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked when she thought her collaboration with Combs “crossed the line of becoming sexual,” O’Day said, “There are emails with pictures of his penis.” She read one of his emails out loud, which included passages like, “‘I don’t wanna just fuck you. I wanna turn you out. I can see you being with some motherfucker that you tell what to do. I make my woman do what I tell her to do, and she loves it. I just want — and like — to do things different. I’mma finish watching this porn and finish masturbating. I’ll think of you, happy face. If you change your mind and get ready to do what I say, hit me. Happy face. God bless, Diddy. God is the greatest.’\n\n\t“This is your boss at your work sending you that e-mail,” she continued. “What happens in real life to anyone else? Your boss gets fired. Six months later, I was fired. I absolutely felt that I was fired for not participating sexually, but I also found out later that [fellow Danity Kane member] Dawn [Richard] and Puff were recording a different project. I was the star of the show, and Puff needed to move that entire audience over to a new project.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked about individual accusations in “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” Combs’ legal counsel sent a statement to Variety, writing, “We’re not going to comment on individual claims being repeated in the documentary. Many of the people featured have longstanding personal grievances, financial motives, or credibility issues that have been documented for years. Several of these stories have already been addressed in court filings, and others were never raised in any legal forum because they’re simply not true. The project was built around a one-sided narrative led by a publicly admitted adversary, and it repeats allegations without context, evidence, or verification Sean Combs will continue to address legitimate matters through the legal process, not through a biased Netflix production.” When asked specifically about O’Day’s allegations in the docuseries, a representative for Combs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Combs’ team also released a longer statement about the project overall here.\n\n\tLater in the series, O’Day said she was informed of an affidavit that was received during the flood of civil lawsuits filed against Combs. In it, a woman alleges that she accidentally walked into a room where O’Day was “sprawled out on a leather couch, looking very inebriated. She was naked from the bottom half, and she had something over her top. Puff Daddy was penetrating in her vagina, and there was another stalky light-skinned man with his penis in her mouth.”\n\n\tAfter reading the affidavit on camera, O’Day said she is conflicted because, “I didn’t have a recollection of this.” She also stated that “I didn’t drink like that at all — I don’t drink at all, it’s never been an issue with me.”\n\n\t“Does this mean I was raped?” O’Day asked. “Is that what this means? I don’t even know if I was raped, and I don’t want to know. I don’t want to find out any more that that woman has to say. If she made it up, I would be compelled to take her the fuck down. You realize the burden that that puts on my soul for the past year, which is if I expose one victim who’s got a civil lawsuit, that gives Diddy and his legal team credit to take down everybody else as potential liars. Says Aubrey O’Day! It goes right back on my shoulders, just like that. The weight of that man and his bullshit … I will never get up from under it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNiv Sultan, the breakout star of “Tehran,” leads the cast of a new crime thriller, “Murder at the Dead Sea,” which is produced by Yoav Gross Productions, the banner behind “Nutuk,” “Red Skies” and “Manayek.” \n\n\tKeshet International has boarded worldwide sales on the seven-part show and will introduce it to buyers at the London TV Screenings on Feb. 24. Currently in post-production and set to premiere on Keshet 12 on Dec. 22, “Murder at the Dead Sea” is created by Raz Yuvan (“Kfula,” “Hezi and Sons”), directed by Tomer Shani (“Carthargo,” “Nehama”). \n\t\n\n\tSet against Israel’s Dead Sea, “Murder at the Dead Sea” opens with the mysterious death of Sarah Hacohen, a pop icon whose body plummets from the ninth floor of a quarantined hotel during the height of the pandemic. What begins as an apparent suicide quickly unravels into a dark web of deceit, betrayal, and murder. Trapped in isolation, young police investigator Revi Shem-Tov (Sultan) must uncover the truth among a group of quarantined strangers—each hiding secrets more dangerous than the virus itself.\n\n\n\t“‘Murder at the Dead Sea’ is a high-end thriller that reinvents the locked-room mystery for today’s global audience,” said Kelly Wright, Keshet International’s managing director of distribution. “It features a stunning and exotic location, twisty plot, and an outstanding performance from Niv Sultan.” \n\n\tKarni Ziv, Keshet 12’s head of drama and comedy, adds: “We think Keshet 12 viewers are going to love this contemporary reimagining of the classic Agatha Christie whodunnit set in a COVID hotel by the Dead Sea, because it combines the taut suspense of ‘And Then There Were None’ with the cinematic storytelling of ‘The White Lotus.'”\n\t\n\n\tRecent scripted commissions by Keshet 12 include the October 7 drama, “Red Alert” which ranks as Israel’s highest-rated drama of the last decade; “Nutuk,” a gripping suspense drama where a boy’s memories of another life lead two families into the heart of a buried murder mystery; and “Save the Date,” a romantic comedy starring Tomer Capone. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAcclaimed Indonesian filmmaker Garin Nugroho has been elevated to the rank of Officier dans l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France‘s Ministry of Culture, receiving one of the country’s highest cultural distinctions in recognition of his contributions to cinema.\n\n\tFrench Ambassador to Indonesia, Timor-Leste and ASEAN, Fabien Penone, presented the decoration to Nugroho during the JAFF Market French Night at the Institut français d’Indonésie in Yogyakarta. The filmmaker had previously been named Chevalier in the order in 2015.\n\t\n\n\tEstablished in 1957, the Order of Arts and Letters honors individuals who have made exceptional contributions to culture in France and globally. The elevation acknowledges Nugroho’s decades-long career shaping Indonesian cinema and expanding its international presence.\n\n\n\tNugroho made history in 1998 when his film “Daun di Atas Bantal” became the first Indonesian feature selected for the Cannes Film Festival, screening in the Un Certain Regard section. The milestone opened doors for Indonesian cinema in France and internationally.\n\n\tHis work has maintained strong resonance with French audiences and institutions. “Memories of My Body” won the Montgolfière d’Or at the Festival des 3 Continents in Nantes in 2018. In 2023, the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac hosted a presentation of “Setan Jawa” as a large-scale cine-concert featuring symphonic orchestra and gamelan ensemble.\n\n\tThe collaboration continues with “Daun di Atas Bantal” set to open the Panorama of Indonesian Cinema event at the Cinémathèque française in Paris on Dec. 10. The major retrospective will showcase several decades of Indonesian filmmaking and bring prominent Indonesian directors to the French capital.\n\t\n\n\tNugroho’s latest film, “Samsara” (2024), blends cinema, live music, Balinese tradition and contemporary forms. The hybrid work earned four Citra Awards in 2024, including best director, cinematography, music and production design.\n\n\tBeyond filmmaking, Nugroho founded the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF), Indonesia’s leading independent film festival. He launched the JAFF Market in 2024 as the festival’s first film industry platform. His collaboration with France has facilitated initiatives including the Indonesia-France Film Lab, which pairs emerging Indonesian filmmakers with French industry professionals for mentorship.\n\n\tSince 2023, Nugroho has served as head of cultural programming at GIK UGM, where he develops projects connecting culture with education, creation and public engagement, often in partnership with the French Embassy.\n\n\t“Garin Nugroho’s cinematic work as well as his leadership within Indonesia’s cultural landscape, have made him one of the most influential figures of Southeast Asian cinema,” said Penone. “Thanks to his deep engagement with France, he has strengthened the ties between our film communities and reinforced the cultural cooperation between our two countries.”\n\n\tNugroho’s debut feature, “Cinta dalam Sepotong Roti,” was released in 1990.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivalry” creator Jacob Tierney said during a recent interview with Xtra that the real-life sexualities of his stars are irrelevant compared to the “enthusiasm and willingness” they bring to HBO’s new queer, sports drama series.\n\n\t“I don’t think there’s any reason to get into that stuff,” Tierney said when asked if the sexualities of stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie are relevant to the show. “I’ll tell you something about the casting of both of these roles. You can’t ask questions like that when you’re casting, right? It’s actually against the law. So what you have to gauge is somebody’s enthusiasm and willingness to do the work.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “And that’s what’s so impressive about both of these guys is they came into this being like, ‘Yeah, we’re here to do this, and we are here to make this story feel authentic and to be as real as possible.’ And they fucking hit it out of the park.”\n\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” stars Williams and Storrie as emerging hockey pros Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, respectively. Despite playing for rival teams, the pair develops a romance off the ice.\n\n\tWilliams recently told Out Magazine that his chemistry with Storrie has an intense and unexpected authenticity unrivaled by other potential co-stars.\n\n\t“I read with one other possible Ilya, and it was good. But something about Connor,” he said. “There was an inexplicable X-factor that just felt realer than what I thought it could possibly be. And that was something. I had a quote I told Jacob, at one point, about my read with Connor in particular.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the same interview, Tierney recalled meeting with Williams after the fact: “Hudson told me, ‘The other guy was good, but Connor felt like he was going to pin me down and fuck me,’” later adding, “That is literally what he said. And I was like, ‘Well, I think I cast this right.’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron‘s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” has finally been unveiled to members of the film press ahead of its theatrical rollout later this month, and journalists are calling the third trip to Pandora an “ultimate cinematic spectacle” that pushes “visuals and emotion to new heights.”\n\n\tFilm critic Courtney Howard praised the film on X, writing that films like “Fire and Ash” remind us what “movie theaters were built for.”\n\n\n\t“3 films in, James Cameron still has the sauce, making the epic spectacular feel emotionally impactful,” Howard wrote. “A glorious saga. Bold, brilliant & awesome in every way, this is what movie theaters were built for.”\n\t\n\n\tFellow critic Sean Tajipour echoed the praise on X. He wrote that with “Fire and Ash,” Cameron “continues to push boundaries with every frame.” \n\n\t“I may not be the biggest ‘Avatar’ superfan, but [‘Avatar: Fire and Ash‘] proves once again that James Cameron can and will always deliver the ultimate cinematic spectacle, pushing visuals and emotion to new heights and redefining what a true blockbuster feels like,” he wrote. “It’s bold, immersive, unforgettable, and driven by sheer ambition.”\n\n\tCollider correspondent Perri Nemiroff wrote of the film on X, “Three films in and I still can’t get over how magical the [‘Avatar’] movies are. Wish I had more original phrasing, but this applies too well — [‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’] truly feels like a ride. I couldn’t believe how quickly I was pulled back into the world of Pandora and swept up in the situation. And once that happens, there’s a noticeable increase in complexity in quite a few aspects of the production.” \n\t\n\n\tFilm writer Michael Lee wrote on X that the story left a bit to be desired, but praised the visuals and action as “out-of-this-world.” \n\n\tHe wrote, “[‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’] is huge on visual spectacle, especially in 3D. Deeper exploration of Pandora & new tribes allow for immense world-building. Story may be lacking, but this pushes technical boundaries in unimaginable ways.”\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” picks up after the events of 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which notably ended with the death of Jake Sully and Neytiri’s son Neteyam. This latest installment finds the Sully family grieving one of their own when a new threat emerges in the form of the Fire tribe, an antagonistic group of Na’vi volcano-dwellers led by the revengeful Varang (Oona Chaplin in her franchise debut). The returning cast includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang and Kate Winslet, among others.\n\n\tCameron has been blunt in recent interviews in saying the future of the “Avatar” franchise depends on the box office performance of “Fire and Ash” this holiday movie season. The director originally envisioned five “Avatar” movies and has a large chunk of a fourth movie already shot. The original “Avatar” remains the highest-grossing movie of all time (unadjusted for inflation) with $2.9 billion worldwide, while “The Way of Water” is third on the list with $2.3 billion. Cameron told Empire magazine earlier this year that he’s ready to direct the fourth movie himself.\n\n\t“I mean, there’s no reason not to,” Cameron said ahead of his 71st birthday in August about directing more “Avatar” sequels himself. “I’m healthy, I’m good to go. I’m not going to rule it out. I mean, I’ve got to make it in a vigorous way, to handle the kind of volume and energy of the work for another six or seven years. You know what I mean? I might not be able to do that… [but] if I can, I’ll just do it.”\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” opens in theaters Dec. 19. Check out more first reactions below. \n\nJames Cameron did it again! ‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’ is jaw dropping from start to finish and easily one of the most visually stunning films to hit theaters in years. I’ve never felt so immersed in a world like this. #AvatarFireAndAsh pic.twitter.com/BaNqtaDMXx— Dorian Parks (@DorianParksnRec) December 2, 2025\n\n\n#AvatarFireAndAsh is a visual masterpiece. If you love these movies, it's more of the same, but story-wise, it's the same \"capture/rescue\" plot over and over again with some laughable dialogue thrown in the middle. The runtime is criminal, and if you have eye issues, avoid the 3D pic.twitter.com/p8ou1mI25c— Kaitlyn Booth (@katiesmovies) December 2, 2025\n\n\n#AvatarFireAndAsh James Cameron once again deliver a remarkable visual feast. The fire tribe are a scene stealing presence. Oona Chaplin’s dynamic w/ Quaritch was a highlight. I will say Way of Water spoiled us w/ SO MUCH new stuff this one feels slightly repetitive w/ little new pic.twitter.com/9O4JQ9DKN5— Cris Parker (@3CFilmss) December 2, 2025\n\n\nWe all thought James Cameron was making his Star Wars, #AvatarFireAndAsh cements it as his Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy (highly complimentary). This is so At World's End coded & Cameron has fully embraced the anime & video game inspos even more proudly here. A nonstop series… pic.twitter.com/pDOQNgaEKz— Griffin Schiller (@griffschiller) December 2, 2025\n\n\n#AvatarFireandAsh is a visual masterpiece & the fight scenes are breathtaking. Zoe Saldana & Oona Chaplin are standouts. There were captivating moments with themes of grief & faith. But the script becomes lazy, repetitive & exhausting with excruciatingly bad dialogue. #Avatar2 pic.twitter.com/7RxTBjQVxe— sagesurge (@sagesurge) December 2, 2025\n\n\nThe best and unexpectedly, the horniest of the three, #AvatarFireAndAsh features some astonishing filmmaking from James Cameron. Fans of the previous two will be very pleased.— Todd Gilchrist (@mtgilchrist) December 2, 2025\n\n\n#AvatarFireAndAsh felt like coming home. old dog james cameron isn’t demonstrating many new tricks but i literally do not care — repetition is allowed when it’s perfecting the beats of past movies with jaw dropping spectacle and darker, strife-rich storytelling. my family!!!! pic.twitter.com/Oaa5YVP7jP— lyvie scott (@lyviescott) December 2, 2025\n\n\n#AvatarFireAndAsh  is a staggering achievement of moviemaking, and an all round phenomenal film. James Cameron raises the stakes. It’s bigger, better and more emotional than ever before. It has gorgeous visuals, thrilling new characters and is a technical marvel. Loved it. pic.twitter.com/XcPKjCvsVL— Jazz Tangcay (@jazzt) December 2, 2025\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesian director Yosep Anggi Noen (“The Redemption of Sin”) is bringing Leila S. Chudori’s acclaimed novel The Sea Speaks His Name” (Laut Bercerita) to the screen. \n\n\tThe ensemble cast features Reza Rahadian, Dian Sastrowardoyo, Yunita Siregar, Eva Celia, Christine Hakim and Arswendy Beningswara.\n\n\tThe film, unveiled at the JAFF Market, is currently in production through PAL8 Pictures in cooperation with VMS Studio, Jagartha, Lynx Films and Brandlink, centers on the Wibisono family whose eldest son, Biru Laut, vanishes during the 1990s. While parents Arya Wibisono and his wife maintain hope their son survives, daughter Asmara Jati becomes convinced her brother is gone.\n\t\n\n\tSet against Indonesia’s democracy movement of the 1990s, the narrative follows university student Biru Laut, whose commitment to justice leads him into the Winatra group, a secret circle of activists writing and speaking in defiance of authoritarian rule. The story unfolds through dual perspectives: Laut’s own voice, characterized by poetry and idealism, and his sister Asmara Jati’s later search for traces of her disappeared brother among families still waiting for answers.\n\n\n\t“This is not a conventional love story – it is a narrative of young people holding onto their principles, to speak of their voices,” Noen said. The filmmaker emphasized that resistance transcends time, belonging to all generations.\n\n\tNoen is adapting source material that has been reprinted over 120 times, with approximately 700,000 book copies sold and an expected readership of 1.4 million. The production will incorporate period visual markers including demonstrations, mass movements and underground meetings set against popular music of the era, along with fashion, communication technology and entertainment icons designed to emphasize parallels with contemporary youth.\n\t\n\n\t“In a world where history is buried beneath misinformation, propaganda, and digital echo chambers, fiction becomes essential,” Noen noted, describing the approach as extracting real events and reconstructing them to ignite curiosity.\n\n\tBehind the camera, the production team includes producer Gita Fara, co-scriptwriters Chudori and Noen, cinematographer Batara Goempar, production designer Ahmad Zulkarnaen, editor Dinda Amanda, costume designer Retno Ratih Damayanti and makeup designer Aktris Handrajasa.\n\n\tPAL8 Pictures, a production house under Tempo Media Group with over 50 years in the press industry, is making its feature debut with the project before moving forward with additional titles. The company aims to produce films relevant to societal issues, including stories with social or historical backgrounds.\n\n\tCo-producers include VMS (Visual Media Studio), known for titles including “Pemandu Jenazah,” “Assalamualaikum Baitullah,” “Maryam: Janji dan Jiwa yang Terikat” and “Penerbangan Terakhir”; Jagartha Group, recognized as a pioneer in film financing in Indonesia with credits including “Mencuri Raden Saleh,” “Jatuh Cinta Seperti di Film-Film,” “Agak Laen” and “Sore: Istri dari Masa Depan”; and Lynx Films, founded in 2004 and known for collaborations with director Garin Nugroho on “Samsara,” with recent short films “Pulang” and “Galura Tropikalia Alive” selected as entries at this year’s Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n\n\tThe production is targeting a third quarter 2026 release.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart went after Donald Trump for enacting sweeping immigration reform after an Afghan national was accused of shooting two National Guard members on Nov. 26 in Washington, DC.\n\n\tAs a result, the United States halted immigration from Afghanistan. Trump also said he would reassess green cards for immigrants living in the United States from 19 countries.\n\n\n\t“That horrible act was done by one individual who was part of a larger group of Afghans who were brought here because they risked their lives helping the United States during our invasion of Afghanistan,” Stewart said. “Which, of course, means…”\n\t\n\n\tStewart then cut to a clip of Trump speaking to reporters about his decision to pause asylum requests. The president said the suspected shooter is part of a group of “people that shouldn’t be in our country,” a cluster that also includes “Somalians” and “plenty of others.”\n\n\t“Did you just ‘Somalia’ Afghanistan?” Stewart joked. “Because of this one Afghan, all Afghans are suspect, and also Somalians?”\n\n\tThe late-night pundit then cut to another clip of Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where he was asked what the Solamians had to do with the National Guard shooting. The president replied, “Nothing, but Somalians have caused a lot of trouble.”\n\n\t“‘They had nothing to do with it, just reminded me of other groups I also don’t like. I don’t see color. I just hate all of it,'” Stewart said. “So our entire immigration system is now going to be based around the principle that if even one person from your ethnic or religious group fucked up, you all got to go.”\n\t\n\n\tLater in the monologue, Stewart asked who Trump would like to see come to America. Trump’s answer came in a sound bite: “I also like very competent people coming into our country. … Maître ds, wine experts, even waiters, high-quality waiters. You got to get the best people.”\n\n\t“So Somalians aren’t welcome, unless they’re also ‘sommeliers,'” Stewart said. “But by the way, I want to make this clear. I don’t mind Trump having strict standards. The problem is, if you are from the so-called less desirable countries, he does not view you as individuals. You are just part of a larger amorphous blob of suspicion that deserves no grace, and if one of you fuck up, all are condemned.”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift has released the official trailer for her upcoming Disney+ special “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show,” releasing on December 12.\n\n\tThe film will be a full concert experience captured during the final show of her tour in Vancouver, B.C., featuring the entire set of “The Tortured Poets Department” for the first time. That portion of the show was added to the tour following the album’s release in April 2024. Fans were able to watch an earlier iteration of the “Eras Tour” theatrical film on Disney+ before those songs were added to the tour set list.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve had so long to prepare for the end of this tour and we get to play one last show for you here tonight,” says Swift in the trailer, which shows her performing “Long Live.” “I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date.”\n\n\n\tIn addition to the release of “The Final Show,” Swift is planning to drop the first two episodes of her six-part docuseries “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era,” also on December 12. That series has been described as “an intimate look at Taylor’s life as her tour made headlines and thrilled fans around the world.” Opening tour acts, including Gracie Abrams and Sabrina Carpenter, will appear in the series, as will guests Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch. Following the first episode releases, two additional batches of two episodes will be released in the following weeks.\n\n\t“Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era” is directed by Don Argott, co-directed by Sheena M. Joyce and produced by Object & Animal. “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show,” meanwhile, is directed by Glenn Weiss and produced by Taylor Swift Productions in association with Silent House Productions.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the official trailer below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian filmmaker Anusha Rizvi, director of the acclaimed “Peepli Live,” is returning to feature filmmaking with “The Great Shamsuddin Family,” a comedy-drama that examines modern Indian family dynamics.\n\n\tThe film stars Kritika Kamra as Bani Ahmed, a writer racing against a career-defining 12-hour deadline when her home becomes ground zero for a family crisis. The ensemble cast includes Purab Kohli, Farida Jalal, Shreya Dhanwanthary, Juhi Babbar, Sheeba Chaddha, Dolly Ahluwalia, Natasha Rastogi and Nishank Verma.\n\t\n\n\tSet over one day in Delhi, the narrative follows Bani as mothers, aunts, cousins and former romantic interests descend on her apartment, each bringing their own emergencies. As the protagonist navigates interfaith complexities, generational conflicts and family expectations, she faces a choice between pursuing international career opportunities or remaining with her family.\n\n\n\t“At its core, the film isn’t just about interruptions; it’s about how family even at its most exasperating shapes us in ways we can’t escape,” Rizvi said. “Through Bani’s day of glorious madness, I hope audiences recognize glimpses of their own mothers, aunts, siblings, and that one relative who always shows up at the wrong moment but with the right heart.”\n\n\tKamra described her character as the quintessential eldest daughter in a middle-income family who prioritizes others’ needs over her own ambitions. “She’s quietly dependable, endlessly responsible, and always putting herself last, even when all she wants is a single day to focus on her own future,” the actor said.\n\n\tFor Dhanwanthary, the project marked a departure from recent roles. “This is my first time doing comedy after a run of serious, heavy-handed dramatic roles,” she said, noting she plays the impulsive younger sister who turns to her sibling during crises.\n\t\n\n\tChaddha emphasized the film’s single-location setting. “Everything, the humor, the conflicts, the emotions unfolds under one roof, creating a world that’s both intimate and wildly entertaining,” she said.\n\n\tKohli called the production a mirror reflecting typical Indian family dynamics. “That’s exactly what makes it so relatable and so warm,” he said.\n\n\t“The Great Shamsuddin Family” premieres Dec. 12 on JioHotstar, India’s largest streamer. \n",

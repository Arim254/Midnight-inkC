In addition, the gaming company just dropped a new title to play that revisits a fan-favorite franchise, Kirby.\n\n\tEnter “Kirby Air Riders” for Nintendo Switch 2, which is the first new Kirby game for a home console since 2022’s “Kirby and the Forgotten Land” for the original Nintendo Switch and sequel to “Kirby Air Ride” for the Nintendo Game Cube in 2003.\n\n\n\tThe new game is available for purchase for $69 at Walmart, starting on Thursday, Nov. 20. The new installment is a racing game with 21 racers including Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede and others, while racing through various tracks on land and in the skies of Planet Popstar.\n\n\tThere’s an inventive racing that really takes advantage of the new Joy-Con 2 hardware, with single-player and multiplayer modes throughout the game.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNintendo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIf you’re a fan of Kirby and “Kirby Air Ride,” then it’s likely you’d be a fan of the sequel “Kirby Air Riders” too. Especially with new playable characters that increases the roster from three in the original game to seven times more with the new game. \n\n\tThere are even more Nintendo Amiibo collectible figures available for additional goodies and boosts. There’s Kirby on a Warp Star and Bandana Waddle Dee on a Warp Star too. Both collectibles go for $49.99 at Walmart.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNintendo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNintendo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAnd since “Kirby Air Riders” is from Walmart, you’ll get it shipped to you for free if you’re a Walmart+ member.

    "body": "\n\tIt’s time to say goodbye to the Landry family.\n\n\t“The Way Home” will end with its fourth season, set to be released on the Hallmark Channel in Spring 2026. The series stars Andie Macdowell, Chyler Leigh and Sadie Laflamme-Snow. The series is currently in production.\n\n\t“Fans of ‘The Way Home’ have enthusiastically watched and rewatched every episode since the first pond jump of season 1 as they’ve tried to piece together the brilliant puzzle Heather Conkie, Alexandra Clarke and Marly Reed expertly crafted,” said Samantha DiPippo, SVP of programming at Hallmark Media, in a statement to People. “We’re grateful to our talented cast led by Andie, Chyler, Evan and Sadie, as well as our amazing writers and crew who have worked so hard on this show.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Way Home” follows three generations of the Landry family as they embark on a journey throughout Port Haven to find their way back to each other by using time travel. Season 3 ended with Del (MacDowell) time-travelling for the first time, going back in time to witness her wedding to Colton (Jordan Doww) in the 1970s, as well as the disappearance of Jacob (Spencer Macpherson). The season also ended with the reveal that Susanna (Watson Rose) left the infamous Lingermore estate to the Landry family — and the audience learned the real identity of the mysterious baby by the pond was Elliot\n\n\n\t“The Way Home” is created by mother-daughter duo Heather Conkie and Alexandra Clarke, alongside Marly Reed. The series is executive produced by Reed, Clarke, Conkie, MacDowell, Leigh, Susanne Berger, Arnie Zipursky, Lauren MacKinlay, Fernando Szew, Hannah Pillemer and Larry Grimaldi.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat a way to prepare for an auction: Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav hosted a star-packed dinner at his Beverly Hills home Wednesday night, hours before he took a redeye flight to New York to consider the first wave of preliminary offers for the entertainment conglomerate that he has headed since 2022.\n\n\tThe guest list would have been impressive at any red carpet premiere: Oprah Winfrey, Lorne Michaels, Margot Robbie and Tom Ackerley, Al Pacino, Sandra Bullock, Jonah Hill, Bette Midler, Kristen Wiig, Bryan Lourd and Nancy Meyers. In total, about 20 people joined in for a casual discussion about movies and various projects in the works at the studio. \n\t\n\n\tOne source with direct knowledge of the evening said the mood was light-hearted and fun despite the gravity of the situation that Warner Bros. Discovery faces. The auction process, kicking off less than four years after the company went through its latest mega-merger — the union of WarnerMedia and Discovery completed in April 2022 — is sparking dread and anxiety among the rank and file at Warner Bros., HBO/HBO Max and staffs at CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery, Food Network, HGTV and other linear cable channels brought under the WBD umbrella by the Discovery merger.\n\n\n\tOn Wednesday night, however, the dinner party conversation was said to have kept the emphasis on new projects in the hopper. There wasn’t much open conversation about the sale process. But one source said it was made clear that Zaslav and his key lieutenants expect to the process to be essentially concluded by Christmas — which struck some as ambitious.\n\t\n\n\tOne source said that Zaslav, as ever, was a gracious host and animated in his discussion about the industry and its future. After the last course was served, Zaslav bowed out to get himself to a plane. The WBD CEO left the crowd with the impression that his plan was to sleep during the flight, then “wake up, shower and wait for the bids to come in at noon,” per the source with direct knowledge.\n\n\tThe field of expected bidders for WBD that has emerged in recent weeks includes Paramount, Comcast and Netflix. The specifics of who actually submitted what Thursday are still unclear. Warner Bros. Discovery representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDon’t ya just love Prince? The “Dancing With the Stars” Season 34 semifinals episode, which was themed around Prince, hit another season high with 7.22 million total viewers, according to the network, and a 1.5 rating among adults 18-49.\n\n\tThe Nov. 18 episode became the highest-watched semifinals episode in ratings in seven years (November 2018) and is up 28% in viewers compared to last season’s penultimate. Among adults, it nearly doubled its rating, with last year’s episode earning a 0.79; this year’s episode is the show’s best penultimate telecast in nine years (November 2016).\n\t\n\n\tThe interest has also grown immensely with younger viewers, with a 1.68 rating among adults 18-34, the best delivery in the younger demo in 10 years and the strongest for a penultimate episode in 14 years. Additionally, fan voting rose to a new high of 55.9 million votes.\n\n\n\tThe episode also included Zac Efron in the audience for the first time, there to support his brother, Dylan Efron. In a shock to many, Whitney Carson and Mark Ballas were eliminated, sending Dylan and partner Daniella Karagach to the finale along with Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy, Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten, Robert Irwin and Witney Carson, and Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sousa.\n\n\tThe finale of “Dancing With the Stars,” produced by BBC Studios, will air on Tuesday, November 25, with the final five couples each dancing three times for the first time ever. Each pair will perform a judges’ choice dance, an instant dance and a freestyle routine.\n\n\tThis season has continued to see major success since it kicked off in September with the biggest premiere in five years and a 49% ratings bump from the year before. Plus, premiere voting rose 163% over last season’s premiere episode — and has seen an increase each week.\n\t\n\n\t“DWTS” airs on Tuesdays on ABC and Disney+ at 8 p.m. ET and streams the next day on Hulu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSomewhere, Robert Pietranton is smiling and spinning his favorite tune, Bruce Springsteen’s “Walk Like a Man” from the “Tunnel of Love” album. The beloved and well-respected communications exec, who just celebrated his birthday on Nov. 10, died Wednesday in Los Angeles. Pietranton was 56.\n\n\tThe news stunned and saddened the tight-knit Hollywood publicity and journalism communities, particularly the TV execs, publicists and reporters who worked closely with Pietranton during his stints at Warner Bros. TV, Sony Pictures TV and DreamWorks. The cause of his death has not yet been disclosed, but Warner Bros. TV said a celebration of his life will be held at a later date.\n\t\n\n\tPietranton, known for a wide variety of nicknames (this reporter liked to call him “Bobby P”), most recently worked at Warner Bros. TV Group as senior VP, publicity and communications. He had been at Warner Bros. for 20 years, having first joined in 2006 as director of publicity at Warner Bros. Worldwide Television Marketing. \n\n\n\tThe busy Pietranton worked regularly on projects big and small at the studio, including strategic business and written communications. In one recent notable example, just a few weeks ago he helped Variety on this story about how the HBO Max series “The Pitt” would be rolled out on TNT.\n\n\t“To have worked with Robert was truly a joy,” said Rebecca Marks, the exec VP of publicity and communications at Warner Bros. TV Group. “He was kind, honest, and warm, and his ability to connect with the press was widely respected. Most of all, Robert loved this business dearly. He was a consummate executive whose passion for storytelling was evident in everything he did, and we were so lucky to have him in our lives. \n\t\n\n\t“On a personal note, Robert was not only a colleague but a good friend that I could always count on,” she added. “I couldn’t begin to count the times he helped and supported me, along with so many others in our field. I will forever be grateful to him.”\n\n\tPrior to Warner Bros. TV, Pietranton spent time at Sony Pictures TV, where he was VP of media relations. And before that, he oversaw PR at DreamWorks TV. He also spent a bit of time doing some freelance work for Variety, particularly for some of this publication’s specials sections, writing about Clint Eastwood, Regina King, Liev Schreiber and others — you can see his stories here. He began his career at Levine Schneider PR and later worked at NBC Entertainment during its “Must-See TV” era as director of electronic publicity for movies, miniseries and specials.\n\n\tIn its tribute to Pietranton, Warner Bros. TV summed it up perfectly: “Pietranton was known for his calm demeanor under pressure, unwavering kindness, generosity, and decency. He was a rare executive who saw character and work ethic as traits valued over title or pedigree, lessons he often shared. He deliberately avoided the spotlight and was often happiest when those around him received the accolades. He personified the word mensch to those fortunate enough to know him.”\n\n\tAs referenced in the lede to this story, Pietranton was known for his love of Springsteen. Among those many nicknames (which also included “RP,” “BP,” “Piet” and “P”) was “Bobby Gene,” a reference to Springsteen’s song “Bobby Jean.” (And also a reference to his full name, Robert Gene Pietranton.)\n\n\tThe super TV fan also embraced dramas from titans like David Milch, David Chase and David Simon (he wrote about “The Wire” for Variety here). A tribute to Pietranton noted his other passions: “Martin Scorsese, the Pittsburgh Steelers, European soccer, entertainment business trivia, Wordle, and performing small acts of kindness for those around him.”\n\n\tSaid his pal Stu Levine, now at NBC but also a former Variety staffer: “In a comparison I know he would treasure, Robert was the Pele of PR, the Clemente of communication. We bonded over many things, including our absolute love of television. We could have a 30-minute conversation dissecting one scene from ‘Deadwood’ and then an hour conversation about a scene from ‘The Wire’ the very next day. He was my friend. He was my colleague. He was the best.”\n\t\n\n\tRobert Gene Pietranton was born on Nov. 10, 1969, in Virginia to parents Robert G. ‘Piet’ Pietranton and Linda Ann (Cox) Pietranton. He grew up mostly in Las Vegas, attending high school there, where he played soccer. He the graduated from Loyola Marymount University with a bachelor of arts in political science and began his career in PR.\n\n\tDuring his two-decade stint at Waner Bros. TV, the shows he worked on included “Abbott Elementary,” “All American,” “The Bachelor” franchise, “The Big Bang Theory,” the DC “Arrow” verse, “ER,” “Extra,” “Fringe,” “Gossip Girl,” “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” “The Mentalist,” “Mom,” “The Pitt,” “Riverdale,” “Smallville,” “Shameless,” “Shrinking,” “Supernatural,” “Running Point,” “Ted Lasso,” “Two and a Half Men,” “The Voice” and “The West Wing,” among many others.\n\n\t“There are no words to describe just how much Robert has meant to everyone at Warner Bros. Television Group,” said Channing Dungey, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Television Group and WBD US Networks. “He was the heart and soul of not just our publicity department, but of our broader Studio. Throughout his 20+ year tenure, he was our confidant, our voice of reason, and our first stop in a brewing crisis. Beyond his impeccable reputation within our industry, he was most importantly our friend. His kindness and warm laugh will be deeply missed. We are heartbroken beyond measure and are keeping him and his family in our thoughts and prayers.”\n\n\tNews of Pietranton’s death quickly reverberated among colleagues past and present, among those know knew and loved him. “Robert Pietranton was a rare gem of a human being,” said Tammy Golihew, who worked with Pietranton for years at Warner Bros. before she moved to Amazon. “Razor sharp, whip-smart and sporting an encyclopedic knowledge of our industry, he was the G.O.A.T of Written Communications.  He was also funny, supportive and passionate about the things and people that he loved. I am devastated for all of us, who called him friend, that the irreplaceable Bobby P is gone.”\n\n\tAdded Karen Barragan, who worked closely with Pietranton at Sony: “My friend Robert was brilliant, loyal, generous, dependable, and one of the finest strategists I’ve ever known. I loved him as much as he loved Springsteen, and losing him breaks my heart.”\n\t\n\n\tFormer Warner Bros. publicity exec Scott Rowe said: “Robert was kind, funny, and smart – smart as hell. He was a friend to everyone. A true expert on entertainment, he understood not just the business, but the movies, series, and music themselves. I’m not sure there was a film he hadn’t seen or an episode unwatched. One of my greatest joys was making him laugh. It was a great laugh. It’s a laugh I will never forget. It was big, bright, and often punctuated with a hand-clap.”\n\n\tThen there’s former Disney exec Brandon Shaw, who considered Pietranton both a mentor and a friend: “As a young person with an interest in the entertainment business, all I wanted to be was our friend Robert Pietranton. And as my career has evolved, no one was better able to guide and provide counsel in tough times and celebrate the success in the up times than our dear friend. I will miss his life lessons, his ear, his heart and his generosity, and thank him from the bottom of my heart for being such an extraordinary friend to me and my family always. On the backstreets until the end, RP.”\n\n\tPietranton is survived by his brother, Ryan Pietranton, and his nephews Michael and Matthew.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe inaugural Doha Film Festival kicked off Thursday with the official Middle East premiere of Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’s moving drama “The Voice of Hind Rajab” standing as testimony to Qatar’s role as a crucial driver for independent Arab cinema just as the country aims to raise its profile in the global film industry sphere.\n\n\tThe moving opening ceremony on a balmy evening in the Katara Cultural Village marked the first time a presentation of the powerful film – which tells the true story of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl who was stranded in a car that was attacked by Israeli forces in Gaza and later found dead – was attended by the victim’s mother, Wissam Hamada, who on stage said: “I lost my daugther, but I did not lose my humanity.” \n\t\n\n\tHind Rajab’s mother did not watch the film because she is unable to hear the real recording of her daughter’s voice which amplifies its gut-wrenching emotional intensity.\n\n\n\t“There is a huge gathering around the movie in Doha,” Ben Hania told Variety ahead of the screening, noting that it marked the first time its actors met the real Palestinian Red Crescent Society operatives they play in the film. \n\n\tIt’s significant that “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is launching into the region from Qatar, which has been a key mediator in cease-fire negotiations involving Israel and Hamas.\n\n\tDoha Film Institute CEO Fatma Hassan Alremaihi in a speech noted that the DFI was the first entity to provide funding for “The Voice of Hind Rajab” and vowed to take its role to the next level after 15 years during which the DFI has built a solid reputation for fostering quality films mostly from the Arab world.\n\t\n\n\t“DFI has established the golden age of Arab cinema as an essential chapter in the world’s collective story, where long-term commitment meets long-term impact,” she said. “As we turn a new page with Doha Film Festival, we are poised and ready to write the next chapters of our journey to build a global community coming together in dialogue to shape a shared future rooted in purpose and possibility.”\n\n\tDuring the opening ceremony, DFI Chairperson Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thanipresented Egyptian actor Jamal Soliman and France-based Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani (“Body of Lies”) with DFF 2025 Creative Excellence Awards.\n\n\tSteven Soderbergh, Ramy Youssef, Michaela Coel, Mo Amer, Saleh Bakri, Hiam Abbas and Annemarie Jacir are among talents expected on the festival’s red carpet in coming days. Industry execs in attendance include AGC Studios chief Stuart Ford, Neon CEO Tom Quinn and Miramax CEO Jon Glickman.\n\n\tThe Doha Film Festival’s first edition runs Nov. 20-28. \n",

As Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” holds steady at 11 and “Wicked: For Good” pushes into the top tier with nine, the Oscar landscape is taking shape — but it’s still far from settled (or “locked”).\n\n\tDel Toro’s return to the director and adapted screenplay prediction charts for the first time in months signals a meaningful shift in momentum for “Frankenstein.” The film’s surge has also elevated its craft prospects and overall awards narrative, with industry buzz mirroring its climb. \n\n\tOn the performance side, Hailee Steinfeld breaks into the supporting actress lineup for the first time this season, thanks to her standout turn in “Sinners,” and could net her a second career nom after “True Grit” (2010).\n\n\tYet dark horses continue to linger at the edges, threatening to upend any sense of stability. “Ne Zha 2” remains a vibrant player in animated feature, while “Bugonia” is positioned could still surprise in several categories if passion votes stack up. \n\n\tThe first official charts for achievement in casting and original score are out.\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” (14); “Sinners” (13); “Frankenstein” (12); “Hamnet” (11); “Wicked: For Good” (9);\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\tSeason 2 of “The Hunting Party” will feature Niecy Nash-Betts, Eric McCormack and his son Finnigan McCormack as guest stars.\n\n\tThe NBC drama follows “a small team of investigators led by former FBI profiler Rebecca “Bex” Henderson (Melissa Roxburgh) – who are assembled to track down and capture the most dangerous killers the world has ever seen, all of whom have just escaped from the Pit, a top-secret government prison that’s not supposed to exist,” per the official logline.\n\t\n\n\tIn the season premiere, Eric McCormack will play Ron Simms aka the “Boogeyman” killer, who is described as “at large and targeting women who are searching for love. Time is of the essence to stop him before he leaves more than broken hearts behind.” Finnigan McCormack will make his acting debut as a younger version of Simms in a flashback.\n\n\n\tNash-Betts will appear in the second episode of Season 2 as Erica Burke, a detective with a past connection to rural New Mexico serial killer Adrian Gallo, who “preserved his victims in acrylic resin, the same way people preserve insects.” Bex must work with Erica to find Gallo before it’s too late. \n\n\tMcCormack is best known for playing Will in NBC’s “Will & Grace,” which earned him an Emmy for lead comedy actor in 2001. His other TV credits include “Nine Dead Bodies in a Mexican Morgue” on MGM+, “The Other Black Girl” on Hulu and “Travelers” on Netflix as well as TNT’s “Trust Me” and “Perception.” McCormack is repped by Gersh, 3 Arts Entertainment and Sloane Offer Weber and Dern.\n\n\tNash-Betts won a supporting actress Emmy in 2024 for playing Glenda Cleveland in Netflix’s “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” and was most recently seen as Emerald Greene in Hulu’s “All’s Fair.”  Her previous TV credits include FX’s “Grotesquerie,” TNT’s “Claws,” ABC’s “The Rookie: Feds,” HBO’s “Getting On,” Netflix’s “When They See Us,” Fox’s “Scream Queens,” Showtime’s “Master of Sex,” TV Land’s “The Soul Man” and Comedy Central’s “Reno 911.” Nash-Betts is repped by WME and Artists First\n\t\n\n\t“The Hunting Party” returns for Season 2 on Jan. 8 at 10 p.m. Besides Roxburgh, the cast includes Nick Wechsler, Patrick Sabongui, Josh McKenzie and Sara Garcia. JJ Bailey created the series and serves as co-showrunner with Jake Coburn. Both are executive producers alongside director Thor Freudenthal  and writer Michael Jones Morales. Universal Television produces. \n\n\tSee a teaser for Season 2 below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount is betting big on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. \n\n\tA new live-action film is in the works from producer Neal H. Moritz, known for the studio’s “Sonic the Hedgehog” series. No other details have been confirmed but Paramount reportedly wants a family friendly take on the turtle brothers known as Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\n\tWith the kid-friendly edict in mind, Paramount is putting a pin in plans for the R-rated, live-action adaptation “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin,” which the studio announced in 2024. That project, based on the bloody and intense graphic novel series, was being developed by former Warner Bros. chief Walter Hamada and screenwriter Tyler Burton Smith, with “Nobody” helmer Ilya Naishuller in talks to direct. Sources say the film remains in development as a project to revisit in the future, though it likely won’t be anytime soon.\n\t\n\n\tThere hasn’t been a live-action “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” adventure since 2016’s “Out of the Shadows,” which bombed with $245 million against a $135 million budget. Paramount turned to animation with 2023’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” which was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. It became a modest box office hit with $181 million against a $70 million budget. A sequel from Rogen and Goldberg, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2,” is slated to release on Sept. 17, 2027. \n\n\t“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” was created as a comic book series in 1984 by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. The franchise has spawned a toy line, a popular animated series, several video games and seven feature films, which have generated over $1.35 billion at the global box office. \n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tL to R: Cynthia Erivo is Elphaba and Ariana Grande is Glinda in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversal Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Casting Commentary (Updated Nov. 20, 2025): Predicting the inaugural Oscar for achievement in casting is proving to be one of the season’s most interesting exercises. \n\n\tWith no historical precedent and a voting structure that mirrors aspects of best picture — including a 10-film shortlist determined by rank-choice ballots — the new category will reward both discovery and inventive ensemble-building. That opens the door for bold, unconventional choices such as Rebecca Dealy’s exhaustive nationwide search for young performers in Charlie Polinger’s “The Plague,” alongside more traditional showcases of star-power ensembles like “Jay Kelly,” shepherded by Douglas Aibel and Nina Gold.\n\n\tStill, a handful of casting directors have emerged as early favorites. Francine Maisler, long considered an industry titan, could make history with “Sinners,” while Cassandra Kulukundis’ meticulous world-building in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” also feels like a natural fit for the branch. Tiffany Little Canfield and Bernard Telsey’s work on “Wicked: For Good,” packed with high-profile talent and unexpected finds, should find room in the lineup, especially after winning the Casting Guild prize last year.\n\n\tJennifer Venditti has a trio of visually and tonally distinct achievements in “The Smashing Machine,” “Marty Supreme” and “Bugonia” that could easily land in the mix.\n\n\tWhat makes the race even more unpredictable is the bake-off phase, where each shortlisted title must articulate its casting process through a five-minute reel and pre-recorded Q&A. That favors films with clear, demonstrable choices — think uncanny transformations like “Nouvelle Vague,” guided by Stéphane Batut, or franchise reinventions such as “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Story,” cast by Bret Howe and Mary Vernieu. \n\n\tWith additional dark horses ranging from Allison Jones’ “Weapons” to Lindsay Graham and Vernieu’s emotionally charged “Song Sung Blue,” this first-ever category will be a genuine referendum on what voters believe great casting truly means.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited casting director(s) are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of The Space Program, Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Cannes\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Artisans (Best Casting)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of TPS Productions/Focu\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

However, there were reports of them being spotted holding hands in Croatia -- where Chase was recently filming the hit Netflix series.\n      \n    \n          But now, Chase's cryptic posts have fans thinking this could be it.

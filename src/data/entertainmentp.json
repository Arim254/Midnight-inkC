    "body": "\n\tDisney fans behold: “Disneyland Handcrafted,” a new feature documentary from producer and director Leslie Iwerks, will premiere — and be available to stream — on Disney+ and Disney YouTube on Jan. 22. Built from rare archival footage and original audio recordings, the film will give viewers an inside look into the magic of Walt Disney’s dream and the extraordinary artistry and grit it took to create The Happiest Place on Earth. \n\t\n\n\tDisneyland has been operating for more than 70 years. But Disney wasn’t built in a day, and “Disneyland Handcrafted” tells the tale of how the park came to be the iconic spot it is today ahead of its opening on July 17, 1955. Through newly unearthed materials from the Walt Disney Archives, Iwerks and her team uncovered previously forgotten 16mm film reels and audio recordings that aim to bring audiences along for the tumultuous year ahead of the park’s creation, capturing both the legacy and nostalgia leading up to the creation of the Disneyland Resort. \n\n\n\tFirsthand accounts from the artists, craftsmen and Imagineers who were there also provide insights into the park’s creation, creating a fly-on-the-wall perspective aimed to capture what was truly happening behind the scenes. \n\n\n\tIwerks herself also has a special connection to Disney; she’s the daughter of Don Iwerks, a former Disney executive, and the granddaughter of Ub Iwerks, the animator and co-creator behind Mickey Mouse. Her previous projects include “The Imagineering Story,” “The Pixar Story” and “League of Legends: Origins.” \n\t\n\t\tSPECIALS\t\n\n\tThe ABC News year-end special “What You Need to Know: 2025” has premiered exclusively on Disney+.\n\t\n\n\tHosted by correspondents James Longman and Rachel Scott, the special episode will highlight memorable stories that defined the year.\n\n\t“In under 15 minutes, we took the stories that people couldn’t escape and brought them together in a way that is uniquely ‘What You Need to Know,’” Longman and Scott said in a joint statement. “When we sign off, our hope is that viewers feel a little more informed, a little more hopeful, and reminded that even in a whirlwind of headlines, we’re all sharing this story together.”\n\n\tFrom global reporting and politics to pop culture headlines and viral videos, “What You Need to Know: 2025″ will unpack the biggest moments in under 15 minutes.\n\n\t“What You Need to Know” launched in July 2025 with morning episodes streaming exclusively on Disney+ and expanded in July to twice-daily episodes so viewers can follow the top stories and headlines as they continue to develop. It is ABC News’ first daily streaming news series exclusive to Disney+.\n\t\n\t\tPROGRAMMING\t\n\n\tTurner Classic Movies will honor the life and career of filmmaker Rob Reiner with a programming tribute of his most popular films on Jan. 28, 2026.\n\n\t“The profound sense of loss we’re all feeling is heightened by Rob’s lofty standing in Hollywood; he was universally loved inside the entertainment industry,” Ben Mankiewicz, TCM host, said in a statement. \n\n\tHe continued, “I did not know him as well as I would have liked, but he always made me feel like we had been pals for decades. Rob’s character was defined by the qualities we see in those films: kindness, decency, humor, compassion, and most of all, a belief in humanity.”\n\n\tThe tribute will be headlined by a special premiere presentation of “The Princess Bride” with “When Harry Met Sally,” “Stand By Me” and “This Is Spinal Tap” to follow.\n\n\t*\n\n\tThe documentary “Roads of Fire” has set a TVOD release date, becoming available across Amazon, Apple TV and Fandango at Home starting Jan. 6.\n\n\tDirected by Nathaniel Lezra, “Roads of Fire” provides a look into human smuggling and migration, following three different stories of individuals and groups on perilous journeys towards prospective freedom.\n\n\tThe film won Best Documentary at the 2025 Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the Audience Award at the Brooklyn Film Festival and Best Cinematography at the Pacific Northwest Documentary Showcase.\n\t\n\n\tThe TVOD release marks the film’s first nationwide digital availability following its limited theatrical and festival runs.\n\t\n\t\tPARTNERSHIPS\t\n\n\tThe Fox-owned Los Angeles duopoly KTTV Fox 11 and KCOP Fox 11+ has been named the official media partner of the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment Commission, the company announced Thursday. As an official partner, the stations and its digital property, Fox Local, will provide coverage of marquee events with a focus on the upcoming FIFA World Cup 26 and Super Bowl LXI in 2027. \n\n\t“We’re proud to welcome Fox 11 as our Official Media Partner at a time when Los Angeles is preparing to host some of the world’s most iconic events,” said Kathryn Schloessman, president & CEO of the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission, in a statement. “With their support, we can recognize the organizations that make it all possible and celebrate the unique opportunity our region has over the next three years.”\n\n\tThrough exclusive access, in-depth reporting and behind-the-scenes content from events, Fox 11 will provide Angelenos with compelling content across digital, broadcast and social platforms, with a special focus on showcasing the ways Los Angeles locals can be part of the major events coming to their city.  \n\n\t“We are honored to partner with LASEC during this historic and thrilling year for Los Angeles and to provide Angelenos with a backstage pass to the most prestigious events and sports happening locally and on the world stage,” added Amber Eikel, senior vice president and regional general manager of Fox Los Angeles and San Francisco duopolies, in a statement. “We are ready to highlight our communities, as well as celebrate each momentous occasion leading up to, during and after the World Cup and Super Bowl.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKristen Stewart recently told “Entertainment Tonight” that she “would love” to direct a reboot of “Twilight,” the 2008 vampire romantasy film that launched her career.\n\n\t“I would love — look. I love what Catherine [Hardwicke] did, I love what Chris [Weitz] did, I love what all of the directors did with the movies,” Stewart said. “They were so themselves and weird and kind of like, squirrelly, and just so present in that time when they didn’t really know what they were yet, like before they blew up.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart said ideally, she would receive a “huge budget” and “a bunch of love and support” from fans for the hypothetical project.\n\n\n\t“Yeah, sure, I’ll do the remake,” she added. “I’m doing it! I’m committed!”\n\n\tStewart starred in the “Twilight” franchise alongside Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. The 2008 original spawned four sequels: 2009’s “New Moon,” 2010’s “Eclipse,” 2011’s “Breaking Dawn – Part 1” and 2012’s “Breaking Dawn – Part 2.” The series grossed more than $3 billion in total at the worldwide box office.\n\n\tWhile Stewart is happy to return to Forks, Wash., Pattinson may not be so quick to buy in. He told GQ in 2022 that he spent much of his time on the “Twilight” set “infuriated” because the studio did not agree with his vision of the film.\n\n\t“I wanted to make it as arty as possible,” Pattinson said at the time. “We had this strange tension where the studio was scared to make things a little bit too emo and stuff. I thought that was the only way to play it. I spent so much time [on set] infuriated… I can’t believe the way I was acting half the time.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart recently made her directorial debut with “The Chronology of Water.” Starring Imogen Poots, Thora Birch and Jim Belushi, the film follows a woman who copes with her childhood trauma through swimming and the written word. The film landed Stewart on Variety‘s annual 10 Directors to Watch for 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe actors are about to have their say.\n\n\tThe Screen Actors Guild Awards may have a new name, but their importance in the Oscar race is as vital as ever. Now called the Actor Awards, nominations will be announced Jan. 7. With more than 122,000 SAG-AFTRA performers eligible to vote — the largest voting body of any major awards show — the results often reflect populist tastes and broad mainstream appeal.\n\n\n\tThis year’s eligibility window covers performances released between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2025, setting up what appears to be a competitive field across all categories.\n\t\n\n\tSince the ensemble category was introduced in 1995, only four films — “Braveheart” (1995), “The Shape of Water” (2017), “Green Book” (2018) and “Nomadland” (2020) — have gone on to win best picture at the Academy Awards without earning a SAG ensemble nomination. Since the Academy expanded the best picture field in 2009, 61 of the 80 films nominated for SAG ensemble — a 76% success rate — have also received best picture nominations, underscoring the category’s value as a reliable Oscar indicator.\n\n\tThe ensemble race is as crowded as ever. \n\n\tWarner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” is entering as an early frontrunner with a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn, and a lineup that fits the guild’s well-established preference for recognizable names. There’s also some history to possibly be made. At a projected seven nominations, Paul Thomas Anderson’s action epic is poised to become the most nominated movie in the history of SAG. And there’s still room for one more in case Regina Hall makes the cut in supporting actress alongside Teyana Taylor.\n\t\n\n\tThe list of the most nominated films in SAG history is currently a six-way tie with five each: “Shakespeare in Love” (1998), “Chicago” (2002), “Doubt” (2008), “The Banshees of Inisherin” (2022), “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022) and “Wicked” (2024). Of those, “Shakespeare,” “Chicago” and “Everything Everywhere” went on to win the SAG Award for best cast ensemble before clinching the Academy Award for best picture. “Doubt” took home best actress at SAG for Meryl Streep (but lost the Oscar) while “Banshees” and “Wicked” both went home empty-handed.\n\n\tObviously, SAG’s predictive strength extends to the film acting races as well. Since 2009, SAG’s film acting nominees have overlapped with the Academy Awards an average of 16 out of 20 slots, an 80% match rate. The strongest alignment came in 2009, the year of “The Hurt Locker,” when 19 of 20 SAG nominees went on to earn Oscar nominations. The weakest crossover occurred in 2021, the year of “CODA,” when the overlap dropped to 12 of 20.\n\n\tLast year’s best actor winner, Timothée Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), continues his momentum and is back with his turn as table tennis prodigy Marty Mauser in Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme.” Notably, no film actor has ever won back-to-back SAG Awards. That could open the door for someone else to take the top spot. Nonetheless, DiCaprio, Michael B. Jordan and Ethan Hawke are all expected to hear their names called. The organization has not been kind to non-English language performances, which is why a snub is projected for “The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura. Despite emphatic praise from critics, the guild’s longstanding hesitation to nominate non-English language performances — see Sandra Hüller’s omission for “Anatomy of a Fall” — remains a barrier.\n\n\tStill, there is some expected recognition for non-English storytelling with Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas all predicted to make their respective lineups for the Norwegian family drama “Sentimental Value.”\n\n\tActors who are mainstays at the ceremony such as Glenn Close (who has 10 individual nominations and could appear for “Wake Up Dead Man”) or William H. Macy, who could find his way to a nomination for his work in “Train Dreams,” which is predicted to land in the cast ensemble category.\n\t\n\n\tOn the television side, the drama series race will likely be dominated by streaming platforms, with Apple TV’s “Severance” and HBO Max’s “The White Lotus” expected to lead the pack alongside Netflix’s final season of “Stranger Things.” In comedy, FX’s “The Bear” and HBO’s “Hacks” remain fixtures, while Apple TV could break through with Seth Rogen’s “The Studio.” \n\n\tSome of the other individual acting categories showcase a mix of established favorites and veterans — Jean Smart, Jeremy Allen White, Adam Scott — and relative newcomers like Glen Powell for “Chad Powers.” \n\n\tThe limited series categories are heavily weighted toward Netflix, which could claim as many as eight of the 10 nomination slots across both male and female actor categories, led by their Emmy-winning miniseries “Adolescence.”\n\n\tNominations will be announced Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. Final voting to determine the winners will take place from Jan. 14 through Feb. 27 at noon Pacific time. The 32nd annual Actor Awards, presented by SAG-AFTRA, will air live on Netflix on March 1.\n\n\tThe final predictions in all film and TV categories are below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFilm Categories\n\n\tCast Ensemble in a Motion Picture\n\n\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n“Marty Supreme” (A24)\n“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) \n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\n\n\tAlternates: “Sentimental Value” and “Wicked: For Good”\n\n\tMale Actor in a Leading Role\n\n\nTimothée Chalamet, “Marty Supreme” (A24)\nLeonardo DiCaprio, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\nJoel Edgerton, “Train Dreams” (Netflix)\nEthan Hawke, “Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics) \nMichael B.

    "body": "\n\tCon Pederson, one of four special effects supervisors on “2001: A Space Odyssey,” died Friday at the MPTF residence in Woodland Hills following complications from Alzheimer’s. He was 91. \n\n\tPederson was a fixture in the field of science fiction filmmaking, particularly thanks to his involvement on Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” in 1968. Alongside three other special effects supervisors including Douglas Trumbull, Wally Veevers and Tom Howard, Pederson’s work led the director to his Oscar win for best visual effects in 1969. On set, Pederson ran the “war room,” where the VFX shots were planned, scheduled, tracked and evaluated. For each shot, anywhere from eight to ten elements were added to the original camera negative, an intricate process that took months.\n\t\n\n\tIn Michael Benson’s 2018 book “Space Odyssey,” the author quotes Trumbull as saying, “The film’s post-production process was epic in its complexity and Con was the smartest guy in the room.” He added that “‘2001’ absolutely would not have happened without Con.”\n\n\n\tAfter working on the film, Pederson went on to co-found pioneering computer animation company Robert Abel and Associates, where he worked as an animator and programmer alongside Bob Abel. Following the company’s closing, he continued as a creative lead at Metrolight Studios alongside Tim McGovern. \n\n\t“Con was a constant source of wisdom and knowledge,” said John Nelson, who met Pederson during his time at Robert Abel and Associates. “He was a Renaissance man who was both an artist and a technician. He could animate by hand or write computer programs to generate animations. Several people from Robert Abel’s went on to win Oscars for Visual Effects. I was lucky enough to be one of them.” \n\t\n\n\tBefore Pederson began his career in the film industry, he attended UCLA, where he majored in art and anthropology. During his time there, Pederson was hired at Disney after making student films. He was then drafted into the U.S. Army, where he worked with Wernher von Braun on rocket projects. Pederson went on to work at Graphic Films following his time, where he wrote and directed the 1964 film “To The Moon And Beyond” for the world’s fair. Kubrick saw the film, and thus hired Pederson to work on “2001: A Space Odyssey.”  \n\n\tOutside of work, he created crossword puzzles that were published across the New York Times, the Wall St. Journal and the Washington Post, and loved science fiction, hiking, sailing and collecting and building things with bricks he had collected from all over the country.\n\n\tPederson is survived by his wife Carole and his son Eric, stepchildren Tracey and Morgan and grandchildren Alex and Vivi.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\tJan 5, 2026 3:42pm PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOscar Predictions: Film Editing — Why This Category Remains Best Picture’s Strongest Tell\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\tVariety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety chief awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGwyneth Paltrow in ‘Marty Supreme’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Film Editing Commentary (Updated Jan. 5, 2026): Since film editing became an Oscar category in 1934, its connection to the best picture race has been unmistakable. From 1981 through 2013, every best picture winner was also nominated for film editing, a remarkable 33-year streak that helped cement the category as one of the Academy’s most reliable predictors. Roughly two-thirds of best picture winners have gone on to win the editing Oscar.\n\n\tThat pattern has cracked only twice in the expanded best picture era. “Birdman” (2014) and “CODA” (2021) both won best picture without editing nominations.\n\n\tThis year’s editing race showcases radically different philosophies of cinematic rhythm. \n\n\t“Hamnet” and “Marty Supreme” represent one of the season’s most intriguing case studies, particularly because of the filmmakers’ hands-on approach. Josh Safdie and Chloé Zhao co-editing their own films places them in exceedingly rare company. Only three directors have ever won the Oscar for film editing — James Cameron for “Titanic,” Alfonso Cuarón for “Gravity” and Sean Baker for “Anora.” Others, including David Lean, the Coen brothers (working under the alias Roderick Jaynes) and Zhao herself, have previously earned editing nominations for films they directed.\n\n\tAnother crucial factor shaping the race is the long-standing bond between film editing and sound. Since 2013, no two Oscar categories have demonstrated a stronger statistical relationship, regardless of whether sound was split into editing and mixing or combined into a single award. During the split-sound era, films such as “Gravity,” “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Dunkirk” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” swept both editing and sound. Even when the overlap was partial, the connection held. “Hacksaw Ridge” won editing and sound mixing in 2016, while “Ford v Ferrari” took editing and sound editing in 2019.\n\n\tThat relationship has loosened in recent years. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022) won editing without a sound nom. “Oppenheimer” (2023) claimed editing but lost sound to “The Zone of Interest.” Last year, “Anora” won editing without a sound nod, while “Dune: Part Two” took home the statue.\n\n\tAgainst that backdrop, “F1” vrooms into the conversation as a potential disruptor. Fresh off a Critics Choice Award win for editing and powered by its commercial success and broad appeal, the high-octane racing drama has been registering beyond the craft branches. If its momentum carries through the guild phase, “F1” could position itself as a film testing the edges of a best picture nom as well.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Neon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: 20th Century Studios\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Eros Hoagland/Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tMarketecture Media, a business-to-business podcasting, content, community and events firm covering advertising and marketing, announced $1 million in funding from top industry execs. \n\n\tExisting and new investors in Marketecture are David Rosenblatt, Rob Norman, Phil Fresen, David Hertog, Scott Messer, Breakpoint Capital’s Jim Payne, Aperiam Ventures and Momentum. \n\n\tNew York-based Marketecture said the funding will be used for organic growth and potential acquisitions. Founded in 2022, the company said last year marked its transition “from a niche podcasting operation to a multifaceted B2B powerhouse.” In 2025, Marketecture completed six M&A transactions of content and community sites, including Adland.tv’s archive of TV spots and the Serial Marketers community of brand and agency executives. The company also hosted two sold-out Marketecture Live conferences.\n\t\n\n\tThe company’s podcast lineup includes “The Marketecture Podcast” and “AdTechGod,” and its newsletters include “The Refresh,” “Monopoly Report” and “Marketecture.”\n\n\n\tIn 2026, the company plans to host the third edition of its flagship conference, Marketecture Live III, March 10-11 in New York City. The event, expected to attracted 1,000 industry professionals, is produced in partnership with Adweek and TVREV; more info is available at marketecturemedia.com. \n\n\t“Marketecture was built on the premise that true experts are best placed to explain new concepts, new companies, and new ways of doing business,” Jeremy Bloom, co-founder and CEO of Marketecture, said in a statement. “We started by doing this in podcasts and have since expanded to newsletters, video series, digital communities, and live events. It’s a rare combination of high-quality content, industry expertise, and human connection that is of clear value to the marketing and tech communities.”\n\t\n\n\tCompany co-fonder Ari Paparo, who is the host of “The Marketecture Podcast,” added, “Instead of defending legacy ways, Marketecture is leaning into the shifts — deeply covering pressing industry issues through its AI Marketers Guild community, policy wonk pod and newsletter ‘The Monopoly Report,’ and the AI-powered news reader Maddb.ai. We’re in the business of educating the industry and talking to people who are actively making the advertising world better.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil’s debut as the anchor of the “CBS Evening News” came widely heralded — by Tony Dokoupil.\n\n\tThe broadcast journalist, who since 2019 had been CBS’ morning show co-anchor, came into the seat once held by Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and Katie Couric with plenty of attitude, saying in a recent social-media comment that he would be “more accountable and more transparent” than had been legendary anchor Cronkite and, on New Year’s Day, sharing a video in which he declared his broadcast had often “missed the story” by privileging “the perspective of advocates and not the average American.” \n\t\n\n\tAll of which conveniently mirrored the career-long attitude of Dokoupil’s new boss; Bari Weiss, the opinion journalist brought in last year as CBS News’ editor-in-chief by new Paramount leader David Ellison, has long evinced a relentless focus on presenting her perspective as that of the common man, no matter how many of her fellow Sun Valley attendees may coincidentally share it. \n\n\n\tDokoupil carried out the brief. On his hurriedly moved-up debut Saturday night, before his official start date, the anchor covered the U.S. capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro almost exclusively through a lengthy but unchallenging interview of U.S. defense secretary Pete Hegseth, one in which the administration’s perspective was aired so thoroughly as to raise the question of when an interview becomes a press release. (In this aspect, Dokoupil’s work certainly suited the Weiss doctrine: The news chief’s first big scandal on the job arose right before Christmas when she held a “60 Minutes” segment over its not sufficiently representing the side of the administration, who had declined comment in the first place. For Weiss, it may not be news if the nation’s current leadership doesn’t get an unchallenged say.) \n\t\n\n\tAnd in his official first broadcast on Jan. 5, Dokoupil betrayed a Weissian willingness to bulldoze past that which might seem too untidy for whatever hypothetical viewer he and his editor have in mind. Dokoupil blandly stated to the camera that a Russian-Chinese-Iranian base of influence in Venezuela will be destabilized by the U.S. military action, without citing any source or consulting any guest; a brief interview with a financial expert about how the events in South America will affect the price of gasoline never broached the notion of whether the U.S. extracting Venezuelan petroleum is legal. Perhaps that might have constituted consulting advocates, and not the average American. But it would have been part of telling the whole story. \n\n\tNot that that seems to be Dokoupil’s strong suit, or his interest. Elsewhere, in a segment about health and human services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s newly announced and seismic shifts to the recommended vaccine schedule for children, Dokoupil began an interview with a CBS News medical journalist by asking what this expert would say to “parents out there who are celebrating,” because they thought their kids were obliged to be injected with too many vaccines. He ended the segment by declaring “So, parents are going to have some options for themselves!” when, to a large portion of the audience, the precise opposite is true — they’ll now need a physician consult to obtain a vaccine for their child that was once more easily obtained. Dokoupil thanked his guest and announced, brashly, “You clarified it for us.” The guest could be said to have tried his best, despite Dokoupil. \n\n\tWeiss has been reported to have pursued Fox’s Bret Baier and CNN’s Anderson Cooper for this role, but after both stars wisely chose to keep their sinecures, she likely had to choose from among the army she had — but Dokoupil lacks the charisma and aptitude to turn the “Evening News” into whatever it is she may want. He babbled confusedly, then fell silent, when a segment about Sen. Mark Kelly jumped ahead of a segment about Gov. Tim Walz in the lineup — the kind of shift an anchor is supposed to be able to handle without painfully long seconds of dead air. “First day, big problems here,” Dokoupil said with evident frustration.\n\t\n\n\tAnd an newscast-ending segment about a small town in Oregon raising funds by selling a nude calendar of senior citizens felt neither like the news (the movie “Calendar Girls,” about a similar real-life case in the U.K., is more than 20 years old) nor conveyed with wit, elan — or even access. Weiss’ journalism, through her career, has many things that distinguish it, but it fundamentally lacks sensibility. Why was just broadcasting a bunch of nude photos of senior citizens a story? So that Dokoupil could giggle through it. \n\n\tThankfully, just like parents, viewers have some options for themselves — and few, it seems likely, will choose this reboot. The hypothetical viewer who wishes their news were pitched at a more conservative tenor is super-served by Fox News and Newsmax; evening newscast viewership has been dropping across the board, and, in terms of comfort in the chair and ability to convey thought, Dokoupil has a way to go and will likely move in the wrong direction. Say this much, though: Weiss’ management of “60 Minutes” has so far been a tragedy, in that it is shattering the credibility and prestige of what remains to this day one of the signature, and most popular, programs of any type in American television. The “Evening News” has been ebbing into irrelevance for years for reasons entirely beyond political slant. Perhaps sequestering Dokoupil there might contain the damage that might be done by an anchor whose ambitious ability to see which way the wind blows has so far outstripped his broadcasting talent.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWinona Ryder recently revealed to Netflix’s Tudum that she only filmed the climactic moment in which Joyce beheads Vecna with an ax in the “Stranger Things” series finale two times. The scene marked Ryder’s last one with Vecna actor Jamie Campbell Bower. \n\n\t“I love Jamie so much,” Ryder said. “I remember when he was in that position and we were talking about bands, and he’s the most lovely person. I came in that day just for that. You can’t rehearse a scene like that. You just have to sort of save it for the take. I think I only did it twice.”\n\t\n\n\tThe beheading occurs right after Joyce tells Vecna: “You fucked with the wrong family.” The iconic lines marks the rare uses of the F-word in “Stranger Things'” history.\n\n\t“We haven’t used the F-word in the show, and we’ve been looking for a moment for it,” series co-creator Matt Duffer told Tudum. “I think Dacre [Montgomery, who played Billy] muttered it without us wanting him to in Season 3’s ‘The Sauna Test’ [Episode 4]. So I guess this technically doesn’t count as the first time, but we were looking for a real moment that would deserve stronger language and we’ve been saving it and felt like, well, if we’re going to go there, this is the moment for it. Let’s give it to Winona.”\n\n\tRoss Duffer said in an interview with Variety that the “Stranger Things” writers room debated which character should get the final blow on Vecna and having Joyce behead the villain “felt right for a lot of reasons.” \n\n\t“She is sort of the mother of this group, the protector,” Ross said. “And also, we never got to see her hit anything with that ax, so that felt like such a satisfying way to deliver the final blow to Vecna. But it was in editorial really, where, as we were working on it, that we had the initial flashbacks to her remembering back to Bob, and building up that anger. It felt right that it’s just not just a ‘fuck yeah’ moment. It was also, in a way, a cathartic moment for our characters, who are purging all this trauma that’s been caused here. It’s not just a stand-up and cheer moment. It’s remembering that this evil has caused them so much pain.”\n\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer added: I remember working with our editor and our composer and just talking to them and going, ‘Let’s make this the most emotional decapitation in history.’ That was the goal.”\n\n\t“Stranger Things 5” is streaming in its entirety on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis is the first year that cinematography has been included in the Oscar shortlist, and on the list are such familiar names as Dan Laustsen, Guillermo del Toro’s go-to DP, and Robbie Ryan, who works regularly with Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\n\tBut there’s a trend: three women made the cut, Autumn Durald Arkapaw (“Sinners”), Alice Brooks (“Wicked: For Good”) and Amy Vincent (“Song Sung Blue”).\n\n\n\tIn the history of the category, no woman has ever won the Oscar for cinematography, and only three women have ever been nominated: Rachel Morrison in 2018 for “Mudbound,” Ari Wegner in 2021 for “The Power of the Dog” and Mandy Walker in 2022 for “Elvis.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year, Arkapaw made history as the first female cinematographer to shoot on Imax 65mm and Ultra Panavision for “Sinners,” and looks like a front-runner. With a win, she would not only be the first womanto win the category, she would also be the first Filipina/African American to win an Oscar for cinematography.\n\n\tArkapaw and Coogler went out to the desert near Lancaster, Calif., and tested IMAX 35mm and 65mm, with Coogler showing a keen interest in showcasing the landscape — an idea inspired by Quentin Tarantino‘s “The Hateful Eight,” which was shot on 65mm film using Ultra Panavision 70mm. “We screened those tests at FotoKem and the headquarters of IMAX. After you see what you created, you can’t unsee that stuff,” Arkapaw said.\n\n\tEmotions were key to “Wicked” and its conclusion, “Wicked: For Good.” “The first movie would live in this effervescent daylight and the second film would be steeped in maturity and density and have a weight to it,” Brooks says. “As we were designing it, ‘Wicked: For Good’ has this handmade feel to it, but it also feels textured and raw and edgy.”\n\t\n\n\tBrooks used every color of the rainbow to light the movie. Each scene, color meant something. “Red is when you make the wrong choice. You see that in a lot in the governor’s mansion. Orange is the color of Elphaba’s transformation, and you see it with the flames and with ‘No Dood Deed.'” And blue, Brooks says is the color of love between the two. You first see in the Ozdust Ballroom surrounding and then you see it for the color of the moonlight in ‘For Good.”\n\n\tBut, it’s going to be a tough choice for voters to whittle down the field, given the levels of achievement on display. Among the familiar artisans on the shortlist are two-time Oscar nominee Seamus McGarvey for “Die My Love”; Łukasz Żal, also a two-time nominee, for “Hamnet”; Darius Khondji returns to the race looking for a third nomination with “Marty Supreme”; “One Battle After Another’s” Michael Bauman, who looks to be a front-runner for a nom, as does Oscar-winner Claudio Miranda for his work on “F1.” “All Quiet on the Western Front” Oscar-winner James Friend returns to the race with “Ballad of a Small Player.”\n\n\tNew to the Oscar campaign are David Chambille, who shot “Nouvelle Vague” in black and white on the streets of Paris; Kasper Tuxen’s interiors for “Sentimental Value,” which added to the secrets and untold emotions of the film’s main family; “Sirât,” in which Mauro Herce shot raves and majestic landscapes in the North African desert; Fabian Gamper’s work on “Sound of Falling,” which translates the generational trauma in the film; and “Train Dreams,” in which Adolpho Veloso, who just won the Critics Choice Award for best cinematography, let the magnificent landscape of the Pacific Northwest speak for itself.\n",

As the phase one period for Oscar nominations enters its final, volatile stretch, a few unexpected titles are beginning to press against what once looked like a locked best picture lineup. \n\n\tRichard Linklater’s “Blue Moon” from Sony Pictures Classics continues to build serious word of mouth and is quietly building a deep bench of admirers behind the scenes. To the point that a surprise best picture nomination no longer feels far-fetched. The film’s quiet momentum — the kind that grows through admiration rather than spectacle — is exactly how late-breaking contenders have slipped into the lineup in the past.\n\n\tJoseph Kosinski’s “F1,” fresh off two major wins at the Critics Choice Awards, is also testing the edges of the race. There is almost always room for what might be called a “normal people” movie — accessible, star-driven and emotionally legible — in the best picture field. Think “The Blind Side” or “Top Gun: Maverick.” The Apple studios high-octane racing drama starring Brad Pitt fits that mold, but its viability likely hinges on securing a nomination from the Producers Guild of America, which announces Friday.\n\n\tHow many international feature films will be in best picture remains another open question, particularly among Neon’s contenders. Joachim Trier’s Norwegian drama “Sentimental Value” feels solidly positioned, but whether the Academy embraces more than one non-English-language film is still unclear. Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Brazilian thriller and Critics Choice winner “The Secret Agent,” alongside Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident,” are both in play, though space feels very limited.\n\n\tElsewhere, Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” is gathering momentum across categories. Jacob Elordi’s surprise Critics Choice win for supporting actor as the Creature has helped reposition the film as more than a technical showcase, giving it renewed credibility in the above-the-line conversations.\n\n\tOver the weekend, the Palm Springs International Film Awards gala delivered its annual blend of star power. Next on the awards docket are SAG noms on Wednesday, Golden Globes Awards arriving Sunday night and Oscar nomination voting opening Monday morning.\n\n\tAt the Critics Choice Awards, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” swept best picture, director and adapted screenplay. The acting winners included Timothee Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”), Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”), Elordi and Amy Madigan (“Weapons”). Whether or not they can all translate remains to be seen.\n\n\tStill, the race is far from unsettled. Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” which co-led all films with four wins at CCA, could be a late-breaking spoiler, if the coalition remains intact.\n\n\tThis week’s updated predictions are below.\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): \n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): \n\n\t*** = PREDICTED WINNER(All predicted nominees listed below are in alphabetical order)\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Picture\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Credit: Sabrina Lantos\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics)“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)“Frankenstein” (Netflix)“Hamnet” (Focus Features) “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)“Marty Supreme” (A24)“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) ***“Sentimental Value” (Neon)“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)“Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\tOscar category page with rankings>>>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDirector\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ken Woroner/Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson ***“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)Ryan Coogler“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)Guillermo Del Toro“Frankenstein” (Netflix)Jafar Panahi“It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)Chloé Zhao“Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n\n\tOscar category page with rankings>>>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tActor\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTimothée Chalamet “Marty Supreme” (A24)Leonardo DiCaprio “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)Ethan Hawke ***“Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics)Michael B.

The rep also said ... \"Hilton Hotels serve as welcoming places for all\" and \"the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values.\"\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The spokesperson went on ... \"We are investigating this matter with this individual hotel, and can confirm that Hilton works with governments, law enforcement, and community leaders around the world to ensure our properties are open and inviting to everyone.\"\n      \n    \n          We'll keep you updated ... stay tuned.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                ICE\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

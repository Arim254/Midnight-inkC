    "body": "\n\tThe 2026 Genesis Invitational tees off today at the historic Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, California. After being relocated to Torrey Pines Golf Course in 2025 due to the Los Angeles wildfires, the tournament returns to Riviera for its 100th playing — a milestone year for one of the PGA Tour’s most storied stops.\n\n\tTitle sponsor Genesis Motor also announced a five-year extension, keeping its name on the event through 2030 and reaffirming its commitment to what has become one of the Tour’s signature events.\n\n\n\tThe field is loaded. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler returns as defending champion, while Collin Morikawa arrives fresh off a win at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Former champions and major winners including Rory McIlroy, Viktor Hovland, and Patrick Cantlay round out a field worthy of the centennial stage. With a $20 million purse and elevated status on the schedule, the Genesis Invitational has increasingly become one of the most consequential early-season tournaments on Tour.\n\n\tThis year, tournament host Tiger Woods continues to expand his influence within the PGA Tour, now serving as Chairman of the Tour’s Future Competitions Committee. In that role, Woods has been involved in evaluating schedule structure, competitive balance, and postseason formats. Woods and Genesis Motors CEO Jose Munoz announced the sponsor extension, sparking discussion of whether the Genesis Invitational could eventually evolve into a FedExCup playoff event as part of potential adjustments to the Tour calendar. Nothing has been finalized, but the idea underscores how central this tournament has become.\n\n\n\t“We’re looking at everything,” said Wood’s. “Something’s we say are nixed off the table and other opportunities that have grown and we’ve fleshed out. We represent the entire player body and we’re trying to bring the best [schedule] we possibly can for all of our partners and fans, everyone involved.”\n\n\tThe return to Riviera for its 100th edition, combined with Genesis’ renewed sponsorship and Woods’ growing executive role, gives this year’s event added significance beyond the leaderboard.\n\n\tCoverage of the Genesis Invitational begins Thursday, February 19, with morning rounds streamed live on ESPN+. Throughout the weekend, Golf Channel and CBS will air featured groups and key holes, ensuring fans can follow the most important moments from every round. If you want to stream the 2026 Genesis Invitational without a full cable subscription, there are several options with free trials or subscriptions to fit your viewing preferences.\n\n\tDIRECTV carries both Golf Channel and CBS, so you can follow all featured groups and marquee holes. New users can take advantage of a five-day free trial, with subscriptions starting at $45.99/month for ongoing access.\n\n\tFuboTV also gives you live access to the Genesis Invitational’s featured groups and marquee holes on Golf Channel and CBS. New subscribers can try it free for 7 days, with plans starting at $48.99/month for a limited time.\n\n\tHulu + Live TV includes both CBS and Golf Channel, and when paired with the ESPN+ and Disney+ bundle, you get full access to all tournament coverage. Subscriptions start at $35.99/month and include Hulu’s complete on-demand library.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWise Child Studios has named veteran executive producer and showrunner Leslie Mattingly as head of documentary as the company expands its nonfiction team following the debut of “Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model” on Netflix. \n\n\t“We are happy to be growing in such a challenging business environment,” said Wise Child Studios co-founder and CEO Jason Beekman. “Wise Child Studios was formed as a lean, nimble company with the reach of a full-service production shop, and that philosophy has led to incredible momentum in just over two years.”\n\t\n\n\tWise Child is riding high on the success of “Reality Check,” which has been buzzy since its Feb. 16 premiere.

During her tenure, she collaborated with award-winning filmmakers including Joe Berlinger and Skye Borgman. She most recently led the History Channel’s mega-documentary series “The Great War,” overseeing production across multiple locations, including scripted sequences shot in Cape Town.\n\n\tMattingly also spent more than 15 years as a senior staff producer with NBC’s former long-form unit, Peacock Productions.\n\n\tWise Child Studios also executive produced the feature documentary “Asco: Without Permission” alongside executive producers Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal. The film has screened at more than 15 festivals, including its premiere at SXSW 2025. It also opened the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival and screened at the New York Latino Film Festival, Chicago International Film Festival and Heartland International Film Festival, with additional screenings at MoMA, The Met and the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.\n\t\n\n\tSince its founding in 2023, Wise Child Studios has focused on streamlining the creative process by pairing strong strategic leadership with in-house legal counsel, enabling the development of high-end projects on smaller budgets. In just one year, the company has built a highly curated catalog spanning scripted and nonfiction series, features and formats.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHulu is developing a comedy series from Zoe Young that has Chelsea Handler attached to executive produce and potentially star. \n\n\tThe potential series is titled “Townhouse.” Per the official logline, the show follows “a washed-up reality star and her live-in entourage of misfits as they scramble to rehab her image and reboot her career. When her estranged daughter unexpectedly moves into their crumbling Manhattan townhouse, the TV has-been is confronted with the one role she’s spent her entire life avoiding: motherhood.” \n\t\n\n\tShould the show move forward, Handler would play the lead role. Young is the creator, writer, and executive producer on the project. 20th Television is the studio. \n\n\n\tThe show would mark Young’s first TV writing credit. She is a 2025 graduate of USC’s Writing for Screen & Television MFA program. \n\n\tHandler is a celebrated stand up comedian and show host. In addition to her stand up career, she is best known for hosting the late-night talk show “Chelsea Lately” at E! for seven seasons. She followed that up with shows like “Chelsea” and “Chelsea Does” at Netflix. As an actress, Handler has been in shows like “Not Dead Yet,” “The Comeback,” and “The Good Wife.” She also starred in the E! sketch comedy series “The Chelsea Handler Show,” while the NBC sitcom “Are You There, Chelsea?” was based on her book “Are You There, Vodka? It’s Me, Chelsea,” with Handler also appearing onscreen as the character Sloane. \n\n\tYoung is repped by WME and Yorn Levine. Handler is repped by Ocean Avenue, WME, Hansen Jacobson, and Align PR. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMobile gaming giant Scopely will acquire a majority stake in the Istanbul-based development studio behind popular new puzzle game “Pixel Flow!”, which has been played by more than 10 million people globally since launching last year.\n\n\tThe studio, formed just last year, was founded by CEO Kübra Gündoğan and CTO Emre Çelik. Launched shortly after, the game became the only casual game released in the last 12 months to break into the U.S.’s monthly top-20 grossing charts. Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal’s multi-year, performance-based structure values the business in excess of $1 billion. Last year, the team closed a seed financing round.\n\t\n\n\t“Having invested in the company just months ago, to exit at a billion-dollar-plus valuation is a phenomenal result,” Managing Director of Arcadia Gaming Partners Akin Babayigit said in a statement. “It’s been a privilege to have a front row seat to the team’s rapid growth and success and see them become the latest Turkish startup to reach unicorn-level status. We’re extremely confident about their future growth potential as part of the Scopely ecosystem.”\n\n\n\tThe acquisition comes as Scopely has continued to grow as the top mobile video game company in the U.S. and the second in the mobile gaming industry globally. Previous moves include its acquisition of the Niantic games business (including titles like “Pokémon GO,” “Monster Hunter Now” and “Pikmin Bloom”), new partnerships with IP from “Star Wars” to “Jurassic Park” and more.\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMERCH\t\n\n\tWilson released today the “Backyard Baseball Collection,” a lineup of sports equipment that captures the fun, vibrant spirit that made the video game franchise a cultural staple for an entire generation. The collection also includes basketballs, footballs as well as soccer balls, rounding out a complete Backyard Sports line of products. \n\n\tThe Backyard Baseball collection includes gear for tee ball to elite travel ball players and collectors. It’s ramping up the next generation, allowing them to share in the same joy millennial parents felt when Backyard Sports video games were released during their childhood almost 30 years ago. The collection features Wilson gloves, Louisville Slugger bats, EvoShield protective gear and more. Each unique item reinforces what makes baseball amazing to begin with: it’s fun. \n\t\n\t\tPARTNERSHIPS\t\n\n\tLyrical Media’s Lyrical Games has signed a publishing deal with award-winning British video game development studio The Chinese Room. Under the agreement, Lyrical Games will publish an upcoming, unannounced title from studio. Lyrical is providing full financing, strategic production support, and collaborative go-to-market planning for the project, “while preserving the studio’s creative autonomy and IP ownership.”\n\n\tBacked by Lyrical Media, an independent storytelling company with film and TV roots, Lyrical Games is led by industry veterans from Private Division, Humble Games, Devolver Digital, and more. Following its launch in Spring 2025, Lyrical Games has announced two highly anticipated titles, “Valor Mortis” from One More Level, and “Erosion” from Plot Twist, both due out in 2026. They have also announced a partnership with Blackbird Interactive for an unannounced title. \n",

    "body": "\n\tHBO has released the first trailer for “House of the Dragon” Season 3, which debut in June. The upcoming season is set to be the penultimate, as HBO has confirmed a planned four-season run for the show.\n\n\tThe fantasy drama series, which is based on author George R.R. Martin’s “Fire & Blood” novel detailing the history of House Targaryen, is set roughly 200 years prior to the events of “Game of Thrones.” The Season 3 trailer dropped Thursday ahead of the upcoming finale for “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” another HBO prequel set 90 years before “Game of Thrones” and about 75 years after “House of the Dragon.”\n\t\n\n\tThe trailer shows Aemond Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne after his brother Aegon was disfigured last season and his mother, Queen Alicent Hightower, secretly left King’s Landing in order to surrender the city to her best friend-turned-rival Rhaenyra’s forces. It’s also revealed that Rhaenyra has discovered new dragons to add to her army, which would be a disaster for Alicent and her family. More large-scale battles are teased — including what appears to be the iconic Battle of the Gullet, where Rhaenyra’s son Jace flies his dragon against House Velaryon’s navy.\n\n\n\tReturning cast members for “Hosue of the Dragon” Season 3 include Matt Smith, Emma D’Arcy, Olivia Cooke, Steve Toussaint, Rhys Ifans, Fabien Frankel, Ewan Mitchell, Tom Glynn-Carney, Sonoya Mizuno, Harry Collett, Bethany Antonia, Phoebe Campbell, Phia Saban, Jefferson Hall, Matthew Needham, Tom Bennett, Kieran Bew, Kurt Egyiawan, Freddie Fox, Clinton Liberty, Gayle Rankin and Abubakar Salim.\n\t\n\n\tNew cast members joining “House of the Dragon” for its third season include James Norton as Ormund Hightower, Tommy Flanagan as Lord Roderick Dustin, Dan Fogler as Ser Torrhen Manderly, Tom Cullen as Ser Luthor Largent, Joplin Sibtain as Ser “Bold” Jon Roxton, and Barry Sloane as Ser Adrian Redfort.\n\n\tMartin co-created the series with Ryan Condal. Both are executive producers, with Condal serving as showrunner. Sara Hess, Melissa Bernstein, Kevin de la Noy, Vince Gerardis, David Hancock and Philippa Goslett also executive produce. Clare Kilner, Nina Lopez-Corrado, Andrij Parekh and Loni Peristere direct Season 3 episodes.\n\n\tWatch the “House of the Dragon” Season 3 trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tEntertainment Tonight released set footage from the upcoming horror movie “The Dreadful” in which former “Game of Thrones” co-stars Sophie Turner and Kit Harington play lovers. The actors played brother and sister duo Jon Snow and Sansa Stark for eight seasons on HBO’s blockbuster series, which is why Turner is seen gagging on set after locking lips with Harington. \n\n\tSet in the 15th century, “The Dreadful” follows Anne (Turner) and her mother-in-law Morwen, who live on the outskirts of society. When a man (Harington) from their past returns, he triggers a chain of events that upends Anne’s life. The film — written and directed by Natasha Kermani — also stars Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence O’Fuarain and Jonathan Howard.\n\t\n\n\tTurner appeared on “Late Night With Seth Meyers” last August and revealed for the first time she had to film kissing scenes with Harington.\n\n\n\t“So, I sent the script to Kit, and he kind of sent me a message back going like, ‘Yeah, I’d love to, but this is going to be really fucking weird, Soph,’” Turner said. “And I was like, ‘What is he talking about?’ Then I was reading [the script] and it’s like, ‘Kiss, kiss, sex, kiss, sex…’ And then I’m like, ‘Oh, shoot, that’s my brother.’ We put it out of our minds, and then we get on set and it’s the first kissing scene, and we are both retching. Like, really, it is vile. It was the worst.”\n\n\tHarington later told E! News that kissing Turner was “weird,” adding: “She was the one that sent that movie to me and somehow didn’t see what I saw in it. I was like, ‘These guys, these are lovers, right?’ I felt very odd about that. But it was a good chance to be with her again and work together… It was slightly embarrassing, having to get on an apple box to kiss her because she’s about a foot taller than me. But other than that, my dignity was pretty intact.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Dreadful” opens in theaters Feb. 20. Watch the set video in the video below, courtesy of Entertainment Tonight. \n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe mission at NBC’s “Today” has long been to give viewers the news and information they need to start their day — along with a little bit of hope. ",
    "body": "\n\tThe mission at NBC’s “Today” has long been to give viewers the news and information they need to start their day — along with a little bit of hope. In recent days, that last element has been harder to deliver.\n\n\tThe NBC morning mainstay is in its third week of navigating its way through one of the most surreal happenings in media history: Nancy Guthrie, mother of co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, has been missing since January 31, and the show has been trying to carry on as usual while addressing the massive national interest in the case and efforts to find her. That has meant finding a substitute for Savannah Guthrie and devoting substantial time at the top of every broadcast to analyzing the latest developments in the quest to find her relative.\n\t\n\n\tSome of these moments have been heartbreaking, emotional, even riveting. But how much more can the show do?\n\n\n\tOn Thursday, “Today” led not with an update about the search for Nancy Guthrie, but with breaking news about the arrest of former Prince Andrew in the U.K. following revelations about his dealings with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Craig Melvin and Hoda Kotb, the latter filling in for Savannah Guthrie, offered news about the state of the Nancy Guthrie case immediately following. Producers and executives at “Today” remain focused on keeping the program going from day to day, says one person familiar with the show, as well as covering the latest news around the search for Nancy Guthrie and supporting their longtime colleague. On Wednesday, anchors wore yellow ribbons in solidarity with the Guthrie family.\n\t\n\n\tThe longer the hunt goes on, the more questions get raised about how the show will maneuver in weeks to come. Will Guthrie be able to return to her post in the foreseeable future?  And should “Today” consider a regular substitute in the interim?\n\n\tThe answers to such questions can determine the fate of storied TV brands like “Today,” which, even in the streaming era deliver millions of dollars in advertising revenue and often serve as the financial linchpin of a network news division. Indeed, the four weekday hours of “Today” nabbed around $315.4 million in 2025, according to Guideline, a tracker of ad spending. And yet, “Today” is in something of a squeeze. Savannah Guthrie’s ability to return to her role won’t be known immediately, says a second person familiar with the program and introducing a  new anchor to take her role — even on an interim basis — could alienate viewers, who have a years-long relationship with her and don’t want to see her treated poorly, particularly under duress.\n\n\tNext steps at the show could be critical as “Today” vies for attention with dozens of newsletters, video podcasts and other upstart programming — not to mention the show’s mainstay rivals.  “The interest in the format is there, people want to start their day with a little dose of news, it’s just fragmented across thousands of endpoints,” says Sean Wright, Guideline’s chief insights and analytics officer. “Between countless daily, morning news podcasts, clips on YouTube, free streaming news on FAST channels and TikTok, it’s been hard to keep viewers tuning back in daily.”\n\n\tKotb, a veteran co-anchor who left the program last year, has been filling in alongside Melvin, but that is believed to be tied in part to an arrangement that had her at the ready to help with coverage of the Winter Olympics. The show has not given any indications as of yet as to whether Kotb might stay for a while — a solution that might prove durable, given the fact she;s already affiliated with the show. Even so, says one former morning show producer, TV executives can be “mercenary” about morning shows, which continue to serve as a signature element that connects viewers with networks. It would be difficult to imagine, this former producer says, that someone at NBC isn’t at least considering what options might be taken in the future, depending on the outcome of the Guthrie family’s ordeal.\n\t\n\n\tGuthrie’s plight is heart rending and unique, shows like “Today” and “Good Morning America” have struggled with similar challenges in the past. Viewers paid rapt attention to Robin Roberts’ journey through treatment tied to myelodysplastic syndrome, a bone marrow disease, in 2012, and, in 2023, kept up with Michael Strahan after his daughter was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a type of brain tumor. “Today” viewers have followed a close-knit group of anchors through a series of difficult tragedies, including an absence by Kotb in 2023 to tend to a sick daughter, and an absence by Al Roker due to a weeks-long illness in 2022 and 2023.\n\n\tAdding new personnel to the mix at such a time could be ill advised. A morning program “operationally is a deep bench of anchors, correspondents, producers and a format that allows flexibility. That combination usually allows the franchise to sustain itself even during challenging periods,” says Jim Bell, a former “Today” executive producer who is now senior vice president of media for the 2028 Los Angles Olympics. “The audience relationship is long term and grounded in trust. When something personal arises, authenticity matters but so does respecting privacy. The show typically acknowledges what appropriate and then focuses on delivering the broadcast with steadiness. It’s always a careful balance.”\n\n\tIndeed, NBC has in recent years — with a few notable exceptions — focused on building “Today” from the inside. Guthrie, Kotb and Melvin all gained experience and exposure at “Today” and other NBC News properties over years. Sheinelle Jones, a longtime “Today” anchor at 9 a.m., now co-anchors the show’s 10 a.m. hour with Jenna Bush Hager.\n\n\tAnd the anchors make appearances across the show’s four hours on air every weekday morning. Melvin still co-anchors the 9 a.m. hour of “Today, “as does  Roker, and Hager and Jones make regular appearances in the shows first two morning hours, along with Roker and Carson Daly. Weekend “Today” anchors, who include Peter Alexander and Laura Jarrett, also turn up. Indeed, Alexander has been reporting from the Milan Olympics in a year when “Today” largely opted to stay close to home during Savannah Guthrie ordeal.\n\n\tThere may not be much more NBC News can do. The search for Nancy Guthrie isn’t just being covered by “Today.” The story is also tracked regularly on “NBC Nightly News” and the company’s live-streaming service, NBC News Now. But the anchors at “Today” may simply have to solider on. After a series of layoffs and staff reductions, NBC News doesn’t have a lot of extra staff to allocate to new challenges. And so, “Today” personnel will need to rely on who they have in the past — each other.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBAFTA night is when the Oscar race stops being polite and starts getting real.\n\n\tThe final BAFTA voting concluded on Tuesday, Feb. 17, at 10:00 a.m. PT, and now we wait to see what solidifies its standing in the race — or sparks a late-breaking surge that could reshape Oscar night. No awards body has a larger membership crossover with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences than BAFTA. The Oscars have nearly 11,000 voting members, while BAFTA’s international membership includes about 14,000 professionals across film, games and television, with branches in London, Cardiff, Glasgow and Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tAs of 2025, BAFTA reported that it had achieved key representation targets: 20% minority ethnic groups (19.85%), 12% Deaf, disabled, and neurodivergent members (12.84%), and 10% LGBTQ+ members (13.29%). Currently, 43% of BAFTA members identify as women (target: 50%), though 51% of members who joined since 2020 identify as women. In total, 10,000 BAFTA members vote in the annual awards recognizing achievements in film, games and television. For the 2025-26 awards season, there are 8,300 film awards voters. Some 782 new full members joined BAFTA this year.\n\n\n\tIn 2021, BAFTA made it mandatory for members to provide demographic details. At the time, 37.4% of members were women, 12.2% were from minority ethnic groups, 5.3% reported having a disability, and 9.7% identified as LGBTQ+.\n\n\tSimply put, we have a race, and it is difficult to discern what could emerge as the victor, and what that could mean for the overall push toward the 98th Academy Awards. \n\n\tAt the 79th BAFTA Awards, Paul Thomas Anderson’s political satire leads the nominations with 14, just two short of the all-time record set by “Gandhi” (1982). Ryan Coogler’s historical horror follows with 13 nominations, which is the most ever for a film directed by a Black filmmaker in BAFTA history.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Agata Grzybowska\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne of the most compelling questions is the split between outstanding British film, which recognizes significant creative involvement by British individuals, and the top category of Best Film, which all filmmakers qualify for. Since the category’s revival in 1992, only four films have won both awards: “Conclave” (2024), “1917” (2019), “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” (2017) and “The King’s Speech” (2010).\n\n\tThe only film nominated in both categories this year is Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” which is also the highest-grossing BAFTA best film nominee in the United Kingdom and Ireland. That bodes well for the Shakespearean drama. \n\n\tBAFTA rarely produces many “sweepers.” The record for most wins in BAFTA history is nine for George Roy Hill’s “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (1969), followed by eight for Roland Joffé’s “The Killing Fields” (1984). The nominees offer a mix that appeals to different voting blocs of the organization. Three of the top four most-nominated films — “One Battle After Another,” Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme” and “Sinners” — lean toward American sensibilities, which BAFTA has not typically favored outside a few notable exceptions, including “Nomadland” (2020), “La La Land” (2016), “Boyhood” (2014) and “Argo” (2012). Only two of those won the Oscar in the end.\n\n\tThe obvious question is whether those American-leaning titles split the vote of those members that are open to those themes and narratives.\n\n\tWhen it comes to “Hamnet,” with an impressive 11 nominations, it speaks directly to a U.K.-leaning bloc. It’s the same bloc that propelled films such as “Conclave,” “The King’s Speech” and “Atonement” (2007) to victory. The box office story for “Hamnet” has been one of the season’s more compelling success narratives. Of its $80 million global gross, the film has surpassed “Sinners” to become the highest-grossing BAFTA Best Film nominee in the U.K. and Ireland. That could be helpful on Sunday night.\n\n\tThere is also an internationally minded contingent likely to embrace Joachim Trier’s Norwegian-language drama “Sentimental Value,” which earned eight nominations. This is a group that has never been shy about recognizing non-English-language films in a major way, as seen with past best film winners such as the German-language war film “All Quiet on the Western Front” from Edward Berger and the Spanish-language film “Roma” (2018) from Alfonso Cuarón. \n\t\n\n\tWhen you dig into the acting races, your guesses are as good as anybody else.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARTY SUPREME, Timothee Chalamet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn leading actor, Timothée Chalamet has an opportunity to cement his frontrunner status after winning the Critics Choice and Golden Globe prizes — neither membership of which overlap with Oscar voters. Awards strategists generally see the category as a three-way contest among Chalamet, Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle After Another” and Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon.”\n\n\tChalamet also appears to be the clearest path to rewarding “Marty Supreme,” which doesn’t look to be very competitive elsewhere. BAFTA has historically been less reluctant than the Oscars to reward younger actors, previously recognizing eventual Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne for “The Theory of Everything” (2014), Austin Butler for “Elvis” (2022) and a teenage Jamie Bell for “Billy Elliot” (2000). If “Marty Supreme” were to lose all 11 nominations, it would tie the record for most losses in BAFTA history alongside “Women in Love” (1969) and “Finding Neverland” (2004), which funny enough still went on to win one Oscar each on their respective nights for best actress (Glenda Jackson) and original score (Jan A.P. Kaczmarek). It’s especially striking given Safdie — director, co-producer, co-writer and co-editor — is the year’s most-nominated individual with four nominations.\n\n\tA DiCaprio win is not out of the question. His film remains the presumptive favorite among many pundits and industry analysts. At the same time, outlets including Variety see the Oscar picture as a genuine toss-up based on reporting and conversations with voters. DiCaprio, who previously won a BAFTA for “The Revenant” (2015), has tied the record for most BAFTA best actor nominations with seven and is the youngest to reach that figure. His turn as stoner Bob Ford could help ignite a late campaign surge for the 51-year-old actor, particularly if “One Battle After Another” wins best film. It would be the kind of momentum shift reminiscent of Jean Dujardin’s rise for “The Artist” (2011), or last year’s best actress winner Mikey Madison for “Anora,” who won even as her film lost at BAFTA, then carried that lift through Oscar night after Demi Moore had been widely viewed as the safe pick for “The Substance.”\n\t\n\n\tOne additional statistical quirk is Chiwetel Ejiofor remains the last BAFTA best actor winner from an eventual best picture winner — “12 Years a Slave” (2013) — whose BAFTA win did not translate into an Oscar. In that year, Matthew McConaughey’s Oscar-winning performance in “Dallas Buyers Club” was ineligible at BAFTA because of its U.K. release date.\n\n\tThere is also a BAFTA contingent that leans towards veterans when the moment is right. When the chance arises to honor someone the industry deeply respects, BAFTA can seize it and shift the trajectory of a race. It was the only major group to foreshadow Anthony Hopkins’ upset for “The Father” (2020) over Chadwick Boseman for “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.” Something similar could unfold for — coincidentally, for another Sony Pictures Classics title — “Blue Moon” and its star Ethan Hawke.\n\n\tWith only his second career BAFTA nomination after “Boyhood,” Hawke has been making the rounds at tastemaker events and remains widely admired by peers. The big hurdle to overcome is being the sole representation for his movie. If he were to win for his portrayal of Lorenz Hart as the sole nominee for the movie, he would be the first to do so since Walter Matthau for “Pete ’n’ Tillie” (1973). However, Matthau’s win effectively served as a combined recognition with his performance in “Charley Varrick,” which received did receive additional BAFTA nominations. It is also worth remembering that BAFTA ceremonies were held after the Oscars during that era. Even Colin Firth’s surprise BAFTA win for “A Single Man” (2009) over eventual Oscar winner Jeff Bridges for “Crazy Heart,” had the advantage of his co-star Julianne Moore also being nominated.\n\n\tWhen you venture onto social media, much of the noise has centered on whether Rose Byrne can pull off an upset. It remains an incredibly tough sell to see such a outcome like that unfolding. Buckley leads the season in critics’ prizes and is anchored to a film with multiple BAFTA and Oscar nominations. Byrne is the only mention for her movie at both ceremonies. By that measure, it remains Buckley’s category to lose.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTIMENTAL VALUE, (aka AFFEKSJONSVERDI), Stellan Skarsgard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSupporting actor appears tailor-made for Stellan Skarsgård’s work as film director Gustav Borg in “Sentimental Value.” This cannot be overstated: If Skarsgård were to lose at BAFTA — on top of missing an Actor Awards (formerly SAG) nomination, a hurdle many of us have been willing to overlook — a BAFTA loss could prove fatal to his Oscar campaign. \n\t\n\n\tIf the door were to open, the beneficiary could be Puerto Rican veteran Benicio Del Toro for “One Battle After Another,” which a win would make him the first Latino actor to win more than one BAFTA award. Or Jacob Elordi’s performance as the Creature in “Frankenstein” could demonstrate his CCA win was no fluke, riding a wave of possible craft wins (production design, costumes and make up and hair) for Guillermo del Toro’s Netflix monster film. Or Paul Mescal’s work in “Hamnet,” shockingly omitted from the Oscar nominations, and could take a meaningful BAFTA victory lap to prove his movie has strength. Notably, the last winner in this category who did not receive an Oscar nomination in this category was Bill Nighy for “Love Actually” (2003), who triumphed over eventual Oscar winner Tim Robbins for “Mystic River.”\n\n\tThe supporting actress category is rapidly becoming a pick-your-own-winner race, and you could be right. \n\n\tAbsent is the critics’ darling Amy Madigan from “Weapons,” whi missed a vital nomination. The last person to win the Oscar in this category without BAFTA was Regina King for “If Beale Street Could Talk” (2018). \n\n\tThat leaves the pathway wide open for Teyana Taylor, who has been riding high on a memorable Golden Globes speech and the widespread assumption that she has controlled the race since the 83rd ceremony more than five weeks ago. A BAFTA win would, in many eyes, put the race to bed, maybe regardless of what happened at SAG. Remember, this is also the category that first signaled Angela Bassett would not win the Oscar for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (2022), when BAFTA awarded Kerry Condon for “The Banshees of Inisherin” (2022), before Jamie Lee Curtis won SAG and ultimately the Oscar for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” \n\n\tWith that in mind, attention has turned to “Sentimental Value” breakout Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, who doesn’t have to face vote-splitting from Oscar-nominated co-star Elle Fanning, who is not nominated at BAFTA. There’s also room for British performer Wunmi Mosaku for “Sinners,” who may also have her best shot of the season with a “home field” advantage. A victory for her would suggest “Sinners” is capable of breaking through above the line beyond original screenplay, which matters if it is to contend seriously for best picture at the Oscars.\n\t\n\n\tAwards watchers have long assumed BAFTA would not be the organization to embrace Coogler’s vampire sensation, given its uneven history with Black films and artists (i.e., Denzel Washington has never received a BAFTA nomination). Yet “Sinners” has already exceeded expectations by landing 13 nominations, tying the fourth-most nominated BAFTA film ever and trailing only “One Battle After Another,” which scored 14 and ranks as the third-most nominated in BAFTA history. \n\n\tBut, that does not mean it will go home empty-handed. \n\n\t“Sinners” remains on track to win original score for Ludwig Göransson, unless it is shut out in a manner reminiscent of “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” which won a single BAFTA (editing) and then took seven Oscars right after. \n\n\tIf Coogler were to win original screenplay — something many are expecting could happen at the Academy Awards — that could be enough to sustain momentum going into these final weeks. And to go along with its historic year, a “Sinners” win in original screenplay would also make Coogler the first Black winner in that category. The Oscars have only had one with Jordan Peele for another horror flick, “Get Out” (2017).\n\n\tOne of the tightest contests of the season is cinematography, which has produced varied results across precursors. The same five nominees appeared at Critics Choice, the American Society of Cinematographers and the Oscars (a first in recent history). CCA went with “Train Dreams,” while ASC will not weigh in until Mar. 8, which is after Oscar voting closes. Its sister-guild, the British Society of Cinematographers, selected Michael Bauman’s work on “One Battle After Another,” but the BSC’s alignment with the Oscar winner since best picture expanded in 2009 has been inconsistent, matching in only six of the last 16 years: “The Brutalist” (2024), “All Quiet on the Western Front,” “Mank” (2020), “1917,” “Roma” and “Blade Runner 2049” (2017). However, BSC and BAFTA match more often, aligning eight of the last 16 years, which could favor “One Battle After Another” on Sunday. \n\n\t“Train Dreams,” meanwhile, is nominated only for cinematography at BAFTA. If it won, it would be the first since Roger Deakins’ camera work on “The Man Who Wasn’t There” (2001) to claim the prize as the sole nomination — and that film still lost the Oscar to “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.” More damaging is that “Train Dreams” was also passed over by the BSC, and no film in the last 16 years has won BAFTA cinematography without a BSC nomination.\n\t\n\n\tThat points us towards a historic win for Autumn Durald Arkapaw, who will make history as the first woman to win the category for her stunning work in “Sinners.”\n\n\tElsewhere on BAFTA night, “F1” is projected to sweep its three categories — editing, sound and, more surprisingly, special visual effects — potentially at the expense of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” BAFTA has shown no reluctance to reward sequels, previously recognizing “Dune: Part Two” (2024), “Avatar: The Way of Water” (2022) and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (2015). Still, this third installment in James Cameron’s Pandora franchise, while a box office success, drew a more tepid response in the U.K., grossing $56 million compared with $93 million for the second film and $153 million for the original.\n\n\tThe BAFTA Film Awards take place Sunday, Feb. 22. The K-pop singing trio from “KPop Demon Hunters” is set to perform, despite the film’s ineligibility in animated feature. That prize is expected to go to Disney’s “Zootopia 2,” released under its U.K. title, “Zootropolis 2.” \n\n\tBy the time the trophies leave London, the question won’t be whether BAFTA mattered; it’ll be who survived it.\n\n\tThe final BAFTA predictions are below.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 19: A general view of the BAFTA award trophy ahead of the EE BAFTA Film Awards 2023 at The Royal Festival Hall on February 19, 2023 in London, England.

    "body": "\n\t“Summer House” star Jesse Solomon has signed with CAA.\n\n\tA breakout star of the Bravo reality show, Solomon is currently concentrating on his music career as a singer and songwriter. \n\n\tSolomon, who trained as a vocal jazz performance artist at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music, has credited his viral tongue-in-cheek track, “What Would Jesse Solomon Do,” for reigniting his passion for performing.\n\n\n\tHe recently released his third studio track, “Into Space.” His influences include John Legend, Frank Sinatra, John Mayer and Bublé.\n\t\n\n\tSolomon currently splits his time between New York and Miami.\n\n\t“Summer House,” launched in 2017, follows a group of friends who share a vacation home in Southampton, New York. It has launched three spin-offs, “Winter House,” “Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard” and the upcoming “In the City.”\n\n\tSolomon joined “Summer House” in Season 8 and returned for the ninth and the recently premiered Season 10. Shortly after his debut on the show, Solomon opened up to his housemates about being a two-time cancer survivor. “When you’re on your ass and you can’t get up to piss, and your brother and your dad lift you up, you’re like, ‘Wow,’” he said at the time. “It definitely puts everything into perspective and makes you realize the importance of family and your friends, who’s there for you and who is not.”\n\n\tIn 2024, he learned he was five years cancer-free.\n\n\tIn addition to CAA, Solomon will continue to be represented by Steel Wool Entertainment, Millennial Entertainment and Shore Fire Media.\n\n",

The logline for the show states that it “follows a brother and sister duo whose fun, messy lives in New York City are interrupted when their worst nightmare comes true: their high-achieving older sister shows up and wants to hang out with them.”\n\t\n\n\tLaw (“Hacks,” “The Good Place”) and Murray (“Parks and Recreation,” “The Good Place”) are writers, executive producers, and co-showrunners on “Dang!” Schur executive produces along with Alan Yang, David Miner for 3Arts Entertainment, and Chris Prynoski, Shannon Prynoski, Ben Kalina, and Antonio Canobbio of animation studio Titmouse. Universal Television will produce, with Schur and his Fremulon banner currently under an overall deal at UTV. \n\n\n\t“We’re beyond thrilled to partner with Netflix, Universal Television, and Titmouse on ‘Dang!,'” Law said. “We hope that you fall in love with these characters. Or at least find them very, very attractive. Sexually.”\n\n\t“Mike Schur, Andrew Law, and Matt Murray are experts in finding the heart and hilarity in the most complex relationships,” added John Derderian, Netflix’s vice president of Animation Series + Kids & Family TV “With ‘Dang!,’ they tackle the relatable chaos of sibling rivalry, brought to life by the undeniable chemistry of Andrew Law, Poppy Liu, and Stephanie Hsu. As the home for the best creators and adult animated series, we’re thrilled to bring this incredible team and new show to our global audience.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s most well-known adult animated comedies include “BoJack Horseman,” “Big Mouth,” and “F Is for Family.” The streamer’s current adult animated slate includes shows like “Long Story Short” and “Haunted Hotel,” as well as upcoming shows like “Strip Law.” \n",

However, authorities say the driver -- 32-year-old Jacob Novak -- was relatively uninjured and no children were riding in the bus at the time. The bus driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.\n      \n\n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Novak was cited for following too closely and headed home on foot -- the trouble seemingly in his rearview -- until cops received a call about a domestic battery incident later in the day.\n      \n    \n          According to a police report, a sheriff's deputy arrived at a house and made contact with Novak and an unidentified woman. Jackson claimed their altercation had been purely verbal, not physical.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Cops say two eyewitnesses told a different story ... one told police they'd seen Jacob push the woman several times up against a garage door.\n      \n    \n          According to the police, Jacob had several injuries from a crash sustained earlier in the day ... and deputies say they were not able to determine if the injuries were caused by the female, as they didn't seem to line up with what he alleged about their altercation.\n      \n    \n          Novak was eventually arrested for one count of battery, touch or strike (DV) and taken to jail.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Insane Videos\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive Details\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

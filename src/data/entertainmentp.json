    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/motion-picture-association/\">Motion Picture Association</a> on Monday called on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/openai/\">OpenAI</a> to take “immediate action” to fix the copyright opt-out system on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sora-2/\">Sora 2</a>, as knockoff videos proliferate online.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe MPA issued its first comment on the situation since the release of the video AI model last week, which allows users to create clips using copyrighted characters — and puts the onus on copyright holders to object.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Since Sora 2’s release, videos that infringe our members’ films, shows, and characters have proliferated on OpenAI’s service and across social media,” said Charles Rivkin, the chairman and CEO of the MPA. “While OpenAI<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.samaltman.com%2Fsora-update-number-1&data=05%7C02%7Cgmaddaus%40variety.com%7C00f8908daf9642dc271808de05401d48%7Ce950f25546e44144a778a6ff4f557492%7C0%7C0%7C638953970087303033%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NX61u2KjB8SWOyDd1YcdHQPDk1VkhD52jthz8FqGBck%3D&reserved=0\"> clarified</a> it will ‘soon’ offer rightsholders more control over character generation, they must acknowledge it remains their responsibility – not rightsholders’ – to prevent infringement on the Sora 2 service. OpenAI needs to take immediate and decisive action to address this issue. Well-established copyright law safeguards the rights of creators and applies here.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, OpenAI Sam Altman said that an update to Sora 2 will soon give copyright holders “more granular control over generation of characters.” But he did not guarantee that copyrighted material would be scrubbed from the platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration,” he said in a blog post.</p>\n<p>\n\tSora 2 was introduced with the idea that creators could opt out if they object to having their characters or copyrighted work used on the site. Under copyright law, rightsholders can sue and obtain statutory damages for individual acts of infringement — regardless of whether the infringer offers an opt-out or not.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe MPA has made clear that the entertainment industry is not on board with the idea that an opt-out system absolves OpenAI from liability.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn June, Disney and Universal sued Midjourney for allowing its users to create infringing videos and still images on its site. Warner Bros. filed its own suit against Midjourney in September. Midjourney has fought back, arguing that AI training is “fair use” under copyright law, and that if users are infringing on copyrights, they are doing so in violation of the platform’s terms of service.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/new-york-film-festival/\">New York Film Festival</a> audiences will get the first look at Timothée Chalamet in Josh Safdie’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/marty-supreme/\">Marty Supreme</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/a24/\">A24</a> film is one of the year’s most anticipated, but it remained one of the few remaining awards contenders to be unveiled. That changed Monday evening, when the indie studio gave “Marty Supreme” a surprise world premiere at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall. The setting makes sense given that Safdie is a quintessential Big Apple filmmaker, Chalamet is a native son and the film was shot in the five boroughs. Both the star and the director are in attendance.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe screening was confirmed after the audience had filled the seats for the festival’s secret screening and Safdie took the stage.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I hate surprises too,” Safdie said to the crowd. The secret screening was a tight deadline for the director, as he added, “I finished it at 2 a.m. yesterday. … You’re the first audience to see this film.”</p>\n<p>\n\tChalamet then joined his director onstage to introduce the film, disclosing a personal connection to the evening. The star shared that he went to high school down the street from Alice Tully, so “it’s fucking awesome” to premiere at NYFF.</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on the “Marty Supreme” trailer, Chalamet appears to be playing an aspiring ping-pong champion. Gwyneth Paltrow, who co-stars in the film, previously said she plays the wife of a rival professional who has an affair with Chalamet. “I mean, we have a lot of sex in this movie,” Paltrow teased. “There’s a lot — <em>a lot.</em>”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cast also includes Odessa A’Zion, Kevin O’Leary, Tyler Okonma, Abel Ferrara and Fran Drescher. Safdie co-wrote the script with Ronald Bronstein.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film cost $70 million, making it A24’s most expensive movie ever. The premiere comes as the studio’s “The Smashing Machine,” which was directed by Josh Safdie’s brother Benny, is failing to connect at the box office despite good reviews. The Safdies previously collaborated as co-directors on “Good Times” and “Uncut Gems.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe New York Film Festival has held premieres for several awards contenders, including Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly,” Luca Guadagnino’s “After the Hunt,” Kathryn Bigelow’s “A House of Dynamite,” and Scott Cooper’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” </p>\n</div>",

Ken Jacobs taught in the cinema department of Binghamton University in New York for over three decades. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1956, he made his first film “Orchard Street” about the Lower East Side, and many of his later films also “used Manhattan streets, rooftops and dumps as the backdrop for sardonic minidramas of social despair,” his former student, film critic J. Hoberman, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/movies/ken-jacobs-and-his-films-feted-in-80th-birthday-tributes.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis 1969 film “Tom, Tom the Piper’s Son” uses a short film from 1905 as source material to manipulate speed, light and motion. It was admitted to the National Film Registry in 2007. Jacobs explained the film saying, “There’s already so much film. Let’s draw some of it out for a deeper look, toy with it, take it into a new light with inventive and expressive projection. Freud would suggest doing so as a way to look into our minds.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHis later films include 1986’s “Perfect Film” and 1990’s “Opening the Nineteenth Century: 1896.” In 2004, he released “Star Spangled to Death,” a nearly seven-hour compendium of found footage on 20th century American history that he began compiling in 1957. </p>\n<p>\n\tJacobs’ films, videos and performances have been exhibited at venues including the Berlin Film Festival, the London Film Festival, the New York Film Festival and the Museum of Modern Art.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis honors include the AFI’s Maya Deren Award, a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation and the New York State Council on the Arts. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, artist Nisi Ariana.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe four-part series “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/red-alert/\">Red Alert</a>,” a scripted account of the terror attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, gains its power from the absence of context. As conceived by writer, director and co-creator Lior Chefetz (“The Stronghold”), the story eschews a bird’s-eye view of Hamas militants’ incursion from the Gaza Strip, the IDF’s counteroffensive or the broader history of a conflict now well into its eighth decade. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is never mentioned; neither is Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar, the attacks’ mastermind. (Even the word “Palestinian” doesn’t appear in the scripts.) Instead, the main characters of “Red Alert” are ordinary people — kibbutzniks, cops and kindergarten teachers blindsided by a horrifying onslaught of violence. We experience the day as they do, almost in real time.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it’s precisely the context of “Red Alert” that makes the show noteworthy, especially to stateside viewers who can stream the show on Paramount+. Parent company Paramount Skydance announced the series’ acquisition <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/paramount-red-alert-series-hamas-attack-israel-1236525993/\">with a statement</a> from newly installed CEO David Ellison, who praised “Red Alert” as “critical” and lauded its “harrowing precision.” (Another high-profile figure in American entertainment, “Pulp Fiction” producer Lawrence Bender, offered “Red Alert” his imprimatur as an executive producer.) It’s highly unusual for an executive at Ellison’s level to weigh in on a title his company didn’t even produce, like if Ted Sarandos urged his subscribers to check out AMC’s “Interview With the Vampire” on Netflix. Yet, 10 days prior, Ellison’s Paramount had made another atypical move, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/paramount-condemns-israeli-film-boycott-1236516511/\">proactively condemning</a> a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/stars-sign-pledge-complicit-israeli-film-companies-1236511010/\">boycott pledge</a> targeting certain Israeli film institutions — indicating a vested interest in the setting and subject of “Red Alert” on Ellison’s part. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThat same boycott indicates the other kind of context that viewers will bring to “Red Alert,” which is timed to the second anniversary of the nightmarish events it depicts. The intervening two years have only brought more pain and bloodshed throughout the region. Some of these open wounds are alluded to in the postscript of “Red Alert,” like the continued captivity of four dozen Israeli hostages in Gaza; some are not, like alleged <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164496\" target=\"_blank\">war crimes</a> and <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517\" target=\"_blank\">widespread starvation</a> in the Strip on top of a death count <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down\" target=\"_blank\">now estimated at over 60,000</a>. One could theoretically make a show just as wrenching as “Red Alert” about infants dying from lack of food, doctors forced to treat amputees without anesthetic and kids <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/02/middleeast/israeli-precision-guided-munition-maghazi-deaths-intl\" target=\"_blank\">killed by drone fire</a> while playing foosball. Unlike “Red Alert,” such a show probably couldn’t shoot on location due to the Strip’s <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-17/ty-article-magazine/.premium/satellite-data-shows-at-least-70-percent-of-gaza-buildings-leveled/00000198-12de-d9c7-af98-7adffc8f0000\" target=\"_blank\">near-total leveling</a>, and Ellison’s Paramount almost certainly wouldn’t touch it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs much as “Red Alert” attempts to cleave away everything but the immediate and subjective, it joins projects like the touring <a href=\"https://novaexhibition.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nova Exhibition</a> and the IDF-produced documentary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_Witness_to_the_October_7th_Massacre\" target=\"_blank\">“Bearing Witness”</a> that offer their versions of a narrative that remains hotly contested — that of the origins, goals and sympathetic parties of a still-ongoing war. Ellison clearly understands the power and significance of elevating certain stories over others. There’s a reason he chose to distribute “Red Alert” and not, say, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/no-other-land/\">“No Other Land,”</a> the documentary about settler violence in the West Bank that never found a U.S. backer despite winning an Oscar earlier this year. That film was recently name-checked in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/paramount-israel-boycott-employee-letter-1236536692/\">anonymous petition</a> from 30 Paramount employees accusing the company of “silencing Palestinian voices” while “actively and exclusively platform[ing] Israeli perspectives.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s thus the very elements that make “Red Alert” such an affecting watch that also make the show an inherently impossible effort. In the moment, Chefetz, co-creator Ruth Efroni and their collaborators can situate us firmly in the early hours of that terrible day, when holiday preparations for Simchat Torah were overtaken by questions of basic survival. But “Red Alert” arrives in the messy, disputed aftermath of Oct. 7 — a present tense viewers will inevitably return to, however vivid the show’s staging of the recent past.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEach protagonist of “Red Alert” is based on a specific survivor, some invoked by name and some given a pseudonym at their request. Batsheva Yahalomi (Rotem Sela) and her husband Ohad (Miki Leon) belong to the former group. The Yahalomis and their three children initially retreat to the bomb shelter that’s a feature of many Israeli homes, especially those within rocket range of the Strip; it’s there they hear scary-but-typical overhead explosions joined by gunfire, signaling a much more immediate threat. (“Red Alert” takes its name from the automated warning message that plays on an eerie loop throughout.) Such indirect exposition drives home how disorienting Oct. 7 was at its onset, and in the absence of a more prompt and centralized response.</p>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere, another married couple, law enforcement officers Kobi (Israel Atias) and Nofar (Chen Amsalem), get separated while working separate shifts at the Nova Music Festival, the site of some of the day’s worst mass casualties. Educator Tali (Sara Vino) leaves her own shelter in search of her son Itamar (Nevo Katan), while Palestinian-Israeli Ayoub (Hisham Sulliman) and his family are ambushed in their minivan without regard for their heritage. By focusing on these particular people, “Red Alert” communicates the scale and trauma of Oct. 7 while avoiding some of the attacks’ most graphic elements, like sexual violence or the murder of children. Instead, Chefetz works to elevate the heroism of parents and partners who put their lives on the line to protect their loved ones, a kind of silver-lining spin on an otherwise awful moment in time.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyoub’s inclusion is an indication “Red Alert” does have its own political lens, a decidedly liberal one within the Israeli domestic spectrum, despite sticking closely to firsthand accounts. The agricultural worker’s face is the first we see onscreen, cradling his now-motherless infant son as Hamas fighters stage a last stand outside his improvised shelter. “Red Alert” is careful to highlight Ayoub’s difficulty securing an Israeli ID despite his long-term residence, a detail that becomes nerve-wrackingly relevant when IDF soldiers finally arrive on the scene only to hold him at gunpoint and demand he prove his loyalty. In a neat resolution, the troops quickly accept Ayoub’s crumpled receipts and school report cards. The scene is nonetheless a nod to the nuance that lies beyond the urgent, all-consuming panic of the unfolding crisis, and a queasy echo of the many such encounters that <em>don’t </em>end so amicably. The dialogue also often alludes to the army’s confoundingly delayed arrival, a pointed rebuke of a government — led by Netanyahu, who has yet to apologize for his role in the operational shortcomings — that failed in its duty to protect its citizens. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Red Alert” otherwise excels at capturing the confusion and occasional absurdity of the chaos victims were left to navigate for themselves. Without uniforms, it’s almost impossible to distinguish friend from foe, leading a group of Israelis to identify themselves to soldiers via group chat selfie: “Smile so we don’t look like Hamas!” In a strange and chilling encounter, Batsheva and her daughters come across two unarmed, English-speaking men who urge her to come with them, supposedly for her safety. (Arabic-speaking Gazans and Hebrew-speaking Israelis default to English as a linguistic middle ground.) She refuses, and the men simply wander off. We never learn exactly who they are or what became of them, the lack of resolution creating a subtler sense of unease than the overt atrocities.</p>\n<p>\n\tA disclaimer before each episode clarifies that “Red Alert” has fictionalized certain scenes. Like many scripted works inspired by true events, however, the series invokes its proximity to real life to prove its bona fides and maximize emotional impact. In a now-common device, the finale’s closing credits juxtapose actors with the people they’re portraying, a few with their faces pixelated for anonymity. Some video clips show the survivors on set, even conferring with the crew; others, in a discomfiting choice, play actual footage from Oct. 7 that Chefetz then faithfully recreated. As fraught as the reused recordings are, their overlap with the final product is the point. “Red Alert” weds itself so tightly to its source material that there’s little space left for anything else — or at least, that’s the intent. But the world beyond the show’s limited scope still looms, whether it’s deliberately invoked or not.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>All four episodes of “Red Alert” are will stream on Paramount+ on Oct. 7.</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tribeca/\">Tribeca</a> Festival and AT&T have increased their AT&T Untold Stories program’s top production prize from $1 million to $1.2 million for the festival’s 25th anniversary in 2026. The program, which provides funding, empowerment and support for emerging filmmakers, is the largest unrestricted film production award of its kind in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe program launched in 2017 and each year awards one new filmmaker full funding to produce a feature along with mentorship, support and a guaranteed premiere at the Tribeca Festival. Since its inception, the program has supported 40 projects and produced eight winning films, some of which have garnered distribution on major platforms such as Netflix and HBO Max.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Independent filmmaking has never been tougher, and too many vital stories never make it to the screen. Untold Stories changes that,” said Jane Rosenthal, CEO and Co-Founder of Tribeca Enterprises. “It doesn’t just give filmmakers the means to create — it helps ensure their work is seen. With funding, mentorship, and distribution support, the program opens doors that might otherwise stay shut. This expanded prize will give bold storytellers the chance to dream bigger, go further, and reach the audiences their stories deserve.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tApplications for the 2026 Untold Stories award are now open and close on Feb. 6. The winner will receive the $1.2 million grant at next year’s festival. </p>\n<p>\n\tFilmmakers can apply now at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftribecafilm.com%2Funtoldstories&data=05%7C02%7Cjtangcay%40variety.com%7C6526110935c04d10792108de035f174d%7Ce950f25546e44144a778a6ff4f557492%7C0%7C0%7C638951904526361534%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=1ryEai7Xf%2F%2FVAMRwn2spvuiaKTDxKAsGyRdBIsfe3y4%3D&reserved=0\">tribecafilm.com/untoldstories</a>.</p>\n\t<h2>\n\t\tMonday, October 6\t</h2>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Reveals 2025 Student Academy Awards Placements</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have unveiled the recipients of this year’s Gold, Silver and Bronze placements and universities around the world at the 52nd Student Academy Awards ceremony.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zelda-williams/\">Zelda Williams</a>, the daughter of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/robin-williams/\">Robin Williams</a> and the director of the romantic comedy “Lisa Frankenstein,” recently took to her Instagram story to tell people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father, the iconic comedian who died in 2014 at 63 years old.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Please, just stop sending me AI videos of Dad,” Zelda wrote. “Stop believing I wanna see it or that I’ll understand, I don’t and I won’t. If you’re just trying to troll me, I’ve seen way worse, I’ll restrict and move on. But please, if you’ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It’s dumb, it’s a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it’s NOT what he’d want.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to ‘this vaguely looks and sounds like them so that’s enough’, just so other people can churn out horrible TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening,” she continued. “You’re not making art, you’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings, out of the history of art and music, and then shoving them down someone else’s throat hoping they’ll give you a little thumbs up and like it. Gross.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tZelda concluded, “And for the love of EVERY THING, stop calling it ‘the future,’ AI is just badly recycling and regurgitating the past to be re-consumed. You are taking in the Human Centipede of content, and from the very very end of the line, all while the folks at the front laugh and laugh, consume and consume.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThese most recent Instagram story posts are not the first time Zelda has called out AI recreations of her late father. Back in 2023 when SAG-AFTRA listed AI recreations as a “a mandatory subject of bargaining” in its strike, Zelda bashed AI versions of Robin Williams as “personally disturbing.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am not an impartial voice in SAG’s fight against AI,” Zelda <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/news/robin-williams-daughter-slams-ai-recreations-disturbing-1235742023/\">wrote on Instagram</a> at the time. “I’ve witnessed for YEARS how many people want to train these models to create/recreate actors who cannot consent, like Dad. This isn’t theoretical, it is very very real.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve already heard AI used to get his ‘voice’ to say whatever people want and while I find it personally disturbing, the ramifications go far beyond my own feelings,” she continued. “Living actors deserve a chance to create characters with their choices, to voice cartoons, to put their HUMAN effort and time into the pursuit of performance. These recreations are, at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRead Zelda’s most recent posts in the photos below.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-robin-williams-02-100625-78baf898d1e44c37aac885be66874696.webp 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-robin-williams-02-100625-78baf898d1e44c37aac885be66874696.webp?resize=88,150 88w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-robin-williams-02-100625-78baf898d1e44c37aac885be66874696.webp?resize=176,300 176w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-robin-williams-02-100625-78baf898d1e44c37aac885be66874696.webp?w=602\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-robin-williams-03-100625-0c8b4438392e4a80b0ab329a57c59d47.webp 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-robin-williams-03-100625-0c8b4438392e4a80b0ab329a57c59d47.webp?resize=87,150 87w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-robin-williams-03-100625-0c8b4438392e4a80b0ab329a57c59d47.webp?resize=173,300 173w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-robin-williams-03-100625-0c8b4438392e4a80b0ab329a57c59d47.webp?w=592\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>",

I’d have to speak to the [Department of Justice]. I’ll look at it. I have a lot of people who have asked me for pardons. I call him Puff Daddy, [he] has asked me for a pardon.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the past, Trump has been questioned about whether or not he would grant a pardon to Combs, who was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-jail-sentence-four-years-prison-1236537592/\">sentenced</a> last week to four years and two months in federal prison on transportation for prostitution charges.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“He was essentially I guess sort of half-innocent,” he told <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oEsAoMM7Xc\" target=\"_blank\">Newsmax</a> in August. “I was very friendly with him. I get along with him great, and seemed like a nice guy, I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile. And it’s hard. Like you, we’re human beings and we don’t like to have things cloud our judgment. But when you knew someone and you were fine, and then you run for office and he made some terrible statements… I don’t know. I’m being honest, it makes it more difficult to do.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“But more likely a no for Combs?” the reporter responded. “I’d say so,” said Trump.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-lawyer-trump-pardon-prison-experience-1236476565/\">spoke</a> with Combs’ lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo that same month and asked if counsel had been in touch with the administration. “I am not involved in that in the least,” said Agnifilo. “I have literally no idea. There are times I think there’s nothing to it, and there are times I think it’s just rumor mill stuff. But, I do not purport to know the president’s mind. I really don’t know.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier today, Combs’ attorneys filed a request to Judge Aran Subramanian that he serve his sentence at New Jersey’s Fort Dix so that he can best “address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe Troubadour has probably never been mentioned as many times from the stage of the Greek as it was Friday night. This was because the headliner, country star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/megan-moroney/\">Megan Moroney</a>, had to keep pinching herself — figuratively, not literally — as she surveyed the sold-out crowd on her second night playing the storied amphitheater. The last time she headlined in L.A., she kept remarking, it had been at the 500-capacity Troubadour, and now, two years later, she was filling the 5,900-seat Greek two nights in a row. With demand to spare: Tickets on resale sites for the two shows in the weeks leading up to the shows weren’t going for much less than $300, even in the cheap seats. This was a leap for Moroney that counted as, locally, at least, a coronation.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMoroney is still eligible for a best new artist Grammy this year, even though she’s on her second album and would have been a possibility last year, too, if voters were a bit more on the ball. She seems much more assured of a nomination this time. The Grammys are not fan-voted, of course, but if they were tallied by the sound of a not-so-dull roar, Moroney might have a win in the bag. For those of us who attend shows at the Greek a great deal, probably the last time we heard a womanly roar this loud and this sustained during a concert there was when Olivia Rodrigo made her first headlining appearance there. Aside from when she slipped in a Brooks & Dunn cover, nearly every word was sung along with at top volume, as if this were a somewhat miniaturized version of the Eras Tour in which Taylor’s country era was still the only era. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut here’s the beauty part: All those words all those young ladies are shout-singing are pretty good. Better than pretty good, even. Moroney has actually been one of the leading lights of country for the last two or three years in the critical community as well as in, like, the SoCal cowgirl cosplay community. This is not a case of “the men don’t know, but the little girls understand.” In the country music world, the men have a strong understanding of just how good Moroney is, too, even if there weren’t a lot of them in the Greek crowd over the weekend. (There will be a more sizable helping of guys at the CMA Awards when she is up for six of those a month and a half from now.)</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102756-2.jpg 6628w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102756-2.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102756-2.jpg?resize=300,214 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102756-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Megan Moroney performs onstage for the Am I Okay? Tour at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/greek-theatre/\">Greek Theatre</a> on October 3, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  (Photo by John Shearer/Getty Images for Megan Moroney)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Megan Moroney\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWhat Moroney represents now is kind of an interesting usurping of expectations. When she first appeared on the scene with her breakout hit “Tennessee Orange,” there was a near-immediate understanding that she had some solid songwriting chops, and that her sound skewed just enough toward old-school country that she would be welcomed into circles of credibility that are denied a lot of other freshmen. But she also invited suspicion with her looks, which are generally also considered to be… good. Specifically, a look that allowed for blonder-than-blonde hair, a lot of legginess and a bit of cleavage. There was some hemming and hawing: Was her image designed to appeal to the dreaded <em>male gaze?</em></p>\n<p>\n\tSo how wonderfully hilarious is it that Moroney is now selling out amphitheaters — and likely headed to an arena tour next year — in front of audiences that are all about the female gaze. (Give or take the 15-20% of the crowd that might consist of boyfriends who did not find being brought along too painful.) This feels like the kind of young women’s night out that we haven’t experienced at quite this level of concentration since the glory days of the Dixie Chicks, when, for a brief, shining moment, it felt like country’s future really was female. Moroney is standing on the shoulders of other giantesses, too, but combining some of their different qualities in an interesting way — as girly as Shania Twain on the surface level but at least somewhere on the same toughness scale that is topped by Miranda Lambert, too. And there’s a self-aware humor in a lot of her music that might make you think of someone in another genre who isn’t afraid to be funny while getting dolled up, Sabrina Carpenter… although it’s also part of a strain of wit that goes back to a wide swath of mid-century country.  \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOutside the auditorium, there were blowups of hearts that fans could pose in front of, bearing the title of her second album: “Am I Okay?” Moroney is doing so well in just about every possible public regard at the moment, that can only count as a rhetorical question.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actual song that goes by that title is an enthusiastic love song, or at least major crush song — and as such, it’s in the minority in her catalog. So many of her songs are about not being OK, and about being dumped or, more strikingly in Moroney’s case, having been forced to dump. It’s safe to say that a lot of her audience has fallen for her because she carries the winning persona of a beautiful loser. She does right by singing so much about realizing she snagged the wrong guy. Even when she sang one of her most hopeful songs, “Third Time’s the Charm,” about finally seemingly getting it right on love #3, she was able to get a laugh by adding, as an aside, after the line “praying that the third time’s the charm”… “it was not.” Those two words took even this rather earnest song into the realm of sly comedy, which is a place where she thrives. But also: heartbreak feels real in a place like this.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg 7534w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239103197.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Guests attend the Am I Okay?

And I needed to be reminded to never love the boy more than I love myself. It was inspired by a toxic relationship I was in. Imagine that! And I was just shrinking myself and completely disregarding my happiness to try to be with him. I used to think that  I’m a tough girl, so that means I can put up with his bullshit. Like, no one else wants to put up with his bullshit, but I can because I’m strong. And what I realize, now that I’m a little bit older, is the strength is in walking away as soon as you know you deserve better. Because it didn’t make me tough to be with an asshole, really.”</p>\n<p>\n\tYou almost don’t need a song after that, but fortunately she still had some satisfying tough self-love left over for the tune itself. As Moroney sang the sad punchline “She loved the boy more than she loved the girl in the mirror” for the first time, I watched one mom in the crowd who was presumably hearing it for the first time turn to her teenage daughter with just a concerned “Aww” expression on her face, like she was saying, “Oh, honey, <em>that’s</em> not good.” You had to be there, but as on the Eras Tour, there’s a real sweetness in watching mothers and daughters or sisters or besties look at one another knowingly during some of these songs, caught in a moment where they’re turning their spotlight off the star and onto something shared among themselves.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of moms: Moroney’s mother was celebrating a special day at the Greek Friday night, which made some of the intros that the singer offered a little bit pointedly ironic. “Tonight’s my mom’s birthday.<br />Here’s a song about lying to you. Hi, mom.” That’s a good, glib line, but the singer went on to make it less of a joke. “If someone does me dirty, she don’t forgive or forget like I do,” Moroney said. “So whether it be a relationship or a friendship, if I’m not ready to cut the person out of my life yet, then I can’t tell my mom, because cause my mom will be like, ‘Do it <em>now</em>.’ So I wrote a song about finally being ready to let the person go and coming clean and telling my mom exactly how I was treated.” Now, that’s a birthday present.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis tour, which is nearing its end, isn’t hugely about stagecraft. One imagines it might be a bit more so if she is making the leap to a Forum or Crypto in the month to come. But one also hopes it won’t be too much in that direction, because Moroney’s relatability benefits from not having to compete with pyro. Her set design at the Greek gave her just enough room to keep the show dynamic, as she emerged from the top of a giant staircase whose steps led down to either of the twin bandstands her musicians performed on. A couple of times she reascended those steps to sing from on high, including one more subdued segment where she took a rest sitting inside a nicely mood-lit, hollowed-out heart.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut those boots were made for walkin’, and she handles rambunctiousness well, too, like in the second song, “Indifferent,” a rocker that found herself slapping the back of her boot with her hand, or borrowing some sticks from the drummer to launch her own attack on one of his cymbals. The tone of her singing voice is not diva-like but more conversational, which works highly to her advantage. She feels like someone you’ve just joined at the bar for a convo already in progress, maybe one or two beers in. Moroney reserves just enough energy during her predominant midtempo songs that when she stasrts shaking that platinum hair in a climactic moment at the end, it’s like being reminded that your calm bestie is capable of igniting a rager, too.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg 7274w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239102398.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Megan Moroney performs onstage for the Am I Okay?

Playing some songs from her debut album, she brought out her green acoustic guitar, reviving that project’s color. Currently, the mode is blue, on-stage and off; looking out into her audience was like being down the way at a Dodgers game. Out at the merch stands — which had the longest nearly all-female lines this side of a Boygenius gig — it was an army of people in blue, in line to buy more blue. Who knows what they’ll do when she changes colors again with her 2026 project, (Proudly stand in line again, we’re guessing.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you aren’t clued in at all times to what’s happening in country music, you may be asking yourself, how and when did she get this popular… this scream-worthy? Actually, you may ask that even if you are clued into contemporary country. It’s not a story told in a sudden massive radio hit, although she’s done fine on that score. An overnight smash is a fun phenomenon to follow; so is an artist who’s building audience identification in daily dribs and drabs, not big power moves, until suddenly a choir or army of twentysomething women that wasn’t there two years ago is blasting your ears out. It’s a beautiful sound.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>On the closing day of the Paris fashion week, Chanel hosted the hotly anticipated debut collection of its new artistic director, Matthieu Blazy, who wowed guests with his resolutely modern take on the signature styles invented by Gabrielle Chanel.</p>\n<p>Among the 2300 guests who gathered inside the Grand Palais, a Parisian landmark decorated for the occasion as a colorful galaxy, were a flurry of stars from the film world, including Sofia Coppola, Tilda Swinton, Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman (who attended with her two daughters), Pedro Pascal, Margot Robbie, Carrie Coon and Marion Cotillard.</p>\n<p>Cruz, who is about to start filming Florian Zeller’s “Bunker” alongside her husband Javier Bardem, said she felt “emotional” seeing the enthusiastic reaction to Blazy’s first collection, noting that seeing that level of excitement at a Paris show is a rarity.</p>\n<p>“He took such a big risk and it completely works. To see everyone standing and giving him that ovation, it’s really hard to get that reaction in Paris in a Fashion Week, you don’t see that very often and he really deserves it,” said Cruz with teary eyes. “It’s completely the essence of the brand. He has respected that and he has also created a new thing,” she continued.</p>\n<p>Coppola was also taken by Blazy’s innovation.”It was so exciting because it looked like Chanel, but it looked like a new voice here, and his version of Chanel. It something new that I’ve never seen before,” she said, adding that her favorite look was “some beautiful silk T-shirt dresses” and “a black suit with little chameleons.”</p>\n<p>Equally ecstatic, Swinton said Blazy’s Spring/Summer collection felt like “an absolute breath of fresh air. It feels like the future. I’m very happy and very admiring of Matthieu and his team. It’s not easy to pull off a new evolution of this house, but he’s done it,” Swinton said. The actor, who was already wearing a look for the collection, said she enamored with “a number of styles” from Blazy’s creations. “The skirts, I’m wearing one of them right now. The skirts are sublime. They’re so comfortable and so flexible and on the hip, they’re so slouchy. You just feel completely 21st century. But at the same time, incredibly 1920s. They’re very Gabrielle Chanel herself,” continued Swinton, who has been an ambassador for the French fashion house for over a decade.</p>\n<p>Coon, meanwhile, was struck by how Blazy “took the DNA of Chanel, and he deconstructed it, and he put it back together, and he made astonishing clothes that everyone will want to wear. He turned it inside out, and he made it really sexy, and he made it really edgy. And I just feel like people will be clamoring to wear this collection,” predicted “The Gilded Age” and “White Lotus” star.</p>\n<p>Cotillard, who was recently in Los Angeles for the premiere of “The Morning Show” season 4 in which she stars alongside Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, was also lured by the sex appeal of Blazy’s collection. “I thought he went all out with the codes of femininity and masculinity, fluidity, and body movement, and that he made it his own, making the tweeds completely transparent, this mix of very masculine and very feminine,” Cotillard said.</p>\n<p>In his note of intent, Blazy set the tone for the show, saying that “Chanel is about love. The birth of modernity in fashion comes from a love story.” As such, Blazy, who joined Chanel from Bottega Veneta, chose to have the models walk the runaway to the beats of iconic love songs, from Connie Francis’ “I Was Such a Fool (to Fall in Love With You)” to Mc Solaar’s “Caroline.”</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Sunday Rose Kidman Urban, Nicole Kidman and Faith Margaret Kidman</h2>\n\t<figure>\n\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239615259.jpg?w=200\" alt=\"PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 06: (EDITORIAL USE ONLY - For Non-Editorial use please seek approval from Fashion House) (L-R) Sunday Rose Kidman Urban, Nicole Kidman and Faith Margaret Kidman-Urban attend the Chanel Womenswear Spring/Summer 2026 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on October 06, 2025 in Paris, France.

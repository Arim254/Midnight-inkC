    "body": "\n\tSpeaking in conversation at the Red Sea Film Festival in Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong director and producer Stanley Tong (“Rumble in the Bronx”) traced the unlikely, injury-filled route that led him from stunt work to one of the most consequential collaborations in Jackie Chan’s career.\n\n\tTong began at the beginning, recalling how he first entered the film industry not behind a camera, but directly inside the action. After meeting Bruce Lee at age 11 through his brother-in-law, an actor, Tong began training in martial arts and gymnastics before becoming a stuntman in 1980. “I broke my shoulders, my ribs, my back, and my kneecap,” he said. “It’s not easy work. I had many stitches. My ankles got twisted many times on both sides.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter a severe shoulder injury, Tong said his mother pushed him to leave stunt work altogether. “She said, ‘Stanley, get a new job,’” he recalled. Instead, he followed advice to shift into production roles as a way to learn filmmaking inside out, starting with script supervisor, which the veteran director says allowed him to follow “every shot, every scene, every dialogue.” He added, “You’re right there watching how the director talks to the actor. This is a tip for anybody.”\n\n\n\tTong quietly continued doing stunt work to support himself while progressing through nearly every department, including assistant director, screenwriter, production manager and camera operator, before becoming a stunt coordinator in 1986, the same year he first trained Michelle Yeoh.\n\n\tReflecting on his ambitions, Tong said directing was not always the initial goal. “In Hong Kong at the time, a stunt coordinator was more powerful than the director,” he said. “You’ve got all the stuntmen behind you. You go everywhere, you feel more safe.” But after reaching that position, he realized directing, and eventually producing was the only way to fully shape a film.\n\t\n\n\tThat realization set the stage for a defining moment: being handed the script for “Police Story 3: Supercop,” starring Chan. Tong recalled walking into a studio meeting where, in a single day, he met Chan, studio executives, and the film distributor. “When I go back in the afternoon, they give me the script of ‘Police Story 3,’” he said.\n\n\tTurning to his collaboration with Chan, Tong admitted he was overwhelmed. “They said, ‘You be the director,’ and I said, ‘What about Jackie’s team?’ They said, ‘We won’t use it, just you,’” he recalled. “I didn’t reply for five days. I was very scared.”\n\n\tTong ultimately accepted after studying Chan’s films and recognizing a fundamental problem with the existing script, which centered on a gun-heavy robbery on Hong Kong streets. “We don’t have permission to shoot guns in Hong Kong,” Tong said. “The police won’t block the road. The producer and production manager could go to jail.”\n\n\tBecause “Police Story” entries one and two were already iconic, Tong felt repeating the same approach would be pointless. “If I shot ‘Police Story 3’ as it is, I don’t think I can do anything better than that,” he said. “So I told my boss, ‘Can I change the script?’ It was brave to ask.”\n\n\tTong proposed relocating the film to a location where authorities would allow helicopters, large-scale stunts and weapons. “Jackie deserved to have the biggest story,” he said. He also pushed to cast Yeoh as a true action co-lead. “In Jackie’s movies, you’ve never seen the girl fight,” Tong said. “So I talked to Jackie. Jackie liked the idea. The boss likes the idea.” From there, Tong said, the film was rebuilt from the ground up around that shift.\n\n\tThe rewritten “Police Story 3: Supercop” became a milestone, earning Chan his first Hong Kong Film Award for best actor and opening doors internationally. Looking back, Tong said the film’s impact came not from its scale, but from working within constraints. “As a filmmaker, you want to make dreams come true,” he said. “But you have to think about how to get through all these hurdles.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a “Weekend Update” that featured jokes about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, a sunburned vacationer played by cast member Ben Marshall and how Netflix will jack up its prices to $50 million in order to buy Warner Bros., Sarah Sherman stole the show playing the drunk raccoon that (actually!) got wasted in a Virigina liquor store this week, and passed out in the bathroom.\n\n\t“Here to explain their actions is that drunk raccoon,” said Colin Jost.\n\t\n\n\tComing on to Jost, while writhing around the Update desk, the raccoon complained that it doesn’t have any privacy, as Jost said she has a “serious drinking problem.” She countered that the “problem being I can’t get drunk in a bathroom without people taking pictures of me face down, ass up!” \n\n\tWhen Jost asked her whether Bradley Cooper’s portrayal of Rocket Raccoon in Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies is considered a positive representation of raccoons, she said, “I wouldn’t know, I haven’t seen it — I’m not a virgin.”\n\n\tAfter saying she was starving and asking to DoorDash something, she said, “You know what’s actually good that you wouldn’t think is good? Poop!” When Jost seemed grossed out, she said, “Quiet, piggy.”\n\n\tJost then told her he thought raccoons ate only trash, and she said, “We hear what you call us. Trash pandas. Dumpster dogs. The Sarah Shermans of the forest.” To which Jost responded, “You’re not nearly as hairy as Sarah Sherman.”\n\n\tJost said she just hoped she got the help she needs for her drinking problem, and that he hoped she didn’t give him rabies. “Rabies is the last thing you need to worry about getting from me,” the raccoon said to Jost.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Marrakech Film Festival has grown alongside Morocco’s flourishing film industry. When the festival debuted in 2001, the local scene produced just five films a year. Today, that number has surged to around 40, reflecting a variety of initiatives aimed at nurturing and sustaining new generations of talent. \n\n\tPrograms like the Atlas Workshops have been instrumental in connecting emerging auteurs onto the international stage, while initiatives such as the female-focused Tamayouz Foundation — founded by three Moroccan filmmakers and two producers — work to remove barriers to entry. The foundation provides entry-level training for women interested in the industry, along with financial support and mentorship in directing, screenwriting, production and post-production, and has also experienced significant growth in recent years.\n\t\n\n\tHere are four filmmakers from four very different backgrounds who are making waves in Marrakech.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Meriame Essadak – Producer \n\n\tMeriame Essadak has worn many hats throughout her career, moving from education to foreign services to marketing before breaking into film through incubator programs with the Tamayouz Cinema Foundation and the Atlas Workshops. She currently has three features in development, including Mohcine Nadifi’s psychological thriller “La Piste.” The project won the Tangier Film Festival pitch competition in 2024 and was one of five titles selected for a Franco-Moroccan co-production session in Cannes — meetings that sparked serious interest from several French companies. \n\n\t“Mohcine initially approached me to co-write the film, which I did,” she explains. “But when we started looking for a producer, I took the bull by the horns. I told him, ‘You have me. I’m your warrior, and I’ll defend this project body and soul.’ As a producer, I only take on projects that hit me hard, because they demand sleepless nights and immense mental energy. If it doesn’t make me vibrate, it’s not worth it — the connection has to be physical.” \n\t\n\n\tEssadak is also developing “Potes,” directed by Hamza Atifi, and “Rajol,” from Adnane Rami, both of which have gone through the Tamayouz professional lab. \n\n\t“Potes is about Moroccan students who go abroad to study and struggle to reconnect with home,” she says. “It’s the voice of a young generation that sees itself as resolutely modern, only to discover abroad that certain expectations and gazes remain unchanged.” Meanwhile, “Rajol” explores “what it means to be a man in Morocco today, in a society where women’s voices are increasingly heard.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDriss Ramdi – Actor\n\n\tBorn in Morocco and based in France, Driss Ramdi first broke out with a supporting role in Mehdi Ben Attia’s Berlin-selected “Je Ne Suis Pas Mort,” earning a spot on the César shortlist for Most Promising Newcomer. Since then, he has built a steady career with roles in Rachel Lang’s “Baden Baden,” Emmanuel Hamon’s “Escape from Raqqa,” Emmanuel Finkiel’s “A Decent Man,” and the popular Canal Plus rap series “All the Way Up.” \n\n\tThis year, Ramdi steps into the spotlight for the first time as the tortured protagonist of Meryem Benm’Barek’s “Behind the Palm Trees,” which premiered in competition in Marrakech. Looking ahead, he is determined to build on the emotional intensity and authenticity he tapped into for Benm’Barek’s film. \n\n\t“Now I want to work as deeply as I did on this role,” he says. “I want to do more and more interesting films. I’m very particular: I refuse cliché roles — the terrorist, the meaningless thug. I choose carefully. I want leading roles. I want to meet directors, dive into projects where you really invest yourself.” \n\n\tRamdi is also exploring a lighter, more playful side through stand-up comedy. “That actually scares me the most,” he admits. “I’ve been writing a lot — with notebooks scattered all over my home — but direct contact with an audience still gives me chills. I can stand in front of [someone incredibly famous, like] Brad Pitt and be super focused, super calm. But on stage… that’s my next challenge.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYoussef Michraf – Director\n\n\tBorn into a self-described “lower-middle-class family,” Youssef Michraf left his native Casablanca at 18 to train as an engineer in France. But once he arrived, he felt compelled to follow his true calling. He studied film at La Sorbonne before earning a directing spot at the prestigious national film school La Fémis, and soon set out to launch his debut feature, “Sweet Disposition.” \n\t\n\n\tThe film blends body-horror with a coming-of-age narrative, centering on a young boy so ashamed of his modest origins that he invents an elaborate ruse — one that soon spirals into a literal corporeal transformation. Michraf presented the project at the Atlas Workshops in 2021, winning the Artekino International Prize, and has since sought to reposition the film outside the French system after moving to Los Angeles. \n\n\t“American friends are launching a production company,” he says. “They have financiers ready, and things are going well. They’re much more open than the French — genuinely enthusiastic about the complexity and specificity of the film. In France, films set in Morocco have to fit certain expectations, and I found that suffocating. There’s not enough openness to nuance or complexity, whereas the Americans I met really valued the film’s identity and felt it was worth protecting.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLeyna Tahiri – Director\n\n\tLeyna Tahiri began in politics, driven to “understand the world.” She soon realized she needed another language: “the language of emotions, of cinema.” \n\n\tAfter working as a development executive for “In Therapy” writers David Elkaïm and Vincent Poymiro, Tahiri turned to Moroccan television, contributing to serialized dramas while developing her own personal projects. \n\n\tPreparing her next short, she also brought her feature, “Earth and Ashes,” to this year’s Atlas Workshops. The film follows a tense judicial process after the death of a France-born architect, leaving his Moroccan family — and the Gallic courts — to decide whether he should be buried according to secular or Islamic traditions. Nabil Ayouch and “Calle Malaga” producers Amine Benjelloun and Jean-Rémi Ducourtioux are on board.\n\n\t“I realized this situation happens often,” Tahiri says. “It also raises the question: is a funeral for the dead, or for the living?” \n\n\t“Like many children of immigrants, I ask myself a lot of questions,” she adds. “I was raised in France, built my career in Morocco, and want to explore those cultural dynamics. Nabil also comes from a dual culture, so it resonated with him immediately. So many people share similar stories from their own lives — what happened to my aunt, my grandmother. Everyone has a story that echoes this film, which makes it feel universal.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSaudi filmmaker Shahad Ameen’s road movie “Hijra,” about the bond formed between different generations of Saudi women during a journey across the desert, delves deep into the country’s multi-cultural DNA, intending to show the country’s little known aspect “as a melting pot,” says the director.\n\n\t“Hijra,” which is Saudi’s Academy Award submission and is in competition at the Red Sea Film Festival this week, is the second feature from Ameen whose feminist fable “Scales” made a splash after launching from Venice in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tShot in a vast swathe of desert and in several Saudi cities and urban areas including Jeddah, Medina, AlUla and Neom, “Hijra” is set in 2001 and revolves around a Saudi grandmother named Sitti (Khayriya Nazmi) traveling from Taif to Mecca to perform the sacred ritual of Hajj with her two granddaughters Janna (Lamar Faden) and Sarah (Raghad Bokhari).\n\n\n\tThe ambitious film, which features stunning visuals of remote parts of Saudi, is a co-production between A Beit Ameen and Iraqi Independent Film Center Production in association with Ideation Studios, Film Clinic, Human Film, Daw’ Film – Film Commission | MOC, Noon Art Media Production and Three Arts.\n\n\tVariety speaks to Ameen about taking her vision as filmmaker to the next level with “Hijra” and depicting Saudi Arabia “in a very different way.”\n\n\tHow did this story germinate?\n\n\tI had this missing girl idea that I had been playing around with for years. I had a script about a younger sister looking for her older sister with her father in Jeddah. The whole script was ready to go. I wrote it after “Scales.” And then, all of a sudden, I hated it. I outgrew it. I thought it was childish. I threw it out. Then, years later, I was talking to my producer Mohamed Al-Daradji – we really collaborate a lot on writing – and he said: “Aren’t you tired of the [patriarchal] father story that you already did in “Scales”? What if you make a woman’s story with a grandmother in a multi-generational context? So that’s how it re-started.\n\t\n\n\tDo you have a personal connection to this story?\n\n\tWell my family – it’s not something I say a lot – but my father’s family are immigrants from China, fifth generation. So I thought: “what if the missing girl is an immigrant?” That became an exciting thread. Then, I went back to the earlier script and the best scene in that was when they passed a checkpoint through Mecca with all the pilgrims and all of that during Hajj. And suddenly everything was connected and it became a story about immigration. It’s a story about a girl trying to escape from her grandmother to a different country. \n\n\tTalk to me about casting Lamar Faden as the younger granddaughter Janna. She’s so expressive!\n\n\tI was talking to one of the film’s producers Faisal Baltyuor at the Red Sea festival and Lamar passed by with her sister. I said [to myself]: “Who is this girl?” And like a crazy person, I chased her and got her sister’s phone number. She really stayed in my mind. She was nine at the time. Then, a couple of years later, when we started casting I called her. She came do to a screen test with her sister and I was like: Oh my God! I knew I wanted her even before she started acting the scene! Then Lamar acted and I saw that my instinct was right. She was talented. And she has a very nice ethnicity as well. She has a grandmother who is Pakistani, and Indonesian heritage from the father’s side. So sometimes she looks super Saudi; sometimes she looks like she’s from Philippines; sometimes she looks like she’s from Mexico; sometimes she looks like she’s from Indonesia.\n\n\tThe film’s opening scene is quite symbolic. Ice is wiped away from the windshield of a bus headed to the holy land, and we meet Sarah, cloaked in a white abaya. Can you talk to me about how you conceived it?\n\n\tI wanted it to reflect how 20 years ago in Saudi you just couldn’t see a woman like you see a man. So the viewer should be able to do this gradually. You start to peek in slowly, a man is opening a curtain, and you are allowed to peek in a little bit to see what both of them are feeling. How they act around each other. And then we are allowed to enter into the lives of these three women.\n\n\tTalk to me about the choice of ice. It’s such a non-typical Saudi element.\n\n\tIn these areas, it gets very cold. They have to scrape the ice off the windshields of their cars. I know it might sound very mundane. But people, when they think of Saudi, they think desert, right? But we have incredible locations in Saudi like the south of Saudi Arabia and the north of Saudi Arabia are all mountainous areas with a very high altitude, you know. So I wanted to bring out this diverse landscape.\n\t\n\n\tSomewhat similarly, the most important thing in this film for me was to present Saudi as a melting pot. A diverse place where a lot of Muslims have sought refuge and they live there in peace and security. That, and also the diversity in locations. That was very important to me. Because, you know, people don’t know Saudi. We don’t have many films. And through that, I wanted to present Saudi in a very different way. Who would think that Saudi would have ice? It’s very ambiguous. And I wanted that ambiguity to carry the story forward.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Venice Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLauded French actor Juliette Binoche, who is currently at the Red Sea Film Festival both as an honoree and to present her directorial debut “In-I in Motion,” praised Arab filmmakers Cherien Dabis (“All That’s Left of You”) and Shahad Ameen (“Hijra”) during a conversation event organized by Kering’s Women in Motion initiative. Binoche, who shared the panel with the directors, told Dabis and Ameen that, “in the Western world, we need to hear stories like yours.” \n\t\n\n\tSpeaking directly to Ameen following the Saudi director’s account of breaking into filmmaking during the rise of her country’s burgeoning film industry, the “Chocolat” actor said: “When a young woman from your country watches a film and wants to direct, it’s amazing. You’re so courageous. I think it’s remarkable.” \n\n\n\tThe panel, the first-ever “Kering | Women in Motion” event to take place at the Red Sea Film Festival, was preceded by a passionate speech by Kering’s chief brand officer Laurent Claquin. The French exec said being in Jeddah was “meaningful and inspiring,” particularly given 2025 marks ten years of the initiative that was first launched in Cannes back in 2025. “As we look for the next 10 years, our commitment remains unchanged: to stand with all those who dare to challenge boundaries and move forward. The Red Sea Film Festival in just a few editions has become far more than an event, it is a platform for creativity and bold expression, a place where artists from the region and all over the world bring their stories to life. We are really proud to be here this year.”\n\t\n\n\tThe talk revolved around the directors’ latest works, with Binoche recalling how her directorial debut started with advice from Robert Redford. The late U.S. actor-filmmaker watched the French actor’s stage show “In-I” in New York, and told her she must direct a film about its making. Redford’s wish came true 17 years later, with Binoche’s documentary on her creative process alongside dancer Akram Khan premiering at the San Sebastian Film Festival earlier this year. \n\n\tRedford was also somewhat involved in Dabis’ lauded drama, given it premiered back in January at the director’s Sundance Film Festival. Talking about the film, the Palestinian-American director said she wanted to tell a story “that has not been told about what happened to Palestinians in 1948,” when the Palestine War led to the Nakba. The Arabic word for “the catastrophe” is used to refer to the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in order to establish the State of Israel. \n\n\t“The impact of displacement and occupation in different generations continues to this day,” added the director. “I wanted to really explore the human toll of all of these events that people have been reading about in the news for decades. Western media in particular has a way of dehumanizing Palestinians. For me, making this movie was a way of honoring Palestinians.” \n\n\tDabis said she feels there is “much more support for our Arab stories in Europe than the U.S.,” recalling how Arab filmmaking changed after 9/11. “As someone who was living in New York at that time, it felt like the Arab world was like, ‘Oh, we need to invest in our stories. We have to change the narrative and start making this a priority because our image is being shaped for us, and it’s not a good one.’”\n\n\t“I’ve gotten to watch the Arab world blossom in this way,” she continued, praising events like the former Dubai Film Festival, the work of the Doha Film Institute, and now the initiatives taking place at Red Sea. “It’s been really exciting to see.”\n\n\tAmeen felt in a full-circle moment at the panel, stating she was inspired to get into filmmaking as a young woman thanks to Dabis’ trailblazing work. “I saw ‘Amreeka’ in film school, and I bought it immediately,” the Saudi filmmaker told her now peer on stage. “I couldn’t wait because there were not enough films telling our stories. I saw your film and kept thinking: What can I do in the future?”\n\t\n\n\tThe Saudi filmmaker, whose “Hijra” premiered at the Venice Film Festival, appeared thrilled about premiering her film back home. “Saudi Arabia is the most exciting place on the planet to make films right now,” she said. “You can do whatever you want. There’s a place for every voice. I dislike it when Saudi filmmakers try to copy American films. Be yourself, be weird, be odd, and someone will recognize [it]. Having the opportunity to tell our stories is an incredible privilege.”\n\n\tTo that, Binoche enthusiastically said: “I think it’s wonderful. Go for it, baby! We’re waiting!” \n",

    "description": "\n\tOscar-winning Korean actor Youn Yuh-jung opened up about her remarkable six-decade career during an In Conversation event at the Singapore Internati",
    "body": "\n\tOscar-winning Korean actor Youn Yuh-jung opened up about her remarkable six-decade career during an In Conversation event at the Singapore International Film Festival, sharing candid insights about her unconventional start in the industry, her formative relationship with director Kim Ki-young, and the challenges she overcame to achieve international recognition.\n\n\tThe 78-year-old actor, recipient of the festival’s Screen Icon Award, participated in a wide-ranging discussion with local actors Rebecca Lim and Janice Koh that touched on everything from her 1971 debut film “Woman of Fire” to her recent Hollywood projects, including the Oscar-winning “Minari.”\n\t\n\n\tYoun revealed that her entry into acting was entirely accidental, stemming from a failed university entrance exam in the 1960s. Needing to earn money while attending a less prestigious college, she took a part-time job at a television station, which led to an unexpected audition.\n\n\n\t“I didn’t plan to be actress,” Youn said. “I went to the station for a tour, and they asked me to audition. I said no, I cannot read this line in front of camera. But I did it, and I got accepted as talent.”\n\n\tUnlike today’s system-driven Korean entertainment industry, Youn had no formal training. “I didn’t have any theatrical background or film school experience,” she acknowledged. “That’s why I felt guilty about my job, because all of them from theatrical background, they had training, but I didn’t have any training.”\n\n\tThis lack of formal education became a driving force in her approach to roles. “Every role I get, I studied my lines. I memorized thoroughly. I practiced so many ways because I realized I didn’t have gifted talent. That’s why I needed to practice. Nobody thinks I’m putting that much hard work. They think I’m just doing naturally or something. No, I work so hard,” Youn explained.\n\t\n\n\tHer breakthrough came with “Woman of Fire,” directed by Kim Ki-young, when she was in her early 20s. The controversial role, where she played a country girl who turns femme fatale, was a departure from the typical melodramas of 1970s Korean cinema, where actresses were expected to fit conventional beauty standards.\n\n\t“Back in my time, in Korean standard, if you want to be actress, you got to be most beautiful person,” Youn said. “I’m not pretty by Korean standards. I’m not beautiful. So most of them [films] at the time, there’s the melodrama — the poor girl falls with a rich boy, and then the family against her, blah, blah, same old story. But this script was very different.”\n\n\tDespite winning best actress at the Blue Dragon Awards and Best New Actress at the Grand Bell Awards for her debut, Youn faced harsh criticism. “When you hear about yourself judging by somebody else, it’s not pleasant feeling,” she said. One critic told her that with her voice, she would never make it as an actress. “He saw me blooming, blooming, and he said, ‘You are the first one I made the wrong criticism.’ He always said he was right. But he passed away.”\n\n\tYoun credited Kim Ki-young as a major influence on her career, recalling their unusual working relationship. The director insisted on meeting with her regularly before filming began, which she initially found uncomfortable. “I was thinking maybe he’s plotting or something,” she recalled. “The first day of shooting, he said, ‘Miss Youn, when I met you during the meeting, I told you about something, and you had very weird smile and very strange smile. I want that smile.’ That’s why he was watching me. He was observing me.”\n\n\tKim’s advice about choosing roles stayed with her throughout her career. “He always called me Miss Youn. He said, ‘The main role is not important. Don’t do it, because you have a big responsibility. If you are doing the main role, if you fail there, it’s all your responsibility. So it’s very dangerous. But safe way is just being a supporting actress. That is very safe way, and then you get the money too.'”\n\n\tYoun’s path to “Minari” was equally unconventional. Director Lee Isaac Chung sent her the script through a friend, but she stopped reading at page 40 due to the difficulty of reading in English. “I called her and asked, ‘Is it based on his real life story?’ And she said it is. So I said, okay, I’ll do it. You cannot be genuine more than his real life story. You don’t need any writer. So this must be genuine.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production presented numerous challenges. When the producer asked her to fly economy class from Seoul to Tulsa, Oklahoma, Youn negotiated for business class — and ended up paying for it herself. “I spent a lot of money for that film,” she said. She also hired her own professional translator friend to improve the Korean dialogue, covering the ticket and payment personally.\n\n\t“I sacrificed my time and my money,” Youn explained. “I don’t know why I did that, because I want to make it nice one properly. Because the translation is very important.”\n\n\tDespite the hardships, the collaboration proved fruitful. “That’s why I think we become good friends, Isaac,” she said. “If he comes to Korea, he always visits me. If I go to the States, I always visit him. And he became a huge director now, working for the ‘Oceans 11’ [the prequel] now. I’m so proud of him, I’m very happy as a Korean.”\n\n\tWhen asked about the international recognition following “Minari” — including becoming the first Korean actor to win an Oscar, SAG Award, and BAFTA — Youn remained grounded. “When you become famous, people lift you up with no reasons, and then they tear you down with no reasons,” she said. “Out of kindness, out of malice. So I experienced enough. I’m myself.”\n\n\tAt 78, Youn has adopted what she calls a “luxury” approach to her career. “The true luxury is just do what I like to do,” she explained. “I can choose my time, or I can choose the director, I can choose the scenario. That’s my luxury.”\n\n\tThis selective approach came after years of working intensively to support her two sons as a single mother. “I worked so hard for my two boys. They were in the States boarding school, so I had to pay a lot,” she said. “After they graduated everything, I promised myself, okay, I’ll be free. I’m going to work whatever I want. If I like the director, I will do it, or if the writer has good writing, then I will do it.”\n\n\tRegarding the evolution of the Korean entertainment industry, Youn noted significant changes from her early days. “My time, we just step by step,” she said. “If I get paid this much for this time and if I get paid little bit more for next time. But nowadays, it’s all changed. They have some kind of factory, because I’m old school, so I don’t agree with them 100%.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, she noted that opportunities for senior actors remain limited. “The roles got very limited because of the production cost. They just cut down, make it very small family. So it’s not many roles for us,” she said. “But now, in my age, I understand everything is because of capitalism.”\n\n\tWhen asked about advice for young Asian actors, Youn demurred. “Usually when you’re young, we don’t listen to elderly persons,” she said. “In Korea, they usually say, ‘Is there any message for the younger generation?’ So I usually say, I’m not the Pope, I don’t have any message.”\n\n\tOn whether she might write a memoir, Youn was firm. “I told one guy, a movie reporter who was fighting with depression, ‘You are the one who could write about my lifetime story. But after I passed away, you can write about me, but not before.’ I don’t like to share my private life.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump didn’t throw much support behind Secretary of War Pete Hegseth in the cold open of the Dec. 6 episode of “Saturday Night Live.”\n\n\tColin Jost reprised his role as Hegseth, berating the press as they were asking about the United States’ strikes on boats that were alleged to be operated by narco-terrorists. After calling one journalist fat and berating another for being single, he made a less-than-believable denial that the military operation went as planned. \n\t\n\n\t“That kind of cruel, heartless act has no place in operation ‘Kill Everybody,'” Jost-as-Hegseth said. “Second, I wasn’t even in the room when it happened. OK, I was so jacked up after the first strike I had to make an emergency call to my sponsor … I’m sorry, a guy I met at an anonymous meeting. So I don’t drink something I want, but I can’t have. But I want it, and I need it and I want it right now. It’s booze.”\n\n\n\tHegseth then brought out James Austin Johnson’s Donald Trump as support, but the president was too busy sleeping and dreaming about newly elected NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, mumbling that the politician can “freeze my rent anytime.”\n\n\tTrump then woke up enough to say, “I stand by Pete, and nothing can change my mind. Unless, of course, he could hurt me in any way, in which case I’ll throw him under one of Mamdani’s free buses.”\n\n\tMelissa McCarthy is the host of the Dec. 6 episode, with Dijon as the musical guest.\n\n\tWatch the cold open below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor those destined to be songwriters, the spark of inspiration strikes early in life. That was one common theme from many of the heartfelt thank-yous and reflections shared by the diverse group of musical artists honored Saturday at Variety‘s annual Hitmakers brunch in Hollywood.\n\n\tSabrina Carpenter, Variety’s Hitmaker of the Year, spoke wistfully of writing her first song at age 10. Tyler, the Creator credited his the roots of his creativity to the “crazy imagination” of his 7-year-old self. Tate McRae got going on writing songs in her bedroom at 13. EJAE, part of the powerhouse pop trio Huntr/x featured in the smash Netflix film “KPop Demon Hunters,” did the same at 10. And 89-year-old blues legend Buddy Guy recalled growing up in rural Louisiana without a steady source of clean water in his earliest years. His family devised a filtering system for rainwater. “There must’ve been something alright with that water,” he observed, because he drank a lot of it and he’s still active as he approaches 90.\n\t\n\n\tRELATED CONTENT: Sabrina Carpenter Tells Hitmakers Crowd ‘Write the Music You Want to Listen To’\n\n\n\tThe ninth annual Hitmakers gathering coincided with the Dec. 3 publication, in print and online, of Variety‘s annual Hitmakers issue, which is a survey of the artists and collaborators behind the year’s 25 most popular songs. The issue puts a big spotlight on the range of tunesmiths, producers and other creative collaborators behind every successful song.\n\n\tAlex Warren, the artist and songwriter behind the global smash “Ordinary,” expressed his deep gratitude for the recognition as Hitmakers Breakthrough of the Year artist. He set the tone early on for emotional remarks to the roomful of music biz insiders. He detailed some personal struggles and the loss of his father at age 9 and the struggles with his mother that followed. \n\t\n\n\tThe job of penning his first album, “You’ll Be Alright, Kid,” was particularly “hard because I had to confront the childhood I tried so hard to forget.” The response to his work reinforces that he’s on the right career path. “I am enough,” Warren told the crowd. “I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m here for a reason and I deserve to be here.”\n\n\tBigXthaPlug got the nod for Hitmakers Hip-Hop Disruptor of the Year. He’s part of the UnitedMasters collective that aims to empower artists to work independent of the major music congloms in order to retain ownership of their work. “Thank y’all for recognizing what we’re doing independently — yes independently,” said BigXthaPlug.\n\n\tBenny Blanco was on hard to present the laurel to rising-star band The Marías’ as the Anti-Hit Hitmakers of the Year. María Zardoya, lead singer and co-founder, told the crowd that she has always stood firm against efforts to pop-ify the group’s sound. She thanked Atlantic Records for allowing them to lean into their genuine moods. “Emotion has always taken us further than tempo ever could,” Zardoya told the crowd. “Thank you so much for letting us be emotional wrecks and release whatever we want now.”\n\n\tRELATED CONTENT: Tyler, the Creator Saluted for a Decade of ‘Super-Duper, Awesome S—‘ at Hitmakers\n\n\tThe marathon brunch was emceed by Jem Aswad, Variety‘s executive editor of music. Among the kudos handed out was the Interactive Music in Media nod to video game firm Riot Games for its innovative work to platform music in its game creations.\n\n\tNo less a respected music hitmaker than Jimmy Jam was on had to present Producers of the Year kudos to Jack Antonoff, Mustard and Sounwave, who got the nod for their work with the musical juggernaut that is Kendrick Lamar.\n\n\tJam emphasized the importance of the audience in deciding what qualifies as a hit. “That’s why it’s a team sport,” he said of the music biz.\n\n\tSounwave dug deep when he cited his childhood exposure, thanks to his mother, to the life-coach philosophies of Earl Nightingale as being fundamental early experiences that led him into music. While other kids were listening to hip-hop radio in the car with their moms, he was exposed to ideas for achieving his dreams.\n\n\t“It molded me to understand the power of manifestations,” Sounwave said. Mustard reflected on the road that he’s traveled over the past decade with his longtime collaborator Lamar. He described them as “two kids from Compton trying to figure it out.” And to that end, the overarching goal has always been to “inspire a community and a culture that inspired us. I promise to forever do that while I’m walking the Earth.”\n\t\n\n\tElliot Grainge, leader of Atlantic Records, was recognized as Executive of the Year for his turnaround of the storied music factory with buzzy releases such as Warren’s “Ordinary,” Rosé, as well as longer-standing artists like Bruno Mars, Charli xcx and Coldplay, Cardi B and Twenty One Pilots. He heaped credit on Atlantic’s artists and his executive team. “Labels get a bad rep today for being labels, rightly or wrongly. We are all human,” he observed. The most important role that labels play in the lives of artists is to “push them to heights we all wish we could go to ourselves,” he said.\n\n\tSinger Addison Rae and her collaborators Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjard were tipped as rising stars by receiving the Future Is Female award. “This music exists because of how we showed up for one another,” Kloser told the crowd. “Being part of that trust and support has been very inspiring to me.”\n\n\tFuerza Regida, the Mexican American band from San Bernardino, was feted as Humanitarians of the Year for their work to help families with food drives and and through the hardships inflicted on Latino communities through the ICE immigration raids that have shocked the nation.\n\n\t“This award is the most important because we are for the people. This is our dream,” said the band’s Jesús Ortiz Paz, better known to fans as JOP. \n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” singer Rei Ami was briefly overwhelmed as she accepted her kudos alongside Huntr/x’s EJAE and Audrey Nuna. Ami shook it off with an impromptu pep talk to herself that got a laugh from the crowd: “Don’t cry, bitch. Get it together!” After years of hard work and little recognition, Ami said the trio’s work as Huntr/x presented “the perfect chance for the three of us. An opportunity to become friends and sisters for life.”\n\n\tRising star Rosé, who fielded a big hit with “Apt.” in tandem with Bruno Mars, also reflected on how quickly success can strike. The collaboration with the veteran hitmaker led to “an absolute explosion of surprises and an overwhelming amount of love.” And she admitted that gaining international recognition has been “a tiny bit of a mindfuck.”\n\n\tThe mighty Republic Records prevailed once again as Hitmakers’ Label of the Year. The group’s imprints were responsible for no less than 10 of the tunes on this year’s Hitmakers top 25 list. Marleny Reyes, Republic’s long-serving general manager, accepted on behalf of the company. She said the secret to Republic’s success is found in its leaders and in the artists they champion. “It is an army and a family,” she said while emphasizing, “We got nothing without our musicians who have so much power and energy. They are so inspiring.”\n\t\n\n\tPremier partners for Hitmakers included TikTok, Riot Games, CashApp & Visa.\n\n\t(Pictured: “KPop Demon Hunters” stars Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna and EJAE at Variety‘s Hitmakers brunch)\n",

    "body": "\n\tChinese audiences pushed animation, action and historical war films to the top of 2025’s satisfaction charts, while comedies and romance all but disappeared from favor, according to new research unveiled at the 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival, China.\n\n\tIn a forum presentation at the festival, Sun Xianghui, president of the China Film Art Research Center, revealed that consumer satisfaction scores for those genres outdid others in the center’s 2025 survey, with films like the Nanjing massacre WWII epic “Dead to Rights”, and animation juggernaut “Ne Zha 2” leading in both satisfaction scores and box office returns.\n\t\n\n\tMirroring trends seen in Western markets, the study showed that Chinese audiences have largely abandoned comedies and romance films in 2025, with not a single romance film figuring in the top satisfaction scores of the survey.\n\n\n\tChina’s local film box office has netted $6.7 billion in the year to date, a figure significantly higher than 2024’s $5.8 billion total. Excluding December’s take, local films counted for some 83.8% of the box office.\n\n\t“In 2025, global film production has entered a period of slow growth,” said Sun. “European production capacity is limited, and the traditional Hollywood growth model shows fatigue, with diminished appeal for blockbuster production and markets.”\n\n\tThe recent success of “Zootopia 2” at the Chinese box office, however, and the eagerly anticipated premiere of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” at the same festival, suggests this downbeat assessment to be a tad presumptuous.\n\t\n\n\tAs of writing, “Zootopia 2” has crossed $393 million at the Chinese box office.\n\n\tThe film has grossed more in China than at the domestic North American market ($187 million), a fact Sun was eager to highlight, but also suggests the continued intertwining of fates between Hollywood studios and Chinese audiences.\n\n\tSeparately, film officials were keen to promote international production in Hainan, pointing to its imminent designation as a Free Trade Port on Dec. 18 as a distinct selling point for producers.\n\n\tOfficials also dangled carrots in the form of living subsidies of up to RMB1 million ($141,000) for “leading talents,” and between RMB200,000- 500,000 RMB ($28,000 – $70,700) for “international talents”, as well as visa-free entry for personnel from 86 countries.\n\n\tThe new Free Trade Port status also promises zero tariffs for imported film production equipment, and income tax incentives for foreign “high-level talent,” while post houses and visual effects companies can, in principle, operate as wholly foreign-owned enterprises.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHugh Jackman recently appeared on “The Graham Norton Show” (via Entertainment Weekly) where he proclaimed that he will never say he is never playing Wolverine again. Jackman announced he was done playing the iconic X-Men superhero after 2017’s “Logan,” which ended with the character’s death. But Jackman wasn’t being truthful. He returned as Wolverine seven years later in the 2024 Marvel blockbuster “Deadpool and Wolverine.”\n\n\t“Every time you’re on [talk show], you gotta go, ‘Nope, I’m not doing that again,’ But then you keep making another one. And it’s a big big hit. So are you gonna have to do it again?” Jackman said. “Maybe. I am never saying ‘never’ ever again… But I did mean it when I said ‘never’ [the first time], until the day when I changed my mind. But I really did for quite a few years, I meant it.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring last year’s “Deadpool and Wolverine” press tour, Jackman admitted that his feelings about staying in retirement from Wolverine were complicated after he saw the first “Deadpool” movie.\n\n\t“I was like, ‘Those two characters together.’ I knew it. I knew the fans wanted it ever since I put on the claws, people talked about these two. So, that had always been there, but I just knew,” he told Fandango. “I rang Ryan [Reynolds]. And I just said, ‘Let’s do it.’ Like, I hadn’t rung my agent, no one. I had to ring my agent and said, ‘Oh, by the way, I have just committed to a movie.’”\n\n\tBut not everyone was initially sold on the idea of Jackman coming back as Wolverine. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed to Empire that he originally warned Jackman against playing Wolverine again.\n\t\n\n\t“I said, ‘Let me give you a piece of advice, Hugh. Don’t come back,’” Feige said. “‘You had the greatest ending in history with ‘Logan.’ That’s not something we should undo.’”\n\n\tAs Marvel movie fans eventually found out in “Deadpool and Wolverine,” Jackman did not return as the iteration of Wolverine he played for decades and hung up in “Logan.” Marvel’s multiverse allowed the actor to play a new variant of Wolverine. Whether or not Jackman pops up as the mutant in next year’s “Avengers: Doomsday” or its sequel, “Avengers: Secret Wars,” remains to be seen. Many of Jackman’s original “X-Men” co-stars, from Ian McKellen to Patrick Stewart and James Marsden, are appearing in “Doomsday.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs it gears up for a busy awards season, Mubi has hired veteran publicity executive VJ Carbone as VP of communications in the U.S.. \n\n\tUnder his role at Mubi, Carbone will oversee publicity for the company’s U.S. film campaigns and expanding U.S. presence. He will be based in the New York office and will report to Sophie Rhatigan, Mubi’s senior VP of communications for global.\n\n\tMubi recently released Lynne Ramsay’s psychological thriller “Die My Love” starring Jennifer Lawrence whose electric performance opposite Robert Pattinson has been critically lauded. The movie world premiered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, went on to play at festivals around the world, and is now being touted by Mubi as a strong contender in the awards race, especially for the best actress category. Earlier this month, Mubi received nine Gotham Awards nominations, and 24 BIFA nominations (with Akinola Davies Jr’s “My Father’s Shadow,” a Mubi release, emerging as a frontrunner). The company is also behind the four films leading nominations at the European Film Awards with Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” Oliver Laxe’s “Sirat,” Masha Schilinski’s “Sound of Falling” and Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident.” \n\t\n\n\t“We are thrilled to welcome VJ to Mubi,” said Rhatigan. “His experience, reputation, and passion for cinema make him an excellent addition to our team at a moment when supporting strong independent storytelling matters more than ever,” the executive continued. \n\n\n\tCarbone, who was most recently a consultant at Amazon MGM Studios where he led campaigns on “Bones and All,” “Challengers” and “Boys in the Boat,” said he was “honored to join the remarkable Mubi team.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve dedicated my career to championing great films and filmmakers, and I’m excited to bring my experience to the work ahead and to help amplify the voices, projects, and vision that make Mubi so special,” he continued. \n\n\tPrior to his time at Amazon MGM Studios, Carbone spent a combined 14 years at Focus Features, working on such titles as “Brokeback Mountain,” “The Constant Gardener,” “Atonement,” “Somewhere,” “Moonrise Kingdom” and “Downtown Abbey.” He is the co-founder of the Asbury Park Film Initiative, a non-profit film-based organization promoting culture, education and diversity. \n\n\tMubi’s theatrical releases in the U.S. this year include Paolo Sorrentino’s “La Grazia” starring Toni Servillo, who won the Coppa Volpi Prize for best actor at Venice, and Jim Jarmusch’s “Father Mother Sister Brother,” which won the Golden Lion Venice. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked: For Good” viewers might never see her face, but the actor Bethany Weaver plays a huge role in the blockbuster musical sequel. Weaver takes over the role of Dorothy Gale, originally played by Judy Garland in 1939’s “The Wizard of Oz.” The actor took to Instagram during “Wicked: For Good’s” record-breaking opening weekend to reveal herself as the film’s Dorothy.\n\n\t“This has been a life changing experience, it’s changed me in so many ways and most importantly, for good,” Weaver wrote alongside behind-the-scenes photos from the “Wicked: For Good” set. “It’s been an honor to carry the legacy of the brilliant women before me who have stepped into these shoes, and embarked on the yellow brick road. I hope I have made them proud. Thank you for the sheer volume of love, kind messages and support from all of my friends and family and the glorious wicked fans, I love you all so much!”\n\t\n\n\tWeaver, a relative newcomer who makes her feature film debut in “Wicked: For Good,” proceeded to thank the film’s casting director, costume designer and make-up artists for helping her land and transform into the role of Dorothy. She also thanked the movie’s director, Jon M. Chu, writing: “A huge thank you to the best filmmaker of all time for choosing me to be your Dorothy in this wonderfully wicked universe called Oz. Thank you for contributing to starting my beginning.”\n\n\tThe plot of “Wicked: For Good” unfolds concurrently with that of “The Wizard of Oz.” In keeping in line with the Broadway musical, where Dorothy is never seen, the movie version only shows Dorothy from the back as she walks down the Yellow Brick Road and stands before the Wizard, who instructs her to bring him the broom of the Wicked Witch once she’s been vanquished.\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” rocked the box office with a $150 million domestic debut, which is the biggest opening in history for a Broadway film adaptation. The sequel’s launch was also much higher than the $112 million that the first “Wicked” movie launched to in 2024. These ticket sales also rank as the year’s second-biggest opening behind April’s “A Minecraft Movie” ($162 million).\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures.

    "body": "\n\tMore than a few eyebrows were raised around Hollywood when Universal decided to turn “Wicked” into two separate films.\n\n\tYes, the stage show has been a sensation on Broadway for decades. But it’s a risk to split any movie in half and count on audiences to return a year or more later for the conclusion. Musicals are already a polarizing genre, and in this case, Universal needed to turn two (!) of them into blockbusters to justify the expensive gamble. After all, the studio spent a combined $300 million on production and roughly $250 million on marketing for 2024’s “Wicked” and the follow-up, “Wicked: For Good.”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough the Oz dust has yet to settle, it’s clear the financial gambit has paid off. “Wicked” struck a chord with $758 million globally, making the film the highest grossing Broadway adaptation in box office history (for now). That’s to say nothing of riches on premium video-on-demand (where the film earned a mighty $70 million in just its first week) as well as 10 Oscar nominations.\n\n\n\tA year later, fans weren’t able to resist Oz’s gravitational pull, returning in force for the epic finale of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande). “Wicked: For Good” was even more popular than its predecessor in terms of opening weekend, collecting a dazzling $150 million domestically and $226 million worldwide. By comparison, the first film opened to $112.5 million domestically and $164 million globally.\n\n\t“The excitement and energy around this weekend’s opening was tremendous and cut across all categories of cinema-goers: young, old, women and men,” says Sean Gamble, CEO of Cinemark, one of the country’s largest theater chains.\n\t\n\n\tBack in 2022, director Jon M. Chu explained the decision behind the two-parter as a creative necessity, saying the story — which takes place before, during and after the events of “The Wizard of Oz” — was too expansive to be contained to two hours and change. At that point, Universal had been developing the film for nearly 20 years. “It became impossible to wrestle the story of ‘Wicked’ into a single film without doing some real damage to it,” Chu said ahead of production. “We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one ‘Wicked’ movie but two!”\n\n\tFans of “Wicked” were concerned because the stage show’s second half is dramatically shorter, darker and less cohesive than Act One, which has most of the songs (“Defying Gravity,” “Popular” and “What Is This Feeling?” among them) that audiences know and love. Critics weren’t as charmed by “For Good,” which scored a 70% on Rotten Tomatoes while the original film earned an 88% average. But audiences remain obsessulated, awarding the second installment an “A” grade on CinemaScore, just like the first. With strong audience scores, goodwill toward the pink-and-green property, and a prime release date ahead of Thanksgiving, “Wicked: For Good” is poised for a long and winding theatrical run.\n\n\t“This was a risk before anyone knew how it would turn out,” says analyst Shawn Robbins, director of movie analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. “The first film, which had an incredible fan turnout, was the marketing for the second film. There was no better way to release it.”\n\n\tBefore “Wicked,” Hollywood hadn’t triumphantly adapted a stage show for the screen in over a decade — you have to go back to 2012’s “Les Miserables” ($442 million globally) or 2014’s “Into the Woods” ($212 million) to find a big musical hit. That’s not for lack of trying. Yet recent attempts like Steven Spielberg’s 2021 “West Side Story” remake ($76 million against a $100 million budget), Chu’s 2021 “In the Heights” ($45 million against a $55 million budget), 2021’s “Dear Evan Hansen” ($19 million against $28 million budget), 2019’s “Cats” ($78 million against a $100 million budget) and 2023’s “The Color Purple” ($68 million against $100 million budget) all faltered on the big screen despite being based on popular productions.\n\t\n\n\t“Musicals are challenging to execute,” says Robbins. “In a lot of those cases, they weren’t crowd-pleasers or missed the mark on a creative level. Others were darker and just weren’t suitable to commercial audiences outside of Broadway fans.”\n\n\tHollywood has also learned the hard way that splitting a blockbuster into two films doesn’t necessarily double the profits. Director Denis Villeneuve succeeded with 2021’s “Dune: Part One” and 2024’s “Dune Part Two,” which brought Frank Herbert’s sprawling sci-fi novel to the screen to outsized box office results. Otherwise, two-part releases have worked when capping off long-running franchises, like “Harry Potter,” “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games.” In some cases, requiring a second (or third) trip to cinemas for the competed story can feel like a cash grab à la “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two,” which was renamed to “The Final Reckoning” after “Part One” fizzled at the box office, or Kevin Costner’s four-part “Horizon: An American Saga,” which probably won’t pull off its multi-installment ambitions after the first chapter misfired in theaters.\n\n\tUniversal made good by turning “Wicked” into a leave-the-home-worthy event. For the studio, that involved producing a two-hour NBC musical special “Wicked: One Wonderful Night,” partnering with 400 consumer brands such as Dunkin and American Girl, and promoting the movie in less expected places like on ESPN. An added challenge was needing to keep the musical property in the zeitgeist for two years without wearing out audiences. \n\n\t“Our marketing department made ‘Wicked’ something you had to see to be part of the excitement,” says Universal’s domestic distribution chief Jim Orr. “That’s not easy to do.”\n\n\tAt this point, Universal executives are humming a similar tune as Glinda in “Wicked: For Good’s” opening sequence: “Who wouldn’t be happier?”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGeorge Clooney will be honored with Film at Lincoln Center’s 51st Chaplin Award. He will be feted at a gala on April 27. \n\tThis recognition comes after Clooney’s latest film, “Jay Kelly,” played at the New York Film Festival, hosted by Film at Lincoln Center. Clooney has been in the Oscar conversation for “Jay Kelly,” in which he plays an aging movie star who faces a personal and professional reckoning. So he embarks on a journey through Europe — traveling by planes, trains and automobiles — with his long-time manager (Adam Sandler) as the two reflect on their life choices, relationships and legacies. \n\t\n\t“It was a true pleasure to welcome George Clooney to Film at Lincoln Center in September for the premiere of ‘Jay Kelly,’ a highlight of the 63rd New York Film Festival,” said Daniel Battsek, FLC President. “We are honored to invite him back to celebrate a professional life that reflects such extraordinary range and purpose. From award-winning performances to standout producing work to acclaimed directing, George brings a distinctive blend of intelligence, craft, and social conscience to everything he does. His contributions continue to inspire audiences and artists around the world.” \n\n\tOne of Hollywood’s biggest stars, Clooney’s influence spans television and film, starting with his breakout role on “ER” and continuing with films such as “Syriana,” “O Brother Where Art Thou,” “Up in the Air” and the “Oceans” trilogy. His work also recently extended to the stage, earning a Tony nomination for his Broadway debut in “Good Night, and Good Luck,” a play based on his film of the same name. Clooney is also known for his humanitarian efforts, advocating for the First Amendment as well as the human-rights campaigns for the crises in Darfur in Sudan.\n\t\n\t“George Clooney embodies a rare blend of artistry, generosity, humor, and integrity. His unmistakable on-screen charisma is matched by the excellence he brings behind the camera as a director and producer, consistently using his influence to champion emerging talent and shine a light on urgent humanitarian issues around the world,” said Dan Stern, chairman of the FLC Board of Directors. “We are proud to present George with the 51st Chaplin Award, placing him among the cinematic luminaries who have received this honor over the last half-century.” Presented each year at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall, the Chaplin Award recognizes an individual’s significant contributions to the art of cinema. Past recipients have included Pedro Almodóvar, Viola Davis, Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee, Meryl Streep, Martin Scorsese, Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, and Gregory Peck.",

    "body": "\n\tTunisian actress Dorra Zarrouk (“Whispering Sands”) was in Doha for the launch of the city’s inaugural film festival, bringing with her the perspective of an actor who has recently expanded her work behind the camera. After two decades as one of the Arab world’s most recognizable screen talents, she made her directing debut last year with the documentary “The Life That Remains,” which continues to travel on the festival circuit.\n\t\n\n\t“The Life That Remains” follows a young Gazan woman, Nadine, and her family as they flee the war and attempt to rebuild their lives in Egypt. Shot largely in intimate, domestic spaces, the documentary traces their displacement with a focus on everyday resilience rather than political commentary.\n\n\n\tAt the Doha Film Festival, Zarrouk spoke with Variety about the film’s urgent origins, the growing role of festivals in the region, and the discipline behind sustaining a long career.\n\n\n\tYou’re attending the first edition of the Doha Film Festival. What does this launch represent for you and for the region?It’s a great pleasure to be here. A first edition is always special, and I think it’s important for Qatar to have a festival of this scale. It completes something that has already been happening, especially with the Doha Film Institute consistently supporting independent and engaged films. Of course they can’t support everything, but that belief matters. A festival connects those films with audiences, so that link is essential.\n\n\tHow did “The Life That Remains” come about?I didn’t plan to direct at all. But watching what was happening in Gaza, I felt powerless. As an actress, you can post or speak on social media, but it didn’t feel like enough. Then I received a message on Instagram from Nadine, a young woman fleeing Gaza with her two babies to Egypt. She wasn’t asking me for help; she just wanted to say they were leaving. There was so much dignity in that message. I felt I had to tell her story. I didn’t wait for producers or funding, I just did it.\n\t\n\n\tHow did you convince Nadine and her family to participate? Were they hesitant?She wasn’t hesitant, just surprised. These are people who had never been filmed before. When I mentioned the idea, she said, “Let me ask my husband,” and then came back and said, “We agree.” When you’ve lost everything, a project like this can feel like a small ray of hope. Once we started shooting, her younger sisters would call me on off-days asking, “When do we film again?” They’d lost their routines. Filming gave them something to hold on to.\n\n\tHow did you build the trust needed to film the family so closely?Trust is everything. She knew me as an actress, so I wasn’t a total stranger walking in with a camera, which helped. But I was very aware of my responsibility. I didn’t want to put them in danger or expose them in unwanted ways. I wanted to film their dignity, not their misfortune. One sister cried in front of the camera and told me to remove it because she’s known as “the strong one.” But that moment, bringing strength and fragility together, is the truth I wanted the film to hold.\n\n\tWhat were the reactions from the family and from audiences when they saw the finished film?The first screening was at the Cairo Film Festival. The whole family came, and many Palestinians. A woman came to me crying, saying she saw herself in the film. For the family, it was emotional. Nothing in the film made them uncomfortable, but it brought back memories, some of them painful. At every festival, Carthage, Rotterdam, the reaction has been emotional. People don’t always expect that from documentaries, but sometimes reality carries more emotion than fiction.\n\n\tYou’ve said that in documentary “you sometimes have to make the film now,” while fiction allows for more time. How do you see these two modes fitting into the industry at the moment?Documentary can’t wait. The story is happening, you feel urgency, and you move with it. Fiction has a different rhythm where you can take your time to write, develop, build the world, and secure funding. Both are necessary in the region. We need films that respond directly to the present moment, and we also need fiction that takes years to craft. What matters is that the industry creates space for both forms and both timelines.\n\t\n\n\tEarlier you said a festival “completes the process” by connecting films to audiences. What role do you think a new event like Doha can play within the Arab film ecosystem?A festival isn’t only for filmmakers, it’s where the public finally meets the films. In our region we have many important stories and talented directors, but they need visibility and a space to show their work. When a festival like Doha begins, it creates a place for discovery, for new voices to emerge, and for the industry to grow. I think this festival will expand, and that’s important for everyone making films here.\n\n\tWhat did you discover about yourself by directing for the first time?Freedom. When you act, you serve someone else’s vision. When you direct, you create your own universe. I loved discovering more about editing, sound, color, all the parts of filmmaking I’d never touched. It was a completely different experience to not be in front of the camera. It allowed me space to just be while on set. I’ll direct again, maybe fiction next time, but only if the story calls me.\n\n\tWhat do you credit for your longevity in an industry that changes so quickly?Longevity is much more difficult than achieving success once. In this profession there are always ups and downs with moments when you’re working nonstop and others when you’re not getting the right proposals, or when the spotlight simply isn’t on you. You have to know how to live through that. I’ve had periods of doubt, moments that were very hard, but you have to admit when something hasn’t worked, get up again and reinvent yourself. A film, a series, a play, you never know if it will succeed or not, so you learn not to panic. You learn to ask, “What am I doing in these quiet moments? How do I transform myself for the next step?” For me, the most important thing is to stay grounded. Don’t think, “I’m a star and this will last forever.” You have to keep your feet on the ground, stay steady, keep learning, and keep moving forward. That’s what allows you to continue.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRupert Grint recently told the BBC that he wrote new Ron Weasley actor Alastair Stout a letter before the child actor started production on HBO’s “Harry Potter” television series. Grint played Ron in the eight-film “Harry Potter” franchise from 2001 to 2011. HBO’s series reboot will feature Stout as Ron opposite fellow newcomers Dominic McLaughlin as Harry and Arabella Stanton as Hermione.\n\n\t“I wrote him a letter before they started, passing the baton as it were,” Grint said. “It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience… It’s quite strange to have the cycle happening again. I’m really intrigued what it’s going to be like.”\n\t\n\n\tGrint acknowledged there’s “a bit of family resemblance” between himself and Stout, adding: “I think it’s great that it’s a whole new thing. It’s going to be its own thing, and I think that will be fun.”\n\n\n\tDaniel Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter in the movie franchise, similarly reached out to the actor taking over his iconic role. Radcliffe said on “Good Morning America” earlier this month that he wrote a letter to McLaughlin and got a “very sweet note back.”\n\n\t“I don’t want to be a specter in the life of these children but I just wanted to write to him to say, ‘I hope you have the best time, and an even better time than I did — I had a great time, but I hope you have an even better time,’” Radcliffe explained. “And I do, I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them. They just seem so young. I just look at them and say, ‘Oh, it’s crazy I was doing that at that age.’ But it’s also incredibly sweet and I hope they’re having a great time.”\n\t\n\n\tGrint told the BBC that even with a new “Harry Potter” adaptation on the way, he’ll still “never step out of Ron Weasley’s shadow.”\n\n\t“I’m fine with that. I think it’s great,” he said. “I love meeting people who really felt this was part of their childhood… It has a quite deep meaning to a lot of people of my generation, and even more to generations who are finding it now. It’s great. It gives me a lot of pride. It was such a huge thing. I don’t think I’ll ever quite step out of his shadow, but I’m fine with that.”\n\n\tPlus, Grint has always been an advocate for new actors to take over the franchise. Speaking to GQ Magazine UK in July 2023 before HBO announced its “Harry Potter” series reboot, Grint encouraged someone else to play Ron Weasley and added: “I’d love to see ‘Harry Potter’ be adapted into a TV show. I think it would really work. I’m sure the films will get remade, anyway.”\n\n\tThe “Harry Potter” series is set to debut on HBO and HBO Max in 2027. \n",

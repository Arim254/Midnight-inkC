    "body": "\n\tOscar-winning “Anora” director Sean Baker will serve as president of this year’s Red Sea Film Festival‘s features jury.\n\n\tThe Saudi Arabian fest is holding its fifth edition from Dec. 3 to 14, with a lineup including Angelina Jolie’s “Couture,” “The Wizard of the Kremlin” starring Jude Law and Paul Dano and Rupert Wyatt’s “Desert Warrior” with Ben Kingsley and Anthony Mackie.\n\n\t“It’s an honor to serve as jury president for the Red Sea International Film Festival this year, taking the baton from Spike Lee,” Baker said in a statement. “I’ve long admired how the festival champions bold, diverse voices from across the globe, and this year’s Feature Competition showcases some of the most daring and exciting new voices from the Arab world, Africa and Asia. Festivals like Red Sea IFF give independent films a vital platform and connect them with a global audience, I’m thrilled to be part of that celebration of cinema and look forward to engaging with the incredible titles in the competition lineup.”\n\t\n\n\tBaker’s “Anora” took home five Oscars earlier this year, including best picture, director, original screenplay, editing and actress for Mikey Madison. A champion of indie cinema, Baker is also known for his pioneering features “Tangerine” (2015), which was entirely shot on an iPhone, and “The Florida Project” (2017).\n\n\tAdded Faisal Baltyuor, CEO of the Red Sea Film Foundation: “Sean Baker is a trailblazing director whose dedication to championing authentic and meaningful storytelling through film is truly inspiring. He has continually pushed the boundaries of cinema with authentic storytelling and an unmistakable artistic vision, and we deeply admire his commitment to independent filmmaking. We are very proud to be bringing him on board to lead our features jury this year, fresh off his record-breaking success at the 2025 Academy Awards for our very special fifth edition.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlan Cumming has unveiled Pitlochry Festival Theatre’s programming for 2026. This will mark Cumming’s inaugural year as the theater’s artistic Ddirector for the theater and coincide with the 75th anniversary of of the Scottish Highland Theatre. \n\n\t“My first season of programmed work as artistic director in 2026 also happens to be the 75th anniversary of Pitlochry Festival Theatre’s founding by a man named John Stewart, who came here during the Second World War and made a promise to himself that he would return and build a theater,” Cummings said in a statement Thursday. “I have found I have a great affinity with John: we both came to Pitlochry and were mesmerized, we both share a belief in dreaming big and the power of positivity and manifestation. And for my first season, just as he did in 1951, I have invited people here who I admire and love, and who have been part of the theatrical journey that led me to becoming this theater’s artistic director.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s productions will include “Once” directed by John Tiffany and choreographed by Steven Hoggett, Lerner Loewe’s “My Fair Lady” directed by Maria Friedman, which will feature Cummings as Henry Higgins.

    "body": "\n\tNBCUniversal is back in the game of operating a stand-alone sports network.\n\n\tThe Comcast-controlled media conglomerate said it would revive NBCSN, or NBC Sports Network, and devote it to sports programming that usually streams on the company’s Peacock service, including Monday-night NBA games and the “Gold Zone” Olympics whip-around show.\n\n\t“NBCUniversal delivers the biggest moments in sports, and the new NBC Sports Network gives pay-tv customers a seamless way to enjoy the wide range of sports in our portfolio, adding an important pillar in our linear and streaming strategy,” said Matt Schnaars, president, platform distribution and partnerships at NBCUniversal, in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tNBCU, which previously operated an NBCSN that first started as a small sports network called Outdoor Life Network, then Versus, shut the property down in 2021. Now it will return first on YouTube TV — giving Comcast a chance to tweak competitor Disney, whose ESPN and other properties are currently not available on the service due to a blackout and disagreement over carriage terms.\n\n\tThe deal with YouTube TV likely adds new wrinkles to the usual back-and-forth between content companies and their distributors. Cable and video companies like Charter Communications and Cox would no doubt like to be able to give their customers access to the content that streams exclusively on services like Peacock or Disney+. Indeed, in some cases deals have been struck that make streaming outlets like Disney+ part of a pay-TV subscription. \n\n\tBut NBC’s solution, creating a stand-alone pay-TV network that features streaming-only content could divert subscriptions away from Peacock and toward YouTube TV, creating some headwinds in the effort to win new Peacock customers.\n\t\n\n\tNBC said NBCSN would soon be available on Comcast’s own Xfinity service, and via other distributors in months to come.\n\n\tIn addition to Monday-night NBA games, NBCSC will offer Premier League soccer matches, WNBA games, Big Ten and Notre Dame football and Kentucky Derby undercard races, among other sports. The service is also expected to offer Major League Baseball games as part of an agreement many expect to be unveiled between NBC and Major League Baseball.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaskovski Films has picked up sales rights to documentary “Paikar,” the debut feature by Afghan-Dutch filmmaker Dawood Hilmandi, which will world premiere at IDFA in the Luminous section.\n\n\tBorn in Afghanistan and raised in exile, Hilmandi grew up in the shadow of his father, Baba — a former mujahideen fighter who later became an imam, writer and poet. For years, Baba’s silence and authority ruled the household, leaving little room for questions or tenderness. Yet behind his sternness lived a man of reflection and sensitivity, whose words and verses hinted at a gentleness rarely shown.\n\t\n\n\tWhen life and loss bring him back to his father’s side, Hilmandi begins a journey to bridge the distance between them. Together they retrace Baba’s past across Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq, through places marked by faith and violence, exile and return.\n\n\n\tThe producers are Frank Hoeve and Katja Draaijer of Amsterdam-based Baldr Film. Distribution for the Netherlands is handled by Cinema Delicatessen.\n\n\tIrena Taskovski, head of acquisitions at Taskovski Films, said, “Paikar speaks to the invisible wounds carried by those who live in the shadow of conflict. Though rooted in Afghanistan, its echoes reach far beyond — wherever families are divided by war, silence, or ideology. It’s a film for our times, reminding us that humanity is always larger than history.”\n\n\tHoeve added, “ ‘Paikar’ is an intimately human story, and Taskovski’s unwavering dedication to meaningful cinema makes sure films like this reach audiences who are genuinely touched by them.”\n\t\n\n\tHilmandi’s video essay “Me Montage” opened the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. He won the top prize in the Open Doors program with his pitch for “Badeszenen” at the Locarno Film Festival in 2017.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSaidam Baryl and Argentic Productions have signed a co-production agreement on “Thaw,” a folk-horror feature written and directed by Yakutian filmmaker Stepan Burnashev. \n\n\tThe deal, signed at the American Film Market (AFM), represents what is believed to be the first narrative feature co-production between a Yakut and an American film company.\n\n\tThe mystical thriller takes place in a remote Yakutian village, where an American filmmaker investigating thawing permafrost gets caught up in a local teenager named Sardaana’s shamanic initiation. The story explores the intersection of climate science and indigenous beliefs, blending documentary-style observation with spiritual and psychological elements.\n\t\n\n\t“In Western culture, experiences like this are often framed as possession requiring exorcism,” Burnashev said. “In Sakha tradition, it is understood as the beginning of becoming a shaman — a calling, a responsibility. ‘Thaw’ invites audiences to see this transformation not as something to drive out, but something to understand.”\n\n\n\tKT Kent of Argentic Productions described the project as “a distinctive voice piece — elevated folk-horror with cultural specificity, real place, and international upside.”\n\n\tThe production plans to assemble an international cast and creative team, with a global theatrical and streaming release strategy. “Thaw” is eyeing a festival debut in late 2026 or early 2027.\n\n\tBurnashev has emerged as a prominent figure in contemporary Yakutian cinema, known for atmospheric storytelling that blends modern life with indigenous Sakha perspectives. In October, four of his films — “Black Snow,” “Our Winter,” “Cursed Land-Fate” and “Aita” — launched globally on Prime Video. He recently wrapped production on “The Penthouse,” a psychological thriller shot in Malaysia starring Soji Arai of “Tokyo Vice” and “Pachinko.”\n\t\n\n\tKent founded Argentic Productions in 2017, focusing on genre content with thematic depth. “We are looking for projects that inform public discourse,” Kent said. “How do old philosophies apply to modern life? How can you interpret events in new ways that challenge your perspective? We want you to leave the theater going ‘Wow! I never thought of it that way.’ We want to make films that you’ll still be debating over dinner the next week. ‘Thaw’ fits that profile perfectly.”\n\n\tSaidam Baryl is based in Yakutsk in Russia’s Sakha Republic, while Argentic Productions is based in Los Angeles.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney closed out its 2025 fiscal year on a streaming high note, delivering healthy quarterly subscriber growth for Disney+ and Hulu — the final quarter the media giant will report subscriber figures — and a 39% increase in direct-to-consumer operating income.\n\n\tThe Mouse House reported a combined 195.7 million Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions as of Sept. 27, an increase of 12.4 million for the three-month period, which topped Wall Street estimates by 2.1 million.\n\t\n\n\tDisney+ subscribers increased by 3.8 million in the quarter to hit 131.6 million, including a net gain of 1.5 million in the U.S. and Canada (to stand at 59.3 million). Helping boost Disney+ sign-ups in the quarter was the Sept. 3 release on the streamer of the live-action remake of “Lilo & Stitch,” which was a box-office smash. The film had 14.3 million views during its first five days on Disney+, making it the second-biggest live action premiere on the streamer after 2023’s “The Little Mermaid” (16 million views in first five days). Disney also called out “Alien: Earth” as FX’s biggest premiere ever on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\n\n\tHulu netted 8.6 million new subs, primarily from Disney’s expanded distribution deal with Charter to provide the ad-supported version of Hulu to all of Charter’s Spectrum TV Select customers for no additional charge. Note that Disney’s subscriber tallies include users who “receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements” whether or not they actually watch anything.\n\n\tSome analysts had expected Disney+ sub growth to flatline in the quarter, after a wave of consumers threatened to cancel their subscriptions because of ABC’s decision to briefly suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show in September over his on-air comments about “the MAGA gang” trying to score political points from Charlie Kirk’s murder. In addition, some conservatives said they dropped Disney’s streaming services in protest of Kimmel’s remarks. While cancellation rates for Disney+ and Hulu doubled in September vs. the prior two months, sign-ups also increased for both services, according to independent measurement firm Antenna.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Disney on Sept. 23 announced U.S. price increases across most Disney+ and Hulu plans and bundles, the third price hike in three years. Because those went into effect Oct. 21, subscriber cancellations from the higher fees will likely be greater in the year-end quarter.\n\n\tDisney is now in the process of merging Disney+ and Hulu and is steadily adding integrated features, after completing the full acquisition of Hulu in a deal with Comcast this June. In 2026, the company expects to fully combine Hulu into Disney+ into a unified app and service, although Disney says users will still be able to purchase them as standalone plans. In addition, Hulu last month replaced Star as its global entertainment streaming brand outside the U.S.\n\n\tIn the September quarter, streaming was the bright spot for Disney’s entertainment segment amid revenue and operating income declines for linear TV and theatrical releases. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 8% to $6.25 billion and operating income jumped 39% to $352 million. The results don’t reflect Disney’s acquisition of Fubo, which it closed Oct. 29 and is merging with the Hulu + Live TV business.\n\n\tAs previously announced, Disney will not report Disney+ or Hulu paid subscribers or average revenue per unit (ARPU) after this quarter because those metrics have become “less meaningful to evaluating the performance of our businesses.” That follows the lead of Netflix, which ended the practice at the start of 2025.\n\n\tDisney+ domestic ARPU was flat sequentially at $8.09/month for the September quarter. Average revenue per paid subscriber for Hulu’s VOD tiers declined 2% quarter over quarter to $12.20/month (reflecting lower per-sub wholesale rates in the Charter deal).\n\n\tDisney no longer reports streaming subscribers for ESPN. Its final disclosure for ESPN+ (now called ESPN Select) was 24.1 million subscribers as of the end of the June quarter. In August, the sports programmer bowed ESPN Unlimited, a $29.99/month standalone streamer that for the first time includes everything from ESPN’s networks and services.\n\n\tSEE ALSO: Disney Quarterly Revenue Flat and Operating Income Drops 5%, but Company Affirms Bullish Earnings Outlook on Streaming Momentum\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe independent Telugu-language feature “Nadhi” has completed production after a yearlong shoot, with a cast led by acclaimed actor-director Nandita Das and veteran performer Nasser, it was revealed at the American Film Market (AFM). \n\n\tSet in the forests of Andhra Pradesh, southern India, during the mid-20th century, the film follows an ancient tribe struggling to maintain its traditional way of life as members are drawn toward modernity following the construction of a dam.\n\t\n\n\tWriter-director Aditya Vempaty, a San Francisco Bay Area native who graduated from USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, developed the project after connecting with the Koya tribe of India’s Eastern Ghats, to which he traces his ancestry. The filmmaker spent months living in the Koya heartland across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, building relationships with community members who later participated in the production.\n\n\n\t“I wanted to tell a story that examines changing our relationship to nature and each other as the world develops around us,” Vempaty said.\n\n\tThe production shot on location at the foothills of the Eastern Ghats and outside Hyderabad, working closely with local communities to recreate the period setting. The filmmaking team constructed a period-authentic village along with sets, wardrobe and props, while locals guided them to undisturbed wilderness locations.\n\n\tDas, known for directing “Firaaq,” “Manto” and “Zwigato,” and for acting in “Fire” and “Bawandar,”  returns to acting as village matriarch Devi. Her character’s grown children are portrayed by Maharshi Vudhya, Anusha Nuthula and Jagan Yogiraj. The ensemble also includes Mia Maelzer (“Stolen”) and Saileela. Nasser, whose credits include “Nayakan” and the “Baahubali” franchise, plays Sathya Mohan, a government officer bridging the film’s past and present timelines.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast blends non-actors from the Koya community with trained performers from Hyderabad’s theater scene.\n\n\tProducers are Brendan Bennett, Krishna Mamidibathula and Vempaty, with Radha Krishna Nambu executive producing through FrameByFrame Pictures. Harish CP Yarlagadda, chair of Malaxmi Group, Hyderabad, co-produced.\n\n\tPrincipal photography began in October last year and extended over 12 months to capture seasonal changes across the landscape.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney‘s revenue for the September quarter was roughly flat year over year — coming in short of Wall Street estimates — and adjusted earnings per share declined 3%. But Disney+ and Hulu subscriber additions were better than expected, and the company says it’s still on track to deliver double-digit earnings growth over the next two years.\n\n\tThe company reported revenue of $22.46 billion for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended Sept. 27, shy of analyst average expectations for $22.75 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 beat the Street by 6 cents. Overall segment operating income was $3.5 billion, down 5% year over year, on declines in its linear TV and theatrical businesses offset by strong streaming results and a good quarter for parks and experiences. For its full-year fiscal ’25, revenue was $94.43 billion (up 3%) and adjusted EPS increased 19% to $5.93.\n\t\n\n\tLooking ahead, Disney reiterated its prior guidance of double-digit adjusted EPS growth for fiscal ’26 and again in fiscal 2027. The company announced it is doubling its share repurchases target to $7 billion next year compared with fiscal 2025. And Disney’s board declared a cash dividend of $1.50 per share (payable in January and July 2026), up from $1/share in 2025.\n\n\n\t“This was another year of great progress as we strengthened the company by leveraging the value of our creative and brand assets and continued to make meaningful progress in our direct-to-consumer businesses,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in prepared remarks. “Our strategy, coupled with our portfolio of complementary businesses and a strong balance sheet, enables us to continue investing in high-quality offerings for our consumers and increasing our returns to shareholders, and I’m pleased with our many achievements this fiscal year to position Disney for the future.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the September quarter, Disney+ and Hulu revenue increased 8% to $6.25 billion and operating income hit $352 million, up 39%. After investor concerns that streaming subscriptions would get crimped by a backlash over Jimmy Kimmel’s controversial Charlie Kirk remarks, Disney+ notched a net gain of 3.8 million subscribers and Hulu netted 8.6 million (largely due to the expansion of its distribution deal with Charter to bundle Hulu with Spectrum TV Select). It’s the last quarter Disney is disclosing those subscriber numbers, following the lead of Netflix.\n\n\tDisney’s domestic linear networks business, which includes ABC, saw revenue slide 7% to $1.86 billion. Operating income decreased 5% due to lower advertising stemming from decreases in TV viewership and lower political ad spending (which was $40 million lower than in Q4 fiscal 2024). In addition, the decrease in ad revenue reflected a comparison to the prior-year quarter’s airing of the 2024 Emmy Awards show on ABC.\n\n\tRevenue in the Disney entertainment group’s Content Sales/Licensing and Other business fell 26% in the quarter, to $1.9 billion, and it posted an operating loss of -$52 million (vs. operating income of $316 million a year prior). Disney chalked that up to a tough compare with record theatrical performances of “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool & Wolverine” in the prior-year quarter. The most recent quarter included the box-office take for Marvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” as well as “The Roses” and “Freakier Friday” and the carry-over performance of the live-action “Lilo & Stitch.”\n\n\tESPN domestic revenue for fiscal Q4 2025 was $3.58 billion, up 2%, while operating income declined 3% on higher marketing and programming and production costs. Domestic ad revenue increased 8%. In August, Disney launched ESPN Unlimited, the $29.99/month standalone streaming service that includes everything on ESPN, but the company isn’t providing subscriber numbers for the product.\n\n\tDisney’s Experiences segment revenue was up 6% to $8.77 billion, inclusive of domestic and international parks, cruises and consumer products. Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income grew 9% to $920 million and International Parks & Experiences operating income grew 25% to $375 million.\n\n\tIn the September quarter, Disney took a $450 million impairment charge for its investment in A+E Global Media, owned as a 50-50 venture with Hearst. This summer, Disney and Hearst tapped Wells Fargo to shop A+E, parent of cable networks A&E Network, History and Lifetime.\n\t\n\n\tFor the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (the last three months of calendar 2025), Disney projected direct-to-consumer entertainment operating income of about $375 million. It also forecast lower political advertising revenue of $140 million compared with the year-earlier quarter.\n\n\tIn the December 2025 quarter, Disney said, “theatrical slate comparisons” are expected to drive “an adverse impact to segment operating income of $400 million compared to Q1 fiscal 2025.” That partly reflects more theatrical releases in the period this year, including additional 20th Century Studios and Searchlight titles, and a comparison to the strong performances of “Moana 2” and “Mufasa: The Lion King” in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter releases include 20th Century Studios’ “Predator: Badlands” and box-office disappointment “Tron: Ares”; Disney’s upcoming holiday theatrical releases include “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”\n\n\tFor full-year fiscal 2026, Disney forecast double-digit percentage segment operating income growth for its entertainment segment (streaming, TV and film) “weighted to the second half of the year,” and operating margin of 10% for Disney+ and Hulu — fueled by continued streaming growth and recent price hikes. For parks and experiences, it expects high single-digit operating income growth, while ESPN will see low single-digit growth reflecting the “timing of rights expenses, which adversely impacts year-over-year comparability in Q2 and Q3.”\n\n\tIn fiscal 2026, Disney expects to spend $24 billion on content across entertainment and sports (vs. approximately $23 billion in FY25) and forecast $9 billion in capital expenditures. The company projected $19 billion in cash provided by operations for FY26, up 7% year over year; that includes the impact of $1.7 billion in taxes Disney deferred from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2026 as a result of tax relief granted due to the California wildfires.\n\n\tIger, meanwhile, is about to enter the final year of his contract as CEO, which is up at the end of 2026. The Disney board has said it expects to announce a successor early next year. Earlier this week, Disney extended the employment agreement of CFO Hugh Johnston through 2029.\n",

'cause a minor injury has put him on the sidelines ... TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Production sources tell TMZ ... the actor recently suffered an injury off set, and while it wasn't serious, it was enough to keep him from filming scenes scheduled this week at the Bicycle Casino just outside Los Angeles.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          It's unclear exactly how or where Will got hurt, but we're told the issue made it impossible for him to shoot the planned material safely or comfortably this week. Producers have temporarily rearranged the schedule while he recovers.\n      \n\n          The good news ... we're told the injury is minor, and the expectation is that Will will be back on set very soon, once he's cleared to return.\n      \n    \n          The 10-episode, untitled Netflix series centers on Lonnie \"The Hawk\" Hawkins, a fictional golf legend played by Ferrell, whose larger-than-life personality drives much of the comedy.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to reps for Will and Netflix ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Will Ferrell\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Netflix\n              \n                          \n                Golf\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Nurse!\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Jed Wallace and his company, Street Relations Inc., filed suit against Blake in February 2025 after she named both parties, along with Baldoni, in her December 2024 California civil rights complaint for bad behavior related to the filming of \"It Ends With Us.\"\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          The lawsuit was filed in Texas ... but, according to new legal docs obtained by TMZ, it was dismissed due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. Translation: the judge ruled Wallace didn't establish that the Texas court had the power to deal with the case.\n      \n\n          Blake's rep tells TMZ ... \"With this decision, all of the retaliatory lawsuits filed against Blake Lively by Justin Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and their crisis communications and digital teams have been dismissed. Ms. Lively will have her day in court on her claims at the March trial in New York.\"\n      \n    \n          But Blake has also had her legal setbacks ... Just last week, a judge dismissed Blake's claims in her lawsuit against Jed that he helped smear her reputation online during the release of “It Ends With Us.\" The judge ruled Blake's lawyers should not have sued Jed in New York because his firm is based in Austin, Texas and he has little connection to the Big Apple.\n      \n    \n          Unclear if Wallace plans to refile the lawsuit in a different state. We reached out to Wallace and his PR firm ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Blake Lively\n              \n                          \n                Justin Baldoni\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

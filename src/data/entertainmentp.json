    "body": "\n\tLaurence Fishburne has plenty of sore memories from his time in “The Matrix.” \n\n\t“We were essentially the first Western actors to work in the Hong Kong style,” he says of himself and co-stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss. “And so [martial arts choreographer] Yuen Woo-ping was very concerned that we weren’t going to be able to [pull it off]. So he trained us really hard—training us like professional athletes. And it was in the middle of that training I realized why they pay professional athletes so much money: Because professional athletes are always in pain. Not in pain sometimes—like when you go to the gym and then you’re sore for a day. They’re in pain All. The. Time.” \n\t\n\n\tThe grueling effort clearly paid off, visible not only in the film’s now-iconic fight sequences but also in the muscle memory Fishburne still carries more than a quarter-century later. “It’s all—I mean, it’s still in the body,” he laughs. “We each had two trainers, and they worked us really, really hard!” \n\n\n\tDuring a relaxed and rollicking conversation at this year’s Marrakech Film Festival, Fishburne reflected on a career defined by transformation. Over 90 minutes — with a few technical hiccups along the way — he traced his path from “a wise-ass street urchin” whose “universe was six blocks in Brooklyn” to his defining roles in “Apocalypse Now,” “King of New York,” “Boyz N the Hood,” and “The Matrix,” often stressing his need to defy expectations.\n\n\t“I’m always looking for ways to surprise the audience,” he explains. “I’m always trying to change a little here, shift a little there, so it’s not familiar visually — not someone you instantly recognize or can predict. Instead, I want to create a character who surprises you, someone in whom you either see yourself or someone you know.” \n\t\n\n\tThat philosophy guided his portrayal of the loose-cannon Jimmy Jump in Abel Ferrara’s “King of New York.” Fishburne drew from a familiar archetype — “a classic ‘two-gun kid’ from American westerns,” he says. “That young, reckless guy with two guns, like the character Kevin Costner plays in ‘Silverado’” — while layering in costumes, mannerisms, and quirks to make for something entirely fresh. \n\n\t“Jimmy Jump, for me, is the first hip-hop gangster on film,” Fishburne continues. “It came from intuition, from being from New York, spending time in those neighborhoods, going to hip-hop shows, knowing graffiti writers and breakdancers. I was very much part of that culture. I even knew someone who called himself a hip-hop gangster — he wanted to be a rapper but also had another side business. And I thought, ‘Why haven’t I ever seen this type of character in movies?’” \n\n\tFishburne experienced a different kind of recognition after his role as Furious Styles in John Singleton’s “Boyz N the Hood.” \n\n\t“I was living in Venice, California, right after the movie came out, when a young man approached me,” he recalls. “He had tears in his eyes and didn’t quite know how to express himself, except to say thank you for the movie. I responded gently and thanked him, but I was deeply moved by the raw emotion he was showing.” \n\n\tRoger Guenveur Smith, a friend and co-star from “King of New York,” put the encounter in perspective. “Roger turned to me and said, ‘You don’t understand what happened.’ I asked him what he meant, and he explained, ‘When you played Furious Styles, you essentially became the father to a fatherless generation of boys.’” \n\n\tThe actor maintained that fatherly demeanor once technical issues threatened to derail the talk – keeping measured as he calmed a restive audience. “You’re all so beautiful,” he said to cheers. “Thank you for being here.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJordanian filmmaker Zain Duraie arrives at this year’s Red Sea Film Festival with her first feature “Sink” (“Gharaq”), a deeply personal drama screening in competition. The film, which traces a mother’s increasing desperation as her teenage son slips into mental illness, marks a bold step for a director intent on reshaping expectations around Arab cinema. Duraie previously gained international attention with her short “Give Up the Ghost,” which premiered in Venice’s 2019 Horizons Shorts Competition and went on to win multiple festival awards.\n\t\n\n\tVariety is exclusively premiering the first trailer (below) for “Sink,” which follows Nadia (Clara Khoury), a mother convinced she can guide her teenage son, Basil (Mohammad Nizir), back on track after he’s suspended from school for a troubling outburst. But as his mental state steadily deteriorates, she overlooks the warning signs, sinking deeper into denial as disaster approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety ahead of the Red Sea Film Festival, Duraie shares that the story comes from a private place she prefers not to detail, though its emotional roots run deep. “It’s very personal, but I’m protecting the privacy of the person,” she explains. What she will acknowledge is the frustration that propelled her forward: “I noticed that nobody in the Arab world ever talked about this topic openly because everybody’s chasing the trendy subjects or the boxes Western festivals want checked. I wanted to do something different, something close to home, from my heart, something very personal.”\n\t\n\n\t“Sink” focuses on schizoaffective disorder and how it quietly upends the life of a seemingly stable, upper-middle-class family. While the subject is striking, Duraie emphasizes that the film is, at its core, about a mother’s love. That mother, played with deft subtlety by acclaimed Palestinian actress Clara Khoury, anchors the film’s emotional stakes. “People say my film is about mental health, but I think it’s an ode to motherhood,” Duraie notes, “a gift to motherhood.”\n\n\tThat nuanced domestic world was precisely what some Western funders rejected. “They told me it wasn’t ‘Jordanian enough,’ and I didn’t know what that meant,” she recalls. The implication, she felt, was clear: they expected poverty, overt social collapse, or an explicit institutional critique rather than a character-driven psychological drama set within a modern home. “It’s shot in my city. My crew and cast were from Jordan and Palestine, and everyone was fully dedicated to making this film happen.” she says. “Maybe they wanted the collapsing psychiatric system. That’s a film for another day, but not where my heart is.”\n\n\tInstead of reworking the film to fit those expectations, she and producer Alaa Alasad (Tabi360) turned toward regional co-production, securing financing from Arab partners who trusted the project as it was. “Nobody commented. Everybody gave me those funds with full confidence,” Duraie says. “They told me the power of the film is in its universality.” That independence shaped the tone of the shoot and edit, which she describes as a kind of creative freefall, made possible because “nobody was on top of us saying, ‘You have to do this or that.’” Support came from the Jordan Film Fund, Doha Film Institute, Red Sea Film Fund, and Lebanon’s Arab Fund for Arts and Culture.\n\n\tVisually, “Sink” is defined by water, a motif Duraie has long been drawn to and one that mirrors the mother’s internal state. The Arabic title can mean both “drowning” and “sinking,” and the pool becomes a symbolic space where the characters float, drift, and disappear beneath the surface. “I wanted to use that pool as a device in the film, her pool of denial,” she explains. “It’s him floating in that water around her and she’s not seeing that he’s actually sinking.”\n\t\n\n\tWorking with cinematographer Farouk Laaridh, she crafted a fluid aesthetic that peaks in the film’s central pool sequence — what the team called “the disaster sequence.” It begins in calm waters before slowly tightening with increasing unease. Laaridh shot underwater for the first time, letting the camera drift around the actors. “We told him: move the camera like you feel she would be thinking,” Duraie says.\n\n\tSilence, too, shapes the film. Duraie, who jokes she’s “terrified of dialogue,” built “Sink” on quiet emotional beats that mentors warned could easily fall flat. “But I wanted to play on silence as a tool for her denial,” she explains. “Sometimes I felt this could be a silent film and people would still understand it.” That restraint depended on her cast’s ability to convey emotion with minimal speech. Khoury and co-star Mohammad Nizar rise to the challenge. “It’s a risky role, and Clara took it on with so much courage,” Duraie reflects. She spent three years preparing with Nizar so he could fully inhabit the illness, guiding both actors toward the small gestures and interior shifts she views as “the real heart of cinema.”\n\n\tSince premiering in Toronto’s Discovery section and screening at BFI London, “Sink” has drawn strong reviews and intensely emotional reactions. A woman living with mental illness approached Duraie after a screening to thank her “for making us look human.” Mothers have shared their struggles with their own children. “If this film is touching people, changing a life, that’s more important than an award,” she reflects.\n\n\tReturning to Red Sea, where she first developed the project before being named an “Arab Star of Tomorrow” last year, feels especially meaningful. “It’s a full-circle moment,” she says. “I first harbored this project here. Now I’m back in competition. It’s not easy, so I’m honored — and nervous,” she adds with a laugh. With “Sink” now screening for an Arab audience for the first time, she admits she’s “scared of the reactions,” but also optimistic: “I am hoping they’re going to be touched.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, Duraie plans to continue exploring complex women and, perhaps, mental health in subtler ways. “My next film will be even crazier and riskier,” she says. “If I’m not in my element, I’m going to make a bad movie.” With “Sink,” she’s found that element, emerging as one of the most distinctive new voices in Arab cinema.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s rapidly expanding entertainment market is creating unprecedented scale for major players, with JioStar – the country’s biggest media conglomerate – reaching over 760 million monthly television viewers while its digital platform JioHotstar engages 400 million active users, CEO-entertainment Kevin Vaz said.\n\n\tSpeaking at the Asia TV Forum and Market in Singapore, Vaz outlined how India’s demographic profile and digital infrastructure are positioning the country as a content powerhouse capable of reshaping global storytelling. In his keynote session “Powering the Next Wave of a Billion Imaginations,” the executive presented JioStar’s vision of delivering “stories for every Indian, every day, on every screen.”\n\t\n\n\tVaz emphasized that India’s 1.4 billion people, with a median age of 29, “represent one of the world’s youngest and most dynamic audiences.” This demographic advantage, combined with rapidly expanding connectivity, is transforming how stories are created and consumed, he said.\n\n\n\tThe numbers underscore India’s entertainment scale: 900 million television viewers, 900 million internet users, 500 million social media users and more than 85 million connected TV households consuming content across 22 official languages and over 1,500 dialects. India’s production volume rivals any global market, churning out more than 200,000 hours of television programming, 1,800 films and over 400 web series annually.\n\n\tJioStar has captured a 35% television market share with more than 90 channels across 10 languages, consistently placing five shows in the top ten across genres. The company’s digital arm, JioHotstar, has surpassed one billion app downloads on Google Playstore. JioStar’s combined entertainment and sports offerings now reach 99% of India’s connected TV market.\n\t\n\n\tOn sports, Vaz described it as “one of JioStar’s strongest growth engines,” positioning the platform as “the undisputed home of sports in India.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, Vaz said the ambition “is not only to distribute content but to build a global imagination ecosystem where technology, data, culture, and creativity come together to redefine how stories are told, experienced, and shared.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGeorge Clooney told The Sunday Times that he’s still upset about losing the role of J.D. in Ridley Scott’s 1991 film “Thelma & Louise” to longtime friend and collaborator Brad Pitt.\n\n\t“I got to the final test for a role in ‘Thelma & Louise.’ And, motherfucker, Brad got it,” Clooney said. “I didn’t watch ‘Thelma & Louise’ for years, because I was annoyed. The part launched his career in film. He was doing sitcoms and crap before, so when it was the thing that could’ve launched me? Fuck!”\n\t\n\n\tIn the film, J.D. is a rugged vagabond who sparks a fleeting romance with Thelma (Geena Davis). As noted by Clooney, the film cemented Pitt as a bankable movie star. In the years following, Pitt led films like “A River Runs Through It,” “Interview with the Vampire,” “Se7en” and “12 Monkeys.”\n\n\n\tThe “Jay Kelly” star added that Pitt still taunts him about winning the “Thelma and Louise” role.\n\n\t“Oh yeah, he still gives me shit,” he said. “But, of course, when I saw it, I was, like, well, it had to be that guy.”\n\n\tClooney had to wait a few years after the release of “Thelma & Louise” to get his movie star break. He became a household name playing Dr. Doug Ross on “ER” from 1994 to 1999. In 1997, he was cast as the titular Caped Crusader in Joel Schumacher’s “Batman & Robin.” Unfortunately, that movie was critically panned, but a year later, Clooney landed the film that cemented his leading man status: Steven Soderbergh’s 1998 thriller “Out of Sight.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix came to the defense of its new docuseries “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” on Tuesday night after the film’s subject, Sean “Diddy” Combs, and his team attacked the project as a “shameful hit piece” that used “stolen footage that was never authorized for release.”\n\n\tA Netflix spokesperson told Variety, “The claims being made about ‘Sean Combs: The Reckoning’ are false. The project has no ties to any past conversations between Sean Combs and Netflix. The footage of Combs leading up to his indictment and arrest were legally obtained. This is not a hit piece or an act of retribution. Curtis Jackson is an executive producer but does not have creative control. No one was paid to participate.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s statement comes on the heels of a quote from “The Reckoning” director, Alexandria Stapleton, who also asserted all footage was obtained legally with all the “necessary rights.”\n\n\n\t“We moved heaven and earth to keep the filmmaker’s identity confidential,” she said. “One thing about Sean Combs is that he’s always filming himself, and it’s been an obsession throughout the decades. We also reached out to Sean Combs’ legal team for an interview and comment multiple times, but did not hear back.”\n\n\tThe statement from Combs’ rep, released Monday, alleged that Combs “has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way,” but Netflix was spinning his words out of context. It also claimed that executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is “a longtime adversary with a personal vendetta who has spent too much time slandering Mr. Combs.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAhaan Panday and Aneet Padda have claimed the top two positions on IMDb‘s Most Popular Indian Stars of 2025 list following their performances in Yash Raj Films’ romantic drama “Saiyaara.” \n\n\tThe ranking, based on page views from more than 250 million monthly visitors worldwide throughout 2025, marks a historic sweep for the film directed by Mohit Suri, who himself tops IMDb’s inaugural Most Popular Indian Directors list. Both actors previously received the IMDb “Breakout Star” STARmeter Award in August, which the platform notes has proven a reliable predictor of emerging talent.\n\t\n\n\t“To be ranked No. 1 on the IMDb Most Popular Indian Stars of 2025 list with my first film is nothing short of a dream come true,” Panday said. “This recognition makes me a little more aware of the responsibility I have towards my craft, and at the same time, it excites me for what’s to come.”\n\n\n\tThe actor credited Suri’s direction and thanked Yash Raj Films chief Aditya Chopra for the opportunity to prove himself on screen, along with casting director Shanoo Sharma and producer Akshaye Widhani. “I thank everyone for helping the stars align and giving me something I could cherish for a lifetime, but mainly, I thank everyone for allowing the grandson of a heart surgeon to be a vessel for love,” he said.\n\n\tPadda expressed similar gratitude for the recognition. “‘Saiyaara’ changed my life in ways I am only beginning to understand, and to know that people across countries and languages connected with my work means more to me than I can explain,” she said. The actor credited Suri for his confidence in her abilities and thanked the film’s production team for their support.\n\t\n\n\tRounding out the top 10 stars are Aamir Khan (No. 3), Ishaan Khatter (No. 4), Lakshya (No. 5), Rashmika Mandanna (No. 6), Kalyani Priyadarshan (No. 7), Triptii Dimri (No. 8), Rukmini Vasanth (No. 9) and Rishab Shetty (No. 10). Khatter and Dimri are the only actors who appeared on both the 2024 and 2025 lists.\n\n\tMandanna had a particularly prolific year with releases spanning multiple languages and genres, including the Hindi-language films “Chhaava,” “Sikandar” and “Thamma,” plus the Telugu-language titles “Kuberaa” and “The Girlfriend.”\n\n\t“In the 25 Years of Indian Cinema IMDb Industry Report, we highlighted the emergence of directors as the key architects of this new era of Indian cinema,” said Yaminie Patodia, head of IMDb India. “Filmmakers now consistently appear on our weekly rankings alongside actors, signaling that directors themselves are becoming fan favorites, with world-building and storytelling as the new engines of fandom.”\n\n\tThe directors list features Suri at No. 1, followed by Aryan Khan (No. 2), Lokesh Kanagaraj (No. 3), Anurag Kashyap (No. 4), Prithviraj Sukumaran (No. 5), R.S. Prasanna (No. 6), Anurag Basu (No. 7), Dominic Arun (No. 8), Laxman Utekar (No. 9) and Neeraj Ghaywan (No. 10).\n\n\tKhan, who made his directorial debut with Netflix series “The Ba***ds of Bollywood,” is the youngest filmmaker on the list and the only series director featured. Ghaywan directed “Homebound,” India’s entry to the 2026 Academy Awards.\n",

    "body": "\n\tStreaming platforms operating in Australia are already investing more in local content than traditional broadcasters, according to new data that the streaming industry says undermines recently passed legislation mandating content quotas for subscription services.\n\n\tMajor streaming platforms collectively invested nearly AUD$1.1 billion ($719 million) in Australian and Australian-related programming during the 2024-25 financial year, marking the highest level of content spending since voluntary reporting began in 2020, according to a report from the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\n\t\n\n\tThe figures arrive on the heels of legislation passed in the Senate last week introducing mandatory Australian content obligations for subscription video-on-demand services.\n\n\n\tPaul Muller, chair of the Streaming for Australia Coalition, said the figures demonstrate the new legislation is unnecessary.\n\n\t“Contrary to misleading claims that SVOD services have been reducing investment in the Australian screen industry, the ACMA data clearly shows that Australia’s SVOD services are already investing at a higher rate than Australia’s broadcasters,” Muller said. “This further demonstrates that the legislation passed last week is trying to solve a problem that simply doesn’t exist.”\n\n\tThe ACMA data shows Prime Video, Disney+, Netflix, Paramount+ and Stan allocated AUD$414 million ($271 million) toward Australian content and AUD$687.8 million ($450 million) on Australian-related programs. The investment in new commissions and co-commissions reached AUD$316.6 million ($207 million), representing a 40% jump from the previous year’s AUD$225.2 million ($147 million).\n\t\n\n\tRecent Australian content produced by global streamers include Prime Video’s “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” and Netflix’s “The Survivors.”\n\n\tStreaming platforms now invest more in Australian scripted drama than all subscription and commercial broadcasters combined, despite accounting for only 23% of total television viewing time. The increase in streaming expenditure on Australian content nearly equals the AUD$72.8 million ($47.6 million) that all commercial broadcasters spent in total on Australian drama, children’s programming, documentary and other local content last year.\n\n\tOver six consecutive years of voluntary reporting, streaming services have invested nearly AUD$4 billion ($2.6 billion) cumulatively in Australian production, supporting local employment, infrastructure and international exposure for Australian creative talent.\n\n\tMuller noted that while the ACMA report shows streamers commissioned fewer total programs year-over-year, the increased spending reflects a strategic shift toward larger-scale productions. “SVOD services operate in a highly competitive environment and have focused on what their audiences want: bigger, bolder and more ambitious Australian stories,” he said.\n\n\tThe streaming coalition invested AUD$97 million ($63.5 million) in acquired Australian content for global licensing during the reporting period. However, Muller warned the new mandatory investment obligations create a disincentive for continued licensing activity, as acquired content cannot be counted toward meeting the regulatory requirements.\n\n\tAustralian audiences had access to a record 3,919 titles of Australian content across the five major streaming services during the financial year, according to ACMA data.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Our objective today is to figure out the nature of this project and what we must do to contain it.”\n\n\tThe line is from the trailer to “White Horse,” which got its unofficial debut on Tuesday at the federal trial of director Carl Rinsch, who is accused of swindling Netflix out of millions in the course of the boondoggle production.The show, which was never completed, was pitched to the streamer as a high-concept thriller about the rise of humanoid OI’s (organic intelligences) and the human factions determined to destroy them. Described as a mix of “Star Wars,” “Westworld” and “The Matrix,” the series was once touted by Netflix execs as their next big franchise.But those dreams faltered when the big-budget series began to face major production issues in the fall of 2019. Netflix tried to solve the problems by sending Rinsch an additional $11 million. That was March 2, 2020 — just before the pandemic disrupted nearly every production. Netflix never saw any additional footage or material for “White Horse” and ultimately wrote off its entire investment.Over five years later, Rinsch, 48, is facing many years behind bars if convicted of wire fraud, money laundering and making a series of illegal transactions. The “47 Ronin” filmmaker is alleged to have used the $11 million for his own benefit, buying a $740,000 Ferrari, a $340,000 watch and four luxury mattresses totaling $638,000, among other purchases.\n\n\n\t“This is a case about greed and lies,” the prosecutor told the jury, saying Rinsch “saw an opportunity to make a killing” in the stock market at the start of the pandemic and “deceived” multiple employees at Netflix to get the $11 million. “And Netflix paid because they continued to believe in the project.”\n\t\n\n\tProsecutors say Rinsch routed the money through multiple bank accounts before moving it into his personal brokerage account. He then “went on a spending spree,” they alleged. \n\n\tThe government told jurors they’ll “be able to follow the money” through testimony from witnesses Rinsch allegedly deceived, including his financial manager, personal assistant, bookkeeper and editor. Several Netflix executives, including Cindy Holland, who is now head of streaming at Paramount, are also expected to take the stand.\n\n\tDefense attorney Michael Arthus offered a more favorable portrayal in his opening statement, painting Rinsch as an artist embroiled in a contract dispute — not a criminal. Arthus called him a “luminary and visionary who can breathe new light into a universe that doesn’t exist” — but suggested he was in over his head as a producer.\n\t\n\n\t“The artist Carl valued the story more than the producer Carl worried what it would cost,” Arthus said.\n\n\tThe lawyer also blamed “executive group think” and the pandemic for pushing the project off the rails.\n\n\t“He was Vincent van Gogh with a Netflix deal struggling with his benefactor,” Arthus concluded. “This is the story of a creative genius… He couldn’t quite deliver, but that doesn’t make him a fraud.”\n\n\tRinsch scribbled notes in a yellow legal pad during opening statements.\n\n\tPeter Friedlander, who recently left Netflix to become head of global television at Amazon MGM Studios, was the first witness to testify. He and Holland were the two main execs who acquired “White Horse,” alongside producers Keanu Reeves, Rian Johnson and Gabby Roses, who is Rinsch’s ex-wife. He testified about the project’s initial presentation, saying Rinsch brought him five to six short episodes that were “visionary.” The trailer was played for the jury, which featured Cronenberg-esque body horror and finished visual effects.\n\n\tWhile Rinsch’s original pitch outlined 13 episodes with runtimes of four to 14 minutes, Friedlander set forward a plan to shoot a significant amount of new footage, requiring Rinsch to expand his story and add new characters into the mix. On Sept. 9, 2019, he received an email outlining production problems.\n\n\t“The problem, in this case, is a simple one of money,” Rinsch wrote. “Which is a reality I have to face. And manage.”\n\n\tRinsch outlined two options: to “protect and survive” and limit financial exposure or “forge ahead” and continue to increase the budget. Friedlander was committed to the vision for the series and its potential as a franchise. “The show was at a crisis point at this point,” he said on the stand. “We were investing in this to tell the entire story… To end it right before the end would create a terrible, unsatisfying customer experience.”\n\n\tFriedlander took a more hands-on approach, directing Rinsch to submit detailed production reports going forward. He flew to the troubled Budapest set in October 2019 with another Netflix executive, Mike Posey. Reflecting on the experience, he said, “We wanted to be thought partners and better understand the shooting challenges.”\n\n\tIn February 2020, emails showed that Rinsch outlined a roadmap to condense the production timeline and get the project back on track. On March 4, 2020, he was sent $11 million to spend on storyboards, production designs, fabrication of art/costumes, pay or play on key crew and artists, editing of existing material and other production costs in a five-week period. Although the pandemic paused a lot of filming for various projects, Friedlander asserted that Rinsch could’ve continued working on the project.\n\t\n\n\tAround that time, Rinsch gifted Friedlander a lavish coffee table book with production photos of the 2019 shoot. It was the last material on “White Horse” Friedlander ever received.\n\n\tJudge Jed Rakoff told jurors he expects to be wrapped before the end of next week.\n",

Ana's remains have never been found.\n      \n    \n          Massachusetts State Police Trooper Nicholas Guarino testified Tuesday under direct questioning that Walshe's laptop had viewed a pornographic video about a “cheating wife.\"\n      \n    \n          But, on cross examination, Walshe's defense attorney, Larry Tipton, got Guarino to admit that Walshe’s computer searches failed to show the user was specifically looking for smut films about a cheating wife.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Tipton indicated the laptop's user downloaded a video from Pornhub's vast library of erotic content and even suggested the user was searching for a specific porn star. Throughout his examination, Tipton was careful not to identify Walshe as the actual user of the laptop, instead referring to the person as a “device user.”\n      \n    \n          Guarino also testified that Walshe made numerous Internet searches about cleaning up and disposing of bodies, as well as searching for 1970's serial killer Patrick Kearney, better known as the \"Trash Bag Killer.\" After killing and dismembering his victims, Kearney would discard them in trash bags.\n      \n    \n          Day 3 of the trial continues tomorrow.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Brian Walshe\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

TMZ has learned, but some of his family members feel it was something more nefarious.\n      \n    \n          Multiple sources with knowledge of the investigation tell us POORSTACY shot himself Saturday morning in a Boca Raton hotel room, but initially survived. He was transported to a local hospital, where he died Monday, after being taken off life support.\n      \n    \n          Police have yet to officially release the cause of death, but we're told the rapper's family isn't buying it was suicide. One source connected to his family tells TMZ ... the family is disputing it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound ... and they suspect foul play.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          We're told POORSTACY had been staying at the hotel for about 10 days, after checking in with a woman and a toddler. Our source says POORSTACY was the child's father, and the woman is the mother.\n      \n    \n          It's unclear if they were in the hotel room when he shot himself.\n      \n    \n          We're told police released the room back to the hotel later Saturday to be thoroughly cleaned.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          We broke the story of POORSTACY's death, and at the time, there were unconfirmed rumblings it might have been suicide.\n      \n    \n          Sadly, that's what police believe happened to the 26-year-old artist, according to our sources -- but it sounds like his family members might demand further investigation.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

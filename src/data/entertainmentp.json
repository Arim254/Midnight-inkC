    "body": "\n\t“Terrifier” actress Catherine Corcoran has sued the producers and series director Damien Leone, alleging breach of contract and the distribution of sexually explicit materials without consent.\n\n\tIn a suit filed in California federal court on Sunday, Corcoran’s attorneys presented a case, defined by the “all-too-common story of low budget film producers taking advantage of a young actress through fraud, sexual harassment and, ultimately, betrayal.” The lawsuit names production banners Dark Age Cinema and Fuzz on the Lens Productions as defendants, in addition to producer Phil Falcone and Leone and the filmmaker’s banner Art the Clown. The filing includes seven claims for relief, including distribution of sexually explicit materials, breach of contract and promissory fraud.\n\t\n\n\tLeone and producers could not be immediately reached for comment. \n\n\n\tCorcoran is best known to “Terrifier” viewers as the centerpiece of one of the original 2016 slasher’s most memorably demented sequences, in which the actress’ character is hung upside down, topless, and slaughtered by the villain Art the Clown. The suit alleges that filming for the sequence required Corcoran to be hung upside down by her ankles for “over 10 hours in below freezing temperatures.”\n\n\tCorcoran is said to have agreed to act in the low-budget “Terrifier” on an “extremely low up front per diem rate,” with the agreement that she would receive 1% of the profits from the film, as well as potential future franchise entries and related merchandise, including other licenses of the intellectual property. Two “Terrifier” sequels have been produced, collectively grossing more than $105 million at the global box office, plus home video profits and “Terrifier”-themed fan events and other modes. The suit claims that director and producer Leone, “agreed in writing to provide Corcoran with a share in 1% of all net sales generated from ‘Terrifier’ related merchandise.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, Corcoran alleges that, in the years following the original film’s release and its subsequent rise in popularity, her royalty payments “became more and more sporadic and dwindled to amounts nowhere near commensurate.” The actress claims she has not received back pay since July 2024, and had only received $1816.35 up to that point, “with no explanation as to why the royalty payments ceased or where the remainder of the payments are.” Merchandise royalties are said to only total “approximately $6,408.26.”\n\n\tCorcoran claims to have confronted both Falcone and Leone about her royalty payments and that she was “brushed off, with Leone stating that Falcone handles all of the accounting matters and then with an aggressive and defensive response from Falcone saying he purportedly ‘doesn’t keep records.'”\n\n\tAdditionally, while Corcoran’s death scene required her to be nude, the suit claims that the producers “never obtained Corcoran’s informed written consent” to film unclothed, as was required by the Screen Actors Guild. The suit alleges that Corcoran insisted she be allowed to wear underwear on the day of shooting, but that she still ended up performing the scene topless without written consent. It also claims that Corcoran was only provided a horizontal platform to break on between takes upon her request and that she “was wrapped in a blanket in between takes, but overtime the blanket became so saturated with fake blood that it ceased providing any warmth.”\n\n\tAfter filming overnight, Corcoran alleges she felt ill in the following days and that a doctor diagnosed her with cranial swelling and eardrum damage. In an allegation that ties together the suit’s claims of unpaid royalties and unregulated shooting conditions, the suit claims that the defendants have profited from merchandise depicting Corcoran’s nude body.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIs it time for “Wicked” to conquer the Oscars, for good?\n\n\tUniversal Pictures’ musical fantasy sequel appears poised to match or exceed its predecessor’s impressive showing at the Academy Awards, based on the first social media reactions that were shared on Monday night. \n\n\tDirector Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked: For Good,” written by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox, continues the story begun in 2024’s “Wicked,” which adapted the first act of the hit 2003 Broadway musical by Stephen Schwartz and Holzman. The follow-up adapts the second act, exploring the aftermath of Elphaba and Glinda’s diverging paths — one as the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, the other as the beloved Glinda the Good.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s Oscar prospects look strong enough to repeat last year’s 10 nominations, cementing the two-part adaptation as a genuine awards powerhouse, based on the most passionate reactions that have trickled in.\n\n\n\tDeadline awards writer Destiny Jackson praised the film on X, calling it “an epic and heartbreakingly tender conclusion” to Chu’s fantastical saga. \n\n\t“All Good Deeds Go Rewarded in ‘Wicked: For Good,'” she wrote. “It’s an epic and heartbreakingly tender conclusion to one of the most dynamic friendships in pop culture history. There’s a lot for fans of the Broadway show to love with butterfly kiss sized surprises in store.”\n\n\tVariety’s senior artisans editor Jazz Tangcay echoed the praise. She wrote on X that “Wicked: For Good” goes above and beyond “all expectations” and gave particular praise to Chu’s directing. \n\n\t“Jon M. Chu is a genius in the way he brings this to a close,” Tangcay wrote. “Elphaba and Glinda’s stories are expanded, and leave you with an emotional gut punch at the end. Cynthia Erivo is magnificent, but get ready for Ariana Grande as she takes this performance to the next level and is a tour de force. And wow, the world building, the costumes, and Alice Brooks’ cinematography deserve your attention. Can not wait to see it again. I sobbed hard. ‘Wicked: For Good’ is sheer musical greatness.”\n\t\n\n\tVanity Fair staff writer Chris Murphy also shared a glowing review on X, highlighting the performances of stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. \n\n\t“Saw ‘Wicked: For Good’ last month and believe me when I say that it expands and deepens the original source material in generally exciting and innovative ways,” he wrote. “Cynthia and Ari take their performances to the next level with jaw-dropping performances. The film fully sticks the landing.”\n\n\tEntertainment writer David Gordon wrote on X that “Wicked: For Good” was “everything you want it to be,” taking the original vision of the stage play to dazzling new heights.\n\n\tIf ‘Wicked’ part one was faithful to the blueprint of the stage, ‘Wicked: For Good’ builds out the world to create a full and different (but the same) and extremely emotional version of act 2,” Gordon wrote. “It’s a thrill ride and a heartbreaker and it’s sexy and everything you want it to be.”\n\n\tVanity Fair senior awards correspondent Rebecca Ford added to the hype on X, writing, “I spoke w/Jon M. Chu at the SCAD Film Festival just yesterday in front of a very enthusiastic crowd! Now I can finally share that I’ve seen ‘Wicked: For Good’ and he’s done it again! It’s gorgeous, full of heart, and sticks the landing. A beautiful finale.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWICKED, Cynthia Erivo (green face), director Jon M. Chu (center), Ariana Grande (right), on set, 2024.  ph: Giles Keyte /© Universal Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf both Erivo and Grande are nominated again for playing Elphaba and Glinda, they would join a very short list, becoming the seventh and eighth performers in Oscars history to be recognized twice for the same role.\n\n\tErivo already made history with the first “Wicked” becoming the second Black woman to receive multiple nominations for best actress after Viola Davis. Oscar winner Davis and two-time winner costume designer Ruth E. Carter are the most Oscar-nominated Black women in history, with four noms each. Erivo is currently tied with Octavia Spencer at three nominations (Spencer has one win). Erivo’s two Oscar noms were for best actress for “Harriet” (2019) and the original song “Stand Up,” becoming the third person to be recognized for acting and music in the same year. I’d keep an eye on Erivo being a frontrunner for the Globe in the lead actress (comedy or musical) category. Whether that can be enough to topple someone like Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) will be a hurdle the campaign will need to overcome.\n\t\n\n\tThe current landscape of the supporting actress race reveals a genuine — and increasingly promising — pathway for Grande to enter the thick of the conversation for her first Academy Award. Her performance as Glinda is a fully realized piece of acting that balances humor, heartbreak and show-stopping charisma. If the season’s momentum holds, Grande could find herself not only in the mix but a legitimate contender for Oscar gold.\n\n\tSelf-proclaimed “Wicked” experts will often say the second act of the stage show isn’t as strong as the first half since it lacks a showstopper like “Defying Gravity.” However, Chu, along with writers Holzman and Fox, once again elevate the material, particularly in the incredibly emotional “For Good,” which features the most decisive acting moment for both women in both films (possibly the most decisive moment of their careers). Tears will flow, rivers will rise, and Oscar contenders are solidified in those moments.\n\n\tThe film features a mix of beloved songs from the stage musical and two new original numbers: “No Place Like Home,” sung by Erivo’s Elphaba, and “The Girl in the Bubble,” performed by Grande’s Glinda. Both tracks are penned by Schwartz, who also composes alongside John Powell. Added songs in beloved musicals like “Wicked” that are later adapted for the big screen are rarely considered “better” or even match the original material’s praise. Nonetheless, despite those presumed “flaws,” they can still be embraced by the Music Branch, especially if they are considered to be, in the best picture conversation. Those in the last 25 years have included: “Suddenly” from “Les Misérables” (2012), “Learn to be Lonely” from “The Phantom of the Opera” (2004), “I Move On” from “Chicago” (2002), “Take It All” from “Nine” (2009) and the three original numbers from “Dreamgirls” (2006) — “Listen,” “Love You I Do” and “Patience.”\n\n\tWhile both new “Wicked” songs may face mixed reactions, this is the three-time Oscar-winning Schwartz we’re talking about. The branch reveres the legendary musician. Both songs getting nominated might be too ambitious, especially with this stacked field unfolding (i.e., “Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters”). If one makes it, the smart bet is on “The Girl in the Bubble,” considering its placement later in the movie.\n\t\n\n\tWith “For Good’s” technical categories likely locked for recognition — including the previously winning production design and costume design — along with viable win-worthy makeup, sound and visual effects, you could pencil in “Wicked: For Good” for one of the 10 best picture slots. \n\n\tWhether it translates into more nominations or more wins is a question for the upcoming awards season to answer. One thing that feels certain is the “Wicked” phenomenon isn’t finished casting its spell on Oscar voters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter just one season, Emmy-winning drama “The Pitt” is already having an impact on healthcare conversations. That’s the finding from a new study released Monday by the USC Norman Lear Center, which said “The Pitt” has shifted the conversation on issues such as organ donation and end-of-life planning.\n\n\tAccording to a group of 1,409 viewers surveyed by the Hollywood, Health & Society division of the USC Norman Lear Center, 26.9% of respondents said they were more likely to seek out organ donation information after watching “The Pitt,” while 17.2% said they shared the information with others. The study helpfully noted that the impact was especially great with Black audiences — an important distinction as Black patients are often overrepresented on transplant waiting lists and underrepresented with donors.\n\t\n\n\tAlso, a storyline on “The Pitt” about family members debating over the end-of-life decisions for an ailing father also appeared to have a major impact on viewers. Around 38.8% said they would look deeper into end-of-life planning such as a living will or power of attorney, while 15.3% said they shared this information with others.\n\n\n\tAnd the study found that among the 709 viewers who had watched at least three episodes of “The Pitt,” almost 90% of them said “the series reveals how systemic problems like understaffing affect patient outcomes and helps make provider stress relatable.”\n\n\tThe USC Norman Lear Center Hollywood, Health & Society team also spoke with doctors, nurses and trainees, most of whom confirmed the authenticity of the show’s storylines — such as overcrowding, underfunding and other realities of their work.\n\t\n\n\t“While our primary goal is to create compelling, complex stories, we are also committed to being current and accurate with our portrayal of medical topics,” said “The Pitt” executive producer and writer Joe Sachs, MD. “Because of this, public health education is a wonderful side effect of our dramatic storytelling.”\n\n\tThe study coincides with Monday’s USC Normal Lear Center Hollywood, Health & Society honors, which includes the Culture of Health Award for “The Pitt.” Recent Emmy winner Katherine LaNasa will present the award to exec producer/star (and fellow Emmy winner) Noah Wyle and creator/showrunner R. Scott Gemmill, along with the show’s writing team.\n\n\t“For 25 years, our work has been built upon the idea that stories matter, but conventional wisdom suggests the ‘broccoli’ needs to be hidden in the ‘hamburger’ for audiences to stomach it,” said Erica Rosenthal, director of research at the USC Norman Lear Center. “‘The Pitt’s’ success is a powerful reminder that stories can prioritize accuracy, highlight systemic challenges through authentic characters, spark emotion, and inspire real-world action, all without sacrificing entertainment value.”\n\n\tOther series set to be honored include “Shrinking,” “Dying for Sex,” “Paradise,” “Matlock,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Chicago Med,” all of which are being recognized for making a difference in topics including healthcare, racism, climate change, cancer and more. Comedian Carol Leifer is hosting the event, held at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills.\n\n\tIn addition to LaNasa, other presenters include Jason Ritter (“Matlock”), Wendie Malick (“Shrinking”), Sarah Shahi (“Paradise”), Nikki Boyer (“Dying for Sex”) and Jason George (“Grey’s Anatomy”). Among those also in attendance are Lear’s wife, Lyn Lear, as well as the team from Lear’s final show (“Boots”), including actor Miles Heizer and author Greg Cope White.\n\n\tThe 2025 host committee for the awards are Jimmy Kimmel, Judith Light, Lyn Lear, Phil Rosenthal and Yvette Nicole Brown.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Scrubs” revival has lost one of its two showrunners a few weeks into production, Variety can confirm. Tim Hobert has stepped down from duties co-heading the series due to creative differences, while Aseem Batra will now serve as a solo showrunner as filming continues.\n\n\tHobert and Batra co-wrote the first episode of the “Scrubs” revival, which will see original cast members Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes and John C. McGinley reprising their roles from the original series.\n\t\n\n\tBoth Hobert and Batra are “Scrubs” alumni. Hobert was credited as co-executive producer, executive producer and consulting producer on the original series, while Batra served as story editor, executive story editor and co-producer. Both worked with original series showrunner Bill Lawrence, who remains an executive producer on the revival series through his banner Doozer. Braff, Faison and Chalke are also executive producers, as is Randall Winston.\n\n\n\tHobert will remain credited as an executive producer for the first few episodes of the revival series. Production began in Vancouver in early October.\n\n\tAlong with the original stars, the cast will also include series newcomers Ava Bunn, Jacob Dudman, David Gridley, Layla Mohammadi and Amanda Morrow.\n\n\tThe “Scrubs” revival received a straight-to-series order from ABC in July. The series comes from 20th Century Television. The original “Scrubs” began on NBC, running for its first seven seasons from 2001 to 2008, followed by two seasons at ABC in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\tDeadline was first to report on Hobert’s exit from the “Scrubs” revival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA new feature film examining the buried trauma of America’s “Secret War” in Laos is seeking co-producers and sales agents at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, with production slated for 2026.\n\n\t“Rhizome,” directed by Jakrawal Nilthamrong (Rotterdam winner “Vanishing Point,” Venice selection “Anatomy of Time”) and produced by Chatchai Chaiyon (“Manta Ray”), follows Na, a Lao-American woman who returns to her homeland in 1994 to join a bomb disposal team clearing unexploded ordnance from the Vietnam War era. As she falls in love with Bua, a local team leader, Na confronts the violent legacy that continues to shape the scarred landscape.\n\t\n\n\tThe film opens in 1974 as civil war refugees flee toward the Thai border. When a young girl witnesses a traumatic incident involving her father and an American helicopter crash, the memory haunts her into adulthood. Twenty years later, now working alongside Bua to clear the land of bombs, Na’s mission collides with outsiders – David, an American searching for missing soldiers, and Big-D, a troubled local. A fatal explosion forces Na to reckon with fragmented memories and her father’s wartime past.\n\n\n\tFor Nilthamrong, the title carries symbolic weight. “‘Rhizome’ refers to a subterranean root system – nonlinear, interconnected, and hidden. It symbolizes both trauma and survival, much like the buried legacies of war and the invisible networks of memory, pain, and resilience that bind Laos, its people, and my character’s journey toward wholeness,” the director says.\n\n\tThe film is rooted in the history of the U.S. “Secret War” in Laos between 1964 and 1973. “It addresses how we might build a future from within the ruins,” Nilthamrong explains. “How can we reinhabit spaces shaped by violence once they have become the very ground of our existence? The work seeks to resonate with the urgency of forgotten histories – reminding us that Laos remains the most bombed country in the world, yet its people continue to live, rebuild, and find life growing again from the most wounded soil.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production has faced unique challenges given its sensitive subject matter. “Since the film engages with history and the real bomb disposal units that still operate today, the research and writing process for accuracy has been particularly challenging,” Nilthamrong says. “Gaining permission to access locations and conduct filming in Laos required a foundation of trust.”\n\n\tThe director spent significant time in the field to ensure authenticity. “I wanted to tell the story of Laos from an insider’s perspective, which led me to spend significant time in the field, revisiting locations and refining the screenplay,” he says. “Our intention is not to reopen the past in search of blame, but to maintain a delicate balance between historical truth and sensitivity.”\n\n\tProducer Chaiyon acknowledges the project’s commercial challenges while expressing confidence in its potential. “Although the project’s subject matter and the director’s vision are both compelling, development and financing remain challenging,” he says. “As a producer, I strive to bridge arthouse and commercial cinema to reach a wider audience. I am confident that Rhizome possesses the elements and potential to achieve that goal.”\n\n\tThe team is looking to close the remaining financing gap at the market. “We are looking for co-producers and sales agents to join the project,” Chaiyon says. “Our goal is to close the remaining financing gap and be ready for production in 2026.”\n",

Ravnik joined the show for Season 34 and is paired with Jen Affleck.\n\n\n\tLater in the discussion, Chmerkovskiy explained he was particularly offended by Ravnik’s performance during “Wicked” night on Oct. 21.\n\n\t“He had no idea what foxtrot is supposed to look like,” he claimed. “How are you going to expect him to teach it and deliver that message in a format that is completely different from even ballroom dancing? We had this criticism weeks ago, and I’m like, ‘Bro, is anybody going to explain it to him?'”\n\n\tChmerkovskiy added that he has “zero against” Ravnik as a person, but called his hiring a “missed opportunity.” Podcast host and fellow former “Dancing with the Stars” pro Peta Murgatroyd agreed, adding that it was “outrageous” that Ravnik was hired despite his perceived lack of ballroom dancing experience.\n\n\t“They hired him. He’s a Taylor Swift dancer. It’s the obvious reason why he is hired,” she added. “Apart from that, he’s a lovely guy. He looks great. He obviously is a great dancer. Hiring a non-ballroom dancer to teach ballroom dancing to a celebrity as a job is outrageous.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIliza Shlesinger will bring the laughs with her when she hosts Variety‘s Power of Women gala on Oct. 29 in Beverly Hills. “It’s the perfect fit,” the comedian says of the gig. “My whole career has been commentary on women, and I always want my female audience feeling a little bit better than when they walked in.” Funny, empowering and insightful? Yep, she checks all three boxes.\n\n\tThe event, in partnership with Lifetime, will honor Sydney Sweeney, Nicole Scherzinger, Wanda Sykes, Kate Hudson and Jamie Lee Curtis, highlighting female leaders in the entertainment industry, who are profiled in the Women’s Impact Report.\n\t\n\n\tShlesinger, who is currently touring the country with her “Iliza! Live” show and can be seen in the Amazon Prime comedy special “A Different Animal,” spends a good deal of her stand-up act encouraging women to stand in their power. “I think to be a woman who dares to get out of bed often garners criticism, and so I think that there is something truly special about being around powerful women who don’t ask permission, who create their own lane and do it,” she says.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShlesinger performs during the 16th Annual Stand Up for Heroes Benefit \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Bob Woodruff Fo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShlesinger is certainly one of those women, which helps keep her focused on her gift to make people laugh. “You have to truly believe that what you have to say is so important that it warrants a microphone that makes you louder than everyone else,” she says. “And you have to believe that the way that you look at things is so funny that people are gonna want to stop and listen.” She sums it up: “It’s about feeling seen. Especially as a woman, I think that that’s paramount — feeling seen and feeling heard. And that is the guiding light of my career, knowing that what I have to say is just as valid — if not more valid — than the male comic next to me and deciding that I’m allowed to talk and it’s gonna be pretty good. And, 20 years in, survey says what I have to say is pretty good.”\n\t\n\n\tBut if her audience really listens to her act, it’s not just jokes; there’s also a hefty dose of wisdom behind the words. “As you age in comedy, it’s OK to just tell superficial jokes. There’s nothing wrong with that,” she says. “But I feel things very deeply as an artist. I think comics and comedy get brushed off as, ‘you’re just a comic.’ At the end of the day, I’m not just some road dog who’s there to tell some dick jokes. I’m an artist, and I feel very deeply. I see things a certain way. And I feel like it’s my job to hold up a mirror to society and to call out things when I see them, especially for women, because we’re told that we’re crazy,” she says. “I know a lot of other women don’t have the voice to say the things that they want to say. And so I just try to say the way I’m feeling, and I hope that other people feel the same way.”\n\n\tWhile touring the U.S. and Europe with her comedy show, she notes that one thing she sees over and over is that people are having a hard time “dealing with things that — by the grace of God — you or I don’t have to deal with.” She explains, “The fact that people take the time out of their stresses and their lives to watch my stand-up or buy a ticket, the fact that people give me their time is something that has never been lost on me. I’ve never taken it for granted. And to get to be a part of people’s lives when they are going through something horrible is actually, energetically, a very special thing. I think about that a lot.”\n\n\tAlso on her mind: censorship, which has been a hot topic in the entertainment business since the cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and the suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” “People on both sides who have ideas about how this country should be run slowly chip away at the moral fabric and constitutional foundation, misinterpreting and deliberately interpreting our amendments,” she says. “If enough people do that, at the end of the day, we do not have the America that the bulk of normal people love and defend. As a Jewish person, I think about this like: very bad things happen when very good men do nothing. It’s so important to have critical thinking and to have healthy, open public debate. Comedy should be an example of that. No comics should be censored. No comics should be told that because of one thing that you said, you can’t have a career. If you don’t like what a comic is saying, then you don’t have to watch that comic. This idea that your feelings are facts and that your feelings take precedence over everything else in this person’s life, so much so that that person should be wiped off a map, is delusional and, quite frankly, self-centered.”\n\t\n\n\tIf Shlesinger sounds passionate about the topic, it’s because she is. The comic has long used her platform to speak out against antisemitism — and make sure her voice is heard. “Antisemitism is as old as Judaism itself, that’s the truth,” she says. “But the other truth, the louder truth, is that Jews aren’t going anywhere and now, more than ever before, we are able to be more vocal about our permanence. But the fact that I have to think carefully about my answer to why hating Jews is unacceptable should be a tonal indicator of the blatant and ignorant hatred we are up against. Every socio-political and religious conflict on Earth is assigned nuance, but when it comes to the blanket dismissal of Jewish people, it has become acceptable, and lauded, to be absolute.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Wrecker” packs so many action-thriller cliches into its first few minutes — including Harvey Keitel screaming “You don’t mess with a man’s family!” at a bloodied bloke tied to a chair in a warehouse — that you might worry if there will be any left to fill out the remaining 90. Fear not. This latest from actor-stuntman turned prolific B-movie director Art Camacho “introduces” star Niko Foster, though the only truly new element here for either party is that it represents a relatively rare theatrical (rather than direct-to-home-video) release. Seismic is rolling “The Wrecker” out to U.S. venues this Friday, with Quiver Distribution launching to home formats at an unspecified future date.\n\t\n\n\tHimself a veteran producer with several prior onscreen credits, Foster has the requisite bulging biceps, gravel voice and three-day stubble for a stock macho action-figure hero, amidst other 1980s/90s-style genre tropes. But the script he wrote with Sophia Louisa and James Dean Simington is so shamelessly derivative of already-cartoonish precedents (like “Road House” and “Stone Cold”), it might as well have been assembled by AI — or even intended as self-satire, though regretfully that does not appear to be the case. \n\n\n\tAlso featuring name actors Mena Suvari, Tyrese Gibson and Danny Trejo in thankless roles, this tale of mob-related malfeasance and solo vengeance in Vegas is slick but thoroughly ridick. However, it’s pacy and colorful enough that those in the mood for a deep-fried knuckle sandwich with extra cheese may have fun.\n\n\tAfter an awesomely hokey prologue that deprives Det. Boswell (Gibson) of his partner at the hands of ruthless “Dante the Untouchable” (Keitel), the film introduces protagonist Tony Minetti (Foster). He’s an ex-Marine who got dishonorably discharged. Now he runs an auto-repair shop while raising daughters Sarah (Rebekah Samuel) and Sunshine (London Dee Falcon), whose mother is deceased. Vrooming into the garage one day is his bad-boy little bro Bobby (Chad Michael Collins), high as a kite, driving a canary-yellow Ferrari he surely didn’t acquire through legal means. Unwisely agreeing to go for a spin, Tony finds they’re soon tailed by an ominous black SUV.\n\t\n\n\tWhen the inevitable chase ends in an inevitable crash, he wakes up facing the smirking, fedora’d “biggest crime boss since Al Capone,” whose vehicle Bobby had stolen. Dante informs Tony he won’t see his ne’er-do-well sibling again until he’s paid off that debt by performing some “jobs.” These involve raiding the lairs of hoodlum rivals, then singlehandedly dissuading them from competition. Tony refuses to handle guns (a third brother died in childhood playing with one), so he accomplishes these forceful cleanups with nothing more than his fists — plus one big, swinging wrench. \n\n\tSuch crackdowns attract notice from Boswell, who detects a civilian ally in his fight against local syndicates. But Tony eludes the cop’s inquiries, protected by his waitressing quasi-girlfriend (Suvari, stuck in doe-eyed “honey, be careful” terrain), coworkers and other loyal pals. The two men do eventually join forces, however, once Dante’s goons cross an unforgivable line. \n\n\t“The Wrecker” is lively enough, albeit without much distinction to its action, let alone plotting. It seems entirely recycled from whole parts of other movies. Nothing is too obvious for inclusion: The scantily clad women who provide background scenery in “lair-invading” scenes, yet never get a line of dialogue; the frequently ludicrous ease with which good guys defeat bad ones (at one point Trejo conquers a hulking tough by swiveling an office chair); moldy-chestnut dialogue like “He’s one man against an army” or the inescapable “Let’s do this!!” \n\n\tKnee-jerk sentimentality is cued by any mention of “family,” and there’s a howler of a sappy twist at the close. We get a training montage and an armoring montage, scored to generic hard rock, naturally. The title is derived from possibly the single silliest development among many: When Tony decides to “go to war,” his garage buddies reveal hitherto hidden skills to convert a truck into a “Mad Max”-worthy bulletproof tank, complete with flamethrower… virtually overnight, to boot. \n\n\tThis is not a finest hour for any of the better-known actors in the cast, though it must be said that, unlike in many a similar joint, they aren’t limited to glorified cameos. But the character writing is still so vapid that there’s not much they can do. The lesser-knowns, who often appear recruited from the ranks of pro wrestling and so forth, provide some awkward thesping moments. Still, they’re seldom required to provide more than sneering physicality. Foster himself is carefully presented in all the customary ways for this kind of quiet-cool, deadly-when-riled hero. (Does Tony even own a shirt with sleeves?) If there’s any personality, charm or humor to go with that rugged surface, however, those qualities remain MIA here. \n\t\n\n\tThough it might’ve taken advantage of the Las Vegas setting more, “The Wrecker” has an attractive-enough look in Stefan Colson’s widescreen cinematography. Some of the visual and editorial gimmicks feel a bit desperate in trying to lend third-hand ideas a patina of fresh excitement, but the film’s tech and design factors are solid for its relatively modest scale. \n\n\tIncreasingly towards the end, stylistic and narrative conventions get taken so far over-the-top that you do begin to wonder if Camacho & co. might be pulling our leg. Yet the only element reinforcing that notion is Mauricio Trabanino’s original score, which goes from standard bombast to underlining every pow! and thwack! a la the 1960s “Batman” series. Even so, one suspects that he’s having a private joke the other filmmakers aren’t in on. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAs her new album opens, Brandi Carlile is having a slight argument with herself. The title track of the record, “Returning to Myself,” wonders aloud about how much value there is in going deeply inward for solitary reflection, versus constant connectedness. It’s a question the singer-songwriter had to resolve for herself, to some degree, because she knew her season of being her friend Joni Mitchell’s right-hand woman in her current musical endeavors was ending, and also that it was closing in on time to start in on her first solo album in four years. Perhaps she needed to give herself a pep talk, or permission, at least, that it was all right to go off indulge in splendid isolation.\n\t\n\n\tBut the debate in that title song is not really a fair fight. Carlile has often said that a big way in which she and her wife (and manager), Catherine Carlile, differ is that Catherine becomes completely anxious at the idea of guests dropping by without massive advance notice, and Brandi can’t imagine anything more delightful. So guess what? Carlile spends much of “Returning to Myself” making the case for returning to attachment, as a life philosophy, even if she’ll allow that having time to hear your own thoughts has some value too. So the new record does mark the return of Carlile standing musically on her own two feet — as if she ever wasn’t, even when she released a duo album with Elton John, “Who Believes in Angels?,” in early 2025 — and there are no big collabs in the works and no features on the album. But, naturally, she is just as enthralled to talk about her producing partners, namely Andrew Watt and Aaron Dessner, as about any life lessons she picked up in the moments she allowed herself to be stuck in her own head.\n\t\n\n\tVariety spoke with Carlile on the eve of the release of “Returning to Myself,” which stands as one of her finest efforts and one of the best albums of the year. The conversation turned toward the messages the new album sends out to her fan base (the “Bramily,” as it’s known) about how to navigate increasingly tense times in the world… to her just-announced 2026 arena tour… and yes, to Elton and Joni, because returning to herself is acknowledging how deeply they’re ingrained in her essence at this point.\n\n\tThis feels like a true singer-songwriter album. Not in a way that emphasizes you solely or diminishes the contributions of your band or producers, but if “singer-songwriter” is a genre, this might fit that even more squarely than some of the other recent albums. Whereas with your last album, “In These Silent Days,” you were talking about getting in touch with your inner diva. This is not a diva album, per se.\n\n\tNo, no, it’s not. You’re right. On that album, I think l was, like most people were post-pandemic, wanting to step out. I was feeling like coming right out of the gate with a big voice, sparkly suits, Shakespearean pose, strutting across the stage. I wanted to be out and loud, because we had all been locked in for so long. And that’s not how I felt this time. I felt like I did that already, and I wanted to reflect on some of my atrophied ways of being and thinking.\n\n\tWere they any false starts in your mind before you settled in on the approach for this? In an interview we did at the end of your last album cycle, we were talking about the song “Broken Horses,” which is one of the most hardcore rock ‘n’ roll songs you’d ever done, and you told us then you thought that might be the direction your next album would be headed. But of course that was years before you actually got into making this new record, and maybe surprising yourself.\n\n\tYeah. Which I hope I always do. I remember Rick Rubin telling me when I was really young, “You can’t make records in your head.” And I was like, “Well, sure you can! I make everything in my head, years in advance.” And it’s not true. You can’t make records in your head, if you do it authentically. You have to be prepared to be surprised by the muse. That does tend to happen to me every so often in these big, pivotal moments in my life, and that’s certainly what happened.\n\t\n\n\tYou know, I remember telling you that “Broken Horses” felt like the template for the next album, and there’s a reason for that. It’s like my favorite records, sequentially in the long arc of an artist’s career, blend together like a color wheel. I think there’s always an indication on the album of where the artist has just come from and where the artist is going, so I’m always thinking about that. And so  looking back in retrospect at what that transitional song was, I thought, “Well, maybe the transitional song on ‘In These Silent Days’ is ‘Broken Horses,’” because it just felt like an under-explored tributary for me.\n\n\tBut then the Elton album came along, and I felt that I got to do a lot of that on that album, just in terms of up-tempo, in-your-face rock ‘n’ roll. And the very next song I wrote after “In These Silent Days” was probably “Swing for the Fences” [which appeared on the record with Elton]. So there was a truth to what “Broken Horses” was leading me toward, but then I did that there. And I kind of wound it all down with “You Without Me” [a tender ballad from the Elton album that Carlile also put on her new solo album]. And right then, I knew that was my color-wheel moment that was blending me into the next era of my life.\n\n\tYou’ve said you wanted this album to have an otherworldly palette. You’ve mentioned the Emmylou Harris album “Wrecking Ball” as some kind of template that occurred to you somewhere along the way.\n\n\tYeah, and also “Joshua Tree.” The Daniel Lanois intersectionality of all things was discussed by me with Andrew I think to the point of exhaustion. I made Andrew these exhausting, several-hundred-song playlists of songs that were coming back to me, like flashback from youth, in ways that I hadn’t revisited before. I didn’t even know why I was sending him these abstract snippets and things that I haven’t thought about in years and years — you know, deep cuts from (Radiohead’s) “Pablo Honey” and live recordings of Sarah McLachlan in the ‘90s and obscure Indigo Girls special releases and the “Philadelphia” and “City of Angels” soundtracks. These moments were like a revisitation of a really pure place that my music used to come from. It’s not that it ever wasn’t pure — it’s just that I got in a van and I joined a band and I just started working. And that’s authentic too; work is authentic, and my music and my work were inseparable. But back when it wasn’t work, that’s where I got to with this album.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s a fascinating origin point for this album that would be interesting to explore with you, that involves you landing at Aaron Dessner’s place in the Northeast for a writing session. You flew out there literally the day after doing the second of two shows with Joni Mitchell at the Hollywood Bowl. And you were feeling you needing to detach yourself from those famous collaborations a little bit, whether it was with her or Elton John, and get back to working on music on your own. But you are known for being the great collaborator — “plays well with others” might be the operative phrase.  That’s been a real joy in your life, obviously, to either reach upward and work with your heroes or reach downward to lift up artists who could use your touch as a producer…\n\n\tIt has been, yeah.  \n\n\tSo to step away from that consciously is interesting.\n\n\tWell, it wasn’t conscious, and that’s the truth. My favorite thing to do, probably, if I’m really honest, is just to take my voice and bend it around someone else’s voice and join musically with others, so I always probably will do it. But if I ever got as close to the end of it as I could, it would’ve been at that Hollywood Bowl show. Because there was nothing cumbersome or negative about it; it was quite the opposite, actually. It felt more like a peak moment. And I didn’t really want to slow-roll down the hill of that. I wanted to just jump off the cliff.\n\n\tThe second night, I was sitting next to Joni — best seat in the house, by the way; nobody had a better seat to the Joni miracle than I did — while she was singing “Both Sides Now,” and I was just fighting back tears. Not the kind of tears that wet your face in the stage lights and make you look like a Disney princess; the kind of fucking tears that are full-body, ugly-face kind of tears. Fighting it, just fighting it. And I didn’t know really why at the time, but there was this feeling in me that it was the last time that I would be in that seat doing that for that song, in that moment. And I just thought: What a journey. From the first time I heard her open her mouth and say “rose and floes of angel hair” to here, it all was right there, just laying on my shoulders, and I was overpowered by it. When I woke up the next morning, I still was. And when I met Aaron, I still was. And then when he left me alone in his barn, I still was. And that was why I felt so alone: because I knew it was time for me to say goodbye to something so special, so important. And honestly, it wasn’t even my choice, it was just the end of that, you know? Joni was just gonna float off into Joni prestige and beauty, in the way that she does, and I was gonna find a way to reinvent myself. That didn’t even need to get said. It’s just what happened. But I really felt it.\n\t\n\n\tSo, obviously it was not the end of your friendship with Joni or anything like that, just…\n\n\tOh God, no. If anything, I think the joy that we get from being around each other and having a laugh, knowing that there’s not some big fucking scary thing in front of us that we’re stressed about, is amazing. Because every time we’ve seen each other for six years, we were just about to do something huge, and right on the edge of something that was going to really challenge both of us, together and separately. That feeling was always in the room, and now it’s really not, so that’s so much fun. I still do not go to L.A. without going up and sitting with Joni and watching TV or having wine or whatever.\n\n\tIt’s just so dramatic that you had booked yourself to go the very next day after doing the Hollywood Bowl with Joni to go be with Aaron Dessner across the country. Was it that deliberate, to make the transition as abrupt as possible? Like, this will help me decompress from this weekend of concerts to go do something radically different, immediately?\n\n\tWell, I knew whenever I was gonna make the record, I was gonna make it with Andrew Watt. And Aaron was somebody that I’d only met passively backstage at a couple of shows here and there and really liked him, and obviously I’m a massive fan of the National and of the work that he’s done with Justin Vernon and Big Red Machine and all that stuff that he’s been involved with. I just knew he was a really unique conceptualizer or a creator or facilitator at that point. So it was something I knew I wanted to do for some kind of next phase. I just didn’t know what it looked like. I certainly didn’t think it was for production. I thought it was for songwriting, and I didn’t actually know how he does that until I got there. But I was looking at it as the end of a work trip after the Joni show: I’m gonna do this one more work thing, then I’m gonna take a bunch of time off and figure out who the fuck I am anymore. At the end of a work trip, last thing I’ll do is head over to the east coast, meet this guy, and then I’m going home for a long time. I love to hibernate in the fall.\n\n\tAnd little did I know that that actually was the first day of my album. And then I had to come home and tell Andrew and the twins that: “Hey guys! I wrote my first song without you, and accidentally chose us another producer without even talking to you.”\n\t\n\n\tSettling in at Dessner’s place by yourself at the end of that day, finding yourself alone the night after the big event with Joni, that’s when you wrote the lyrics to “Returning to Myself”?\n\n\tYeah. I got there and went into the barn, and Aaron was there with this amazing girl, Bella, an engineer that he works with, and I sat down on the couch and I told ’em what I had done the day before. I started to feel really emotional about it. Then he was like, “Well, it’s getting late. I’m gonna head off to bed. There’s a blueberry muffin in the kitchen.” And then he left, and I was just alone in this barn. I went upstairs and I picked a bedroom in the loft of this barn to sleep in, and I sat down on the bed. I still had a hangover, a literal hangover, and was having an existential crisis, and I wrote the lyrics to “Returning to Myself” as a poem.\n\n\tThe theme of that song is interesting because it feels like there’s a debate going on within the song. Like, is it good to go find yourself in isolation, and not rely on others, or are others vitally important?\n\n\tYeah, it is like that. It’s like [in the opening lines], first of all, who is God? Like, is God this reckless, leather-jacket-wearing, menacing, James Dean-looking guy just sitting there holding your life between their fingers on fire, and watching it burn down like a matchstick, watching you squirm? Or, are we universally and unconditionally loved? And then, what are we here to learn? Are we really here with all these other people to learn how to exist in solitude and be alone? Is that what it means to be evolved? Is that the point?\n\n\tYou know, I’m in a generation that is fixated on self — self-preservation, self-care, self-exploration. And I’m antithetical to that, I think to a fault, a bit. That’s not to say that I’m not selfish in my own ways, or at least misguidedly self-important at times. But I don’t know if the journey inward is really the point. I don’t know if that’s really the way to self-discovery. I think who you are in the context of who you love is probably the journey. And that’s kind of what I’m asking myself — because I don’t want to have a made-up mind. I don’t want to be atrophied in my thinking at 45; I want to still be growing and evolving. So, is it necessary for me to take the journey inward? And I think that’s what I did when I made this album. I got it out of my system.\n\t\n\n\tKnowing you, if you are going to err on one side of that argument or the other, it’s hard to imagine you not almost always erring on the side of connection. But you did find some value in moments of reflection.\n\n\tYeah, exactly — you got it. I did it, and yeah, and I think I still stand by a preference for connection.\n\n\n\n\n\tTo talk about a couple of the tracks on the album, “Human” and “Church & State” seem like they might be connected, because you’ve said you wrote both of them in close proximity to the 2024 election. But they seem almost like polar-opposite reactions. It seems like the theme of “Human” is that, even though the world may be going to hell, we need to focus on the things that are most meaningful in our lives and not panic and not get totally distressed. And then “Church & State” is more like: Sure, let’s panic. Or more like, it’s okay to get upset.\n\n\tI actually wrote “Human” the night before the election, and then “Church & State” while votes were coming in and being counted. But I tried not to tie it to something as temporary as U.S. politics, and it’s not, the way I look at it. “Human” is about striking that really difficult balance between recognizing that we’re here for a very short period of time, like the blink of an eye, and that we have got to find a way to be happy in the chaos. We have to find a way for all to be well with our soul while we’re here in this split second. Then we also have to find a way to not be apathetic, inactive, passive and neoliberal about the things that are happening in our world. That is a really difficult balance to strike, because one could accidentally block out the things that need work and the things that need activism in order to make ourselves happy. Or one could accidentally block out the need to be human, while they are virtue-signaling and running as fast as they can on a treadmill that’s outpacing them. And that balance is the challenge that I’m putting forward with “Human.”\n\n\tWith the rocker “Church & State,” you recite the words of Thomas Jefferson about the separation of church and state. You’ve joked that recitation goes where a guitar solo would otherwise go.\n\n\tWell, when the lyrics were coming together for that song, I just couldn’t stop thinking of the wisdom of Thomas Jefferson’s address to the Danbury Baptists. What he said to the Baptists was intended to reassure them that they would be allowed to practice their faith, spirituality, religion, however you wanna refer to it, freely. He also makes a really important distinction that we aren’t an autocracy. We’re not a theocracy. We can’t rule over people with our interpretation of an extremely opaque scripture and religion as it pertains particularly to the Christian religion. Now that we’ve seen over time the integration of so many beautiful cultures and faiths in the United States, it’s, it’s a connotation that’s safekeeping for all people because it allows for the law to be secular as it should be. And I just find that to be an essential and life-giving part of that text. In my faith, even Jesus was clear about not ruling a people based on an interpretation of religion. Even Jesus said, “Give unto Caesar what is Caesar’s.” So I can’t get behind rules and laws that I know are secretly based on an interpretation of a religion. I can’t get behind that even if I agree with the religion.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tSoon after the election, you did a livestream for your fan group, the Bramily, to answer questions just having to do with the mood of things, not about any project or anything. A lot of your fans were panicked, with good reason, and they didn’t necessarily want to be calmed down about it, but you were offering a somewhat reassuring message. It felt like you had a challenge in that moment, recognize that people have a right to be upset, and then put it in a bigger picture. In a moment when people are feeling nothing but alarm, it felt like it could be difficult to suddenly start talking in terms of existence and mortality and the shortness of the moment. As you do further, speaking to a much larger group, in “Human.”\n\n\tIt’s really difficult. And sometimes when I’m saying those things, I’m reassuring myself at the same time. Like, I need it too. I need to zoom out to 30,000 feet, too, sometimes. And I think that if you’re in a unique position to be able to help put that in perspective, it’s good for humanity. You know, since the beginning of time, every civilization has believed that they’re living through the apocalypse. And it helps that even in the worst of times, even in a wildfire, the sun looks really beautiful. You have to find that one little thing, let it soothe your soul, and then go out and do the work. When our adrenals are all jacked up because of the things that we’re consuming and seeing and the way that social media is meant to spike our adrenals and give us these dopamine hits based on what we do or say in that realm, I think we really lose perspective.\n\n\tWhenever somebody tries to get me wound up or is sort of acting contrary to their nature in terms of what it is that they’re saying or thinking, my initial reaction is, “Well, let’s go for a hike,” or “Let’s go fishing first, and then let’s decide what we’re gonna do.” Somebody said to me one time, “If you have a goal that you have, something you want to achieve, don’t tell someone else that you’re gonna achieve it, because it gives you this false little dopamine reaction that tricks your brain into thinking that you have achieved it.” And that’s the thing about activism: if you’re doing it all in the comments section, then you’re probably not putting your body in the middle of the process where you need to be. You’re probably not showing up for that cause, because you got what you needed from what you just typed into your phone.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThat fits into the bigger picture of this album. There’s a sense of mortality throughout the songs, like “Human,” and again in the last couple at the end.  We can think of earlier songs like “Beginning to Feel the Years” where you already had that consciousness. But this feels like a very kind of peaceful sense of mortality, as you encourage people to embrace what’s going on and what’s possible in your life right now, because we won’t be here have this chance forever. That infuses so much of the album.\n\n\tYeah, it does, doesn’t it? I have a lot of older friends, and when you’ve got older friends and you get a glimpse into what the second half or the third or the fourth quarter could look like, I think it does enable you, not necessarily to live in a future-thinking sense, but to at least understand, “Oh yeah, okay. I’m about to start the second half here. How do I want to finish this thing out?”\n\n\tThere’s some real Joni-esque phrasing on this album, and not just in the song “Joni,” where it’s meant to be overt, but in other songs like “A Woman Oversees,” too.\n\n\tThat’s the thing you can’t shake. Oh my God, I have tucked my voice underneath her voice now for so many different occasions that I have had to adopt her phrasing in ways that are just practical. And then it becomes the only phrasing. It’s like, yeah, I will never be able to unlearn the unpredictability of Joni’s phrasing. Which is to say, I think I’ve unlearned phrasing in general. Maybe that’s it.\n\n\tYou must have played the song “Joni” for her. Did she have a reaction to the musical homage, or to some of the kind of candid and funny things you write about her in the lyrics?\n\n\tYeah. So I played her “Returning to Myself” and I played her “A Woman Oversees,” which she loved. Then I played her “Joni,” but I worked up to it because I was so nervous about it. There’s some little jokes in there and little references that I thought she’d like, but nobody knows with Joan. So I played this song and she was just listening to it with a furrowed brow, putting clips in her hair and just sort of like staring ahead and listening. She wasn’t smiling for quite a long time. There’s that whole first verse about “laughing at the pop stars,” and she doesn’t even crack a smile or make eye contact or say anything. Then it gets to that chorus where it says: “When I tell you ‘I love you,’ and you tell me, ‘Okay.’” And she just started to laugh — like, just straight out of nowhere, she full-on laughed — and then she goes, “You asshole!”\n\t\n\n\tAnd I loved it, because I knew that she got all of those references, and it was just a really, really great moment. Then she asked at the end of the song, “Why do you think I’m a wild woman?” And I got to explain it to her. It’s not very often that she’ll sit there and let you really give her a compliment, but she asked, so I got to tell her why I think she’s so wild.\n\n\tLet’s talk a bit about Andrew Watt, your primary co-producer, who worked on every track on this album. You started working together on the album you did together with Elton, and clearly that went well for you to repeat the experience for your solo record. I just watched the Ozzy Osborne documentary and saw what a cheerleader he was for him. Obviously you’re far from that Ozzy state where he’s down and out and really needed someone to compel him to make music again. But clearly he has an effect on people in all state of their careers.\n\n\tWell, I think we connect to each other based on some of that too, that we have such reverence for our way-pavers and the people that made the music that we feel built us. He could sit for hours and talk about Ozzy and Paul (McCartney) and the Stones and Iggy Pop; I’ll just be riffing on Elton and Joni and Tanya (Tucker) and my heroes. And we have that conversation probably every time we see each other: “How’s everybody? How’s Mick? How’s Keith?” And I was actually with him when Ozzy passed away, and he was absolutely inconsolable. But also a pillar of support for the family — got straight on a plane and went there (to the U.K.).  \n\n\tHe is going to be a really important part of the story of the music industry, in an enduring way. He’s gonna cast a very long shadow. And one thing about Andrew that is important to remember is that his enthusiasm is a certain kind of spiritually connected chaos that anyone could do with at any age, at any point in their life. If you’re in the studio with Andrew, only you will be able to call it the end of the day, because he will never will. You’ll be there until noon the next day and Andrew will still be making music with you. So every night I had to call it when it was bedtime, and that was an energizing thing. It pushed me to my limits and made me realize that some people are just gonna get in the fucking trenches with you.\n\t\n\n\tDessner’s presence is just really felt in a big way on the tracks he worked on, too, like “A War With Time.” It’s funny that you said you didn’t know how he operated in terms of songwriting. Now you know what every Taylor Swift fan knows by heart, from their descriptions of how they worked together starting with “Folklore.” What he provides is far from being the whole track, but he lays down a serious bed to act as a trigger for a top line melody.\n\n\tIt’s like I said: I am not attuned to or well-versed in writing songs with other people outside of the way me and the twins do it, which is very unique. So I’m over there, and I didn’t know what Long Pond was, either. I thought Long Pond was the name of the town! Everybody kept asking me where I was, and I was like, “I was upstate in New York in a town called Long Pond.” So when I got up there, he was like, “Well, the way I do it is, I’ve got these pieces, and it’s not to say they’re finished — like, you could add to ’em if you want, or take away from ’em — but really they’re kind of a piece. And then if it inspires you, you’ll sing over it.” And I was like, “Oh, well, that’s production first of all. So you’re the producer and we (don’t even bring in others to) co-write, so it’d be you and me and no twins.” It was really liberating, but it was so strange to not worry about production and not worry about creation — that it was either gonna come or it wasn’t, and then when it’s done, it’s kind of done. And “A War With Time” and “No One Knows Us” were both really like that.\n\n\n\n\n\tSo much has happened this year, it’s almost difficult to remember or believe this is really your second album release this year, after you and Elton put out “Who Believes in Angels?,” which you’d recorded at the end of 2023. Though you’re moving on to your next project, do you have lingering thoughts about how that album turned out?\n\n\tMe and Elton’s album? Yeah, it’s left my mind as a musical achievement and it’s become bigger than that for me. It’s healed a part of me, as an adult, because it was essentially me being told by my hero that I was good and that I can do this. And it was me learning to see him through an adult lens. It feels now to me like the way it felt to get married or have children, like a very personal, very human milestone in my life. I love it musically (too); I think musically it’s one of the funnest, freest, most insightful things I’ve ever been a part of. But it’s gone to this place for me where it’s just so meaningful emotionally. Nothing can poke holes in it.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tYou just announced an arena tour for 2026, your first time headlining that type of venue. There’s an intimacy to your music, of course, but it will be interesting to see how  the grandness of some of it gets accentuated in those rooms.\n\n\tWell, my whole job has always been to make a big place feel small, and I’m really up for it. I’m gonna figure out a way to do it, and I’m gonna make everybody that comes to that show feel like it was a living room.\n\n\tYou didn’t announce a huge number of U.S. for that on-sale, but we can’t help but notice there’s a big, multi-month gap in there. So it feels like there could be more to come.\n\n\tYeah, exactly. Don’t worry. Those are just the ones we could sort out in time for the album release.\n\n\tYou have done a lot to set up this album, down to doing grunt work. You put up an Instagram post of yourself carrying records to sign into Easy Street Records there in Seattle, where you were doing an in-store. You’ve done a lot online, like a two-and-a-half hour campfire performance you and the Hanseroth twins did from your compound a few days before the album came out — which you streamed not just to your fan club but to everyone, for free. You have been rallying the troops.\n\n\tI’m a very happy to. It’s hard to rouse the troops when you’re asking people to spend money, so it’s like, I’ve gotta show up for free a bunch, too, so that people can get something where they’re not being asked to fork over cash. Man, you gotta show up sometimes and meet ‘em in the middle, and I hope I’m doing a good job.\n\n\t(Variety will have a separate track-by-track commentary by Carlile about the album’s songs in the coming days.

    "body": "\n\tA new Japanese-Taiwanese co-production is seeking financing at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, bringing together voices from across borders to tell an intimate story set in Tokyo’s LGBTQ+ hub.\n\n\t“Polaris,” directed by Seta Natsuki and produced by Twenty First City in partnership with Taiwan’s Volos Films, unfolds over one winter night at a bar in Ni-chome. Based on the novel “The Night of the Shining North Star” by Li Kotomi, the film centers on women of different ages, nationalities and sexualities who gather in the titular establishment, sharing drinks, laughter and fragments of their lives under soft blue light. As their stories intersect like stars in a constellation, the film explores themes of self-identity and human connection before the women part ways at dawn.\n\t\n\n\tFor Seta, the project represents a meditation on authenticity and understanding. “This film is a reflection on what it means to be yourself and how hard it can be to understand one another,” the director says. “It’s also about how we define our sense of self. How we categorize ourselves and others – or choose not to. And how we can begin to rethink what we once thought of as ‘normal’.”\n\n\n\tThe production has faced unique challenges in adapting Li Kotomi’s source material, which comprises seven interconnected short stories spanning different times and places. “One of the major challenges has been finding a way to weave them into a single film,” Seta notes. The team is conducting extensive research and interviews in Japan and Taiwan to inform their exploration of sexuality and gender issues central to the narrative.\n\t\n\n\tFor producer Kawashima Shoichiro, “Polaris” marks a significant departure for Twenty First City, which has served as a local production partner for Hollywood and European shoots in Japan since the 1990s. “This is the first time we are developing a film project from the beginning ourselves,” Kawashima says. The company gained momentum through participation at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest. \n\n\t“This is a cross-border story with characters of diverse nationalities,” Kawashima explains of their Tokyo market objectives. “We want the film to resonate widely, so we hope to receive feedback from as many people as possible. It would be ideal to meet partners who share our vision and are willing to support us in bringing the project to completion.”\n\n\tThe production is eyeing a winter 2026 shoot, with Seta and screenwriter Kyoko Inukai continuing script development. Casting is slated to begin later this year as the team actively pursues investors, distribution partners and world sales.\n\n\tSeta’s directorial interests extend beyond this project to exploring how small moments can shift perspectives on everyday life and society, with a particular focus on the complexity of human understanding – themes that appear central to “Polaris” itself.\n",

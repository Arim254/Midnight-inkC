    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from Season 2, Episode 6 of “Landman,” “Dark Night of the Soul,” which premiered Sunday, Dec. 21, on Paramount+.\n\n\tGuy Burnet has only been on two episodes of “Landman,” but he’s already made a big impact.\n\n\tBurnet plays Charlie, a M-Tex geologist who had a one-night stand with Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) after a traumatic (and drunken) plane ride. Yet Rebecca had no idea they were both employed by M-Tex — and that she’s technically senior to him, breaking corporate rules — until she traveled to meet him at an informational meeting during this week’s episode.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s been a treat getting to see the high-strung Rebecca let her hair down around the suave Charlie, and the characters’ chemistry is electric. In an interview with Variety, Burnet is quick to praise his scene partner as essential to bringing the spark to their scenes.\n\n\n\t“I think the secret behind it is having two people who are game to do something more, to elevate something,” he says. “Kayla is the opposite of her character. She is this wonderfully kind and generous and gentle human being. When I first went out to Texas, I got her information and said, ‘Hey, would you like to meet?’ Some actors just want to turn up and do the job. She’s not that way, and we share the same philosophy of, ‘Let’s do something fun here. Let’s build something.’ So we met up and talked about life and shared stories, and got on well. Kayla and I have a real protectiveness of each other, and we bring that chemistry to the characters and let that be natural.”\n\n\tBurnet, who has also acted in series like “FUBAR” and “Counterpart” and films like “Oppenheimer” and “Pitch Perfect 3,” had the additional challenge of not just being emotionally vulnerable in his first episodes, but also putting it all out there physically as well. On his first episode, both Charlie and Rebecca woke up from their wild night in various states of disrobe, which can be challenging for even the most fearless and dashing actors. But Burnet thought about the situation and his character’s state of mind a little differently.\n\t\n\n\t“Let’s be honest, I’m not Chris Hemsworth,” Burnet says. “Everyone’s a beefcake these days in these Marvel movies. Do I work out? Yeah, I train, and I box, but I’m not a lot like those guys, so whatever. I got to give up at some point and go, ‘All right, this is me. I’m fine, whatever.’ The first thing we shot was that bedroom scene. I’m coming in naked. Kayla is so abundantly beautiful, and in my mind, I’m going, ‘Why would she want to be with me?’ And then I’m like, even in my head, genuinely at the time, ‘The audience is going to be like, “Oh, come on.”‘ The character is happy-go-lucky, and he just gets lucky. She’s out of his league. That’s how I see it. If it develops from there, he’s hit the jackpot. I don’t think it actually was nerve-wracking because I kind of gave up. I was just like, ‘Whatever, man. I got lucky. She is probably never going to want to see me again. So I’ll just say goodbye,’ and the fates intervened.”\n\n\tFans will definitely get to know Burnet more this season, and while he can’t spoil specifics, he’s excited to show different sides of the character.\n\n\t“As you can see already, there’s obviously a very strong chemistry that Rebecca and Charlie have,” he says. “I think that develops both of their characters. She becomes a bit more three-dimensional, which then allows you to learn more about him. That’s really to drive her character and her story. I’m here to serve that story. Also, he has a natural set of skills that are needed that can bring him into the M-Tex world, which would involve the other characters, and who knows where beyond that. So it’s naturally gonna transition from just their bubble into the greater scheme of things.”\n\n\tAs his role grows, Burnet has one key support figure in his life: His good friend and “Landman” superfan Arnold Schwarzenegger, who he grew close with while shooting “FUBAR.”\n\n\t“Along the way in this job, you get to meet some cool people,” Burnet says. “If you’re lucky enough, you stay in touch. Arnold is such a special, special person. He’s saved me in situations — I’m not going to say that lightly, and I won’t get into what, but when I needed somebody, he was there. He checks in on me all the time. He believes in me more than nearly anyone I’ve ever come across. He makes me believe in myself. He’ll call to check in with me: ‘What’s going on? How are you doing mental health-wise?’ And his favorite show is ‘Landman,’ and he calls and sends me messages and loves it. I consider that relationship one of the great things that’s ever happened for me.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKumail Nanjiani got candid about his experience working on the critically panned Marvel movie “Eternals” on a recent episode of NPR’s Wild Card with Rachel Martin, saying that the film changed how he approached work — something he’s “very grateful for.” \n\n\t“I’m very proud of my performance in it,” he said. “And it’s rare to say, but I actually wouldn’t change anything about how I am in that movie.” \n\n\n\tThe actor and comedian played the superhero Kingo in the 2021 fantasy film alongside other stars Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Gemma Chan and Angelina Jolie. Despite the stacked cast, the film opened to disappointing box office and lukewarm reviews from critics. \n\t\n\n\tOn the podcast, Nanjiani went on to share his biggest takeaways from the experience, including the importance of separating “my experience of something versus the result of something.” \n\n\t“Most times if I’m acting in something, I do not get to decide how good it’s gonna be,” the “Silicon Valley” star explained. “I do not get to choose how the audience is going to receive it. I do not get to choose how much money it’s going to make. I do not get to choose what the reviewers are going to think of it. What I do get to choose is whether or not I learned from it, you know? So to me, that’s been a thing that I have to remind myself over and over and over and over – is that a failure is not a failure. It truly is an opportunity to learn… What I can control is learning from every job and taking a joyful approach to every job.” \n\n\tIn the past, Nanjiani has been open about his feelings around the project, discussing how the negative reception of “Eternals” led him to therapy on fellow stand-up comedian Mike Birbiglia’s “Working It Out” podcast. \n\t\n\n\t“I signed on for six movies,” said Nanjiani. “They make you sign up for all this stuff… and then none of that happened.”\n\n\tMost recently, the actor returned to the stage for the first time in a decade for his newly released Hulu comedy special “Night Thoughts. ”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tCBS will pay tribute to Rob Reiner and his legacy in a new special airing Sunday night. \n\n\tTitled “Rob Reiner – Scenes From a Life,” the one-hour tribute will broadcast on Sunday, Dec. 21 at 8:30 p.m.  ET / 8:00 p.m. PT on CBS News and stream simultaneously on Paramount+. For viewers who prefer live TV bundles, services such as Hulu + Live TV, Fubo and DirecTV all carry CBS in most markets and will stream the tribute live.\n\n\n\tProduced by CBS News, “Scenes From a Life” will celebrate the career and cultural impact of Reiner, tracing his journey from sitcom stardom to one of Hollywood’s most reliable hitmakers. Friends and collaborators including Kathy Bates, Annette Bening, Albert Brooks, Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland, Jerry O’Connell and Mandy Patinkin will share new interviews reflecting on Reiner’s work and influence, while archival footage will revisit his own words across decades of CBS News conversations — including his final sit-down with Lesley Stahl on “60 Minutes” earlier this fall.\n\n\n\tThe special will also revisit defining titles from Reiner’s filmography, including “The Princess Bride,” “When Harry Met Sally,” “Misery,” “This Is Spinal Tap,” “The American President” and” Stand by Me,” alongside his breakout work as Meathead on “All in the Family.” \n\n\tCBS moved quickly to assemble the tribute following the news of Reiner’s death. Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Sunday, Dec. 14. Their son Nick Reiner has been arrested in connection with the deaths. \n\n\tAn editor’s note from CBS confirms that “Scenes From a Life” will replace previously announced programming in the network’s Sunday lineup. For viewers without cable, Paramount+ with Showtime remains the easiest way to watch the special live.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron’s sci-fi epic “Avatar: Fire and Ash” loomed large over the global box office with $345 million, a robust start that’s nonetheless a significant decline from its predecessor. To compare, “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which opened in 2022 after countless release date delays, ignited to $435 million over the same frame.\n\n\tInitial ticket sales for “Avatar 3,” from Disney and 20th Century, include $257 million internationally and $88 million domestically. Globally, this is the second-largest debut of 2025 behind another Disney juggernaut, “Zootopia 2,” which earned $500 million over the three-day period.\n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” certainly has a high bar to clear in terms of theatrical expectations because the first two trips to Pandora were smash hits to the tune of above $2 billion at the global box office. Plus, Disney spent a massive $350 million to produce and roughly $150 million to promote, meaning the big-budget blockbuster needs to earn a lot of coin to justify its mega budget.\n\n\n\tIn that regard, “Avatar” installments have become ubiquitous for their box office longevity. Neither 2009’s “Avatar” nor “The Way of Water” had particularly shattering opening weekends ahead of Christmas, but both remained the de facto choice for moviegoers well into the new year. They stand as two of the highest-grossing movies in history with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.\n\n\tInternational audiences will be key to the threequel’s commercial success. The original adventure “Avatar” earned a mammoth $2.1 billion from just overseas markets, while the sequel generated a massive $1.65 billion from foreign territories. \n\t\n\n\t“The first two movies earned over 70% of their box office overseas,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “So far, the foreign openings are extremely strong again.”\n\n\tThat’s led by China, where “Fire and Ash” started slightly stronger than its predecessor with $57.6 million, a touch above the $56 million debut of “The Way of Water.” Outside of China, the top overseas launches were France with $21.4 million, Germany with $18 million, Korea with $13.6 million and the United Kingdom with $11.9 million.\n\n\t“Avatar” movies are known as visual spectacles, so it’s no surprise that moviegoers opted to watch the third entry in the best possible quality. Premium formats such as Imax and 3D represented a notable 66% of total grosses. Imax alone delivered $43.6 million globally, registering as nearly 14% of the worldwide bow on less than 1% of screens. Those sales mark Imax’s biggest opening of 2025 as well as the fifth-largest start in the company’s history.\n\n\t“As James Cameron continues to break new ground with Avatar, the indelible connection between Imax and this one-of-a-kind franchise endures, with Imax delivering an outsized share of the box office across virtually every market worldwide,” said Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax. “Avatar films have historically played with longevity like few other franchises, and we look forward to fans continuing to enjoy ‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’ in big numbers in Imax throughout the holiday season and beyond.”\n\n\tDisney also scored over the weekend as “Zootopia 2” collected a remarkable $76.6 million overseas and $91 million globally in its fourth frame. The animated sequel has been a powerhouse at the international box office with $990 million to date. It’s about to become only the second animated film ever (“Inside Out 2” was the first) to surpass $1 billion in international ticket sales. Along with $282 million in North America, “Zootopia 2” has hopped to $1.27 billion worldwide to stand as the highest-grossing Hollywood release of the year.\n",

T.L. (Sam Elliott) punched a guy who disrespected his wife; Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) realized that a guy she hooked up with was her subordinate; and Cami (Demi Moore) doesn’t seem to trust Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) at all anymore. Power dynamics are shifting around quickly! On to the episode:\n\t\n\n\nWhy does Tommy always need to drive three hours, have a meeting and drive three hours back? Can’t they do a Zoom and save him the travel time?\nSmart move to dodge the question, Dale (James Jordan)!\nOh man, Nate (Colm Feore) is such a drag! Just enjoy the Mexican food!\nGood on Dale ignoring tech salesmen hawking equipment that means good men will get laid off. But bonus points for taking their swag and free gifts anyway!\nAww, it’s cute that Boss (Mustafa Speaks) is a wife guy. Smart man!\nBoo…down with robots!\nTommy, tell Cooper (Jacob Lofland) to just Google what wedding rings cost. It would have saved you in the end!\nUgh, Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) … lame transphobic joke. Do better, we’re rooting for you!\nShout out to Angela (Ali Larter) for being so selfless by offering her ring. That’s nice!\n“Diamonds are in Dallas.” I’m always saying that!\nT.L.’s “monkey on a runaway dog” analogy is spot-on!\nAww, look at these two sticks in the mud laughing together. Fun!\nMore “Gulf of America” discussion? Taylor Sheridan clearly feels some type of way about Trump’s renaming of the area.\nDoes anyone truly understand the business talk on this show? Nothing makes me feel stupider. I assume it’s all correct, as it sounds complicated!\nNate, just let Rebecca be a boss! Your dignity doesn’t interest me.\nWhat a long, sinister name for a horse! I thought you named them “Domino” or something…\nTommy really brought down a fun day between Gallino (Andy Garcia) and Cami. In fact, Gallino is so thoughtful that I believe him now…what drug money? He’s clean!\nWoah! Rebecca has to work with hot geologist / former fling / double entendre machine Charlie (Guy Burnet) on this project. The chemistry is already great, and he’s being SO flirtatious…gimme more!\nDamn, Cami is still pulling rank over Tommy. This negotiation barely involved him at all … might she fire him from M-Tex eventually?\nLoved T.L. beating up Nash (Robert Morgan). Sure, T.L. was being a dick, but it’s fun to see Elliott get in on the action.\nGet Elliott an Emmy! This scene is so sad.\nThat was a well-shot moment too, with Tommy and T.L. mostly in shadows. Metaphors abound!\nGoing on an outrageous shopping spree with Angela and Ainsley is a new life goal.\nGood angry/hot makeout.\nAww, Cooper is making an effort with Ariana (Paulina Chavez)!\n\n\n\n\tUntil next week, share what you would name a prize horse in the comments.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFinn Wolfhard to Host First ‘SNL’ of 2026 With A$AP Rocky as Musical Guest\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Champagne Made With Rare, Ancient Grapes\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHead Games: A Data Dive Into Lee Corso’s 430 Mascot Picks\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Ransone, the actor known for playing Ziggy Sobotka in “The Wire” and Eddie Kaspbrak in “It: Chapter Two,” died by hanging on Friday, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. He was 46.\n\n\tRansone appeared as the dock worker-turned-petty criminal, Chester “Ziggy” Sabotka, in 12 episodes of “The Wire” Season 2. Over the course of his arc, Ziggy was easily pushed around by other low-level criminals and his fellow cargo checkers. After being delivered one too many indignities, Ziggy snaps and takes out his partner in a fit of rage. Horrified at his actions, he waits for the police to arrive on the scene and confesses to the killings. His final appearance in the show is during the Season 2 finale, where he is seen carrying out his prison sentence. \n\t\n\n\tFive years later, Ransone starred alongside Alexander Skarsgård in “Generation Kill.” He played real life marine Cpl. Josh Ray Person across all seven episodes of the HBO mini-series, which followed a Rolling Stone reporter embedded with the 1st Recon Marines.\n\n\n\tIn 2019, Ransone played the older version of the meek, Derry-born limo driver Eddie Kaspbrak in “It: Chapter Two.” His other recent film credits include “Black Phone 2,” “V/H/S/85,” “Small Engine Repair” and “What We Found.” \n\n\tHis recent TV credits include “Poker Face,” “Seal Team,” “50 States of Fright” and “The First.” \n\n\tRansone was born in Baltimore in 1979. He attended the Carver Center for Arts and Technology in Towson, Md., from 1993 to 1997. He got his break co-starring in the 2002 teen drama “Ken Park.” He landed his role on “The Wire” a year later. \n\t\n\n\tIf you or anyone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources.\n",

    "body": "\n\tiHeartMedia extended its relationship with multimedia mogul Charlamagne Tha God, co-host of hit radio show “The Breakfast Club” and founder of The Black Effect podcast network, for five more years.\n\n\tSince 2010, Charlamagne has co-hosted the “The Breakfast Club,” which airs on iHeartMedia New York’s Power 105’s and is syndicated nationally. \n\n\tIn announcing the deal, iHeart called him “one of the world’s most well-informed, authoritative and distinctive media personalities,” who has “become a crucial and influential voice in American culture.” Under the new multiyear agreement, Charlamagne will continue his “uninhibited” trademark interview style on the award-winning “The Breakfast Club” radio show, weekdays from 6-10 a.m. ET, as well as “Weekends With The Breakfast Club,” alongside co-hosts DJ Envy, Jess Hilarious and Loren LoRosa.\n\t\n\n\tStarting in 2026, Netflix will exclusively stream video versions of “The Breakfast Club,” one of more than a dozen iHeartMedia shows covered under the companies’ recent licensing pact. Audio-only episodes of “The Breakfast Club” (and the other iHeart programs) will continue to be available on major platforms like Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n\n\n\t“When it comes to iHeartMedia, gratitude will always be my attitude,” Charlamagne Tha God said in a statement. “They’ve created space for me to grow not just as talent, but as an executive and true partner through The Black Effect Podcast Network.” \n\n\tHe continued, “To say that I’m thankful is an understatement. iHeart is the biggest and best audio company on the planet and audio is the foundation on which the whole media conglomerate will be built. Podcasting, live events, TV/film and documentaries, the sky is the limit for where we are going; and radio will always be at the core of it. Here’s to a new era of growth, impact, and prosperity.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Breakfast Club,” celebrating its 15-year milestone this month, has become “the bullhorn for modern culture” and is widely regarded as “the most informative and entertaining top-rated contemporary Hip-Hop/R&B morning show today,” according to iHeartMedia. Guests who have appeared on the show over the years include President Barack Obama, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Jay-Z, Cardi B, Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart, Snoop Dogg, Future, 50 Cent, Lizzo, Will Smith and Alicia Keys. The crew’s “Weekends With The Breakfast Club” is a three-hour weekly program featuring a countdown of the top 20 songs on the charts along with signature interviews. Charlamagne Tha God and “The Breakfast Club” were inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\n\tSEE ALSO: How Charlamagne Tha God Built His Empire and Is Using His Platform to Lift Up Black Artists: ‘If What You Build Only Benefits You, It’s Not Big Enough’\n\n\t“Charlamagne has been a transformative voice in audio, redefining what it means to create content that sparks dialogue and drives cultural change,” said Rich Bressler, iHeartMedia’s president and COO. “Through ‘The Breakfast Club’ and his growing podcast network, he’s amplified diverse voices, tackled tough conversations, and built platforms that continue to resonate with audiences nationwide. His influence has helped shape the future of audio and we’re energized by what lies ahead and appreciate his ongoing trust in iHeart.”\n\n\tiHeart and Charlamagne will continue to partner on the joint venture, The Black Effect Podcast Network — the world’s largest podcast publisher dedicated to Black listeners, bringing together leading voices in Black culture for stimulating conversations around social justice, pop culture, sports, mental health, news, comedy and more. Launched in 2020 and curated by Charlamagne, The Black Effect has debuted more than 60 shows, generating about 11 million monthly downloads and featuring a roster of marquee talent.\n\n\tEarlier this year, “The Breakfast Club” replay podcast — which served as the flagship show for the launch of The Black Effect Podcast Network — surpassed 1 billion downloads, joining a very short list of podcasts to reach the milestone.\n\t\n\n\tLenard “Charlamagne Tha God” McKelvey also founded Southland Stories, a film production company created to spotlight authentic, impactful storytelling. Outside of media, Charlamagne established the Mental Wealth Alliance to advance mental health awareness and provide resources in underserved communities.\n\n\tIn the deal with iHeartMedia, Charlamagne Tha God was represented by Ted Chervin at CAA, with legal counsel provided by Loan Dang of Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein Lezcano Bobb & Dang. Financial strategy and advisory were led by Humble Lukanga and Laura Rutebuka of Lifeline Financial Group. The agreement was developed in close partnership with Charlamagne’s longtime business partner Karen Kinney of KK Entertainment & Media.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNicki Minaj sat for a conversation with Erika Kirk at the Turning Point USA conference in Phoenix Sunday morning, calling conservative activists “the cool kids” in the midst of extolling her growing admiration for the current administration and her disdain for the usurping of traditional gender roles.\n\n\tThe most unfortunately memorable moment came when the superstar rapper praised “the assassin JD Vance,” leading to some awkward silence, with Kirk’s husband Charlie having been cut down by a sniper three and a half months ago. Erika Kirk came around to acknowledging there had been a faux pas on Minaj’s part, but added that it was OK because “we know what’s in your heart..” \n\t\n\n\tMinaj further expressed her complete “respect and admiration” for “the handsome, dashing” President Trump; elaborated on her recent anti-trans statements; dug deeper into her antipathy for trans-supportive California governor Gavin Newsom; and suggested that white women have been the victims of reverse discrimination, as the beauty of Black women has been elevated.\n\n\n\tThe “assassin” slip-up came when Kirk asked what advice the performer would have for young men.\n\n\t“Don’t be Newscum,” she began, repeating her epithet for Newsom. “Young men, you have amazing role models like our handsome, dashing president, and you have amazing role models like the assassin JD Vance, our vice president. And when I say that…” She then fell into uncharacteristic silence, perhaps realizing that trying to reel that back could make it worse.\n\n\tPicking up the ball amid the confusion about the remark, Kirk said, “Trust me, there’s nothing new under the sun that I have not heard. So you’re fine. … You have to laugh about it, truly. I have been called every single thing, and you know what? God is so good. You let it roll right off your back and this is what’s so beautiful about this moment, because if the internet wants to clip it, who cares? I love Nicki. She’s an amazing woman. She has a soul and a heart for the Lord. And words are words, but I know her heart and it doesn’t even matter. And you say what you want to say, because I know your heart and I will not judge that, sister.”\n\t\n\nWATCH — @NICKIMINAJ refers to JD Vance as an “assassin” when talking about what great role models and how handsome he and Trump are 🙃… then realizes she’s on stage with Erika Kirk, who tries to save her 😬 pic.twitter.com/4zmeZ3fgg0— The Tennessee Holler (@TheTNHoller) December 21, 2025\n\n\n\tAsked by Minaj about backlash she has faced for her now-right-leaning views, Minaj — who has devoted her recent social media to being combative on these issues — drew cheers as she claimed: “I didn’t notice… We don’t even think about them… We’re the cool kids. The other people, they’re the ones who are disgruntled, but really they’re just disgruntled with themselves.”\n\n\tMinaj made it clear that there has been a total turnaround in her political thinking from the days when she could be counted on to knock Trump along with her hip-hop peers. Asked by Kirk if there is “something that you want to leave as a legacy in this world for your family, for your baby, for just everything,” Minaj responded: “That it’s okay to change your mind.” \n\n\t“There’s sometimes there’s a lot of things projected onto you when you change your own mind. You know, they project fear, shame, onto people who don’t think and do as they think and do. But I’ve performed for huge crowds all around the world, and no matter how many songs I do on that stage, it didn’t mean as much as this. Because this is a direct link for younger people. This is a direct link between young people and God, and there’s been a lack of that in our media, in our everyday conversations.”\n\n\tMinaj was effusive with her support for the MAGA movement and its leaders. “I have the utmost respect and admiration for our president… he’s given so many people hope that there’s a chance to beat the bad guys and to win and to do it with your head held high and your integrity intact. … This administration is full of people with heart and soul., and they make me proud of them.”\n\n\tThe rapper called for keeping politicians without what she sees as respect for faith out of office. “I truly feel that there are people out there who felt good about chastising Christians right here in our country. And it’s kind of really, really sick,” she said. “We can’t let people like that be in power, you guys. That’s the truth. I can sugarcoat it and laugh and tee-hee, but the truth is, I am here today to tell you guys that we absolutely cannot let people who have a problem with us worshipping God… we cannot have them in power.”\n\n\tMinaj indicated that, even beyond her beliefs about trans youths, she feels boys are discouraged from being masculine. “Boys, be boys,” she said repeatedly. “It’s OK. Be boys. There’s nothing wrong with being a boy… How powerful is that? How profound is that? Boys will be boys and there’s nothing wrong with that.” “Amen,” Kirk responded, repeatedly, as Minaj laughed and stretched her arms out in a pose of triumph.\n\t\n\n\tOn the subject of girls and young women, Minaj said, “Recently in the media, it is almost been like a push to not just making young Black children feel proud of themselves, but it’s almost like doing that and at the same time telling other children not to be proud of themselves. And I don’t want any child feeling that way. If weif as black wome, felt that we were not being represented and not being admired for our beauty… why would we want to do that to other women? Why would we now need to make other people downplay their beauty so that we can feel… no, that’s not how it works. I don’t need someone with blonde hair and blue eyes to downplay their beauty, because I know my beauty.”\n\nMinaj: Recently in the media it's almost been like a push to — it's not just making young black children feel proud of themselves, but almost like doing that, and at the same time telling other children not to be proud of themselves.I don't need someone with blonde hair and… pic.twitter.com/vJHAFvZHls— Acyn (@Acyn) December 21, 2025\n\n\n\tShe elaborated: “I don’t want what was done to little Black girls done to little white girls. I don’t want it done to any girls. I want all the little girls in the world to know that you are unique, you are beautiful, you are you, and you can compliment another girl. You can compliment another woman and still know that you are epic and amazing. So that’s what I would say about for the girls. … I know my adults understand clearly where I’m going with that.”\n\n\tShe continued, “I don’t like people making other people feel badly about themselves in any way. We need to nurture young girls whether they are Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, they still need to be nurtured. They cannot continue to pay for other people’s sins. They haven’t done anything wrong.”\n\n\tAlthough Minaj did not invoke DEI directly, Vance, in following her appearance with his own speech, made it clear that that’s what he believed Minaj was talking about. Vance spoke of consigning diversity and inclusiveness initiatives to “the dustbin of history,” adding that “in the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore… We base people on who they are, not on ethnicity and things they can’t control.”\n\n\tMinaj finished on a note of somberly warning that it not just Nigeria, which she first raised as a cause, that is rampant with anti-Christian discrimination — it is America, too, in her view. And she invoked the Biden administration as having fostered this alleged bias against Christians.\n\n\t“Look at what is being done to Christians all around the world. And ask yourself why people in this country that were in positions of power felt so comfortable to try to take our voices from us. They were that afraid. They are that intimidated. They are that insecure. They are that small inside that hearing us and seeing us worship God irritated them. Our spirit irritates them because when we speak, they get shown up. When the truth walks in the room, the lies hide. They don’t come out willingly. You gotta pry it out of them. They hide because they don’t want you or anyone to know who they really are behind closed doors, because even they know how evil it is to try to deprive people of worshipping God.”\n\t\n\n\t“We love you, Nicki Minaj,” said Kirk.\n\n\tThe White House subsequently tweeted posts of Minaj’s full-throated endorsement of the Trump administration.\n\n🇺🇸 Trump has \"given so many people hope that there's a chance to beat the bad guys, & to win, & to do it with your head held high & your integrity in tact. This administration is filled with people with heart & soul.\" MAKES US FEEL PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN 🔥 @NICKIMINAJ pic.twitter.com/xkQosoncqI— The White House (@WhiteHouse) December 21, 2025\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s a particular way Dacre Montgomery answers questions.\n\n\tHe’s not evasive, but circuitous, like someone walking the perimeter of a truth before deciding how to enter it.\n\n\tHe starts somewhere unexpected, drifts into tangents, then loops back with startling precision to land exactly where he meant to go all along. It’s the conversational equivalent of his career: seemingly wandering, but actually following some internal compass invisible to everyone else.\n\t\n\n\tWhen we meet to discuss “Dead Man’s Wire,” Gus Van Sant’s darkly comedic exploration of America’s media obsession, Montgomery is five days removed from wrapping his directorial debut. He’s been editing in the car on the way over to the Variety offices. There’s an intensity to him, barely contained, like someone who’s discovered they have more to say than any single medium can hold.\n\n\n\t“Gus definitely feels like my spirit animal,” Montgomery says, with a boyish earnestness. He recounts how Van Sant called him out of nowhere about playing one of the leads: Dick Cole, a 55-year-old man, opposite Bill Skarsgård’s 48-year-old character.\n\n\tMontgomery is 30, Australian, and built nothing like the real-life Cole. “I was like, this is really interesting,” he says with characteristic understatement. “But I think what I learned in the meeting is just how kind, pure, unfiltered, and creative a spirit that Gus is.”\n\n\tIt’s that unfiltered quality Montgomery keeps returning to — in Van Sant, in the actors he admires, in the kind of artist he’s trying to become. He describes the auteur as someone who “just kind of follows his gut in the purest way,” reading the script and immediately thinking: “When it’s Dacre and Bill.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film itself — about two men who become unlikely media sensations during a 1977 kidnapping — functions as both a period piece and a mirror. “It’s fascinating as an Australian to watch the news cycle out of the U.S.,” Montgomery observes, mentioning recent political events with an archness that suggests he sees the patterns Van Sant is illuminating.\n\n\t“I think it’s, unfortunately, extremely topical.”\n\n\tBut he’s quick to note how the film’s sly comedic elements make it more than mere commentary: “It subverts your expectations, and it makes the film more accessible than it otherwise would be.”\n\n\tSince “Stranger Things” made him recognizable nearly a decade ago, playing Max’s brother who becomes an unwilling host of the Mind Flayer, Montgomery has worked sporadically, appearing in only a handful of projects. It’s the selective approach that can read as precious or privileged, at least at first glance, depending on your generosity.\n\n\tBut listening to Montgomery explain it, something else emerges. “I am process driven, not outcome driven,” he says with the conviction of someone who’s had to defend this position before. “I never go and watch the movie beyond one time at the premiere. It’s not about the outcome. It’s not about the box office or the streaming thing; people like it, don’t like it. It’s not part of my process.”\n\n\tHe pauses, making sure the point lands. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’ve taken the last six, seven years off, and just did one other film with Vicky Krieps, which was ‘She Came Up the Hill’ before Gus’s film. And that film changed my life.”\n\n\tIt’s a radical position in an industry that measures everything by metrics, and Montgomery knows it. But he’s not being contrarian for its own sake. There’s a vulnerability beneath the stance, one he eventually articulates through an unexpected story about reconnecting with his grandmother in New Zealand. \n\n\tAfter finishing “She Came Up the Hill,” he spent a week with her and realized something he’d been avoiding: “I feel like I absorb a lot of people’s energies. With ‘Stranger Things,’ because of the subscriber base of Netflix, overnight, my whole life changes.”\n\n\tHis admission hangs in the air. \n\n\t“I realized all I’m pursuing is trying to be an actor because I love movies. I haven’t been pursuing it because I wanted to get known or to get money. I was suddenly really vulnerable to a lot of different energies that I felt insecure about, self-conscious, and I got more and more self-conscious about myself.”\n\t\n\n\tHe needed time, he explains, to “figure out about myself and what I wanted to do and find the right roles and the right directors that were true and honest.” \n\n\tI see Dacre Montgomery now, at least I think I do. The six-year gap wasn’t laziness or pickiness. On the contrary, it was survival.\n\n\t“I wanted that authenticity in the projects,” he says. “I’m not going to give all of myself to just anybody. I want to feel pure.”\n\n\tWhen he talks about his directorial debut — a four-person, single-location drama called “The Engagement Party” — the same careful articulation gives way to something more urgent and lively. \n\n\t“There’s nothing else I wanted to do,” he says about reading the script. “The only story I need to tell, this is the only thing I need to do with my life, and if it’s the last thing I do with my life, I’m happy. That’s how I feel about everything: no in between. It’s zero or 1000.”\n\n\tThe all-or-nothing mentality isn’t posturing. Montgomery describes keeping a list of things he’s wanted to try in a movie since he was young, filling his first film with everything he’s been storing up. “A lot of people were like, ‘What the fuck is going on? He’s a lot,” he says with a laugh. “I am very intense.”\n\n\tBut then, more seriously, he shares: “I feel like I’m in this phase where I want to push myself. I don’t ever want to plateau. I want to try the next thing and try to push myself further creatively.”\n\n\tHe’s aware of how this intensity might read.\n\n\t“I think it’s hard,” he admits. “People say, ‘You have opportunities, why don’t you take them? You’re lucky. Shut up and be lucky.'”\n\n\tHe acknowledges all those perspectives without letting them change his course. “I’m not out here trying to do anything for anyone. Not to prove them wrong or prove them right. I’m on my journey, doing it for me.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Dead Man’s Wire.” Photo Credit Stefania Rosini/Row K Entertainment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefania Rosini/Row K Entertainment\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs for “Stranger Things,” now in its fifth season with four episodes left to air on Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve, Montgomery is gracious but eager to shift the focus.\n\n\tWhen asked if fans should expect him or anything in the final episodes, he demurs.\n\n\tWhat excites him is what comes after: “The Duffer Brothers have all this other stuff they want to do, and that’s the bit I’m most excited for. The after, other IP, other stories, other things that for years they’ve been talking about.” \n\t\n\n\tOf course, he won’t answer if he appears in the finale.\n\n\tNonetheless, he has a glass-half-full perspective about the industry’s evolution, uninterested in nostalgia for how things used to be.\n\n\tNear the end of our conversation, Montgomery mentions calling three of Australia’s greatest living directors before starting production on his directorial film. They all had one standard message for Montgomery: “No one’s perfect. You will make mistakes, but own the mistakes. Show the actors, and show the crew that you are figuring it out.”\n\n\tIt was liberating, he says, to realize “I can’t control everything. I can’t control every outcome. Maybe there’s magic in that.”\n\n\tIt’s the closest he comes to articulating what ties everything together — Van Sant’s instinctual casting, the years spent searching for authentic projects, the all-consuming dive into directing.\n\n\tMontgomery isn’t trying to build a conventional career or become a movie star in any traditional sense. He’s only trying to stay true to his internal definition of what matters, even when he can’t fully explain it to anyone else, maybe not even himself.\n\n\t“At the end of the day,” he says, searching for the right words, “Why did I lose my mind over this thing, if it’s not really about being the project?” He catches himself mid-tangent, then decides to push through anyway. “I’m going off track, but I guess the point is, I wanted that authenticity in the projects.”\n\n\tI don’t think he’s off track at all. He’s exactly where he means to be — somewhere between certainty and discovery, giving everything to the process and nothing to the outcome, following his gut like Van Sant taught him, like his grandmother understood, like he’s been trying to do all along. The “magic,” as he puts it, might be in not knowing exactly where you’re going and just knowing that getting there, honestly, is the only thing that matters.\n\n\t“Dead Man’s Wire” will be distributed by Row K Entertainment and opens in limited release on Jan. 9, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel is set to give the 2025 Alternative Christmas Message for U.K. network Channel 4. \n\n\tSometimes humorous, sometimes serious, the famed message — which will air on Christmas Day — has become an annual tradition of Channel 4’s and serves as an alternative to the British monarch’s televised address to the nation. Various well-known yet unexpected names have given the address since it first started in 1993, with Kimmel following in the footsteps of former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whistleblower Edward Snowden and French screen icon Brigitte Bardot. \n\t\n\n\tAccording to the network, Kimmel’s message will see him reflect on the last few months — including the hugely controversial suspension by ABC of “Jimmy Kimmel Live” following a monologue made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder — in a “deeply personal and characteristically jovial address.”\n\n\n\tIt asserted that Kimmel’s Christmas message includes the line, “From a fascism perspective, this has been a really great year.”\n\n\tIn his final monologue of 2025 for “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” the chat show host teared up as he thanked fans for helping him get through a difficult year. Alongside ABC briefly pulling his late night talk show off the air and Kimmel’s ongoing feud with President Donald Trump, he also lost his childhood best friend — and “Jimmy Kimmel Live” bandleader — Cleto Escobedo III, who died in November. \n\n\t“This has been a strange year. It’s been a hard year,” Kimmel said at the beginning of the last “Jimmy Kimmel Live” episode of the year on Dec. 19. “We’ve had some lows, we’ve had some highs. For me, maybe more than any year of my life. I’m crying already, I’m sorry.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel fought through tears and continued, “I just want to say that we appreciate your support, your enthusiasm, and not just for watching. This year, you literally pulled us out of a hole, and we cannot thank you enough personally.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix‘s “His & Hers,” based on the acclaimed novel by Alice Feeney and adapted for television by William Oldroyd, appears, at first, to be a typical, albeit engaging, mystery thriller full of death, secrets and lies. Yet, as the limited series unfolds, audiences quickly realize there is nothing normal about this show. At the center of the narrative is a sidelined Atlanta news anchor, Anna (a fascinating Tessa Thompson), trying to reclaim her career through a shocking murder case. However, a volatile detective, Jack (Jon Bernthal), leading the investigation, becomes increasingly concerned that Anna has other motives. A delectable, detailed story spotlighting revenge, women’s rage and deceit, “His & Hers” seeps into your psyche, shifting everything you thought you knew. \n\t\n\n\tAs many mysteries do, “His & Hers” opens with a tragic scene. In the woods surrounding  Dahlonega, Georgia, a dead woman, Rachel (Jamie Tisdale), is sprawled on the hood of a cherry red sports car. The unrelenting rain beats down on her, washing away the majority of the evidence. Elsewhere in Atlanta, Anna walks into her luxury apartment drenched and weeping. Her apartment is in complete disarray. Papers, takeout containers and half-drunk alcohol bottles are strewn everywhere. But this is Anna’s last day wallowing in her own self-pity. Disgusted after seeing a massive billboard of the anchor who took her job, Lexy Jones (Rebecca Rittenhouse), Anna has decided her year-long work hiatus is over. It’s time to return to reclaim her desk. \n\n\n\tIn Dahlonega, Jack gets a call from his partner Priya (Sunita Mani) telling him that a dead body has been found. Though Jack tries to keep the news quiet, word is already beginning to spread across the small town. In fact, Anna has convinced her boss to let her work as a field reporter covering the case in an effort to salvage her career. With her cameraman Richard (Pablo Schreiber) in tow (who also happens to be Lexy’s husband), she heads to her hometown, determined to win back the network and viewers. \n\t\n\n\tBut this will be no straightforward investigation for Anna or Jack. Following a devastating loss, which led her to becoming a recluse, Anna is still acting strangely, and always conveniently showing up in odd places across Dahlonega. For his part, Jack is also an erratic figure. Though he appears to be a decent investigator on the surface, his choices are beginning to alarm Priya, who begins eyeing him suspiciously as more facts about Rachel’s demise come to light. \n\n\tAt its core, “His & Hers” has all the delicious elements of a stellar thriller. Thompson and Bernthal are formidable in their roles, and there are enough twists and turns to keep even the most eagle-eyed viewer on their toes. The pacing is fantastic, and at just six zippy episodes, the show is crammed with detail from Anna’s past into her present. Still, this is not the show you think it is, and that’s why it’s masterful.  \n\n\tWhile murder and mayhem are at its core, “His & Hers” is a series about the anguish we feel as human beings, the incidents we wish we could forget, how we try to absolve ourselves after harming others and what anger can do when it’s carefully cultivated and used willfully and deliberately. Society pressures people to move on after horrible things happen to them, and while many do, others choose to respond differently. After all, fury can be one hell of a motivator. \n\n\tThere’s no shortage of limited series on TV, especially as streamers try to pull in A-list talent who would otherwise be unwilling to commit to extended shows. However, “His & Hers” is one of the most unhinged shows ever seen on television. It has a jaw-dropping, layered ending that will leave viewers gobsmacked. (I literally sat in shock, screaming “WHAT?!!” continually as the final credits rolled.) The series’ conclusion is so astounding because it taps into our own societal biases. We constantly overlook and underestimate those seen as “worthless,” and, according to this tale, it’s to our own peril.\n\n\t“His & Hers” is now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMarking Yash‘s birthday, the filmmakers behind “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” have released a character introduction video presenting Raya, played by Yash.\n\n\tThe reveal arrives after the production strategically unveiled its female ensemble cast – Kiara Advani, Nayanthara, Huma Qureshi, Rukmini Vasanth and Tara Sutaria – establishing the film’s character-driven foundation before introducing its central figure.\n\n\n\tThe video opens in a cemetery setting that rapidly shifts into action. Gunfire disrupts the silence as Raya emerges through smoke, armed with a tommy gun. The material establishes a darker aesthetic that signals the production’s scale and visual intensity. Building on footage released during last year’s birthday reveal, the new video expands the film’s action-driven world and visual approach.\n\t\n\n\tAs actor, co-writer and co-producer, Yash takes on a role that represents creative experimentation within an international storytelling framework. \n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\t\n\n\tWritten by Yash and director Geetu Mohandas, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has been shot simultaneously in Kannada and English, with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\tThe production features National Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences are choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning action directors Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for worldwide theatrical release March 19, coinciding with Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\tWatch the video here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHBO Max’s “The Pitt” has been renewed for a third season. HBO CEO Casey Bloys made the announcement Wednesday, Jan. 7, during “The Pitt” Season 2 premiere at the DGA Theater in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe news comes one day before the premiere of the Emmy-winning second season of the Noah Wyle medical drama from John Wells. The series, created by R. Scott Gemmill, premiered in 2025 and tells the story of healthcare workers inside a Pittsburgh emergency room over the course of 15 episodes. Each season has taken course over one shift, with each episode covering an hour of the shift.\n\t\n\n\tThe first season earned 13 Emmy nominations and won five — best drama; drama casting; and acting trophies for Wyle, Katherine LaNasa and Shawn Hatosy. On Wednesday, the show was nominated for two Actor Awards and two DGA Awards.\n\n\n\t“It’s hard to make any good show, regardless of whether it’s comedy, drama or documentary. But what John and Noah and Scott wanted to do going in was to do a high-quality show, but also one that was set up in a way that you could do 15 episodes. So, the concept of the show being on essentially one set made the budget manageable,” Bloys told Variety after the Emmy wins. “And you have a group of people who understand how to make 15 episodes, but also how to bring it back on an annual basis. That is the one thing I think that we’ve gotten away from in television, that ability to bring shows back on an annual basis.”\n\n\tWyle leads the cast alongside LaNasa, Hatosy, Patrick Ball, Supriya Ganesh, Fiona Dourif, Taylor Dearden, Isa Briones, Gerran Howell and Shabana Azeez. Sepideh Moafi joined the cast in Season 2 as Dr. Al-Hashimi.\n\t\n\n\tWells, Gemmill and Wyle serve as executive producers along with Erin Jontow, Joe Sachs, Simran Baidwan and Michael Hissrich.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlan Ritchson is returning to Queensland, Australia to begin production on an untitled Amazon MGM Studios feature about decorated Navy SEAL hero Mike Thornton, Screen Queensland has revealed.\n\n\tPrincipal photography kicks off this month at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast. The project marks Ritchson’s return to the region following his recent action thriller “Runner,” which filmed in Brisbane and the Gold Coast in 2025.\n\n\n\tAustralian director Patrick Hughes is helming the project, which chronicles Thornton’s real-life survival story in the South China Sea that earned him a Congressional Medal of Honor. Ritchson, known for his roles in “Reacher” and “Fast X,” stars alongside Joe Cole (“Subversion,” “A Prayer Before Dawn”) and Hoa Xuande (“The Sympathizer,” “Avatar: The Last Airbender”).\n\t\n\n\tSylvester Stallone and D. Matt Geller are producing under Balboa Productions, alongside Hidden Pictures’ Todd Lieberman and Alex Young, Ritchson’s AllyCat Entertainment, and Alan Rautbort. Executive producers are Valerie Bleth Sharp and Mike Thornton. The screenplay was written by Mark Semos (“SEAL Team,” “Y: Marshals”), Ritchson and Jason Hall (“American Sniper,” “Thank You for Your Service”).\n\n\tThe film is supported by the Australian government through the Location Offset, the Queensland government through Screen Queensland’s Production Attraction Strategy and the City of Gold Coast’s Screen Attraction Program.\n\n\tThe production was secured for Queensland through Screen Queensland’s Production Strategy and the federal government’s Location Offset.\n\n\tActing Minister for the Arts Tim Nicholls said the project demonstrates strong momentum for screen production in the state heading into 2026 under the Crisafulli Government.\n\t\n\n\t“This latest project for Amazon MGM Studios will create employment for around 260 local cast and crew while injecting an estimated AUD50 million ($33.5 million) into the Queensland economy and supporting numerous small businesses,” Nicholls said in a statement, adding that the government remains committed to keeping Queensland as the country’s top destination for screen production.\n\n\tScreen Queensland CEO Jacqui Feeney highlighted the state’s expertise with military and water-based productions as key factors in the production’s return to Queensland.\n\n\t“Queensland crews have an internationally renowned reputation for delivering complex action films and series and it’s fantastic to start the new year with such an ambitious production coming into Village Roadshow Studios,” Feeney said.\n\n\tHughes said he was excited to bring the project back to Australia. “The Gold Coast offers world-class crews, facilities, and locations, making it an ideal home for a production of this scale,” the “Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard” director said. “I’m thrilled to be working with Screen Queensland to bring this film to life.”\n\n\tThe Mike Thornton project joins a growing slate of Queensland-based films for Amazon MGM Studios, including “Balls Up,” “The Bluff,” “Voltron” and “Subversion.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNot even a bull-induced brain hemorrhage and broken ribs can stop Johnny Knoxville.\n\n\tA brand new “Jackass” movie will be released wide in theaters on June 26 via Paramount Pictures, Variety can confirm.\n\n\tKnoxville teased in a vague Instagram post that the franchise would be returning to cinemas in the summer, but did not explicitly mention that it is, indeed, “Jackass 5” and not a rerelease of a past project. The post was jointly uploaded by Knoxville, the official “Jackass” account and Gorilla Flicks, the production company founded by Jeff Tremaine.\n\t\n\n\tThe caption reads: “Well a wang dang and hot damn doodle, we are starting the year off with a bang. We wanted to let you know that this summer ‘Jackass’ is back!! We will see you in theatres June 26th. More to come but wanted you to hear it from us first!!”\n\n\n\tThe new film comes four years after “Jackass Forever,” in which Knoxville was lit up by an angry bull, Danger Ehren was covered in honey and confronted by a black bear and Steve-O’s genitals were covered in bumblebees. The fourth film installment featured most of the original, aging “Jackass” stunt men and pranksters while also welcoming in some new blood, like Zach Holmes, Sean “Poopies” McInerney, Jasper Dolphin, Eric Manaka and Rachel Wolfson. \n\n\tBeyond Knoxville’s involvement, the cast of “Jackass 5” has yet to be announced. It seems unlikely fans will see the return of original squad member Bam Margera, who was cut from the fourth film due to a violation of his contract relating to substance abuse. He recently told the press, “You couldn’t offer me enough money to want to do another ‘Jackass.'”\n\t\n\n\t“Jackass” began as a TV show on MTV before swelling into a film franchise that spans decades. Its audience, once immature teenagers, is now made up of immature middle-aged people — plus a whole lot of new immature teenagers. In his 2022 review of “Jackass Forever,” Variety chief film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote, “Johnny Knoxville is now 50, Steve-O and Chris Pontius are 47, Dave England is 52, Wee Man is 48, but they and the rest of the team have not slacked off in their mission to create what are basically the world’s most stupidly elaborate frat-house hazing stunts, and to stage them with a juvenile masochistic fervor that lies somewhere between psychotic and religious. That they’re still at it in middle age is to say that these dudes are no longer just Jackassing. They’re fighting for their right to party. They’re raging against the dying of the balls.”\n\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Stranger Things” actress Jennifer Marshall, who played Max’s mother Susan Hargrove in Seasons 2 and 4 of the hit Netflix series, has posted via social media about not appearing in the show’s final season — and how the decision came as she was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\tSeason 4 ended with Max (Sadie Sink) in a coma at the hospital, where that character also spent much of Season 5. But while Max’s boyfriend Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) kept a vigil by her side, Susan — despite being Max’s mother — was nowhere to be seen.\n\t\n\n\tIn her post, Marshall noted her disappointment that she wasn’t in Season 5, especially since it would have helped her with health insurance. \n\n\n\t“I had cancer, I get it,” Marshall wrote on social media. “But I was in remission during the shooting of Season 5. Shooting would have helped me obtain my health insurance through the union. Maybe they had too many characters, idk but obv Susan Hargrove is THE WORST MOTHER EVER LMAO. #strangerthings #strangerthings5 #cancer #cancersucks #butwhy.”\n\n\tMarshall told Variety that the post was not meant to be mean-spirited, but rather in jest, noting that with Susan missing, it’s clear the character is just not that great of a mom.\n\n\t“I just made the reel as a funny thing and it blew up,” Marshall wrote in an email to Variety. “I hold no ill will toward anyone and just wish things would have gone a different way. I was surprised to not be called back but cannot confirm why that decision was made. Regardless, I am grateful for the opportunity to be in the previous seasons.”\n\n\tEarlier, as the “Stranger Things” finale dropped on New Year’s Eve, Marshall wrote another post on Instagram: “Okay folks! It’s over…but where was she? What kind of mother isn’t there for her child while she’s in the hospital? Give me all your theories…”\n\t\n\n\tMarshall revealed her cancer diagnosis in a personal Facebook post in 2022. She noted at the time that she was being treated for cancer while filming Season 4 of “Stranger Things,” and that by the fourth episode, she required a wig due to her hair coming out.\n\n\t“I confided in certain people on set, including Sadie, who plays my daughter, Max. Her kindness and compassion overwhelmed me and I’m forever thankful for those moments we shared behind the scenes,” she wrote then. “She’s an incredible talent, but more importantly, a caring and kind human being. At the end of the shoot, I asked if I could speak to Matt and Ross [Duffer, the show creators] alone and explained to them what was going on. They looked alarmed and asked how I was. I confessed I had shot those episodes while undergoing treatment but that they were some of the brightest days I had had given all that was going on. I told them that eventually, I would be public about my diagnosis. That I wanted to influence others to get checked so that no one ever had to go through what I did. I asked them to please not write me out due to kindness or concern about my health because the days spent on set were such a bright light in an otherwise dark and depressing time. They expressed their concern, offered their well wishes and urged me to contact them if I needed anything. Such lovely people I’m thrilled to know and have worked under.”\n\n\tMarshall’s other credits include “The Terminal List: Dark Wolf,” “Sugar,” “For All Mankind,” “NCIS: Los Angeles” and “Reacher,” as well as host of The CW’s “Mysteries Decoded.”\n",

Rita Ora named Manny Ramirez.\n\t\n\n\tAs for the identity of the second elimination — a duo under two Croissant costumes — Thicke said he believed it was Snooki and the Situation from “Jersey Shore,” while Jeong guessed Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. McCarthy-Wahlberg named Todd and Julie Chrisley. Ora went with Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag. The Croissant will be revealed at the start of next week’s episode.\n\n\n\tThe two-hour premiere — which repped the first episode since May 2025, as “The Masked Singer” took the fall off — opened with Ora singing “Golden,” from “KPop Demon Hunters” (which features the voice of her fellow panelist Jeong). Later, Jeong and Thicke also joined in the vocals.\n\n\tIn a series of head-to-head competitions, Galaxy Girl faced off with Handyman; Pugcasso with Queen Corgi, Scarab with Croissants, Snow Cone with Stingray and Googly Eyes with Cat Witch. Winning those faceoffs: Galaxy Girl, Pugcasso, Scarab, Stingray and Cat Witch.\n\n\tThat meant Handyman, Queen Corgi, Croissants, Snow Cone and Googly Eyes were the bottom five. After one more vote, the bottom two were poised for elimination: Googly Eyes and Croissant.\n\t\n\n\tDavid “Big Papi” Ortiz as Googly Eyes is the first celebrity unmasked on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\n\tBack for Season 14 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists McCarthy Wahlberg, Jeong, Ora and Thicke.\n\n\tNew this season is “America’s Insider,” in which singer, dancer and social media personality Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues for viewers. The twist: Cantrall is in costume, but will unmask for viewers — so the audience knows who she is, but the panelists don’t.\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\n\tHere were the performances on Wednesday’s two-hour premiere episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGalaxy Girl, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGalaxy Girl\t\n\n\tSong: “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” by Chappell Roan\n\n\tPanel guesses: Lindsay Lohan, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Emma Stone\n\n\tGalaxy Girl voiceover: “Star light, star bright. Heard you’re looking for stars tonight. Well, this girl’s the whole galaxy. From a young age I was on top of the world. Accepted in the best schools on scholarship. The youngest on stage, even before I could drive. But y’all, I’m human. And perfection was never my thing. So, I walked away. For years, I was lost in the background. But I knew there was something bigger in the world for me. So I worked my butt off. And boom, my rise was meteoric. Now I’m feeling another gravitational pull. Toward this stage. I’ll admit, I’ve been curious about doing ‘The Masked Singer’ for a while. And I’m ready for takeoff. But I don’t plan to take off this mask until I secure that trophy.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHandyman, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHandyman\t\n\n\tSong: “Shake Your Groove Thing,” by Peaches & Herb\n\n\tPanel guesses: Idris Elba, Tone Loc, Vin Diesel\n\n\tHandyman voiceover: “I’m your host, Handyman. And today I’m going to teach you how to flip your life upside down. I grew up on the west coast. And as a kid, I was scrappy. I was a tough guy. And I rode around with an interesting crew. It was fun. You want to see my wild guy face? I was never looking for trouble. So I used my image to shift gears. Suddenly, the crowd I was rolling with included everyone from DeNiro to Courtney Cox. Turns out, I could still be scrappy. But use that attitude for something good. My street cred has never been higher.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Cannon and Pugasso, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPugcasso\t\n\n\tSong: “Ordinary,” by Alex Warren\n\n\tPanel guesses: Dan Reynolds, Darren Criss, Ryan Tedder\n\n\tPugcasso voiceover: “Well hello there my furry friends. I’m Pugcasso. And welcome to the Joy of Panting. Today, we’re going to paint a happy little career change. See, I was supposed to take over the family business. But sometimes you’ve got to color outside the lines. Like the time I threw my name in the hat on something big. My life changed overnight. I joined an ensemble of dreamers just like me, and before you knew it I went from nobody to top dog. Something only a handful of artists have achieved. Just like that, we painted success. But as for me, I’m still that ordinary pup living in an extraordinary world.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQueen Corgi, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tQueen Corgi\t\n\n\tSong: “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” by Barbra Streisand\n\n\tPanel guesses: Nikki Blonsky, Maya Rudolph, Aidy Bryant\n\n\tQueen Corgi voiceover: “OK lemme tell you something. College was not for me. So I’m hanging out at my dorm, just being myself. You know, doing what I love. And people started paying attention. A few at first. And then, like an actual audience. And it hit me, hey, maybe I can make a living off this. But everyone thought I was crazy. Friends, family, professors, they all said no. But I didn’t wait for permission, I didn’t follow the rules. And now they literally call me a trailblazer. Like, what? So don’t even think about raining on my parade. Because I’m hoping to be best in show.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tScarab, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tScarab\t\n\n\tSong: “Set Fire to the Rain,” by Adele\n\n\tPanel guesses: Whoopi Goldberg, Viola Davis, Sheryl Lee Ralph\n\n\tScarab voiceover: “’This golden goddess, perhaps the most decorated we’ve ever seen, has risen as any star in the heavens.’ Yeah, everyone knows my story. I have done it all. Met presidents, dined with Brad. Even Prince knew my name. Just look at my trophy shelf. That’s a lot of gold, baby. I’m proud of what I’ve achieved. But I’ve been at this a long time now. While most people would be thinking about retirement, I’m looking for something new to inspire me. The Scarab is a symbol of rebirth. And this is the beginning of mine. Time to win a new kind of gold.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCroissants, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCroissants\t\n\n\tSong: “Jailhouse Rock,” by Elvis Presley\n\n\tPanel guesses: The Situation and Snooki, Todd and Julie Chrisley, Spencer and Heidi Pratt\n\n\tCroissants voiceover: “’They were upper crust socialites. Living at the top. And it all came crumbling down.’ So it’s true, life was good. And we were inseparable. Until we were torn apart. That’s right. We were canceled, separated. And we didn’t know when we’d see each other again. It was the darkest moments of our lives. And just when I thought all hope was lost, a miracle. Out of nowhere, we’re back. Back. And best of all, reunited. We feel everyone just had the wrong idea about us. So we’re here to change it. And rise again. Together.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Cannon and Snow Cone, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSnow Cone\t\n\n\tSong: “When I Grow Up,” by the Pussycat Dolls\n\n\tPanel guesses: Mischa Barton, Nicole Richie, Taylor Momsen\n\n\tSnow Cone voiceover: “Hello everyone. My name is Snow Cone. And I’m here to clear the air. I’ve been misunderstood. Look, from day one I knew I was destined for stardom. Sure, I was just modeling snow boots for a kids catalog. But I was the whole package. And then wham, I finally got my big break. I landed a role on one of TV’s hottest shows. Until one moment spoiled everything. I was kicked to the curb. You should have seen what the headlines said about me. All lies. Hollywood completely iced me out. And ever since then, I’ve been trying to shake that image. Tonight, the nerves are real. But this song feels personal to me. I’m not what you think. And I’m going to prove those people wrong.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Cannon and Stingray, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tStingray\t\n\n\tSong: “Stayin’ Alive,” by Bee Gees\n\n\tPanel guesses: Lenny Kravitz, Jaden Smith, Lil Romeo\n\n\tStingray voiceover: “You know what? This Stingray is everywhere. From Michelin to Met Gala. I say yes to it all. And in my early days I might have been known to mix it up on Sunset Boulevard. I mean, who else parties on the roof of the Chateau Marmont? It all started when I was a kid and my mom hosted these amazing parties with legends like Michael, Luther, Stevie. Some of my earliest memories are sneaking out of bed to sit at the top of the stairs, desperate to catch a glimpse of the gold and the glamour. To this day, I don’t like to miss out on a good time. That’s why I’m here. I’ve had so many friends do this show and love it, so I wanted to see if the hype is real. Does that sound like a party?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGoogly Eyes, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSong: “Turn Down for What,” by DJ Snake and Lil Jon\n\n\tPanel guesses: David “Big Papi” Ortiz, Daddy Yankee, Wesley Snipes\n\n\tGoogly Eyes voiceover: “Heard you are hiring a new ‘Masked Singer’ winner. The name is Googly Eyes. Here’s my resume. Qualifications? I have tons. I am a massive star, a born leader who is known for getting businesses out of the red and into the black. And I am mostly housebroken. Need references? Bacon, Krasinski, Tucker, those guys have got my back. So I am perfect for the gig and will be clutch for making this season a smash. Reach out with any questions, and let’s get to work.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCat Witch, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCat Witch\t\n\n\tSong: “Abracadabra,” by Lady Gaga\n\n\tPanel guesses: Charli D’Amelio, Addison Rae, Lisa from Blackpink\n\n\tCat Witch voiceover: “The best things are worth the wait. And don’t I know that’s true. I’m not used to being anonymous. But I’m thrilled to toy with you. Ever since I was a kitten, I longed for the stage. So I brewed myself a future. A dash of time, a little sage, grandiose merch, tours, albums. All that and more came from my cauldrons. And I’m living for it. This little kitten’s got her claws in every single pot. Because to live nine lives, you’ve got to grow and stretch a lot. I’m ready to shed my image. A more mature side you should find. And what I’m manifesting next, that gold mask is mine.”\n\t\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tAfter testing the interest of sports fans in short-form content, Disney aims to bring brief bursts to a broader audience.\n\n\tThe company aims to bring so-called “microcontent” to Disney+ in 2026, it announced Wednesday at CES, and in doing so joins a parade of traditional media purveyors working harder to court younger consumers who have grown more accustomed to swiping through Tik Toks, Reels and other attenuated attempts to entertain. \n\t\n\n\tDisney first put a stake in short-attention-span theater with “verts,” or  short video vignettes placed on its new ESPN streaming app that might include important game moments or pieces of commentary or analysis from various sports personalities. Fans are able to exert more control over a feed through whichi they can scroll or swipe, and the videos are tailored to the individual interests of users.\n\n\n\tDisney indicated it intends to expand the use of short-form video across both news and entertainment, betting that such features will make Disney+ a daily destination for users who want to get updates on their favorite content areas. There have already been some intriguing experiments. In 2025, ABC News launched a daily short-form show for Disney+ called “What You Need to Know” that is hosted each weekday by Rachel Scott or James Longman. \n\n\tOthers are courting similar engagement. Procter & Gamble, one of the nation’s largest advertisers, this month is launching “The Golden Pear Affair,” a 50-episode “microsoap” that will be made available initially via social media and, later, a bespoke mobile app. The idea, say backers of the new program, is to reach people who are used to giving content a swipe on a mobile phone, rather than those who sit back and passively swoon in front of a more traditional screen. Spanish-language giant TelevisaUnivision has been wooing advertisers to a growing series of sudsy “microdramas” that emulate many of the elements of the company’s popular telenovelas. The company recently worked with the Dentsu ad agency to create a bespoke Spanish-language microdrama for retailer JCPenney. \n\t\n\n\tDisney also made outreach to Madison Avenue Wednesday, unveiling a “brand portal” that will allow clients to measure the impact of ad campaigns on Disney properties using data from Affinity Solutions, CINT, EDO, Innovid and VideoAmp.  “We’re empowering advertisers to move smarter and faster to reach their goals, with data and measurement guiding their strategy,” said Dana McGraw, Disney’s senior vice president of data and measurement science, in a statement. The company also unveiled a new “impact metric” that it said would offer insight into goals such as consumer attention, reach, brand health, search and actions taken by consumers following exposure to commercials.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNow that Miley Cyrus has said she would love to do music for the second season of “Heated Rivalry,” one of the show’s stars, Connor Storrie, has a confession to make.\n\n\tStorrie, who plays Russian hockey player Ilya in the queer romance series, tells me he was only 13 when he dressed as Cyrus for Halloween.\n\n\tAs Hannah Montana?\n\n\n\tNope, it was Cyrus from her very controversial MTV VMAs performance with Robin Thicke in 2013. “Not to expose myself a little bit, but…it was a big cultural moment at the time,” Storrie told me Wednesday morning after he and “Abbott Elementary” star Janelle James announced this year’s SAG/Actor Awards nominations in Los Angeles. “Me and my best friend — I was Miley Cyrus for Halloween and he was Robin Thicke.”\n\t\n\n\t“I was in middle school,” he continued. “I think those photos don’t exist anymore. I want to plant the seed for people to try to find them, but I don’t think they will.” (Turns out they do. Fans were quick to find one after Variety posted a video of my interview on social media.)\n\n\tCyrus was blasted for her appearance at the VMAs for not only twerking on Thicke during their set, but she was also accused of cultural appropriation.\n\n\tUnlike Storrie’s YouTube videos from around that time that have become quite popular these days, Storrie doesn’t believe there’s any footage of him as Cyrus. As James said, “That’s probably a good thing.”\n\n\tLooking into the camera, Storrie said, “So, Miley Cyrus, know that I was you at the MTV Movie Awards.”\n\n\n\tIt’s been a meteoric rise for Storrie and his “Heated Rivalry” co-star Hudson Williams ever since HBO Max debuted the first two episodes of the show over Thanksgiving weekend. HBO Max acquired the series from Canadian streamer Crave.\n\t\n\n\tMemes and gifs of the show’s most explicit sex scenes and other moments from the episodes quickly went viral.\n\n\tIn mid-December, Storrie told me he decided to do his self-tape audition shirtless. “I was like, ‘If we’re doing a show that heavily involves sex,’” he said. “So I took off my shirt, even though it didn’t say that. I had my shirt off the entire time because I was like, ‘If we’re doing that, you all have to see what these people look like naked.’”\n\n\tStorrie has signed with mega talent agency CAA. He and Hudson will present at the Golden Globes on Sunday. Storrie will make his late-night talk show debut on “Late Night with Seth Meyers on Jan. 12.\n\n\tSadly, because “Heated Rivalry” is a fully Canadian-financed production, it’s ineligible for Emmys and Actor Awards.\n\n\t“Do I think it would be cool to get that recognition for the show?” Storrie asked. “Yeah, 100%. Do I think the show has a level of quality that I think will get recognized? 100%. But also, awards are a cherry on top of the cake, which is just being able to do what you want. We all make things to be seen, so when you get reinforcement that things are being watched, that’s kind of all you need, especially with something like this that had little promise going into it.”\n\n\tJames said she watched “Heated Rivalry” about three weeks ago when her assistant recommended it. “What I’m thinking about his excellent Russian accent that he does,” she said when I alluded to his risqué sex scenes. “I’m thinking about his characterization. I’m thinking that he is adorable, and he looks like a leading man, and I’m excited to see where he goes next.\n\n\tAdditional reporting by Kennedy French.\n\n",

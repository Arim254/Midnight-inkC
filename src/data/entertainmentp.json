    "body": "\n\tNicki Minaj sat for a conversation with Erika Kirk at the Turning Point USA conference in Phoenix Sunday morning, calling conservative activists “the cool kids” in the midst of extolling her growing admiration for the current administration and her disdain for the usurping of traditional gender roles.\n\n\tThe most unfortunately memorable moment came when the superstar rapper praised “the assassin JD Vance,” leading to some awkward silence, with Kirk’s husband Charlie having been cut down by a sniper three and a half months ago. Erika Kirk came around to acknowledging there had been a faux pas on Minaj’s part, but added that it was OK because “we know what’s in your heart..” \n\t\n\n\tMinaj further expressed her complete “respect and admiration” for “the handsome, dashing” President Trump; elaborated on her recent anti-trans statements; dug deeper into her antipathy for trans-supportive California governor Gavin Newsom; and suggested that white women have been the victims of reverse discrimination, as the beauty of Black women has been elevated.\n\n\n\tThe “assassin” slip-up came when Kirk asked what advice the performer would have for young men.\n\n\t“Don’t be Newscum,” she began, repeating her epithet for Newsom. “Young men, you have amazing role models like our handsome, dashing president, and you have amazing role models like the assassin JD Vance, our vice president. And when I say that…” She then fell into silence.\n\n\tPicking up the ball amid the immediate confusion about Minaj’s slip, Kirk said, “Trust me, there’s nothing new under the sun that I have not heard. So you’re fine. … You have to laugh about it, truly. I have been called every single thing, and you know what? God is so good. You let it roll right off your back and this is what’s so beautiful about this moment, because if the internet wants to clip it, who cares? I love Nicki. She’s an amazing woman. She has a soul and a heart for the Lord. And words are words, but I know her heart and it doesn’t even matter. And you say what you want to say, because I know your heart and I will not judge that, sister.”\n\t\n\n\tAsked by Minaj about backlash she has faced for her now-right-leaning views, Minaj — who has devoted her recent social media to being combative on these issues — drew cheers as she claimed: “I didn’t notice.”\n\n\tMinaj made it clear that there has been a total turnaround in her political thinking from the days when she could be counted on to knock Trump along with her hip-hop peers. Asked by Kirk if there is “something that you want to leave as a legacy in this world for your family, for your baby, for just everything,” Minaj responded: “That it’s okay to change your mind.”\n\n\t There’s sometimes there’s a lot of things projected onto you when you change your own mind. You know, they project fear, shame, onto people who don’t think and do as they think and do. But I’ve performed for huge crowds all around the world, and no matter how many songs I do on that stage, it didn’t mean as much as this. Because this is a direct link for younger people. This is a direct link between young people and God, and there’s been a lack of that in our media, in our everyday conversations.”\n\n\tThe rapper called for keeping politicians without what she sees as respect for faith out of office. “I truly feel that there are people out there who felt good about chastising Christians right here in our country. And it’s kind of really, really sick,” she said. “We can’t let people like that be in power, you guys. That’s the truth. I can sugarcoat it and laugh and tee-hee, but the truth is, I am here today to tell you guys that we absolutely cannot let people who have a problem with us worshipping God… we cannot have them in power.”\n\n\tOn the subject of girls and young women, Minaj said, “Recently in the media, it is almost been like a push to not just making young Black children feel proud of themselves, but it’s almost like doing that and at the same time telling other children not to be proud of themselves. And I don’t want any child feeling that way. If weif as black wome, felt that we were not being represented and not being admired for our beauty… why would we want to do that to other women? Why would we now need to make other people downplay their beauty so that we can feel… no, that’s not how it works. I don’t need someone with blonde hair and blue eyes to downplay their beauty, because I know my beauty.”\n\t\n\n\tShe elaborated: “I don’t want what was done to little Black girls done to little white girls. I don’t want it done to any girls. I want all the little girls in the world to know that you are unique, you are beautiful, you are you, and you can compliment another girl. You can compliment another woman and still know that you are epic and amazing. So that’s what I would say about for the girls. … I know my adults understand clearly where I’m going with that.”\n\n\tShe continued. “I don’t like people making other people feel badly about themselves in any way. We need to nurture young girls whether they are Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, they still need to be nurtured. They cannot continue to pay for other people’s sins. They haven’t done anything wrong.”\n\n\tAlthough Minaj did not invoke DEI directly, Vance, in following her appearance with his own speech, made it clear that that’s what he believed Minaj was talking about. Vance spoke of consigning diversity and inclusiveness initiatives to “the dustbin of history,” adding that “in the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore… Ee base people on who they are, not on ethnicity and things they can’t control.”\n\n\tMinaj finished on a note of somberly warning that it not just Nigeria, which she first raised as a cause, that is rampant with anti-Christian discrimination — it is America, too, in her view. And she invoked the Biden administration as having fostered this alleged bias against Christians.\n\n\t“Look at what is being done to Christians all around the world. And ask yourself why people in this country that were in positions of power felt so comfortable to try to take our voices from us. They were that afraid. They are that intimidated. They are that insecure. They are that small inside that hearing us and seeing us worship God irritated them. Our spirit irritates them because when we speak, they get shown up. When the truth walks in the room, the lies hide. They don’t come out willingly. You gotta pry it out of them. They hide because they don’t want you or anyone to know who they really are behind closed doors, because even they know how evil it is to try to deprive people of worshiping God.”\n\n\t“We love you, Nicki Minaj,” said Kirk.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Ransone, an American actor best known for playing Ziggy Sobotka in “The Wire” and Eddie Kaspbrak in “It: Chapter Two,” died by hanging on Friday, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. He was 46.\n\n\tRansone appeared as the dock worker-turned-petty criminal, Chester “Ziggy” Sabotka, in 12 episodes of “The Wire” Season 2. Over the course of his arc, Ziggy was easily pushed around by other low-level criminals and his fellow cargo checkers. After being delivered one too many indignities, Ziggy snaps and takes out his partner in a fit of rage. Horrified at his actions, he waits for the police to arrive on the scene and confesses to the killings. His final appearance in the show is during the Season 2 finale, where he is seen carrying out his prison sentence. \n\t\n\n\tFive years later, Ransone starred alongside Alxerander Skarsgård in “Generation Kill.” He played real life marine Cpl. Josh Ray Person across all seven episodes of the HBO mini series, which followed a Rolling Stone reporter embedded with the 1st Recon Marines. \n\n\n\tIn 2019, Ransone played the older version of the meek, Derry-born limo driver Eddie Kaspbrak in “It: Chapter Two.” His other recent film credits include “Black Phone 2,” “V/H/S/85,” “Small Engine Repair” and “What We Found.” \n\n\tHis recent TV credits include “Poker Face,” “Seal Team,” “50 States of Fright” and “The First.” \n\n\tRansone was born in Baltimore in 1979. He attended the Carver Center for Arts and Technology in Towson, Md., from 1993 to 1997. He got his break co-starring in the 2002 teen drama “Ken Park.” He landed his role on “The Wire” a year later. \n\t\n\n\tIf you or anyone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron’s sci-fi epic “Avatar: Fire and Ash” loomed large over the global box office with $345 million, a robust start that’s nonetheless a significant decline from its predecessor. To compare, “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which opened in 2022 after countless release date delays, ignited to $435 million over the same holiday frame.\n\n\tInitial ticket sales for “Avatar 3,” from Disney and 20th Century, include $257 million internationally and $88 million domestically. Globally, this is the second-largest debut of 2025 behind another Disney juggernaut, “Zootopia 2” which earned $500 million over the three-day period. \n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” certainly has a high bar to clear in terms of theatrical expectations because the first two trips to Pandora were smash hits to the tune of above $2 billion at the global box office. Plus, Disney spent a massive $350 million to produce and roughly $150 million to promote, meaning the big-budget blockbuster needs to earn a lot of coin to justify its mega budget.\n\n\n\tIn that regard, “Avatar” installments have become ubiquitous for their box office longevity. Neither 2009’s “Avatar” nor “The Way of Water” had particularly shattering opening weekends ahead of Christmas but both remained the de facto choice for moviegoers well into the new year. They stand as two of the highest-grossing movies in history with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.  \n\n\tInternational audiences will be key to the threequel’s commercial success. The original adventure “Avatar” earned a mammoth $2.1 billion from just overseas markets, while the sequel generated a massive $1.65 billion from foreign territories. \n\t\n\n\t“The first two movies earned over 70% of their box office overseas,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “So far the foreign openings are extremely strong again.”\n\n\tThat’s led by China, where “Fire and Ash” started slightly stronger than its predecessor with $57.6 million, a touch above the $56 million debut of “The Way of Water.” Outside of China, the top overseas launches were France with $21.4 million, Germany with $18 million, Korea with $13.6 million and the United Kingdom with $11.9 million.\n\n\t“Avatar” movies are known as visual spectacles, so it’s no surprise that moviegoers opted to watch the third entry in the best possible quality. Premium formats such as Imax and 3D represented a notable 66% of total grosses. Imax alone delivered $43.6 million globally, registering as nearly 14% of the worldwide bow on less than 1% of screens. Those sales mark Imax’s biggest opening of 2025 as well as the fifth-largest start in the company’s history.\n\n\t“As James Cameron continues to break new ground with Avatar, the indelible connection between Imax and this one-of-a-kind franchise endures, with Imax delivering an outsized share of the box office across virtually every market worldwide,” said Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax. “Avatar films have historically played with longevity like few other franchises, and we look forward to fans continuing to enjoy ‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’ in big numbers in Imax throughout the holiday season and beyond.”\n\n\tDisney also scored over the weekend as “Zootopia 2” collected a remarkable $76.6 million overseas and $91 million globally in its fourth frame. The animated sequel has been a powerhouse at the international box office with $990 million to date. It’s about to become only the second animated film ever (“Inside Out 2” was the first) to surpass $1 billion in international ticket sales. Along with $282 million in North America, “Zootopia 2” has hopped to $1.27 billion worldwide to stand as the highest-grossing Hollywood release of the year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s a particular way Dacre Montgomery answers questions.\n\n\tHe’s not evasive, but circuitous, like someone walking the perimeter of a truth before deciding how to enter it.\n\n\tHe starts somewhere unexpected, drifts into tangents, then loops back with startling precision to land exactly where he meant to go all along. It’s the conversational equivalent of his career: seemingly wandering, but actually following some internal compass invisible to everyone else.\n\t\n\n\tWhen we meet to discuss “Dead Man’s Wire,” Gus Van Sant’s darkly comedic exploration of America’s media obsession, Montgomery is five days removed from wrapping his directorial debut. He’s been editing in the car on the way over to the Variety offices. There’s an intensity to him, barely contained, like someone who’s discovered they have more to say than any single medium can hold.\n\n\n\t“Gus definitely feels like my spirit animal,” Montgomery says, with a boyish earnestness. He recounts how Van Sant called him out of nowhere about playing one of the leads: Dick Cole, a 55-year-old man, opposite Bill Skarsgård’s 48-year-old character.\n\n\tMontgomery is 30, Australian, and built nothing like the real-life Cole. “I was like, this is really interesting,” he says with characteristic understatement. “But I think what I learned in the meeting is just how kind, pure, unfiltered, and creative a spirit that Gus is.”\n\n\tIt’s that unfiltered quality Montgomery keeps returning to — in Van Sant, in the actors he admires, in the kind of artist he’s trying to become. He describes the auteur as someone who “just kind of follows his gut in the purest way,” reading the script and immediately thinking: “When it’s Dacre and Bill.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film itself — about two men who become unlikely media sensations during a 1977 kidnapping — functions as both a period piece and a mirror. “It’s fascinating as an Australian to watch the news cycle out of the U.S.,” Montgomery observes, mentioning recent political events with an archness that suggests he sees the patterns Van Sant is illuminating.\n\n\t“I think it’s, unfortunately, extremely topical.”\n\n\tBut he’s quick to note how the film’s sly comedic elements make it more than mere commentary: “It subverts your expectations, and it makes the film more accessible than it otherwise would be.”\n\n\tSince “Stranger Things” made him recognizable nearly a decade ago, playing Max’s brother who becomes an unwilling host of the Mind Flayer, Montgomery has worked sporadically, appearing in only a handful of projects. It’s the selective approach that can read as precious or privileged, at least at first glance, depending on your generosity.\n\n\tBut listening to Montgomery explain it, something else emerges. “I am process driven, not outcome driven,” he says with the conviction of someone who’s had to defend this position before. “I never go and watch the movie beyond one time at the premiere. It’s not about the outcome. It’s not about the box office or the streaming thing; people like it, don’t like it. It’s not part of my process.”\n\n\tHe pauses, making sure the point lands. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’ve taken the last six, seven years off, and just did one other film with Vicky Krieps, which was ‘She Came Up the Hill’ before Gus’s film. And that film changed my life.”\n\n\tIt’s a radical position in an industry that measures everything by metrics, and Montgomery knows it. But he’s not being contrarian for its own sake. There’s a vulnerability beneath the stance, one he eventually articulates through an unexpected story about reconnecting with his grandmother in New Zealand. \n\n\tAfter finishing “She Came Up the Hill,” he spent a week with her and realized something he’d been avoiding: “I feel like I absorb a lot of people’s energies. With ‘Stranger Things,’ because of the subscriber base of Netflix, overnight, my whole life changes.”\n\n\tHis admission hangs in the air. \n\n\t“I realized all I’m pursuing is trying to be an actor because I love movies. I haven’t been pursuing it because I wanted to get known or to get money. I was suddenly really vulnerable to a lot of different energies that I felt insecure about, self-conscious, and I got more and more self-conscious about myself.”\n\t\n\n\tHe needed time, he explains, to “figure out about myself and what I wanted to do and find the right roles and the right directors that were true and honest.” \n\n\tI see Dacre Montgomery now, at least I think I do. The six-year gap wasn’t laziness or pickiness. On the contrary, it was survival.\n\n\t“I wanted that authenticity in the projects,” he says. “I’m not going to give all of myself to just anybody. I want to feel pure.”\n\n\tWhen he talks about his directorial debut — a four-person, single-location drama called “The Engagement Party” — the same careful articulation gives way to something more urgent and lively. \n\n\t“There’s nothing else I wanted to do,” he says about reading the script. “The only story I need to tell, this is the only thing I need to do with my life, and if it’s the last thing I do with my life, I’m happy. That’s how I feel about everything: no in between. It’s zero or 1000.”\n\n\tThe all-or-nothing mentality isn’t posturing. Montgomery describes keeping a list of things he’s wanted to try in a movie since he was young, filling his first film with everything he’s been storing up. “A lot of people were like, ‘What the fuck is going on? He’s a lot,” he says with a laugh. “I am very intense.”\n\n\tBut then, more seriously, he shares: “I feel like I’m in this phase where I want to push myself. I don’t ever want to plateau. I want to try the next thing and try to push myself further creatively.”\n\n\tHe’s aware of how this intensity might read.\n\n\t“I think it’s hard,” he admits. “People say, ‘You have opportunities, why don’t you take them? You’re lucky. Shut up and be lucky.'”\n\n\tHe acknowledges all those perspectives without letting them change his course. “I’m not out here trying to do anything for anyone. Not to prove them wrong or prove them right. I’m on my journey, doing it for me.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Dead Man’s Wire.” Photo Credit Stefania Rosini/Row K Entertainment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefania Rosini/Row K Entertainment\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs for “Stranger Things,” now in its fifth season with four episodes left to air on Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve, Montgomery is gracious but eager to shift the focus.\n\n\tWhen asked if fans should expect him or anything in the final episodes, he demurs.\n\n\tWhat excites him is what comes after: “The Duffer Brothers have all this other stuff they want to do, and that’s the bit I’m most excited for. The after, other IP, other stories, other things that for years they’ve been talking about.” \n\t\n\n\tOf course, he won’t answer if he appears in the finale.\n\n\tNonetheless, he has a glass-half-full perspective about the industry’s evolution, uninterested in nostalgia for how things used to be.\n\n\tNear the end of our conversation, Montgomery mentions calling three of Australia’s greatest living directors before starting production on his directorial film. They all had one standard message for Montgomery: “No one’s perfect. You will make mistakes, but own the mistakes. Show the actors, and show the crew that you are figuring it out.”\n\n\tIt was liberating, he says, to realize “I can’t control everything. I can’t control every outcome. Maybe there’s magic in that.”\n\n\tIt’s the closest he comes to articulating what ties everything together — Van Sant’s instinctual casting, the years spent searching for authentic projects, the all-consuming dive into directing.\n\n\tMontgomery isn’t trying to build a conventional career or become a movie star in any traditional sense. He’s only trying to stay true to his internal definition of what matters, even when he can’t fully explain it to anyone else, maybe not even himself.\n\n\t“At the end of the day,” he says, searching for the right words, “Why did I lose my mind over this thing, if it’s not really about being the project?” He catches himself mid-tangent, then decides to push through anyway. “I’m going off track, but I guess the point is, I wanted that authenticity in the projects.”\n\n\tI don’t think he’s off track at all. He’s exactly where he means to be — somewhere between certainty and discovery, giving everything to the process and nothing to the outcome, following his gut like Van Sant taught him, like his grandmother understood, like he’s been trying to do all along. The “magic,” as he puts it, might be in not knowing exactly where you’re going and just knowing that getting there, honestly, is the only thing that matters.\n\n\t“Dead Man’s Wire” will be distributed by Row K Entertainment and opens in limited release on Jan. 9, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for Episode 5 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\n\tIf Season 2 of “Heated Rivalry” stays true to Rachel Reid’s “Game Changers” novel series, Stanley Cup winner Scott Hunter will buy the gay bar Kingfisher Tavern.\n\n\tFrançois Arnaud, who plays Scott, already knows who he’d like to guest star as a patron of the watering hole.\n\n\t“If I’m the bartender, I want Jennifer Coolidge as a barfly,” Arnaud says. “I want her there at all times.”\n\n\tBased on Reid’s queer romances, “Heated Rivalry” was adapted and directed by Jacob Tierney. HBO Max acquired the show from Canadian streamer Crave and premiered the first two of its six episodes over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n\n\tIn Episode 3, Scott has a hot and heavy romance with smoothie shop barista Kip (Robbie G.K.), but they call it quits when Scott, who is deeply closeted, refuses to celebrate Kip’s birthday at the Kingfisher. But in Episode 5, Kip is in the stands watching Scott and his team win the Stanley Cup. In an eye-dropping twist, Scott not only motions for Kip to join him on the ice at the end of the game, but he comes out of the closet by kissing him.\n\n\t“He can’t believe it himself, and yet he falls into it,” Arnaud says of Scott. “There are so many things happening at once. There’s a giddiness and excitement and some fear, for sure, but also he’s pushing through that fear. I think it plays really well.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrançois Arnaud as Scott Hunter and Robbie G.K. as Kip Grady \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO Max\n\t\n\n\n\n\tArnaud says he cried when he watched the final cut of the scene for the first time. “Seeing it afterwards with all the people added with CGI, I felt like I was watching this at a real hockey game,” he says. “It was like, ‘Fuck, this is epic.’”\n\n\tAfter the kiss, Ilya Rosanov (Connor Storrie) is seen calling Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams). Ilya tells Shane that, despite some earlier trepidations, he will take him up on his offer to spend some of the summer together at his vacation cottage, uttering the now viral line, “I’m coming to the cottage.”\n\t\n\n\t“I think they’re kind of living vicariously through Scott,” Arnaud says. “They see the possibilities for themselves. It becomes this reassuring aspect. That’s why Scott and Kip’s book in the original books is called ‘Game Changer.’ That’s really what he does for them. He changes the game.”\n\n\tArnaud becomes emotional, even tearing up while talking more about the scene. “I have so much tenderness for Scott. It just feels like he deserves it. It’s so earned,” he says. “And then seeing [Shane and Ilya] watching from home and the song [Wolf Parade’s “I’ll Believe in Anything”] that was used in angst at the top of Episode 3 and then used again for this liberating moment, I heard the lyrics for that song for the first time, singing about sunshine, which he deserves.”\n\n\tArnaud teases the Season 1 finale next week as having another “big moment” for Scott: “Jacob texted me and said he just rewatched the top of Episode 6. He said, ‘Oh, God, you made me cry again.’”\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” Episode 6 premieres on HBO Max on Dec. 26.\n\t\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBow down to Marty Mauser.\n\n\tA24‘s “Marty Supreme,” a sports dramedy starring Timothée Chalamet as the fictional table tennis champ Marty Mauser, broke into the top 10 at the domestic box office with $875,000 while playing on just six screens. That’s a result of 92 sold-out showtimes across four theaters in New York City and Los Angeles. (For context, Disney’s political dramedy “Ella McCay” earned far less over the weekend — approximately $480,000 — from a much more substantial 2,500 screens in its sophomore outing.)\n\t\n\n\t“This initial performance is certainly a bellwether for continued success,” says Shawn Robbins, Fandango’s director of movie analytics.\n\n\n\tInitial ticket sales for “Marty Supreme” translate to $145,933 per theater — registering as the best per-screen-average (PSA) of the year, the biggest PSA of all time for A24 and the highest PSA for a platform release since 2016’s box office hit “La La Land,” according to the studio. PSA is the key metric for indie films, which debut in select theaters to start rather than thousands across the country. The goal is drumming up awareness and building excitement before a film expands its theatrical footprint. In that respect, the platform debut for “Marty Supreme” should bode remarkably well ahead of the movie’s nationwide expansion on Christmas Day. That’s encouraging because “Marty Supreme” carries a budget of roughly $70 million.\n\n\t“As history has shown, a massive limited release success doesn’t always lead to big box office when such films expand wide,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian. “But the star power of Timothée Chalamet and interest in ‘Marty Supreme’ among Gen Z moviegoers should play well in its favor.”\n\t\n\n\tSo far, Chalamet has delivered a master class in getting out the word for an original film. That’s no small feat in 2025 when most indie releases have collapsed in theaters. He’s captured the attention of the social media masses by gifting his famous friends the viral 1950s-esque windbreaker, dispatching a Nickelodeon-orange blimp to fly around the country, advertising on the Sphere in Las Vegas, and turning the refrain “Marty Supreme. Christmas Day” into a mantra. Josh Safdie (“Uncut Gems”) directed “Marty Supreme,” an R-rated, frenetic comedy-of-errors that follows a young Marty Mauser as he pursues his dream of becoming a table-tennis champ.\n\n\t“Timothée Chalamet is the ‘it guy’ right now. There’s no denying it,” says Exhibitor Relations analyst Jeff Bock. “The promotional work he’s done with this film is high-level genius. He knows it’s all about social awareness. That’s what creates viral moments — and how A24 advertises without a big budget.” \n\n\tOver the weekend, Chalamet made a surprise stop at “Marty Supreme” screenings in New York City — and revealed plans to make many more drop-ins over the next week. “For your information, I’m doing this at every screening, for the next four days,” he told one crowd on Friday. “I got 128 appearances in the next 96 hours.”\n\n\tFor many moviegoers in Manhattan, a chance to see the one and only Chalamet in the flesh is well worth the price of admission. Now the question is what enthusiasm for “Marty Supreme” will look like outside of New York City.\n",

    "body": "\n\t38 years after the release of cult-classic comedy “Spaceballs,” the “Star Wars” parody is getting its very own sequel. Though this time around, Lewis Pullman, the son of original cast member Bill Pullman, is stepping into the series, making it a family affair that he describes as “a dream come true.” \n\n\t“We just wrapped, and … every day was such a trip,” the “Thunderbolts*” star said in an interview with People. “It … felt like a bizarre simulation. I just couldn’t believe my luck.” \n\t\n\n\tPullman’s father, Bill, will reprise his 1987 role of renegade space pilot Lone Starr in the upcoming film, while Pullman joins as the new character Starburst, according to IMDb. “Spaceballs 2,” set for release in 2027, will be an onscreen reunion for the father-son duo, who previously acted alongside each other in the 2017 western “The Ballad of Lefty Brown.”   \n\n\n\t“We’ve been wanting to do that forever and we never knew whether we could get the chance or not,” Pullman continued. “And so doing it on a movie like ‘Spaceballs 2’ was just like, ‘What simulation … what world are we in right now?’” \n\n\t“Thirty-eight years ago, there was only one ‘Star Wars’ trilogy,” read the “Spaceballs 2” announcement video, shared by director Mel Brooks. “But since then there have been … a prequel trilogy, a sequel trilogy, a sequel to the prequel, a prequel to the sequel, countless TV spinoffs, a movie spinoff of the TV spinoff, which is both a prequel and a sequel.” The video continues, pointing out other franchises like “Jurassic Park, “Avatar” and “Harry Potter” that have continued to expand.  “But in 38 years,” it concluded, “There has only ever been one ‘Spaceballs.’ Until now…”\n\t\n\n\tJosh Greenbaum directed the sequel, while Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez and Josh Gad penned the script. In addition to Bill Pullman, Rick Moranis will reprise his role of Lord Dark Helmet, ending his acting hiatus, and Daphne Zuniga will return as Princess Vespa.  \n\n\tMost recently, Pullman starred in “The Testament of Ann Lee” as Bill Lee alongside Amanda Seyfried.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tSaturday marked comedian Bowen Yang’s final appearance as a regular cast member on “Saturday Night Live,” a move Yang had already confirmed and cemented by tearing up on live TV alongside Ariana Grande and Cher. Getting to say goodbye with such attention and advance notice is a privilege in the notoriously cutthroat world of “SNL” personnel decisions. The news still promises to send ripple effects through the show’s interdependent ecosystem, where balance and chemistry are as essential as they are elusive.\n\t\n\n\tYang joins his now-former colleagues Heidi Gardner and Ego Nwodim in a string of high-profile departures from the hallowed sketch show. (All three left seemingly by choice, in contrast with dismissals of less established newbies like last season’s Emil Wakim.) In his eighth season, the co-host of the massively popular podcast “Las Culturistas” and an actor in blockbusters like “Wicked: For Good,” —Yang seemingly timed his last episode to his co-star Grande’s third hosting stint — Yang’s departure isn’t necessarily a shock. He had previously missed an October episode to accept an award at a gala for the Academy Museum in L.A., as strong a signal as any that he may have one foot out the door. But the move only deepens the creative lull “SNL” has been sinking into after the celebratory highs of its Season 50 bonanza. It’s a sign of the institution’s current unsteadiness that the move casts more doubt on the show’s future than Yang’s.\n\n\n\tWhen Yang joined the cast in 2019 after a season spent as a writer, he became the first Chinese American repertory player in “SNL” history and only the third openly gay man. Some of Yang’s more high-profile appearances reflected these representational milestones. A string of “Weekend Update” desk bits saw Yang donning elaborate costumes to play queer-coded, culture-literate, anthropomorphized versions of the iceberg that sank the Titanic or Moo Deng, the baby hippo. Yang made his first on-camera appearance as North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who had previously been played by white cast members like Bobby Moynihan, though his impressions were wide-ranging and included Vice President J.D. Vance, much to Yang’s chagrin. \n\t\n\n\tThis exceptionality helped Yang make history as the show’s first featured — i.e., less senior — player to earn an Emmy nomination for supporting actor in a comedy series in 2021, going on to earn three more nods and become the most nominated Asian male performer in the Emmys’ 77-year record. Yet like any good ensemble member, Yang could also blend in if he wasn’t the load-bearing part of a sketch, a necessary skill for real “SNL” longevity. Lo and behold, Yang’s tenure lasted through the pandemic and its attendant upheavals and into a second Trump administration. \n\n\tYang is both a utility player who leaves “SNL” down an experienced, versatile hand and someone whose absence, like Nwodim’s, makes it more difficult for the show to reflect the full breadth of its audience. But as is increasingly the case for cast members coming up in the social media era, some of Yang’s biggest impact has come outside of “SNL,” though contemporaneous with his time there. Co-hosted with Matt Rogers, “Las Culturistas” was already the de facto flagship of a certain Brooklyn-based, alternative-skewing comedy scene. In the last few years, however, it’s become a mainstay of A-list actresses and major pop stars on press tours. Recent guests include Demi Lovato, Jennifer Lawrence and Lopez and several Real Housewives; the podcast’s annual Culture Awards are now televised on Bravo. \n\n\tTina Fey’s now-legendary appearance on “Las Culturistas” broke the fourth wall to acknowledge just how big Yang and his platform had become. On the show’s recurring segment “I Don’t Think So Honey,” Fey cautioned Yang against sharing his real opinions about movies: “I regret to inform you that you are too famous now, sir!” “SNL” helped accelerate that fame to new heights, but it’s not the only weekly release where Yang could share a screen with famous guests and showcase his sense of humor, and he’ll continue to have at least one after he departs Studio 8H.\n\n\tMidseason departures are unusual for “SNL.” Executive producer Lorne Michaels prefers to make changes over the summer to cement a new dynamic for the months ahead. Nwodim already threw off this rhythm by announcing her decision just a few weeks before the Season 51 premiere, after the roster was supposedly set. Now Yang’s exit further thins out the upper ranks on the cast’s experience spectrum. Not counting “Weekend Update” anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che,” “SNL” now has the same number of main cast members as it does more featured players — four of whom are newcomers still in their rookie year. What “SNL” looks like going forward was already an open question. Yang heading out the door simply heightens that question’s urgency.\n",

    "description": "\n\tArgentina’s Diego Lerner, a guiding force for The Walt Disney Company’s roll out in Latin America and Europe from 1990 to this year, died Dec. 18 in",
    "body": "\n\tArgentina’s Diego Lerner, a guiding force for The Walt Disney Company’s roll out in Latin America and Europe from 1990 to this year, died Dec. 18 in Buenos Aires at the age of 71 after a long illness.\n\n\tIn a gesture from Disney, Lerner had been named honorary president of The Walt Disney Company Latin America in November with Martin Iraola taking over in that post.    \n\n\tA private funeral was held for Lerner on Friday attended by close creatives such as Mariano Cohn and Gastón Duprat, creator of “The Boss.”\n\t\n\n\tA consummate company man, Lerner spent nearly 35 years at The Walt Disney Company, in a career which straddled pretty well perfectly the two great surges in the TV business over the last 30 years: the “long expansion or ‘golden age’ of multichannel pay TV in the region,” and “the strategic pivot toward streaming, Disney+, and local production,” noted Omdia Senior Research Director Maria Rúa Aguete.\n\n\n\tLerner had always insisted that the key to success is “not technology but storytelling. What matters is the quality of content. Scripts are still king,” as he told Spanish-language website ConverCom in 2019.  \n\n\t“He contributed to the Company and to its legacy of storytelling in an immeasurable way,” Disney said Friday in a statement, picking up on his philosophy.\n\n\t“We extend our deepest condolences to Diego’s family as well as to his friends and all who are touched by this loss. I know I speak for all of us at Disney in acknowledging just how much Diego will be missed, but I’m very grateful for our nearly 35 years of collaboration and friendship,” said Bob Iger, CEO The Walt Disney Company.   \n\t\n\n\tWhat Lerner Achieved: Rolling out Disney\n\n\tJoining Disney in 1990 as exec director of its video and pay-TV divisions for Latin America, he made what would become classic corporate moves, such as the launch of direct distribution operations in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Argentina, attuned to local sensibilities but all the more to combat piracy in Latin America. To that date, judges there had mostly dismissed Disney’s complaints about IP damage as “too “abstract,” he told ConverCom in 2018.  \n\n\tIn the early to mid-1990s, pay TV penetration in Latin America was still in single digits, running well-under 10 million, according to Omdia. \n\n\tPromoted to president of The Walt Disney Company, Latin America, as the region experienced sustained growth driven by cable roll-out, later accelerated by DTH, Lerner scaled as Latin America scaled, launching channels to have a larger slice of the subscriber cake: Disney Channel in 2000, Jetix in 2004 and Playhouse Disney in 2008. \n\n\tLerner also battled to integrate all lines of business in a single vertical operation, creating a template for Disney’s international operations, Disney itself has recognized.  \n\n\tHe did so well in Latin America in fact, that in 2009, he was appointed president of The Walt Disney Company in Europe, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), to apply his expertise to Disney’s No. 1 overseas market, a rare honor for a Latin American. Based out of London, during his mandate, Lerner drove “continuous improvement in consumer affinity,” Disney noted in 2017 when another challenge loomed: the industry shift from linear growth to streaming competition. \n\n\tDisney+ Launch and the Drive Into Local Content\n\n\tNetflix had launched early in Latin America, in 2011. It also used the region to create its first totally non-English originals in the world: Mexico’s “Club of Crows” in 2015 and a year later Brazil’s “3%,” 80% of whose viewers came from outside Brazil. A new business model was born, based on local, sometimes breakout shows and movies, made on a global scale. \n\n\tWhat marked Lerner out was not only a strategic growth vision, but a sensibility about the value of local creation. Already in 1997, Buena Vista International Latin America had boarded the Pablo Bossi-founded Patagonik Film Group, partnering with Argentinian media conglom Clarin and Spanish telco Telefónica. Having co-produced Alan Parker’s “Evita,” starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas, Patagonik went on to produce several of the greatest modern Argentine films: Fabián Bielinsky’s “Nine Queens,” which launched Ricardo Darín, and Juan José Campanella’s “Son of the Bride.”\n\t\n\n\tLerner returned to Argentina, appointed once more president of   The Walt Disney Company Latin America in late 2018.\n\n\tIn November 2020, Disney+ announced that it had more than 70 original productions in various stages of development and production in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia. “At The Walt Disney Company Latin America, we know how important locally relevant stories are to our audience,” Lerner said at the time. \n\n\tDisney had already bowed a rich line of what TWDC exec producer Leonardo Aranguibel called “true life fictions,” such as Juan Gabriel bio “Since I Met You” (2016) and “Selena’s Secret” (2018), both made with BTF Media, and, arguably the best of them all, “Monzón,” (2019), from Bossi’s Pampa Films. Since then, Disney has produced flagship “Santa Evita,” backed by Salma Hayek and Rodrigo García, “Nada, Robert DeNiro’s first TV show with a character role and its biggest gem, “The Boss” (“El encargado”), now on Season 3. \n\n\tLerner could be heavy involved in production. While in Europe, he helped originate teen musical novela “Violetta” (2012-15)  which became a phenomenon. His was the idea for the ambitious drama series “Limbo,” a Canneseries 2022 world premiere. \n\n\tHe was essentially, however, an entrepreneur but could move at the highest political levels and also knew how to get his way, his art of persuasion based on knowing what other people wanted, and giving them a good part of that. \n\n\tArguably, Lerner’s crowning moment came over 2019-21, when he inherited 50% of rights to Argentina’s soccer Primera Division, shared with TNT, the jewel in the country’s content crown, after Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox. Via Fox and ESPN, Disney now had an estimated 64% of TV sports rights in Argentina. \n\n\tLerner and Disney had everything against them. He was a close personal friend of ex-president Mauricio Macri – he and his wife would have lunch with Mr. and Mrs. Macri. Argentina was governed by Alberto Fernández and ex-President and now VP Cristina Fernández de Kirchner who trounced Macri in 2019 general elections. Cable operator Telecentro was offering $10 million more. In October 2020, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) terminated Fox Sports ownership of Argentine Primera Division soccer rights. Fernández was said to have – not unreasonably – anti-trust concerns about Disney’s dominant sports market position. \n\t\n\n\tLerner looked for allies on Argentina’s center-left, who would argue the case, such as Sergio Massa, president of Argentina’s Congress, and a Fernández ally. Disney also sold Fox Sports channels. He could boast Disney’s record, exporting Argentine hits to the rest of Latin America when leaned on Fernandez de Kirchner in 2012. A Macri ally wrestling soccer rights from a Kirchnerist coalition was thought impossible. But it’s exactly what Lerner achieved. In Jan. 2021, he announced that ESPN would to go on sharing Primera Division games with TNT, with a contract through to 2030.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt might be an exaggeration to say that “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” is the movie that finally squeegees the life out of SpongeBob SquarePants. But watching this friendly yet rather toothless adventure, with its jokes that simply don’t pop the way they used to, you can feel SpongeBob sliding into the zone of a harebrained yet rote elder statesman of high-energy juvenilia. He’s still a beguiling doofus who, as voiced by Tom Kenny, sounds like Daffy Duck on laughing gas, and there’s still an appealing aura of arrested kitsch to the now shiny and digital “SpongeBob” world. (For reasons I can’t quite analyze, it was better when it was drawn.) But the original “SpongeBob” series, and several of the previous big-screen adaptations (including the last one, “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run”), struck much funnier notes of flippant irresponsibility.\n\t\n\n\tBack in 2011, when the original Nickelodeon TV series “SpongeBob SquarePants” got called on the carpet by a study in Pediatrics magazine, which found that the show was damaging the attention span of 4-year-olds, it wasn’t just the cartoon’s lickety-split rhythms that raised eyebrows; so did its attitude of amoral imbecility. “SpongeBob SquarePants” had been around since 1999, and when the show started it was revolutionary: an under-the-sea slice of surrealist anarchy. SpongeBob himself was a wide-eyed dopey mascot of fun, but there was an aggression to the world he moved through, and that spirit began to take over the universe of kiddie cartoons. (A show like the Disney Channel’s rollicking “Big City Greens” is unthinkable without “SpongeBob.”) In a sense, all of this can be traced back to the meta cut-out fruitcake smartitude of “Rocky and Bullwinkle,” and “SpongeBob” honored that legacy by showcasing its characters with total affection even as they came off as borderline nuts.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Search for SquarePants,” our cheerfully oblivious hero has crossed a threshold: He is now 36 clams tall. Which means that he’s tall enough to ride the rollercoaster at Captain Booty Beard’s Fun Park. But instead of reveling in this opportunity as he gets in line for the coaster, SpongeBob freaks out, his underlying dread cued to the audience by the “O Fortuna” fanfare from Carmina Burana. That’s a promising joke, and the whole movie will now be organized around SpongeBob’s desire to overcome his fear and become a big guy.\n\n\tUnfortunately, the opportunity he’s handed to do this hinges on the Flying Dutchman, a cursed pirate voiced by Mark Hamill with a mustache-twirling, ahoy-matey bravura so generic that he never quite sparks to life as a character. “Search for Squarepants” is a swashbuckler, which feels like a standard and rather fuddy-duddy genre for a “SpongeBob” movie. The Flying Dutchman, a recurring presence on the series since Season One, is a phosphorescent green ghost who has struck a deal with the devil. The only way he can free himself from being a mangy pirate is by tricking an “innocent” into climbing to the top of an underwater mountain. And SpongeBob, with his big-guy dreams, is gullible enough to do it, even as the redoubtable Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown), along with Squidward (Rodger Bumpass), charter a boatmobile Winnebago and go on a mission to save him.  \n\n\tThis is a movie in which Davy Jones’s Locker is located in a men’s locker room. In which SpongeBob and Gary the Snail have a conversation about string cheese, and the Flying Dutchman goes crazy at the sheer inanity of it. In which the characters get stuck in a “What would I do? What would you do?” conversational loop that’s pure kiddie Abbott and Costello. That last gag is pretty funny, but too much of “Search for SquarePants” lacks the exquisite dementia of the early years of the series, when the show’s creator, Stephen Hillenburg (who died in 2018), was running the happenings in Bikini Bottom. Don Drymon, the director of “Search for SquarePants,” was one of the show’s founding creative talents, and he certainly knows how to keep the butt jokes popping, but I’m sorry, they are not surprising butt jokes. “Search for SquarePants,” while it has amusing moments, is mostly SpongeBob treading water.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tSupermodel Ashley Graham is familiar with the spotlight. From the moment she landed her first modeling gig over 25 years ago, she’s been a champion for diverse representation of bodies in the media landscape. Now, she’s ready to embark on a new, albeit intertwined, journey: wine.\n\n\tLucci Lambrusco, a dry, sparkling red wine, founded by Graham and her business partner, Danny Epstien, officially launched Wednesday morning. “I’ve seen a lot of celebrity brands in the alcohol space, but there isn’t anything on the market [where] you can say, ‘Oh, I know this Lambrusco that I love very well, and just blurt the name out,'” Graham says over a Zoom call ahead of the launch. “There’s many different tequilas, white wines, Proseccos. But when it comes to an actual Lambrusco, there [wasn’t] one.”\n\n\n\tThe other “Why?” for starting this new brand? Bubbles. “The bubble alcohol business is a $10 billion business,” Graham says. “It’s growing rapidly.”\n\n\tOur conversation starts with a history lesson, as she explains that Lambrusco was popular in the United States in the ’80s, and as palates changed and people stopped drinking it, the beverage became harder to find. Now she only sees it at “trendy restaurants” or “random little wine shops,” rather than grocery and liquor stores. Graham recognizes that gap in the market as an opportunity to “revive a category that’s been dead for a very long time.”  \n\n\tIt’s no secret that the alcoholic beverage sector has grown increasingly saturated with celebrity brands, but bringing Lambrusco back from the dead – at least in the United States – is exactly what Graham says makes Lucci so unique. \n\n\n\tLucci took three years to build, and Graham credits this to meticulous attention to detail. Alongside Epstien, she says it was important that this project didn’t feel like they were “throwing spaghetti on the wall.” She continues, “If I’m not going to eat it, wear it, ride it, enjoy it, have it be a part of my life and my culture, in my home and everything, then it’s not going to sell. It’s not going to do anything for me. What’s it going to do for the people who follow me?”  \n\n\tThe intersection of entrepreneurship and modeling is brought up by Graham before I get a chance to ask. She compares reviving a category to her career; she’s used to changing people’s minds — whether it be about body diversity or sparkling red wine. \n\n\tOn the topic of her career, she touches on the current state of the fashion industry and a regression of inclusivity in recent years. “There’s felt like a big shift in the fashion industry for plus-size girls just in the last few years,” Graham says. “It’s been gutting and hard to swallow because there’s just not been as much opportunity.” She does believe that there has been slow and steady progress for brands like Victoria’s Secret, though, saying that they have “literally opened up the doors to more plus sizes.” But naturally, “they still have a ways to go.”\n\n\t“Do they have all the sizes that they should to be a true body diversity brand? No, they don’t,” she admits. “That’s not okay, but what’s okay is that they’re working towards it.”\n\n\tAs she looks ahead, she teases that she will make a few surprise appearances across film and television this year. In Dec. 2025, Variety reported that she would be a guest star in the upcoming final season of “Survival of the Thickest.” Most recently, she executive-produced and starred in “Side Hustlers,” a reality competition show following several women trying to scale up their side hustles.\n\n\tBeyond that, she just wants people to enjoy what she’s spent three years creating. If the brand releases additional products, she indicated that consumer feedback would be top of mind; “If we end up doing another SKU, it’ll be one that the people have said that they wanted.” \n\n\n\tWhen first tasked with the challenge of bringing Lambrusco back into the American household, Graham asked herself, “Who better to do it than me?” After tasting it, I’d have to agree. \n\n\tLucci retails for $19.99 and is available online at www.reservebar.com and other major retailers, including Whole Foods, Publix, Harris Teeter, and Total Wine.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tKenan Thompson and Lamorne Morris are teaming up for a new action comedy, based on the popular QCode podcast “Unwanted.”\n\n\tMorris and his longtime creative partner, Kyle Shevrin, wrote and directed the original series, which topped the fiction podcast charts upon its release in 2021. “Unwanted” centers on two degenerates who attempt to claim a $1 million reward by capturing an escaped convicted murderer. But, as the logline explains, that plan quickly unravels as they find themselves dangerously unprepared for the chaos that follows. \n\t\n\n\tProduction on the movie, directed by Richie Keen (“Ghosts,” “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” “Fist Fight”), is slated to begin this summer. Morris and Shevrin wrote the screenplay and will produce the project via their 11 Below banner alongside Thompson and John Ryan Jr.’s Artists For Artists (AFA) company.\n\n\n\tCarter Swan, Billy Magnussen (who co-starred in the podcast opposite Morris), and QCode’s Rob Herting, Ben Curtis and Nick Shanks are also on board to produce. Jonathan Davino serves as executive producer.\n\n\tMorris announced the developing project during an episode of his and Shevrin’s podcast “The Lamorning After,” where Thompson appeared as a guest. The full episode can be seen below. \n\n\n\n\tMorris, an Emmy winner for FX’s “Fargo,” will next be seen starring opposite Nicolas Cage in Prime Video’s live-action “Spider-Noir” series and is currently in production on “Jumanji 4.” In addition to “The Lamorning After,” Morris also hosts the “New Girl” rewatch podcast “The Mess Around” with former castmate Hannah Simone.\n\t\n\n\tThompson continues his tenure as the longest-running cast member of “Saturday Night Live,” which is currently airing Season 51. The Emmy winner also co-hosts and produces Prime Video’s weekly sports series “Good Sports” with Kevin Hart. In film, Thompson most recently reteamed with Kel Mitchell for the long-awaited “Good Burger 2” for Paramount+, and the longtime duo will next star in the horror comedy “Kenan & Kel Meet Frankenstein.”\n\n\tMorris is represented by Entertainment 360, CAA, The Lede Company and Myman Greenspan; Thompson is represented by Range Media Partners; and Keen is represented by CAA and Artists First.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Animals in War,” a Sean-Penn starring anthology telling the true stories of animals impacted by the war in Ukraine, has been picked up by Omnibus Entertainment for North American distribution. \n\n\tThe anthology was made by Ukrainian filmmakers in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Showcasing seven standalone stories, the film explores the humanitarian and ecological consequences of war through the eyes of animals and people. It had its world premiere at Tribeca and received three Ukrainian Film Critics Awards nominations. \n\t\n\n\tA label of NY-based distributor Film Movement, Omnibus Entertainment will release the film on VOD, on digital outlets and home entertainment. \n\n\n\tPenn said: “The film makes an important statement about how Ukrainians hold onto their humanity, despite all the injustice, violence, and destruction of this horrific Russian invasion.”\n\n\t“These stories inspire all of us,” Penn added, “and show how people in the midst of tragedy and terror can bravely persevere while holding onto their compassion.”\n\n\tEach chapter centers on an animal, from a white rabbit and a wolf to a cow, blending stark realism with poetic imagery.\n\n\tCreator and producer Oleg Kokhan said, “Animals have no politics and yet are the target, along with their civilian caretakers, of unrelenting waves of terror.” Kokhan pointed out the film “shows that even when facing real evil, humanity can be preserved.”\n\n\t“‘Animals in War’ offers a strikingly original perspective on the human and environmental cost of this invasion, and we’re honored to bring it to North American audiences,” said Film Movement’s president Michael Rosenberg, who unveiled the deal with producer Oleksiy Makukhin and executive producer Adam Sigel at Berlin’s European Film Market. \n\t\n\n\tThe company’s recent acquisitions also include “Barrio Triste” from Harmony Korine’s production company Edglrd; and Dominik Moll’s Cannes competition movie “Case 137” which is nominated for multiple Cesar Awards.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tE.W. Scripps Co. is expecting to make layoffs in the near future as the company, which operates more than 60 local TV stations in the U.S., has embarked on a plan aimed at boosting adjusted earnings by up to $150 million over the next three years.\n\n\tThis week at its headquarters in Cincinnati, Scripps said, it gathered a team of 200 managers “charged with carrying out the transformation.” The company said will share more details of its transformation plan on its Feb. 26 earnings call after reporting fourth-quarter 2025 financial results, including the “timing cadence of savings being realized and the costs to achieve the savings.”\n\t\n\n\tThe scope of the layoffs at Scripps has yet to be determined. As of Dec. 31, 2024, Scripps reported having about 5,000 employees, including full-time and part-time employees. Of those, various labor unions represented approximately 360, all of which are in its local media group.\n\n\n\tScripps announced its “enterprise-wide transformation plan” on Wednesday. That’s designed to “improve operating performance and unlock new value,” targeting annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) growth of $125 million-$150 million by 2028. The company will deliver the improved EBITDA run-rate through cost savings and revenue growth initiatives that will “leverage technology including AI and automation” and increase revenue yield for its existing businesses.\n\n\tIn announcing the plan, Scripps CEO Adam Symson “reaffirmed Scripps’ commitment to its local and national news, sports and entertainment programming, which Americans depend on to connect them to their communities, to their favorite teams, to their passions and to each other.” \n\t\n\n\t“Scripps is nearly 150 years old, and we have thrived for so long because doing well by doing good is in our DNA,” said Symson. “We are taking E.W. Scripps’ founding mission and values for the enterprise, overlaying today’s company vision to create connection, and doing so with operating principles and a cost structure we would have if we were to be founded today.”\n\n\tLast fall Sinclair, the U.S.’s biggest local TV station group operator, made an unsolicited takeover offer for Scripps. The board of Scripps in December rejected the proposal. The hostile bid came as Nexstar Media Group agreed to acquire Tegna, in a $6 billion transaction that would run afoul of the FCC’s 39% ownership cap; Nexstar has filed for a waiver to the ownership cap.\n\n\tScripps is scheduled to release Q4 2025 earnings after market close on Feb. 25. The company reaffirmed the guidance it issued with its earnings results on Nov. 6.\n\n\tFor the third quarter of 2025, Scripps revenue fell 19% to $526 million, as revenue in its local TV group dropped 27% to $325 million. Net loss attributable to shareholders of $49 million (or 55 cents per share). That included a $7.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt, $6.5 million of financing transaction costs, a $1.4 million write-off of deferred financing costs and $2.7 million in restructuring costs.\n\n\tIn reporting Q3 results, Scripps said employee costs came down in both its Local Media and Scripps Networks divisions, and Symson said that “we’re seeing the ongoing effect of reductions in our Scripps News operations last fall.” For Q4, the company expects Local Media revenue to decline about 30% and Scripps Networks sales to be down in the “low double-digit percent range.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, Scripps expects 2026 financial performance to be bolstered by a “robust midterm election spending year,” as well as the Winter Olympics on its 11 NBC stations and the World Cup competitions in North America as well as its Scripps Sports partnerships, its networks distribution on connected TV and the results of accretive divestiture and acquisition activity.\n\n\tEarlier this week, Scripps announced a deal to sell Court TV to Law&Crime, the true-crime and legal content network led by Dan Abrams that is now owned by Jellysmack. Financial terms weren’t disclosed; the deal reportedly values Court TV at less than $125 million.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to its local TV stations, Scripps also operates national news outlet Scripps News and entertainment brands ION, ION Plus, ION Mystery, Bounce, Grit and Laff. It’s also known for being the longtime steward of the Scripps National Spelling Bee.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIs MAGA going woke? It’s a question Piers Morgan is currently floating as Trump’s fanbase continues to be outraged over Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl Halftime Show. While the left is often accused of being political snowflakes, Morgan sees MAGA’s complete meltdown over Bad Bunny to be more or less that.\n\n\t“President Trump and MAGA skillfully rode the post-woke wave as that whole joyless mindset came crashing down. The left had become the sneering, censorious ogres demanding puritanical fealty,” Morgan said on the Feb. 10 episode of “Piers Morgan Uncensored.” \n\t\n\n\t“Conservatives were the ones having a laugh, to quote JD Vance, as star athletes honored the Trump YMCA dance and a nation bathed in woke tears,” he continued. “Well, last year’s Super Bowl really proved the point. The ads were full of bros, burgers and bikinis. The new president got a standing ovation. But how quickly things can change. Of course, it’s difficult to maintain that renegade spirit when you’re actually in power. You have to make unpopular decisions. People realize that you can’t, in fact, please everybody all the time. And with a lot of the furious reaction to Bad Bunny’s spectacular and largely non-political halftime show at this year’s Super Bowl, it’s worth asking whether the culture is now shifting. Is MAGA becoming a bit thin-skinned, a bit sneering, a bit censorious, a bit—dare I suggest it—woke?”\n\n\n\tMorgan even challenged one of MAGA’s most outspoken voices, Megyn Kelly. He invited the former Fox News host onto his show the day after the Super Bowl, and she proceeded to go on a tirade against Bad Bunny.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m sorry, Piers, but to get up there and perform the whole show in Spanish is a middle finger to the rest of America,” Kelly said in hysterics. “Who gives a damn that we have 40 million Spanish speakers in the United States? We have 310 million who don’t speak a lick of Spanish… This is supposed to be a unifying event for the country, not for the Latinos, not for one small group, but for the country. We don’t need a Black national anthem. We don’t need a Spanish-speaking non-English performer. And we don’t need an ICE or America hater featured as our prime time entertainment.”\n\n\tMorgan fired back at Kelly that the USA actually does not have an official language, proving her point mute. This prompted Kelly to dramatically lambast Morgan’s home of Great Britain.\n\n\t“You ceded your culture to a bunch of radical Muslims who came in and took over and now it’s gone. We’re not allowing that here,” Kelly told Morgan. “Whether it’s Hispanic, whether it’s Muslim, it’s not happening in the United States of America. That’s why President Trump was elected. And whether it’s Bad Bunny, who is American but refuses to speak English in his performances, or anybody else, we have to keep the Super Bowl, which is a quintessential American event.”\n\n\tMAGA’s hatred of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime was fueled by Trump himself, who originally said it was “ridiculous” for the NFL to choose the artist as its big game performer. This resulted in Turning Point USA creating an alternative halftime show headlined by Kid Rock, viewership of which (6 million real time viewers on YouTube) paled in comparison to the 128.2 million viewers who watched Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl show. Trump took to social media during the big game’s second half to slam Bad Bunny.\n\n\t“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World. This ‘Show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Crime 101” is an underworld drama that’s clever and compelling in unusual ways. It’s got a couple of car chases through Los Angeles that feel grippingly unchoreographed, as if the drivers really were figuring out at the last moment where to turn next, yet it’s not an action movie. The central character, Davis (Chris Hemsworth), is a jewel thief who specializes in meticulously targeted robberies that you could definitely call heists, though the film doesn’t have the trap-door blitheness of a “heist thriller.” “Crime 101” includes crime aplenty, but at heart it’s a character study — or, rather, four character studies wound into one. Based on a novella by Don Winslow (“Savages”), the film is just moody and intricate enough to feel the-Michael-Mann-of-“Thief”-adjacent, but it’s really a portrait of lost souls working to keep their heads in a corrupt world. Maybe that’s why “Crime 101” plays like a bit of a head game, in a way that may not do it any favors at the box office.\n\t\n\n\tYet I was held by how the film lets its actors make their mark. In the elaborate opening sequence, Davis steals some hot diamonds from a local jeweler and his assistants, which involves stopping them in cars and getting lucky enough to just be missed by a bullet fired from an ancient faulty pistol. Hemsworth plays this for maximum cool, and he’s good enough at it that for 10 minutes or so we’re wondering if he should be the next James Bond.\n\n\n\tBut then Davis meets up with his boss, Money, played by Nick Nolte with an old man’s jagged rasp as dramatic as his wry middle-aged intensity used to be. And we notice a fascinating quality just beneath Hemsworth’s stoicism. His Davis, with short dark hair and a beard and a glint of dread in his eye, is edgy and preoccupied, maybe even a bit nervous. About what? He’s a ruthless operator, but he isn’t fully at home in the world, or in his own skin. And it’s that quality of barely submerged anxiety that makes this one of Hemsworth’s best performances, and keeps the film arrestingly off balance.\n\t\n\n\tDavis commits his robberies along the 101 freeway, and never harms anyone. That’s his pattern, and it’s one that Lou Lubesnick (Mark Ruffalo), a smart LAPD detective, has picked up on. But how to catch him? Ruffalo, doughy and unshaven, with an unfashionable mound of gray-black curls, plays Lou as the Last Honest Cop in L.A., and what’s notable is the form the corruption around him takes. The LAPD, as the movie portrays it, has become a corporation, and the pressure to close cases is like the pressure to close deals; it leads to solving crimes at any cost. Lou, the old-school knight, with his grizzled “irrelevant” integrity, is viewed by his colleagues as a loser, a perception we’re invited to share when his long-time girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) dumps him.\n\n\tHalle Berry, meanwhile, plays a winner trapped in the wrong industry. Her Sharon Coombs is a high-end insurance broker who hawks pricey policies to wealthy clients, sugaring her pitch with a hint of seduction. She’s been with her firm 11 years, but the old boys’ network keeps hedging on making her a partner. She has hit the glass ceiling with nowhere to turn, and Berry laces her vibrance with an undertow of anger that ripples into despair. That makes her a ripe partner for Davis, who needs a new source of potential marks, and also Lou, who she gets to know in yoga class. That Sharon is linked to both criminal and cop is one of those only-in-the-movies contrivances you just have to roll with. It’s a wobbly link, but Berry makes it emotionally credible.\n\n\tThe last major character is Ormon (Barry Keoghan), the thug hired by Nolte’s Money to terrorize his former protégé, and to make sure that any robbery ends with the money in the correct pocket (his). Keoghan plays most of his scenes hidden under a motorcycle helmet and biker’s jacket (much of the time, you can only see his eyes), and it’s a credit to the actor that his personality busts through anyway; it’s there in the brutish impatience of his movements.\n\n\tThe writer-director, Bart Layton, shoots L.A. with an expansive feel for its anonymous concrete nooks and crannies, and he takes his time (the movie runs two hours and 19 minutes), lingering on scenes like Davis’s first date with Maya (a charismatically sunny Monica Barbaro), who he meets when she backends his car, or Sharon’s encounters at the insurance office, a vipers’ nest where she’s starting to be overshadowed by a younger rival. What makes all of this work is that it’s the film’s way of coloring in the motivation for crime. Davis, raised as a foster child, is trying to construct an ordered world for himself. That’s why he’s such a cautious thief, controlled to a fault. He breaks with Money over the prospect of a Santa Barbara jewelry-store robbery he considers too risky — which doesn’t stop the loose-cannon Ormon from taking on the assignment and making a violent mess of it.\n\t\n\n\tIf the criminals in “Crime 101” are mostly more interesting than their crimes, the climactic robbery that unfolds in a suite of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel delivers the jolt of crazy danger we’ve been wanting. The scene is a layer cake of deception, with Davis impersonating the driver who has picked up the diamond carrier, and Lou impersonating the carrier (they have a great exchange about Steve McQueen), all building to a shootout designed to reveal the hidden core of every individual in the room. Taken as a thriller, “Crime 101” has its indulgences, but by the end it can stand as an advanced course in what underworld dreams are made of.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFour-time Oscar-nominated filmmaker Anthony McCarten will direct a political thriller set during the pivotal 1945 Potsdam Conference, with Guy Pearce, Jared Harris and Merab Ninidze leading the cast.\n\n\t“The Price of Peace” chronicles the historic meeting between President Harry S. Truman, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin as they negotiated the future of post-war Europe. SND is introducing the project to international buyers at the European Film Market.\n\t\n\n\tPrincipal photography is scheduled to commence in London and Potsdam during summer 2026, with delivery anticipated in 2027. The production reunites McCarten with historical subject matter following his work on “Darkest Hour,” “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “The Theory of Everything” and “The Two Popes.”\n\n\n\tPearce will portray Truman, Harris takes on Churchill, and Ninidze plays Stalin. The narrative centers on July 1945, as the three leaders converge with competing agendas: Truman seeking to end the Pacific War, Churchill facing domestic elections, and Stalin pursuing territorial expansion. Their negotiations would establish the foundation for decades of Cold War politics.\n\n\t“The Potsdam Conference represented a crucial turning point in world history – the moment when World War II transformed into the Cold War,” McCarten said. “This is not a biopic, but rather a political thriller where the stakes are frankly enormous.”\n\n\tRaccoon Features, Muse of Fire Productions, Salloway Studios and Spark Productions are producing in association with Ingara. SND serves as co-producer while handling international sales and French distribution. CAA Media Finance is co-repping U.S. rights alongside SND.\n\t\n\n\tJonathan Saubach and Philipp Klausing produce for Raccoon Features, Matthew Salloway for Salloway Studios, McCarten for Muse of Fire Productions and Eric Falkenstein for Spark Productions.\n\n\t“Working on ‘The Price of Peace’ with filmmaker Anthony McCarten is exactly where we want to be with Raccoon,” said Klausing. “Telling captivating stories with relevance and urgency to an audience around the world is why we do it in the first place.”\n\n\tRamy Nahas, director of international sales and distribution at SND, compared the project to “Darkest Hour” and “The King’s Speech,” noting McCarten’s “remarkable talent for injecting genuine suspense and emotional depth into well-known historical events.”\n\n\tRaccoon Features, based in Berlin and London, is currently in production on Peter Morgan’s “The Boys from Brazil” for Netflix, starring Jeremy Strong, Gillian Anderson and August Diehl.\n",

The note goes on, \"If they want the name of the individual involved then I want 1 Bitcoin to the following wallet. Time is more than relevant.\"\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          There is a legitimate bitcoin address in the note ... and it is a different address from the one in the original ransom note, received by TMZ and 2 Tucson TV news stations.\n      \n    \n          We have forwarded this note to the FBI.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          It's unclear if the sender of this note is legit, but interestingly, 1 bitcoin is worth about $66,000 right now. You'll recall law enforcement is currently offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Nancy's kidnappers.\n      \n    \n          This comes less than 24 hours after a flurry of activity in the case -- on Tuesday, the FBI released the first images of the armed individual who showed up on Nancy's doorstep early in the morning of Feb. 1, the day she was taken.\n      \n    \n          Then, in the evening, cops detained a person of interest ... a deliveryman who was pulled over in a Tucson suburb. After questioning him, though, law enforcement released the man, who told reporters he didn't even know who Nancy was.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Savannah Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Annie Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Camron Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie Case\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

It's essentially a Hail Mary attempt to find a resolution before their May 18 trial date.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    BACKGRID\n          \n    \n          As you know ... Blake filed a complaint against her \"It Ends With Us\" costar in December 2024, alleging he sexually harassed her while working on the film.\n      \n    \n          Since then, the clash has snowballed into one of the messiest Hollywood legal battles in recent memory, with discovery from the case pulling big-name stars like Taylor Swift and powerhouse production companies like Sony Pictures into the fray.\n      \n\n          Taylor will be called as a witness by Baldoni if the case goes to trial. We're told Taylor would be called as a hostile witness, meaning that because she clearly had a bias against Baldoni, his lawyer, Bryan Freedman, can really put her on the hot seat by asking leading questions.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The Grammy winner is friends with Blake, and the two texted at length about Baldoni.\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Baldoni countersued Lively, claiming he suffered $400 million in damages because she defamed him with her bogus allegations. But the lawsuit was dismissed when a judge ruled Baldoni didn't have the right to sue for defamation over accusations written in a legal filing.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Blake Lively\n              \n                          \n                Justin Baldoni\n              \n                          \n                Taylor Swift\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Fights & Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Now, with federal agents on the ground and a search underway near the border, the case appears to be intensifying.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          As we told you, the abductor was promising to return Nancy to Tucson within 12 hours of receiving the $6 million ransom ... which means they're currently somewhere within a roughly 700-mile radius of Tucson.\n      \n    \n          There were 2 ransom deadlines, both of which have passed ... even though Savannah tried reaching out to the kidnapper and even offered to pay up.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Tuesday afternoon we noticed activity for the first time in the Bitcoin account listed in the first ransom note that was sent.\n      \n    \n          This morning, the FBI released the first images of Nancy's apparent kidnapper ... and the feds blasted the footage out to the public on the same day they received the info.\n      \n    \n          Nancy has a pacemaker and needs daily medication. The feds have been offering a $50,000 reward \"for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance\" ... anyone with information is asked to contact 1-800-CALL-FBI or visit tips.fbi.gov.\n      \n      ",

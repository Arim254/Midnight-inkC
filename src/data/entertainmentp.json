    "body": "\n\tIn bonus footage from “A CNN & Variety Town Hall Event: Timothée Chalamet and Matthew McConaughey,” the two actors discussed how studios have begun catering to people who are using their phones while watching movies or TV shows. \n\n\t“In this day of shorter attention spans and vertical 12-second spots, are we losing the patience for Act 1?” McConaughey said. “Because it’s the first thing that gets cut. It’s the first thing a studio wants to get rid of. I’m seeing Act 2, more and more, start on freakin’ page 12 [of a script]. I’m seeing 10-part series where — bam! — Act 1’s over 32 minutes into the opening episode, and you’re off on the conflict right away. It feels abbreviated to me.”\n\t\n\n\tChalamet responded, “I saw an article about a Netflix production guideline — not for all movies, I don’t want to speak disparagingly, but — where they want their biggest action set pieces up front. The logic used to be: Save your big action set piece for the end of a movie. You save the fireworks for the end. But now they want something up front.”\n\n\n\tChalamet was referencing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck’s recent interview with Joe Rogan about their Netflix movie “The Rip,” where Damon revealed the streamer’s strategy for making action movies. “The standard way to make an action movie that we learned was, you usually have three set pieces. One in the first act, one in the second, one in the third,” Damon said. “You spend most of your money on that one in the third act. That’s your finale. And now they’re like, ‘Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay. And it wouldn’t be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they’re watching.’”\n\t\n\n\tBut Chalamet hasn’t lost hope. “I also think there’s sort of a reverse thing going on where people are desiring things that are more patient and that pull you in,” he said. “I just saw another article that says Gen Z is a bigger moviegoing audience than millennials. ‘Frankenstein’ was a hugely popular movie this year; I didn’t think that pacing was extraordinarily fast, but it pulled people in.”\n\n\t“Some people want to be entertained quickly,” Chalamet continued. “I’m really right in the middle, because I admire people [saying], ‘Hey, we gotta keep movie theaters alive. We gotta keep this genre alive.’ And another part of me feels like, if people want to see it — like “Barbie,” like “Oppenheimer” — they’re going to go see it and go out of their way to be loud and proud about it.”\n\n\tWith a laugh, he concluded: “I don’t want to be working in ballet or opera where it’s like, ‘Hey, keep this thing alive, even though no one cares about this anymore’ — all respect to the ballet and opera people out there.”\n\n\tWatch the extended version of “A CNN & Variety Town Hall Event: Timothée Chalamet and Matthew McConaughey” on Variety‘s YouTube channel or on the CNN app.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBusy Philipps has joined the upcoming CBS drama series “Cupertino” in a series regular role, Variety has learned. \n\n\tPhilipps joins the show alongside fellow cast members Mike Colter, Rachel Keller, Renee Elise Goldsberry, Ella Stiller, and Nik Dodani. The logline states that the show is “a David vs. Goliath legal drama set in the heart of Silicon Valley that follows a lawyer (Colter) who is being cheated out of his stock-options by his former employer, a tech start-up. Refusing to back down, he joins forces with another recently fired attorney (Keller) to represent those taken advantage of by the tech elite, and help them fight back in a high-stakes battle against the Goliaths controlling Silicon Valley.”\n\t\n\n\tPhilipps will star as Natalia, who is described as “the beautiful and delightfully blunt first wife of an AI Billionaire, who divorced her when she turned forty. Now Natalia wants revenge and agrees to finance Michael and Olivia’s start-up law firm in order to go after his and other AI businesses.”\n\n\n\tPhilipps broke out early in her career with roles in iconic shows like “Freaks and Geeks” and “Dawson’s Creek.” She has also starred in shows like “Cougar Town,” which ran for six seasons, and the critically-acclaimed comedy “Girls5Eva.” Her film credits include “Mean Girls: The Musical,” “I Feel Pretty,” and “The Gift.” She currently hosts the QVC+ talk show “Busy This Week” and previously hosted the E! talk show “Busy Tonight.” \n\n\tShe is repped by Range Media Partners and Gang Tyre. \n\n\t“Cupertino” hails from Robert and Michelle King, who will write, executive produce, and co-showrun the series under their King Size Productions banner. Robert will also direct the pilot, with Liz Glotzer also executive producing. The Kings are executive producing under their overall deal with CBS Studios. \n\t\n\n\t“Cupertino” was formally picked up to series at CBS in October 2025. The Kings originally set the show up for development at CBS in 2024, with the network then commissioning a full writers room and a 13-episode script order in 2025.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet and Matthew McConaughey came together for a one-of-a-kind town hall conversation hosted by Variety and CNN. The program, which aired Feb. 21 on CNN, is now available to stream on Variety‘s YouTube channel, along with bonus footage. \n\n\t“A CNN & Variety Town Hall Event: Timothée Chalamet and Matthew McConaughey,” which was filmed before a live audience of University of Texas at Austin’s students, marked a reunion for Chalamet and McConaughey, who played son and father in Christopher Nolan’s 2014 sci-fi epic “Interstellar.” \n\t\n\n\tIn the 90-minute conversation, the actors discussed their memories from “Interstellar,” Chalamet’s role in “Marty Supreme,” their approaches to acting and more. Chalamet and McConaughey also answered questions from audience members throughout the evening. \n\n\n\t“Man, that’s remains my favorite project I’ve ever been in,” Chalamet told McConaughey about “Interstellar.” “I think it’s your most fantastic role. I know you were coming off ‘Dallas Buyers Club,’ but that movie, to me, was the origin point in seeing how you carried yourself on set, how seriously you and Christopher Nolan took the work. It gave me a license. Coming out of high school, it’s hard to take yourself super seriously. You can feel like you’re wasting time or stuck-up or something. And I remember you had a yoga mat, and you’d be working out and sleeping on set. It was all very strange to me. But it was super inspiring. I just can’t thank you enough for being warm to me at that time, when you had no reason to be warm to me. Christopher as well. It just changed my life, man.”\n\t\n\n\tMcConaughey responded, “Thanks for that, man. You were pretty easy to be warm to. I remember you had what I felt like was a feverish curiosity at that time. You were figuring some stuff out, but it seemed obvious to me that no matter what you were dealing with, you were going to make your way. And I believe you were in some sort of limbo. You were choosing — something about music, and somebody was putting pressure about, ‘Maybe go this way,’ and you wanted to go this way.”\n\n\tAt one point, Chalamet shared new details about “Dune: Part Three,” which opens in theaters this December. He teased that the final film in Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi trilogy is the “eeriest one” and a “big swing.” \n\n\tChalamet later added, “I didn’t want to be complacent about a single moment. Everything was sacred, and it was my last time doing a ‘Dune’ film, so I really wanted to treat it as sacred. Because people can get complacent, but I was more intense on the third one. It felt like that was the natural momentum, so I wanted to push against that as hard as I could.”\n\n\tWatch “A CNN & Variety Town Hall Event: Timothée Chalamet and Matthew McConaughey” below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” introduces Gary De’Snake (voiced by Ke Huy Quan), a reptile whose home and community are destroyed by the evil machinations of the lynx family. His heroic actions — along with those of returning protagonists Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) —ultimately foil the villains.\n\n\tBut how do you make a pit viper empathetic? \n\n\tProduction designer Cory Loftis explains that Gary’s design evolved from being intentionally ambiguous — do we trust him? — to feeling instantly sympathetic. Initially, Gary’s eyes were placed more on the sides of his head. “But very quickly, the story started to evolve where it’s like, we want you to love this guy right out of the gate.\n\t\n\n\tSo we rotated his eyes to the front of his head so he could look right at you, and you could empathize with him straight away. We rounded his eyes out. We decided not to lose all of the reptileness, so we kept the long vertical pupils, but they’re softened a bit.”\n\n\n\tSnakes don’t have eyelids, so Gary’s eyes protrude from the top of his head “more like a frog than a snake,” Loftis says. “So it’s not pure snake anatomy, but we built this thick brow over the top that he could push down onto his eyes to make lid-type shapes.”\n\n\tAs for the village where the snakes once lived, art director Sang Jun Lee proposed that the houses be interconnected to convey a strong, close-knit community. This made their destruction — and the community’s separation — feel all the more devastating. Scale motifs appear throughout both exteriors and interiors. “We made sure the counter heights were all low, because they would sort of slither up to them,” Loftis notes. The tables are curved, with natural scoops for snakes to settle into.\n\t\n\n\t“We also ensured that all the handles on doors and cabinets could be wrapped by a snake’s tail, with pull handles on almost everything,” he says.\n\n\t“And we really tried to think about where they would sit. Chairs didn’t seem particularly useful, so there are lots of cushions and poufs for them to curl up on.” Loftis adds that some story artists contributed clever ideas as well, including ensuring that every area had a snake accessible ramp so characters could slide up without bumping over stairs.\n\n\t“There are slides everywhere so they can move around,” he says. “I have a very inventive art team. They really went to town on the mission and came up with some great ideas.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS – Zootopia 2 visual development artwork by Mac George III © Disney\n\t\n\n\n",

Per a press release, he’ll work closely with Fox leadership to “develop a strategic slate of scripted projects aligned with the studio’s creative priorities, including premium drama, elevated genre storytelling, and distinctive, creator-driven series with global appeal.”\n\t\n\n\t“Etan is an exceptional storyteller with a rare ability to blend emotional depth, sharp perspective, and commercial appeal,” said Hannah Pillemer, head of scripted at Fox Entertainment Studios. “He has built an impressive body of work across platforms and genres, and his voice, taste, and leadership make him an ideal partner as we continue to expand our premium scripted slate.”\n\n\n\tFrankel added, “I’m excited to be partnering with Fox Entertainment Studios at a moment when the studio is clearly investing in bold, creator-led storytelling.

    "body": "\n\tIn “Marty Supreme,” Timothée Chalamet plays the titular character, an underdog who is convinced that table tennis is his ticket to success. Set in 1952, Marty is a hustler working at a shoe store, where he pretends customers’ sizes are out of stock to upsell them on pricier pairs. On the side, he’s always looking for his next get-rich-quick scheme.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDirector Josh Safdie and Oscar-nominated cinematographer Darius Khondji brought the frenetic world of “Marty Supreme” to life. Khondji let Safdie’s script, which was co-written with Ronald Bronstein, guide him. No stranger to shooting period films, Khondji, who is nominated for an ASC award and an Academy Award for his work on the film, worked closely with production designer Jack Fisk, and was inspired by the photography of the era, particularly that of Helen Levitt.\n\t\n\n\t“Most of the conversation was that the greediness of New York was a big thing for us, that we wanted New York to look like it could have been at the time, in the ’50s, so I put haze in the streets [for] pollution. There is always a layer between the actor, and we photograph through these layers,” Khondji says.\n\n\n\tGwyneth Paltrow plays faded movie star Kay Stone, who’s wooed by Marty’s hustling ways. Thetwo first cross paths at the Ritz Hotel in London in a scene where Marty watches her regally enter the dining room as Khondji’s camera follows, gliding along with her. Shortly after, Marty calls her room.Khondji credits Safdie’s vision and ideas when it came to framing. “He’s the one coming up with this very modern, exciting idea that Gwyneth was going to be in a room, Timmy was going to be in a different room talking to each other, and shoot it at the same time, live.”\n\t\n\n\tTowards the end, Kay sees through Marty’s ways and has a frank conversation with him about his “dreams.” Khondji relied on a 360mm anamorphic Cinemascope lens to shoot not just that, but most of the film. Distance was important, and the 360mm lens could provide that. \n\n\t“Everything we shot was very observed. You wanted to observe them from a distance.” He filmed at the actor’s height to emphasize that. “We’re observing them, whether we’re behind or in the front, we’re really on their face,” he says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tUTA has added British actor Lox Pratt to its roster, representing him across all areas.\n\n\tPratt recently gained attention for his role as Jack Merridew in Jack Thorne’s four-part television series “Lord of the Flies,” the first-ever television adaptation of William Golding’s classic novel. The series follows a group of boys stranded on a deserted island whose attempts at self-governance quickly descend into conflict and disorder. Pratt plays Jack, the ambitious and unpredictable figure whose decisions drive much of the story’s tension. His performance has been noted for its range, focus and the maturity he brings to the role.\n\t\n\n\t“Lord of the Flies” premiered in February on BBC One in the U.K. and Stan in Australia, earning critical recognition for its performances and production. A U.S. release on Netflix is scheduled for later this year.\n\n\n\tPratt has continued to star in leading roles in major literary adaptations. He is currently filming HBO’s television adaptation of “Harry Potter,” where he plays Draco Malfoy, the cunning Slytherin student and central antagonist to Harry Potter at Hogwarts, a role originally portrayed by Tom Felton in the film series. He stars alongside Johnny Flynn as Lucius Malfoy. The series is expected to premiere in early 2027.\n\n\tBesides UTA, Pratt continues to be represented by Insight Management & Production, Public Eye Communications and Gang, Tyre, Ramer.\n\n\tUTA represents a wide range of actors, filmmakers and content creators across film, television and digital media. Pratt joins a roster that includes both established and emerging talent, expanding the agency’s presence in global television and film.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBeta Film has boarded as international distributor on a crime series about the death of King Ludwig II of Bavaria, whose Castle Neuschwanstein inspired Disney’s iconic castle logo.\n\n\tThe show is being produced by W&B Television, best known for “Pagan Peak,” “Dark” and “4 Blocks,” for German broadcaster ARD.\n\n\tThe series follows psychologist Gustav Zimmermann who is tasked with reviewing a psychiatric report on King Ludwig II, a document that will ultimately determine whether the king is declared incompetent to rule. The more he invests in discovering the reasons that led to Ludwig’s removal from power, the closer he gets to revealing the secrets of the king: his struggles with power, his longing for freedom and his forbidden love.\n\t\n\n\tBeta Film said: ” ‘Ludwig’ is a cinematic journey into the king’s fantastical world, rich with pomp and gold. Yet behind all the splendor and spectacle stood a deeply enigmatic man — as mysterious in life as he was in death. Set in the late 1800s in Bavaria, ‘Ludwig’ is a fascinating and tragic tale of life and queer love, infused with a captivating crime story at its heart.”\n\n\n\tFilming took place at historical locations, including Castle Neuschwanstein, one of the world’s most recognizable landmarks, and the former royal palace in the heart of Munich, the Residenz. Filming also took place in the Czech Republic.\n\n\tUp-and-coming talent Luis Pintsch (“22 Lengths”) stars as King Ludwig II, alongside Felix Mayr (“Unorthodox,” “Senna”), who plays psychologist Gustav Zimmermann, Aaron Friesz (“Corsage,” “Franz K.”), Carlotta Bähre (“Ku’damm 77”), Jonathan Kriener (“Chabos”), as well as Tom Wlaschiha (“Stranger Things,” “The Boat”), Francis Fulton-Smith (“Empire Oktoberfest”), and Karl Markovics (“The Counterfeiters,” “Babylon Berlin”).\n\t\n\n\t“Ludwig” is directed by Nina Vukovic (“Kleo 2”) and Sebastian Ko (“Tatort”), both also serve as writers. Head writers are Dominik Kempf and Marianne Wendt. Jan Prahl (“The Signal”) is the director of photography. Oliver Vogel, Quirin Berg, Max Wiedemann and Dominik Kempf serve as executive producers, Stefan Mütherich as co-executive producer, and Gretha Heisig as associate producer.\n\n\tFerdinand Dohna, head of content, Beta Film, said Ludwig was “a romantic dreamer with rock-star allure, who accepted no compromises when the realization of his visions and dreams was at stake, most notably Neuschwanstein Castle, which famously inspired Disney’s iconic castle logo. Like every good romantic hero, he failed in the end and died under mysterious circumstances at a young age. These are the ingredients for larger-than-life characters, brought to life in this miniseries by an outstanding creative team and magnetic cast that will resonate with audiences around the world.”\n\n\tOliver Vogel, managing director at W&B Television, said: “We all know Ludwig II as a fascinating artistic figure – melancholic, extravagant, withdrawn into a fantasy world far from reality. With ‘Ludwig,’ we are unravelling the old myths, approaching the person behind all these masks, and telling a visually powerful story about a queer life in a repressive era. Together with ARD, BR, Servus TV and SRF, we are bringing the real Ludwig back into the spotlight – vulnerable, contradictory, visionary.”\n\n\tChristoph Pellander, head of commissioning editors at ARD Degeto Film, said: “We are reimagining the tale of the legendary fairytale king as a fictional cold case that is reopened, shedding new light on his mysterious death. Thanks to the outstanding creative team in the writers’ room, directors Nina Vukovic and Sebastian Ko, and executive producers Oliver Vogel and Quirin Berg, this project combines history with modern suspense. Creating a high-end series that meets international standards is only possible by joining forces with great partners. I’m delighted to partner with Beta Film, BR, as well as ServusTV and SRF, on this exceptional series.”\n\n\tLudwig is produced by W&B Television for ARD Degeto, BR, ServusTV and SRF. The series is supported by the German Motion Picture Fund (GMPF), the Bavarian Film and Television Fund (FFF Bayern), with the support from the Czech Audiovisual Fund’s Production Incentive. Beta Film handles international sales.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar-nominated documentary, “The Perfect Neighbor,” will hold special screenings at Stanford University on Feb. 25 and Fordham University School of Law on March 4.\n\n\tDirected by Geeta Gandbhir, “The Perfect Neighbor” tells the story of a minor neighborhood dispute in Florida that escalated into deadly gun violence when Ajike Owens, a young Black mother of four, was shot and killed by her neighbor, Susan Lorincz. The documentary is made from police bodycam, ringcam, and cell phone footage, as well as recorded 911 calls.\n\t\n\n\tThe film highlights Florida’s Stand Your Ground laws, which allow individuals to use deadly force if they believe it necessary to prevent death or bodily harm, as invoked by Lorincz during her trial.\n\n\n\tStanford Law School will hold a screening and discussion with Gandbhir and producer Nikon Kwantu on Feb. 25 at 5 p.m. The event will be held in collaboration with the American Constitution Society, the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, Women of Stanford Law, and the Middle Eastern and South Asian Law Students Association.\n\n\tFordham Law School’s Center on Race, Law and Justice will hold a screening and Q&A with Gandbhir and producer Alisa Payne on March 4 at 5:30 p.m.\n\n\tLeading up to the 2023 shooting, Lorincz called 911 consistently over a two-year period, complaining that Owens’ children and other neighborhood children were making too much noise and playing on “her property.” In an interview with Variety, Gandbhir described the pace of the film as “a slow burn.”\n\n\t“You have these revelations that make you deeply uncomfortable throughout,” said the filmmaker. “It’s a horror film in many ways.”\n\t\n\n\tOriginally premiering at the Sundance Film Festival, “The Perfect Neighbor” was acquired by Netflix in February 2025 for a reported $5 million. The documentary debuted with 16.7 million views in its first three days on Netflix. \n",

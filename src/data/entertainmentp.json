    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures Television — Nonfiction is getting deeper into the U.K. market, signing a new overall deal with unscripted producers Simon Shalgosky and Daniel Brookes, whose credits include U.K.-based hits like “The X Factor,” “Love Island,” “Britain’s Got Talent” and “I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.”\n\n\tShalgosky and Brookes have launched a new banner, Rebel Minds Media, as part of their move to Sony. Sony Pictures Television – Nonfiction heads Eli Holzman and Aaron Saidman announced the overall deal on Monday.\n\t\n\n\t“Our search for wildly creative British format specialists led us to Simon and Daniel and we are thrilled to welcome them,” Holzman and Saidman said in a joint statement. “Sony continues to invest in best-in-class talent so we can develop and launch the hits of tomorrow for our partners and clients around the globe.”\n\n\n\tThe deal kicks off in 2026.\n\n\tShalgosky and Brookes’ credits across development and production include working for companies like ITV Studios, BBC Studios, Syco Entertainment, Keshet, Seven Studios, Lion Television and MGM Unscripted. \n\n\t“The opportunity to work with Eli and Aaron is one that we couldn’t turn down,” Shalgosky said in a statement. “They are the perfect collaborators who share our creative spirit and ambition to innovate bold new formats – each with personality and punch.”\n\n\tAdded Brookes: “We believe that a global approach is the key for launching original IP – and Sony gives us the scale to accelerate that mission, reaching more buyers and more markets than ever before. Rebel Minds Media will continue to rethink tradition with creatively daring formats built on strong conceptual hooks, distinctive visual identity, and a forward-thinking storytelling approach. This partnership lets us push our ideas further, faster.”\n\t\n\n\tThe duo’s other developing and producing credits include “Pooch Perfect,” “Eurovision,” “When Bowie Met Bolan,” “Adele at the BBC,” “Popstar to Operastar,” The BBC Music Awards, “La Banda,” “Come Date with Me,” “Britain’s Best Dish,” “Red or Black,” “Eggheads,” “Step Up to the Plate” and “Who Wants to be a Millionaire.”\n\n\tShalgosky and Brookes were previously based at BBC Studios, where they launched their previous label Rebel Rebel Pictures in 2023.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Sombr thinks back to the moment everything changed, it still feels surreal. Before the Grammy nomination, before the packed shows, and before “Back to Friends,” he was just another teenager making music alone in his bedroom. One of those songs, “Caroline,” produced entirely on his own in his parents’ house, would become the moment that set the rest of his career in motion.\n\n\t“I went to bed just a normal high school kid and I wake up the next day, it’s viral. Literally the next day,” Sombr told Variety in an episode of Behind the Song presented by TikTok. “Every record label is in my inbox.” Months earlier, he had been sending songs to labels with no responses at all. When he told his father what was happening, “he was like, ‘I don’t believe you.'” But it was real. Within days Sombr was on a plane to Los Angeles signing his first record deal.\n\t\n\n\tThe two and a half years that followed were steady; he built a small, loyal fanbase while searching for the song that would take him to the next level. “I had a small, consistent audience, but nothing was doing enough to recoup a record deal or make this career long-term,” he explained. “I kind of needed this and [I’m] really grateful that it happened when it happened.”\n\n\tHis song “Back to Friends” introduced a wider audience to his sound and earned him new industry attention, including a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. For Sombr, the song reflects a personal struggle: the tension of trying to maintain normalcy with someone he once shared deep intimacy with, while realizing he can’t simply act as if the past didn’t happen. “I think it’s a universal topic, but I think with the chorus, I found a unique way of saying it,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tWhat sets “Back to Friends” apart is how thoroughly he shaped the record himself. Sombr is the sole producer on the track and constructed it piece by piece, starting not with chords or lyrics but with rhythm. “When I start with a drum groove, I can set a vibe rather than set a chord progression,” he explained. Using a programmed loop in Addictive Drums, he built the song’s foundation and let inspiration spiral outward from there.\n\n\tHe added piano bass notes on his Yamaha upright, then built layers of background vocals by stacking simple “oohs” and harmonies. “Hearing one of them alone sounds so shit, but then when they’re all together, they sound so great,” he chuckled.\n\n\tVocally, he contrasts distortion-heavy verses with fuller, cleaner choruses. “It’s like yin and yang,” he explained. He prefers the verse vocal to feel strained, as though it’s pushing to break through: “I want it to sound so emotional, but the distortion is kind of like the vocals trying to cut through and escape.”\n\n\tAs the song builds, he brings in new elements to keep it evolving, adding a live drum kit in the second verse and weaving in more guitars and production flourishes. Near the end of the track, he created what he described as a “fake orchestra” made from layered vocals, piano, and synths. The song closes on a fade-out, a deliberate stylistic choice he thinks is due for a comeback. “I want to bring back fade outs,” he said. “I just want to give the listener a second to think about what they just heard.”\n\n\tLooking back, Sombr says he slept through the livestream announcing his Grammy nomination and woke up to a flood of messages. At the time he wrote the songs that eventually put him in the conversation, he was still playing modest club shows. “I was playing 200-cap clubs that weren’t selling out,” he said, a reality that made the idea of a Grammy nod feel improbable enough for him to wonder, “Why am I even expecting that to happen?”\n\n\tBut it did. And for an artist who started alone in his bedroom, “Back to Friends” is both a reminder of where he came from and a sign of where he’s headed.\n\n\tWatch Sombr’s episode of Variety’s Behind the Song above. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivalry” stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie recently spoke with Out Magazine about the intense chemistry that emerged during the audition process for the LGBTQ hockey romance series. \n\n\t“Hudson was the third actor that I read with,” recalled Storrie, who plays Ilya Rozanov, a Russian American player for the Boston Raiders. “The first two I was like, ‘OK, this is cool,’ and then Hudson came on. Jacob [Tierney] actually texted me directly and was like, ‘What do you think?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, Hudson, for sure.’ Instantly.”\n\t\n\n\tWilliams, who plays Montreal Metros pro Shane Hollander, added, “I read with one other possible Ilya, and it was good. But something about Connor… There was an inexplicable X-factor that just felt realer than what I thought it could possibly be. And that was something. I had a quote I told Jacob, at one point, about my read with Connor in particular.”\n\n\n\tWilliams couldn’t recall the exact quote he had said after a chemistry test with Storrie, so he turned to “Heated Rivalry” creator and showrunner Jacob Tierney to say it for him. \n\n\t“Hudson told me, ‘The other guy was good, but Connor felt like he was going to pin me down and fuck me,'” Tierney told Out Magazine, later adding, “That is literally what he said. And I was like, ‘Well, I think I cast this right.’”\n\n\tBased on Rachel Reid’s bestselling “Game Changers” series, “Heated Rivalry” follows the love story of rival hockey players Shane Hollander (Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Storrie). The cast also includes François Arnaud, Robbie G.K., Christina Chang, Dylan Walsh, Sophie Nélisse and Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova.\n\t\n\n\tThe six-episode show scored multiple international sales ahead of its Nov. 28 premiere on Crave in Canada, including to HBO Max in the U.S. and Australia, where it also debuted on Nov. 28. New episodes drop every Friday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tAfter selling a record-breaking more than three million units in the first four days of release, the Nintendo Switch 2 quickly sold out across the internet. And, a few months later for Cyber Monday, the new gaming console is back in stock and its discounted.\n\n\tAvailable for purchase at $449 (reg. $499.99), the Nintendo Switch 2 with “Mario Kart World” bundle is available at Walmart. While this doesn’t seem like the deepest of discounts, it’s actually this model of the console’s all-time lowest price ever for the bundle. You’re essentially getting “Mario Kart World” for free. And since Nintendo rarely puts their consoles on sale, this is a very good deal, indeed.\n\n\n\tYou can sign up for a Walmart+ 30-day free trial to take advantage of all that the subscription service has to offer, such as access to Paramount+ or Peacock; fast free shipping with no order minimum; in-store discounts at Walmart; savings at Burger King, access to exclusive shopping events — such as Deals for Days and Savings Week — and many more perks. Learn more about Walmart+ and its benefits here.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNintendo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCyber Monday Deals\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNintendo Switch 2 with ‘Mario Kart World’ Bundle\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t$449\n\n\n\t$499.99\n\n\n\t10% off\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tEven better, if you buy at Walmart, then you can simply go and pick up the Nintendo Switch 2 at your local retail location. This is one of the best ways to get the console in your hands sooner than later.\n\n\tUnlike the original Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 is bigger, better and smoother with a 7.9-inch display to play games at home on a big screen TV or on-the-go in handheld mode.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Nintendo just released new gaming bundles for the holiday season. The gaming company dropped a new Nintendo Switch 2 with “Pokemon Legends: Z-A” bundle, which is priced at $624.99 at Walmart. There’s also the 12-month Nintendo Switch Online available (a $19.88 value) for cloud gaming, online multiplayer, access to NES, SNES, Gameboy, Gameboy Advanced and Sega Genesis games and other perks.\n\n\n\tOn sale for $449 (reg. $499.99), the Nintendo Switch 2 with “Mario Kart World” bundle is available at Walmart.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDominic McLaughlin is taking over the role of Harry Potter in HBO’s series reboot and recently gave an interview on BBC’s “Saturday Mash-Up! Live” where he said “it was insane” to receive a personal letter from none other than Daniel Radcliffe, who played the boy wizard in Warner Bros.’ eight-movie franchise. Radcliffe revealed last month that he wrote words of encouragement to McLaughlin before HBO’s “Harry Potter” series started filming.\n\t\n\n\t“It was insane,” McLaughlin said about getting Radcliffe’s support. “My Dad tapped me on the train and just gave me this letter. I read it and then I got to the bottom, and it said, ‘Dan R.’ I was going mad, but I had to [keep cool]. I was on the train.”\n\n\n\tMcLaughlin added that filming on HBO’s “Harry Potter” series is “going amazing,” adding: “It’s going really well. I’ve made good friends with everyone, it’s great to be there.”\n\n\t Radcliffe said on “Good Morning America” in November that he wrote a letter to McLaughlin and got a “very sweet note back” from the young actor. McLaughlin is headlining the new “Harry Potter” opposite Alastair Stour as Ron and Arabella Stanton as Hermione.\n\n\t“I don’t want to be a specter in the life of these children but I just wanted to write to him to say, ‘I hope you have the best time, and an even better time than I did — I had a great time, but I hope you have an even better time,’” Radcliffe  said. “And I do, I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them. They just seem so young. I just look at them and say, ‘Oh, it’s crazy I was doing that at that age.’ But it’s also incredibly sweet and I hope they’re having a great time.”\n\t\n\n\tRupert Grint later told the BBC that he similarly rout a letter to Stout giving him his full blessing as the role of Ron Weasley gets passed down to a new actor.\n\n\t“I wrote him a letter before they started, passing the baton as it were,” Grint said. “It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience… It’s quite strange to have the cycle happening again. I’m really intrigued what it’s going to be like.”\n\n\tGrint acknowledged there’s “a bit of family resemblance” between himself and Stout, adding: “I think it’s great that it’s a whole new thing. It’s going to be its own thing, and I think that will be fun.”\n\n\tThe “Harry Potter” series is set to debut on HBO and HBO Max in 2027. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFremantle has acquired international distribution and production rights to “The Advent Calendar,” an original festive-themed dating format, where one single is on a quest to find love in time for Christmas by opening 24 doors of a larger-than-life Advent calendar.\n\n\tThe series, created by Canada’s Sphere Media in collaboration with Bell Media for Canadian streaming platform Crave, blends “the charm of holiday-movie magic with playful real-world dating,” Fremantle said.\n\t\n\n\tAcross 24 days in December, the hopeful romantic opens a new door each episode to unveil potential suitors and “enchanting” seasonal experiences, “embarking on a one-of-a-kind dating experience.” With every reveal, the singletons waiting behind each door are competing to win their heart by Christmas, all hoping to be the one invited home to meet their family.\n\n\n\tGuided by a “beloved” comedian and host – affectionately known as the “fairy godmother” – the players are taken on a variety of dates, complete with romantic twists and funny moments. On the final day, only one suitor can be chosen to receive an extra special gift, accompanying them to their family’s Christmas dinner.\n\n\tFilmed in a “fantasy-built world filled with festive decor,” the light-hearted series “makes the dream of a classic Christmas fairytale a reality,” Fremantle said.\n\n\tVasha Wallace, exec VP, global acquisitions and development, Fremantle, said, “We fell in love with ‘The Advent Calendar’ the moment we saw it – a supersized Christmas calendar guiding someone on their search for love is instantly iconic. It’s charming, imaginative and full of festive sparkle. Sphere Media have created something truly special, and we’re thrilled to be partnering with them again, following the success of ‘The House of Secrets,’ to bring this joyful Christmas dating format to audiences around the world.”\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking for Sphere Media, Renaud Chassé, president, French-language creation and production at Sphere, said, “We imagined ‘The Advent Calendar’ as a joyful and inventive Christmas story that renews the dating genre. Developed with Bell Media, the series embraces both playfulness and heart. Its early international momentum is truly exciting, and we are delighted to partner once again with Fremantle to share its festive charm with audiences around the world.”\n\n\t“The Advent Calendar” will air from Dec. 1 on Bell Media’s steaming platform, Crave, as daily episodes as well as primetime longer episodes until Christmas Eve.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhether or not #MomTok survives, at least we know Whitney will.\n\n\tWhitney Leavitt, best known for starring in the Hulu reality series “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,” has set her Broadway debut. She will play Roxie Hart in “Chicago” at the Ambassador Theatre for six weeks from Feb. 2 to March 15.\n\n\tThe news comes just after Leavitt’s recent finish as a semifinalist on Season 34 of “Dancing With the Stars.” Her run on the ABC dance series was hotly debated, with many considering her the most skilled contestant and speculating that the Nov. 13 release of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” Season 3 caused fans to vote against her. Despite being eliminated, she and her partner Mark Ballas recorded a version of the freestyle dance they hoped to perform in the finale, which was set to a mashup of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” and the theme song from “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.” Their taping of the dance was released alongside a lengthy interview on Alex Cooper’s podcast “Call Her Daddy,” which was recorded in collaboration with ABC.\n\t\n\n\tLeavitt has long been unabashed about her ambitions as a performer. She was absent for the first half of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” Season 3 and controversially revealed that she only returned to the series in order to have the opportunity to audition for “Dancing With the Stars,” also admitting that she attempted to negotiate a role in a scripted series in exchange for her appearance in “Secret Lives.” \n\n\n\t“Chicago” is the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. The book was written by Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse, with music by John Kander and lyrics by Ebb. Currently, Roxie is played by Kate Baldwin. The cast also includes Sophie Carmen-Jones as Velma Kelly, Tam Mutu as Billy Flynn, Alex Newell as Matron “Mama” Morton, Raymond Bokhour as Amos Hart and R. Lowe as Mary Sunshine. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWith Sophie Turner already confirmed to play Lara Croft, the other castmembers of Amazon Prime Video‘s upcoming “Tomb Raider” live-action series are slowly being assembled as production gears up to start in January. \n\n\tVariety has learned that Martin Bobb-Semple, the rising British star most recently seen in a recurring role on The CW’s “All American: Homecoming,” has joined the series, based on the iconic video game series. While details are under wraps, it’s understood to be as a series regular and a major role for the Londoner. \n\t\n\n\tAs previously reported, Phoebe Waller–Bridge will serve as creator, writer, and executive producer on the series, which has been in development at Prime Video since early 2023 and was officially greenlit in May 2024. Chad Hodge has also boarded the show as executive producer and co-showrunner alongside Waller-Bridge. Jonathan van Tulleken will serve as director and executive producer. Shooting is due to begin Jan. 19.\n\n\n\tBobb-Semple was most recently seen as the series regular, Orlando “Lando” Johnson, in “All American: Homecoming.” Starting as a recurring character, he was upped to a series lead in season 3. Before that, he starred in two seasons of Peacock’s “One of Us is Lying,” and was a series lead in “Free Reign” for Netflix. Starting from a young age, his first role was in London’s West End, before he trained at the famed Identity School of Acting. From there, he shortly booked his first TV role for the BBC. \n\n\tThe “Tomb Raider” series is executive produced by Crystal Dynamics; Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robins via Wells Street Productions; Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson of Story Kitchen; Michael Scheel; Hodge; van Tulleken; and Legendary Television. The series is produced by Story Kitchen, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios. Waller-Bridge is currently under an overall deal at Amazon MGM Studios.\n\t\n\n\tThe show was developed under a pact between Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios which comes via Story Kitchen’s first-look deal with the studio to develop additional “Tomb Raider” stories into series and films.\n\n\tBobb-Semple is repped by Identity Agency Group.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFifteen years after the debut of Starz‘s hit drama “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” creator Steven S. DeKnight is returning to the ancient Roman Republic to rewrite history with the sequel series, “Spartacus: House of Ashur.” In the original show and its subsequent chapters, Spartacus (portrayed by Andy Whitfield before his untimely death, and later by Liam McIntyre) killed the traitor Ashur (Nick E. Tarabay) on Mount Vesuvius. In “House of Ashur,” the former gladiator gets an alternative ending, one in which the arrogant Syrian lives. Instead of being killed, Ashur takes Spartacus’ life and is consequently rewarded for his treachery by the Roman Empire. A spectacular tale draped in violence and eroticism, this new series follows a man desperate to hold onto his newfound elite status while embarking on a quest for honor and glory.\n\t\n\n\tThe 10-episode first season (critics received five for review) opens in a dream sequence. Instead of meeting his demise, Ashur (Tarabay, reprising his role) turns against Spartacus to aid the Roman soldiers. For his efforts, he’s been given his own gladiator house and the patronage of his former master, Batiatus. Though Ashur is delighted with his newfound standing, which includes the company of his body slaves Hilara (Jamaica Vaughan) and Messia (Ivana Baquero ) as well as Korris (Graham McTavish), the Doctore in charge of training his gladiators, he is still the laughing stock among the elite, who accuse him of stabbing Sparcus in the back like a coward. \n\n\n\tThere is much to be gained for all under the banner of the House of Ashur, should it actually ascend. Ashur’s gladiators, especially the ambitious Tarchon (Jordi Webber) and Korris, are eager to bask in the notoriety, riches and freedoms a champion status would bring them. Unfortunately, Ashur’s idea to achieve this goal infuriates everyone. When their recent champion is massacred in the arena, Ashur and Korris head to the docks where the enslaved are held, looking for potential new fighters. There, Ashur finds himself distracted by a chained woman getting the best of the guards. Mesmerized by her agility and fearsomeness, Ashur purchases her, renaming her Achillia (Tenika Davis) and forcing Korris, much to his horror, to train her as a gladiatrix. It’s a role that Achillia is neither mentally nor physically prepared for. \n\t\n\n\tLike its predecessors, “Spartacus: House of Ashur” is absolutely bursting with sex and violence. These themes are so embedded in the series that they function as plot points in their own right. The amount of sex and nudity depicted will undoubtedly leave the most liberal-minded viewer blushing. Inside and outside of the gladiator arena, DeKnight highlights how brutal and volatile this world truly is. From slit throats to crushed skulls and disemboweled soldiers, human organs and guts are constantly on display here. However, a gruesome (but deserved) act at the end of Episode 2, “Forsaken,” is sure to shock the senses. \n\n\tMoreover, while the majority of the action centers on street fighting and the arenas, “Spartacus: House of Ashur” also peels back the treachery woven into the era’s politics. Though Ashur is presently thriving, everyone’s standing in Capua is precarious and likely to change at any moment. Ashur desperately works to win the favor of Senator Gabinius (Andrew McFarlane), despite the senator’s wife, Cossutia’s (Claudia Black), clear disdain for him. Yet, his efforts are constantly undermined, especially amid the arrival of Julius Caesar (Jackson Gallagher) and his treacherous wife, Cornelia (Jamie Slater), from Rome.\n\n\tOverall, “Spartacus: House of Ashur” is a dynamic follow-up to the previous chapters. A classic tale of the haves and have-nots in ancient Rome, where power means everything, DeKnight’s world is as enticing as ever. By offering Ashur this new life and anchoring his story to Achilla’s, the series brings two very unlikely figures to the forefront, showcasing the extremes to which they go to preserve their positions. It also highlights how viciously their adversaries will fight to ensure the traitor and the gladiatrix’s demise. \n\n\t“Spartacus: House of Ashur” premieres Dec. 5 on Starz with new episodes dropping weekly on Fridays.\n",

    "description": "\n\tBUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Back to Buenos Aires after a 2024 edition in Uruguay, Ventana Sur Rio de la Plata 2025 looks set to command the biggest in",
    "body": "\n\tBUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Back to Buenos Aires after a 2024 edition in Uruguay, Ventana Sur Rio de la Plata 2025 looks set to command the biggest industry attendance of any film-TV market in Latin America, with accreditations standing at a bullish 2,400 and counting on Thursday. The final delegate head count could be near to 3,000.\n\n\t“At this stage, registrations are excellent, slightly ahead of last year, which is a very positive sign with several hundred accredited participants coming from across Latin America and key international markets players and decision makers. Ventana Sur is definitely a central meeting point for business and project circulation in Latin America,” says the Cannes Marché du Film’s Guillaume Esmiol, Ventana Sur co-director. \n\t\n\n\t“The decision to alternate between Uruguay and Argentina has generated renewed interest and widened the market’s influence across the Río de la Plata region,” he adds.\n\n\n\tDelegates will find a new venue: central Buenos Aires’ Palacio Libertad, an imposing neo-classical white marble mole where Eva Perón once ran her Foundation. “It’s an emblematic space with better facilities for screenings, pitches and professional meetings,” says Esmiol.\n\n\tLaunched in 2009 by Cannes Festival-Marché du Film and Argentina’s INCAA state film-TV agency, joined from last year by Uruguay’s ACAU agency, Ventana Sur was first buoyed by bullishly building national cinemas across Latin America. Then it caught another tailwind a decade later by soaring peak TV. Now it’s another story. \n\n\t“These days, films cost double compared to before the pandemic and half the number of people go to theaters and streaming services pay less,” says Ventana Sur executive director Ralph Haiek.\n\t\n\n\tAll the more reason for Ventana Sur. “This challenge perfectly illustrates why markets like Ventana Sur are so essential. It remains a traditional market supporting international sales for theatrical releases (but also serving streamers),” notes Esmiol. \n\n\tUnspooling over Dec. 1-5, the major narrative of Ventana Sur looks set to be how companies are navigating this headwind, as well as dramatic and often exciting high-tech turbulence. \n\n\t10 takes on the 2025 Ventana Sur Río de la Plata: \n\n\tThe Pivot\n\n\tOnce, Ventana Sur’s crowning achievement was to have a film chosen for a major festival, sparking multiple territory deals if it played well at the event. \n\n\tThat can still happen, especially if a title is selected for Cannes. Oliver Laxe’s “Sirât,” a Cannes competition winner and one of this year’s most challenging and exciting movies, not only sparked rave reviews but sold pretty much worldwide. At Berlin, “Deaf” (“Sorda”), a first feature about challenged hearing impaired maternity, drew great reviews, won the Panorama Audience Award and proved one of Latido’s biggest 2025 sales drivers. Some sales agents’ exquisitely curated slates – Spain’s Bendita Film Sales lineup for instance – can still make a business out of acquiring true-arrow art films. But the stars have to align and such films are breakouts. Ever more,  sales agents are selling across a broad gamut of titles including genre fair, thrillers, animation and even comedies. That reality will be seen at Ventana Sur, as directors themselves essay genre mixes. Screenings or sneak peaks take in Catalan Fernando Trullols’ “Balandrau,” a real-facts-based snowstorm survival tragedy; Uruguayan Lucia Garibaldi’s Tribeca winner “A Bright Future” a touching sci-fi retro futuristic put-down of soul-destroying capitalism, and Argentine Santiago Esteves’ “The Reborn,” a propulsive action thriller take on how crime threatens bedrock family bonds.  \n\n\tRolling Out Abroad a Company Base\n\n\tAnother reaction, which will be seen at Ventana Sur. A decade ago, government support for film industries was pretty much assured in any major territory in Europe and Latin America. Asia worked much more like the U.S. Now, state support is much more volatile. So companies are spreading the risk, establishing beach-heads in other countries with easier access to soft moneys, whether tax incentives for shoots or straight subsidies, or both such as in Spain. Over the last year or so, Argentina’s Rei Pictures, Chile’s Clara Films and Peru’s Tondero have set up shot in Spain. Expect more to be announced at Ventana Sur or soon afterwards.  \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBefore the storm in ‘Balandrau,’ to be sneak-peeked at Ventana Sur\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGenre, a Ventana Sur Market Driver  \n\n\tGenre looks set to make a significant part of Ventana Sur’s market going. Some potential sales drivers: Gustavo Hernández’s Mórbido Fest winner “The Whisper,” a polished genre blender already sold to getting on to half the world off the AFM. Likewise “The Awakening,” also from Latido, a deep-jungle, mystical last film of the late Jaime Osorio (“The Squad”) from Rhayuela Films, is closing key markets. At Ventana Sur, there is large expectation around Lucila Las Heras’ long-awaited debut “El Muglur” and “The Braid,” from rated helmer Gonzalo Calzada (“Nocturna”), both in VS – Fantastic! Screenings. Fantastic! Lab frames new projects from “She Wolf” director Tamae Garateguy (“Match”), “Piacere,” co-directed by producer Ignacio Cucucovich, “Alijuna” from Gisberg Bermúdez at Anaga Media, whose partners include Elizabeth Avellán, and “The Escape” from Paul Urkijo whose folk-horror “The Night” was a major draw at October’s Sitges Festival.    \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘The Devil’s Well,’ in Ventana Sur’s Primer Corte work in progress competition\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBuzz Titles \n\n\tThere’s good word on “The Devil’s Well,” not genre but a water-shortage exposé, and also on climate change impact drama “Braided,” from Puerto Rico, and gender abuse tale “Low Lights,” all in Primer Corte/Copia Final which also frames the latest from Colombia’s Juan Carlos Arango, Dominican Natalia Cabral and Mexico’s Kenya Márquez. Ana Elena Tejera’s “Culebra Cut,” Theo Montoya’s “False Positive” and Roxana Stroe’s “Houses Are Silent” are potential standouts at project platform Proyecta, backed by the Marché and the San Sebastián Festival; Brazil’s “The March of the Sunflowers,” Chile’s “Anita Froggy” and Colombia’s “Noa” are likewise arresting projects at Ventana Sur Animation! The lineup for the dazzling high-tech Ibermedia Next 2.0 includes Sofía Carrillo’s stop motion “Insectario: Despertar,” potentially one of  the most exciting animation projects from anywhere in 2026. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Noa,’ from Colombia’s Diego Gaviria, in Animation!\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Good and Great in Market Terms at Ventana Sur\n\t\n\n\t“Ventana Sur” is a market, not a festival,” says Haeik. Its speakers in an intense conference strand will feature producers who have seen large market success. In VS Tech, Letitia Cristi and Matías Mosteirín at Argentina’s K&S Films will drill down on pioneering virtual VFX work on Netflix hit “The Eternaut”; Globalgate Ent. co-founder Paul Pressburger talks about financing Hispanic films in an age of reduced content budgets at  major streamers, a highly relevant issue; Maria Luisa Gutiérrez drills down on the “Bowfinger Method” behind not only the movies of Santiago Segura but also the 2024 mother of Spanish breakouts, ETA infiltrator edge-of-the-seat tale “Undercover.” \n\n\tThe Low-Down on High-Tech\n\n\tOnce, high-tech was for geeks. Now, for film and TV, it’s everybody’s business. Whether YouTube, in production VFX, Led walls, AI or Unreal Engine, new tech is game changing the industry, Mipcom underscored. In it biggest innovation, and in timely fashion, Ventana Sur will launch VS Tech, whose panels will discuss Argentine virtual production, the use of AI, and in one highlight, on Dec. 3, Humans + IA: In Action, 10 short films, some VR, made with AI by studios and filmmakers across Latin America. “What’s most exciting about Ventana Sur this year is the number 0f innovative contents from all over the region,” said Gisella Previtali, head of Acau, the Uruguayan film-TV agency.\n\n\tPlus Ça Change….\n\n\tAll Proyecta, Primer Corte and Copia Final projects and work-in-progress will benefit from expanded one-to-one professional matchmaking: personalized schedules with targeted decision-makers, an approach introduced last year that has proved extremely effective, says Esmiol. The film library will be powered by Cinando, allowing for additional online visibility. “What stays the same,” however, Esmiol adds, “is the core DNA of Ventana Sur: a curated selection of projects and work-in-progress with strong artistic identity and international commercial potential such as Proyecta, Primer Corte and Copia Final.”\n\n\tSpanish Screenings on Tour\n\n\tAt Ventana Sur in 2022, Rome’s MIA in 2023 and last year’s AFM, the Spanish Screening on Tour, an international platform organized this year by the Malaga Festival returns to Argentina for an intense near all-day event in Buenos Aires. Events weigh in as a succinct exposition in its panel subjects of many of the drivers these days of international business: New talent (next gen creators at Málaga Hack), theatrical success (María Luisa Gutiérrez), sales (Spain’s top sales agents sneak peeking clips of very recent and upcoming titles for 2026), co-production (a mano a mano between Gutierrez and Agustín Bossi at Buenos Aires’ Pampa Films, which has co-produced 2025’s top grossing local pics in Argentina (“Homo sapiens?”) and Mexico (“Mesa de Regalos”). Two presentations on IP protection (Francisco Menéndez) and development (Sydney Borjas) precede the traditional unveil at Ventana Sur of Málaga’s MAFF projects lineup. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHomo Sapiens? with the inefable Guillermo Francella,  Argentina’s top local box office hit in 2025\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Real Drama About Microdramas\n\n\tWhat do Colombinas watch most, linear TV, powered by telenovelas, or global streaming services, led by Netflix? The answer, Spanish analyst Geca announced at October’s Iberseries & Platino Industria, is neither. In viewing figures, both have been overtaken by microdramas. A Dec. 2 workshop will deliver a grounding in vertical formats. How can smaller companies cash in, however? “The challenge is the global competition. It’s not enough to create an App, you need to invest heavily in technology and acquisition and retention of users,” says Haeik. A Dec. 3 panel will feature trad production houses discussing their production strategies with microdramas.\n\n\tUruguay \n\n\t“A Bright Future,” from Lucía Garibaldi (“The Sharks”), won at Tribeca . Another Uruguayan, Daniel Hendler, opened San Sebastián with . Meanwhile, Cimarrón, Uruguay’s industry leader, has set up shop in Colombia. Though one of Latin America’s smallest nations, Uruguay will pack one of the biggest delegations at Ventana Sur, from any country in Latin America , made up of about 80 participants. That’s up on 2023, the last time Ventana Sur was in Buenos Aires, reflecting “how Uruguay has an active, growing presence in principal international markets,” says Gisella Previtali, head of ACAU, which also co-hosted Ventana Sur in Montevideo last year. “The experience strengthened professional networking, opened up new opportunities and enriched creative interchange,” she adds. Uruguay’s rise has two drivers: its international shoot scene and local subsidies which allowed Uruguay to make more films (29) last year than Chile (24).   \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t’27 Nights,’ with Daniel Hendler and  Marilú Marini Courtesy of the San Sebastián Festival\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoe Ekonen / Netflix\n\t\n\n\n",

If it's not, you know it ain't real.\n      \n    \n          Basically, now that the world's seen Diddy rocking his gray beard -- courtesy of our real videos and photos -- they're pumping those images into A.I. and posting 'em everywhere.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          In other words, prison Diddy's about to give Mr. Rogers, Tupac, and MLK Jr. a run for their A.I. money.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Juda Engelmayer, Diddy’s rep, addressed the whole A.I. issue, telling TMZ … \"Sean has always been warm and approachable with the people around him, no matter where he is. He treats his fans with kindness and respect, and he interacts with people who support him the same way he always has. It’s also disconcerting to see how frequently photos and videos of him inside a federal facility are being circulated. That's not right.

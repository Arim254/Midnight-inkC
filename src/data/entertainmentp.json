    "body": "\n\tWork stunk on the Anthony Bourdain biopic — and Antonio Banderas relished the experience. \n\n\t“We spent a month and a half filming in Cape Cod and Newport, constantly surrounded by the smell of fish,” he laughed. “Every time I came back to the hotel, I had to shower because I absolutely reeked — I was cleaning fish every single day!” \n\n\tSpeaking at the Torino Film Festival, Banderas shed new light on the Matt Johnson-directed, A24-produced “Tony,” which reimagines the chef-turned-globetrotter as an aimless young man. \n\t\n\n\t“After finishing university, [Bourdain] originally wanted to become a writer,” Banderas said. “But almost immediately, he began struggling with depression and drug addiction, so the film explores the very difficult early years of his life.” \n\n\n\tBanderas plays a Brazilian-born restaurateur who takes the young Tony — played by “The Holdovers” breakout Dominic Sessa — under his wing. “Through this relationship, Tony begins to truly learn how to cook,” he said. “So the film is not just about cuisine or culinary techniques; it’s about his life, his identity, and his way of being — shaped by this unique mentor.” \n\n\tWhile the real Bourdain began as a dishwasher at a restaurant run by Provincetown mainstay Ciro Cozzi, Banderas’ mentor is more of a composite character. He described the part as “a man from Brazil who works in the United States and has travelled the world.” \n\n\t“My character studied at the finest institutions, graduating from the best gastronomy schools, yet he always remained an outsider,” Banderas added. “He created his own restaurant outside the traditional world of elite chefs, developing his own dishes with ingredients accessible to ordinary communities — simple food for everyday people.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBanderas and Torino artistic director Giulio Base \n\t\n\n\n\n\tIndeed, Banderas placed great emphasis on mentors while in Turin to accept a lifetime achievement award — even describing his own career as the product of serendipitous encounters.\n\n\t“I am a theater actor,” he explained. “Cinema came by chance, thanks to Pedro Almodóvar — a ‘chance’ that led to 130 films, but still, it was chance. Theater was my first love, and for the past seven or eight years, I’ve returned to my home in Malaga and to my true home on the stage. My life has changed, and now I am finally doing what my life’s project was always meant to be.”\n\n\tActor Paul Newman — the subject of a 24-film retrospective at this year’s Torino Film Festival, and whose piercing blue eyes stare out from the festival poster — was another formative figure in Banderas’ life.\n\n\t“I worked for a year in New York doing a musical,” Banderas recalled. “One day I was on stage, singing, and at a certain point I saw Paul Newman with those eyes staring at me. I froze completely — it was incredibly powerful. We made a couple of films together, and I worked with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in ‘Philadelphia.’ He liked me, so we often went out to dinner in New York. He had this quirky habit: he would always ask for a very specific beer and tell the waiter, ‘In exactly 2 minutes and 45 seconds, please bring me another!’ I still think about that.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis weekend, the languishing box office has been changed for the better with “Wicked: For Good,” which powered to $226 million globally. \n\n\tThose ticket sales rank as the fourth-biggest worldwide debut of 2025, behind Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” remake ($341 million), “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($322 million) and “A Minecraft Movie” ($313 million) and ahead of “Superman” ($220 million) and “The Fantastic Four” ($218 million). \n\n\n\tUniversal’s cinematic take on the second half of “Wicked,” a revisionist look at “The Wizard of Oz,” has earned $76 million overseas and $150 million domestically. The film set a worldwide, international and North American record for the biggest Broadway adaptation, smashing the benchmark held by 2024’s “Wicked” with $164.2 million worldwide, $50.2 million internationally and $112.5 million domestically.\n\t\n\n\tSince “Wicked” is established I.P. this time around, “For Good” was able to grow its fanbase internationally. That’s important because the first film was much bigger in North America, accounting for 62% of revenues. “Wicked” became a global hit with $758 million, including $474 million domestically and $283 million overseas. However, the hope is that ticket sales are more evenly split for the second adventure. “For Good” opened in 78 markets, with the top-earning territories including the United Kingdom and Ireland ($24.4 million), Australia ($8.6 million) and Germany ($4.1 million).\n\n\t“This is a sensational opening,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “The only limitation, relatively speaking, is the series’ overseas performance. ‘The Wizard of Oz’ is a classic American story, with a natural domestic skew.”\n\t\n\n\tJon M. Chu directed “Wicked: For Good,” which concludes the journey of Elphaba — who begins the film having been demonized as the Wicked Witch of the West — and Glinda — who has been branded by Ozians as Glinda the Good. Although the second half of “Wicked” is darker than the first and doesn’t have as many memorable songs, “For Good” is expected to remain a draw throughout the holiday season. It’s been a rocky year at the box office — with big-budget bombs aplenty and overall ticket sales just barely ahead of 2024. However, this weekend’s momentum will continue as Disney’s “Zootopia 2” looks to assist “Wicked: For Good” in powering one of the biggest Thanksgivings on record.\n\n\t“Moviegoing is roaring back this weekend, and it will strengthen again with ‘Zootopia 2,'” says Gross, while noting that attendance remains seriously challenged. “These are tough times, with a few strong titles breaking through and even setting records.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is flying high at the box office.\n\n\tThe movie musical has collected $150 million in North America and $76 million overseas for a dazzling $226 million global tally. It’s a boon for theaters since attendance has been seriously lagging since the summer. It’s also a major win for Universal, which took a bold bet in splitting the popular stage show into two parts, both of which needed to become major blockbusters to justify the expensive gamble. “Wicked” became a four-quadrant hit with $758 million globally, setting the stage for the second film to achieve juggernaut status as well. \n\t\n\n\tJon M. Chu directed the PG-rated “Wicked: For Good,” which sees the return of Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh and Jonathan Bailey. The second half picks up as Elphaba is branded the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda has become a public figure who’s tasked with spreading good. Since the story overlaps with “The Wizard of Oz,” a number of familiar faces, including Dorothy Gale, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, make appearances down the Yellow Brick Road. Audiences seem to be “obsessulated” with “Wicked: For Good,” which earned the same “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls as the first. Positive word-of-mouth will be helpful for staying power over the holiday season.\n\n\n\tHere are all the records from opening weekend:\n\t\n\t\tGlobal\t\n\n\nBiggest global opening for a Broadway musical adaptation of all-time ahead of “Wicked” ($164.2 million)\nFourth-best Hollywood debut of 2025 behind Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” remake ($341 million), “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($322 million) and “A Minecraft Movie” ($313 million) and ahead of “Superman” ($220 million) and “The Fantastic Four” ($218 million)\nFifth-largest start for a musical of all-time behind 2019’s “The Lion King” remake ($433 million), “Moana 2” ($389 million), “Frozen 2” ($358.4 million) and 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast” remake ($357 million) and ahead of the “Aladdin” remake ($212 million)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDomestic\t\n\n\nBiggest domestic debut for a stage-to-screen adaptation above 2024’s “Wicked” ($112.5 million)\nSecond-highest grossing opening weekend of 2025, ahead of “Lilo & Stitch” ($146 million) and behind “A Minecraft Movie” ($162 million)\nSecond-largest start for Universal Pictures behind only 2015’s “Jurassic World” ($208.8 million)\nSecond-highest debut prior to Thanksgiving after “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” ($158 million)\nThird-best launch for any musical behind 2019’s “The Lion King” ($191 million) and 2017’s “Beauty and The Beast” ($174 million)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tInternational\t\n\n\nBiggest international for a Broadway adaptation above 2024’s “Wicked” ($50 million)\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\t“Wicked,” the stage musical, took its first bow 22 years ago. The novel it’s based on, “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,”",
    "body": "\n\t“Wicked,” the stage musical, took its first bow 22 years ago. The novel it’s based on, “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,” was published in 1995. All of that happened well before the #MeToo revolution. Yet in the years since that revolution kicked off (you can date it to the week of October 2017 when the Harvey Weinstein story broke), one of the many forms that the new feminist consciousness took was to seize upon stories of women from the past and “reframe” them, only now with a more enlightened understanding of everything those women accomplished (and the odds they were up against).\n\t\n\n\tWe might be talking about a rocket scientist like Dana Ulery, a politician like Shirley Chisholm, or Britney Spears. And “Wicked,” with an impish defiance that anticipated the #MeToo project of reconfiguring the sins of history, dared to place the Wicked Witch of the West in that hallowed company. It said: She has been misjudged, misunderstood, misportrayed. As a stage musical, and as a lavish two-part Hollywood movie, culminating in the newly released “Wicked: For Good,” that fuses confectionary psychedelic imagery with enough sisterly conflict and transcendence to make a lot of us swoon, “Wicked” presents itself as the backstory of “The Wizard of Oz.” But it also seems to be challenging “The Wizard of Oz,” peering at it from a 21st-century vantage point of feminine struggle and liberation. \n\n\n\tThere’s a reason that “The Wizard of Oz” is uniquely suited to that reverse-angle treatment. Certainly, it’s one of the most transporting movies ever made. Yet what is it about “The Wizard of Oz” that speaks to us with such mythological timelessness? We tend to think of it in terms of the film’s eye-popping imagery (no sci-fi movie, and no CGI, can match the cockeyed splendor of how the land of Oz looks), its etched-in-time performances, the barely suppressed freakishness of it all, the whole MGM-on-mushrooms backlot dream atmosphere, not to mention the singular incandescence of “Over the Rainbow.”\n\t\n\n\tBeneath its candified surface, though, what remains haunting about “The Wizard of Oz” is that the film unveils a surreal cosmology of topsy-turvy gender-role reversals. Simply put, it’s Hollywood’s first vision of the patriarchy…that dares to imagine a world after the patriarchy. And that’s why in “Wicked,” “The Wizard of Oz” proves to be so ripe for “reframing.” It’s a movie that reframes society — and reframes itself — even as you’re watching it.\n\n\tIn black-and-white dustbowl Kansas, the quintessence of the “ordinary” old America, Judy Garland’s pigtailed Dorothy lives on a farm with her Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, surrounded by eccentrics like the mean Miss Gulch and the quackish Professor Marvel. But when she lands in Oz, what she discovers isn’t just a land of chattery Munchkins and acid-head Technicolor décor. She discovers…a radically different power structure.\n\n\tTwo women loom large, like good and evil goddesses: Billie Burke’s aristocratic Glinda, arriving inside a giant soap bubble, and Margaret Hamilton’s hypnotically seething Wicked Witch of the West, one of the three or four ripest images of evil a Hollywood movie ever gave us. (What are the others? Offhand, I’d say Mr. Potter in “It’s a Wonderful Life” and Darth Vader.) These women rule the roost, setting the tone for what “The Wizard of Oz,” beneath its glowing colors and fairy-tale story, really is: Hollywood’s first radical vision of matriarchy.\n\n\tAnd here’s the sleight-of-hand trick of it all. The land of Oz doesn’t present itself as a matriarchy. The most powerful figure in the kingdom is a man: the Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Everyone drops his name in awed tones. The regal Glinda defers to him. Even the imperious Wicked Witch is intimidated by his power. So the land of Oz, in form, is a traditional patriarchy.\n\n\tExcept that it’s not. Because what we finally learn is that “the Wizard of Oz” doesn’t exist. That looming patriarchal monarch is an illusion, a hologram glimpsed through smoke and fire. Glinda and the Wicked Witch of the West really are the two most powerful figures in Oz. And as you look more closely at Margaret Hamilton’s extraordinary performance as the Wicked Witch, another level of this phantasmagorical landscape clicks into place, a kind of submerged reverie of identity.\n\t\n\n\tWhat is it about the Wicked Witch that’s so uniquely scary and mesmerizing? It’s that Hamilton invests her with a look and energy that fuses the masculine and the feminine. The movie is telling us, in a nightmare way, what is going to frighten people about matriarchy: the primal anxiety that women will subsume and replace men. That fear asserts itself in the homicidal gaze of Hamilton’s presence. The Wicked Witch’s dream mission is to murder femininity (“My pretty!”).\n\n\tBut this, in fact, is a perversion of what true matriarchy is. The more enlightened version is the one presented by Dorothy and her three friends: the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, all visions of men who have had their power taken away. Yet their love for Dorothy is real; that’s what their power becomes — the desire to transcend their goofball selves by protecting her.\n\n\tWhat this all adds up to is that “The Wizard of Oz,” in the guise of a 1930s Hollywood kitsch fantasy musical, is really presenting us with a hallucinatory, time-tripping vision of a future that is female — one where the old patriarchal rulers, like the Wizard, are façades waiting to be torn down, where the passion of women (good and evil) exerts far greater power, and where ordinary dudes, trying to make themselves better (by improving their brains, hearts, and valor), exist to serve and defend the transcendently soulful teenage heroine who has landed in their midst. In the end, of course, she does go back to Kansas. But by then she’s ready to rule.          \n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Glover, on Saturday, opened up to fans as to why he canceled his 2024 New World Tour.\n\n\tGlover, who performs under the stage name Childish Gambino, told fans during a performance at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw that it was a stroke that forced him to end his globe-spanning tour after just 18 shows.\n\n\t“I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana, and I did the show anyway. I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke,'” Glover explained, per clips shared on social media. “And the first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx.’ That’s really like the second thing. The first thing was like, ‘I’m letting everybody down.'”\n\t\n\n\tGlover added that not long after the stroke, he had another serious health scare when doctors discovered an irregularity in his heart.\n\n\n\t“They found a hole in my heart,” Glover said. “So I had this surgery, and then I had to have another surgery.”\n\n\tHe continued, “They say everybody has two lives, and the second life starts when you realize you have one. You should be living your life how you want. If we have to do this again, it can only get better.”\n\n\tBack in 2024, Glover released a since-deleted statement on X explaining his reason for canceling in more vague terms, sharing that he had an “ailment” that required “more tests” and a surgery.\n\n\t“I want nothing more than to bring this show to the fans and perform,” he wrote at the time. “Until then, thanks for love, privacy, and support.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked: For Good” costume designer Paul Tazewell knew Glinda’s wedding dress visually needed to reflect a woman completely embedded in the culture of Emerald City — someone who wants to impress.\n\n\t“She’s also very much in love with Fiyero,” Tazewell says.\n\n\tIn the “Wicked” conclusion, Glinda (Ariana Grande) has become a public figure, tasked with spreading goodness in Oz. She announces to her fellow Ozians that she’s engaged to be married to Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), which, of course, comes as a surprise to him. Unwillingly, he goes along with it.\n\t\n\n\tTheir grand Ozian wedding takes place in the Wizard’s Hall of Grandiosity within the Emerald City. Production designer Nathan Crowley transforms the city’s emerald tapestry, giving the bride circular trees that line the aisle. Gold butterflies flutter along the floor, creating a dreamy, yet natural, atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe wedding scene from “Wicked: For Good,” directed by Jon M. Chu. \n\t\n\n\n\n\tTazewell created a multi-layer dress made from organza and silk tulle. “The main dress is a silk satin, and it’s embellished with swirls of dimensional butterflies that run around the hem of the dress, as well as around the hem of the 25-meter-long veil that she wears,” he says. (For the record, that’s the width of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.)\n\n\tGlinda’s crystallized tiara is a collection of interlocking butterflies, too. “It is about the presentation of her coming into the Hall of Grandiosity, where she’s parting all these golden butterflies that are sitting on the aisle, and they fly up and become the atmosphere of her wedding dress,” he says. “It becomes this very theatrical moment.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAriana Grande as Glinda in “Wicked: For Good.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut the Ozian nuptials are quickly ruined when, simultaneously, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) discovers that the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) has been keeping the animals of Oz locked in cages under the grand hall. Elphaba is furious and unleashes her powers — freeing the animals and causing a stampede, which ends the wedding festivities abruptly.\n\n\tThe whole scene serves as a metaphor, cinematographer Alice Brooks explains. Glinda and Elphaba are descending stairs “to what becomes the consequence of their life,” she says. \n\n\tGlinda is in the middle of her fairy tale, and the color yellow symbolizes her intuition. “You see it when she selects the yellow brick road, and you see it at the very end of the movie when the Grimmerie opens up for her.”  In contrast, Brooks says, “Elphaba is descending into darkness, into what she does not understand or what has been happening in Oz.”\n\n\tBrooks adds that, at one point, director Jon M. Chu and editor Myron Kerstein — who “like to try everything,” she jokes — removed the intercut so that Glinda was given the full wedding experience and Elphaba was given her own separate moment.\n\n\tHowever, this change totally altered the feel of what was originally designed, these matching processions which were very symmetrical.\n\n\t“There was a whole debate about the fulfillment of the wedding and whether or not that wish fulfillment would be ruined if we’re intercutting with the secret prison,” Kerstein explains. “Balancing that took so much experimentation.” \n\n\tKerstein collaborated with fellow editor Tatiana S. Riegel to discuss their options. The key question was who to cut to as the wedding unravels after Elphaba stumbles upon the horrors of Oz directly beneath her. In the moments before the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) shows up and tries to reason with Elphaba, Kerstein was still trying to honor Glinda’s wish fulfillment. \n\n\t“We want to root for Glinda, who’s been wanting this her entire life — this wedding with Fiyero and the grandeur of the butterflies,” he says, explaining their dilemma. \n\n\tThen, when the animal stampede happens, Kerstein relies on supervising sound editor John Marquis. “I told John I wanted this to feel like [the 1975 film] ‘The Day of the Locust,’ where everything falls apart. Nothing comes back after this.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCynthia Erivo as Elphaba in “Wicked: For Good.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tChu says the decision to intercut between Ginda’s wedding and Elphaba’s discovery as “one of the best discoveries in editorial.”\n\n\t“We had shot some parallel shots, but I didn’t think necessarily that you could layer them on top of each other,” Chu says. “Plus, the note from the studio was: ‘Let the wedding play. You don’t have very many light moments in this movie. Why make the one light moment dark?’” \n\n\tPlus, audiences already know that’s coming. “We are ahead of this movie,” he adds.” Myron did an amazing job just smacking the two together and then finding the shots that match. The truth is in the dark; the lies are the light. It just made it more interesting.”\n\n\tThe riotous sequences ends on a close-up of Glinda.\n\n\t“She does the most wicked thing in the movie,” Brooks says. “You see her walk forward into this very tight close-up. You have the Wizard and Morrible in the background. We didn’t give Myron an option to cut to them. There’s no footage of them. It’s completely out of focus. In the background, you can hear them talking, but we just stayed with Glinda as you watch her make that decision. It’s the choice that changes everybody’s lives, right?”\n\n\tWhen producer Marc Platt — who launched the “Wicked” show on Broadway before overeeing the Universal movies — saw the final product and the filmmakers’ choice to juxtapose those moments, he told Chu, “What you guys did, that’s cinema.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAriana Grande and Cynthia Erivo penned their last goodbyes to the Land of Oz on Friday, following the release of “Wicked: For Good” in theaters over the weekend.\n\n\tBoth actresses posted emotional tributes and behind-the-scenes moments on social media, bidding farewell to their beloved characters, Glinda and Elphaba, from Jon M. Chu’s movie musical.\n\n\tGrande posted a series of unseen moments while on set, including her arriving at her trailer, transforming into Glinda and examining her pink gowns.\n\t\n\n\t“Thank you, my sweet Glinda, for everything,” Grande wrote on Instagram. “I will love you always … ‘Wicked: For Good’ is out now.”\n\n\n\n\tErivo celebrated her character Elphaba in a lengthy Instagram post, which also featured a series of behind-the-scenes moments. She shared images of her soaring on Elphaba’s broomstick, walking down the yellow brick road, standing outside her trailer and posing with many of her co-stars.\n\n\t“I could write you an essay, a poem, Shakespearean prose, to describe what this journey has meant to me, what lessons this time has taught me, bought me,” Erivo captioned her post. “I could try to give a metric to the love I have felt and experienced. I could give a number to the stories I have heard. The truth is the numbers are too small and the words are not enough. So I’ll simply say this.”\n\n\tShe continued, “Take my hand and walk with me to the end of this road paved with gold, and hopefully, the things that I’ve found might find you too. Thank you for letting me be your Elphaba. All my love, C.”\n\t\n\n\n\tIn addition to their shared posts, the official “Wicked” account also paid tribute to Glinda and Elphaba by sharing a video montage of Grande and Erivo hugging and dancing while on the set of “Wicked: For Good” with the caption, “A friendship that changed us for good.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBAFTA Breakthrough Fellow Sindhu Sreenivasa Murthy is set to direct “Teacher’s Pet,” a coming-of-age comedy set in an all-girls Catholic boarding school in India. \n\n\tThe project is being presented at the WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI).\n\n\t“Jubilee” (Prime Video) and “Black Warrant” (Netflix) filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane is on board as executive producer with his Andolan Films. Based on a script by Shuchi Dwivedi, the film is being produced by Aishwarya Sonar’s Lambe Log Productions and Dwivedi’s Small Town Gurl Productions.\n\t\n\n\t“Teacher’s Pet” follows Rinky, an overachiever determined to become head girl of her school, until her ambitions are derailed when she finds herself pitted against her former best friend. What begins as a rivalry spirals into a chaotic, heartfelt journey through adolescent identity, friendship, and the universal awkwardness of growing up.\n\n\n\tThe project is driven by a creative team working at the India-U.S. intersection. Having spent their own teenage years searching for themselves in coming-of-age stories centred on white protagonists, the filmmakers are determined to broaden the narrative landscape. \n\n\t“We are committed to telling Indian stories for the world. ‘Teacher’s Pet’ lets us do exactly that, as we explore the chaos of teenage life. We grew up searching for ourselves in coming-of-age stories about white girls. With this, we’re working towards being part of that change, not just for representation’s sake, but also to showcase the vibrant universe of Indian comedies, which are rare on global screens,” says Aishwarya Sonar whose recent work includes short films “Yakshi” (starring Babil Khan and Anna Ben) and “Hema” (starring Rajshri Deshpande) under her production company, Lambe Log Productions.\n\t\n\n\tFinancing is being raised through private equity, international co-production partners, and non-recoupable grants. The team has already secured a commitment of $200,000 and is in active discussions with new investors and production companies.\n\n\tThe script was developed during Dwivedi’s time at AFI and since has been shortlisted for Mubi’s Cannes W Scripted programme, was a semi-finalist at the Emerging Screenwriters Comedy Competition, and won the IFFLA Pitch Competition in 2024. The project has also participated in Tasveer’s Producers Lab and has been showcased at markets including IFFLA, CineV, and now part of the Co-Production Market at WAVES Film Bazaar 2025.\n\n\tCasting is currently underway, with production planned for December 2026 in Madhya Pradesh, India. Murthy has previously directed the Kannada language feature “Aachar & Co.” and the documentary series “Jeevalahari” (Doordarshan). Her latest Kannada-language feature “13 Days,” is currently in post-production.\n\n\t“We’re positioned to deliver: our director sold her debut to Amazon Studios, and our EP is behind many successful Indian titles; we’re now seeking global partners to help bring this story to screens worldwide,” adds Sonar.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGlinda and Elphaba remain “very very popular” at the box office.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good,” Universal’s rendition of Act Two of the musical sensation, was No. 1 with $150 million from 4,115 North American theaters in its opening weekend. The film set a record for Broadway adaptations, shattering the debut of 2024’s “Wicked,” which previously held the benchmark with $112.5 million over the same pre-Thanksgiving frame. These ticket sales also rank as the year’s second-biggest opening behind April’s “A Minecraft Movie” ($162 million) but above May’s “Lilo & Stitch” remake ($146 million).\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” collected an additional $76 million at the international box office, bringing its global total to $226 million. It marks the biggest overseas and global opening for a stage musical adaptation, also overtaking its predecessor, “Wicked,” which debuted to $50.2 million internationally and $164.2 million globally. The second installment grew its audience overseas, which is important because the first film had overindexed in North America.\n\n\n\t“This is broad-appealing Hollywood filmmaking at its best,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “Strong word-of-mouth is going to drive business through the Thanksgiving Holiday and into December. This is a smash.”\n\n\tAlthough the second half of “Wicked” is much darker than the stage show’s fizzy first act, audiences — 71% of which were female — remained charmed by “For Good.” The film landed an “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, the same as the first installment. Directed by Jon M. Chu, “Wicked: For Good” has been billed as the must-see conclusion to Elphaba and Glinda’s epic journey down the Yellow Brick Road. This entry picks up as the Wizard and Madame Morrible attempt to turn all of Oz against the newly branded Wicked Witch of the West (Cynthia Erivo). Meanwhile, Elphaba’s perky, pink-loving BFF embraces her public persona as Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande). Like the initial adaptation, goodwill toward the musical property and the catchy soundtrack are likely to drive repeat business through the rest of the year.\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is providing a necessary lift to the box office, which has been languishing in recent weeks without a major blockbuster to boost attendance. Although two upcoming releases, Disney’s “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” will help to end the year on a high note, overall domestic grosses are expected to remain just 3% ahead of 2024 by the time the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve. That doesn’t seem so bad, except that grosses last year were nearly 24% behind pre-pandemic times.\n\n\t“This overperformance by ‘Wicked: For Good’ sets up a very strong home stretch for the industry,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian. “‘Wicked: For Good’ will inject much-needed momentum into the marketplace, and that will continue all the way through the holidays.”\n\n\tAs “Wicked: For Good” loomed over the domestic box office, two fellow new releases, Sony’s bloody, R-rated action thriller “Sisu: Road to Revenge” and Searchlight’s dramedy “Rental Family,” fizzled in their respective debuts.\n\n\t“Rental Family,” starring Brendan Fraser as a lonely, struggling actor who lands the not-so-plum job of playing stand-in roles for strangers in Japan, opened in fifth place with $3.3 million from 1,925 cinemas. Reviews and audience scores are strong (an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes and “A” grade on CinemaScore), which could help the film stick around over the holiday season.\n\n\t“Sisu 2” landed at No. 6 with $2.6 million from 2,222 theaters, behind already soft estimates of $3 million. Those ticket sales are behind the prior installment, 2022’s “Sisu,” which ignited to $3.3 million before tapping out with $7 million domestically and $14 million globally. \n\n\tHoldover titles, including “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” “Predator: Badlands” and “The Running Man,” rounded out the top five.\n\n\tSecond place went to “Now You See Me 3,” which added $9.1 million in its second weekend of release, a 56% drop from its debut. Lionsgate’s illusionist adventure has amassed $36.8 million domestically. The film, which cost $90 million to produce, has been a much bigger hit overseas with $109 million for a global tally of $146 million. A fourth installment is already in the works.\n\n\t“Predator: Badlands” was No. 3 with $6.5 million in its third weekend, while “The Running Man” wasn’t far behind in fourth place with $6.1 million in its sophomore outing. Both are big-budget tentpoles that will struggle to recoup their budgets since theater owners get to keep half of ticket sales. “Badlands,” which cost $105 million, has earned $76 million domestically and $159.6 million globally. “The Running Man,” which carries a $110 million price tag, has generated just $27 million in North America and $48.3 million worldwide. Better keep running, man. \n",

Now that the Season 2 plot threads have been teased, let’s jump into the second episode.\n\t\n\n\nRight off the bat: Are these the craziest lyrics we’ve ever heard from a song on a Taylor Sheridan show? “If there ever come a time I got rabies / You’re high on my bitin’ list.” Tyler Childers is great, but this took me by surprise!\nWhy is Cooper so shaken up? He effectively won the lottery, and his dad is the titular landman. Ask for some help with paperwork and you’re set, dude.\nAlso, I get Ariana (Paulina Chavez) being triggered, but it’s only been a few days of a life-changing week for your partner that will benefit you, too. Just roll with it…he’ll be OK!\nWait, she’s breaking up with him over this? This communication blip is such a solvable problem! All of Ariana’s points are valid, but solutions could be ironed out in 45 minutes or so, especially now that they have money.\nOK, now that both T.L. (Sam Elliott) and Tommy have talked trash about the now-departed matriarch of their family, I’m dying to know what she actually did to fall out with them.\nLove Tommy arguing with the radio DJs as if they’re sitting in his truck with him.\nAlso, it’s amazing that Tommy’s phone lights up with a picture of Angela mid-screaming and a spooky ringtone every time she calls.\nUh oh, this missing $400 million is going to be an issue. Too bad the only person who knows where it is, Monty (Jon Hamm), is dead.\nRebecca (Kayla Wallace) putting Nate (Colm Feore) in his place felt great. Shut up, nerd — she can negotiate a contract to drill on the damn moon!\nAngela getting Nate’s name wrong several times is a great gag. To be fair, he does look like a Neil!\nCooper is maybe the dumbest person on the planet. I understand wanting to control your legacy, but HIS DAD IS THE LANDMAN! Have him look at the contract!\nWow! Who knew that Tommy would have pretty good advice about Ariana’s situation and how Cooper should listen to her?\nWould love a spinoff of the tipsy, farty horndogs at the old folks home.\nWhen it comes to Angela and Ainsley vs. the THHSC, I’m firmly Team Norris. They were hanging out with the elderly…that’s a nice thing!\nIf I ever need a lawyer, please let them be as ruthless as Rebecca.\nAs expected, it seems like the skeletons in Monty’s closet will haunt everyone this season.\nIs there any situation in which Sheriff Walt (Mark Collie) wouldn’t just do what Tommy told him to do over FaceTime?\n“Oh, that was just me purging my grief” was an excellently delivered deadpan from Thornton.\nAnother heartbreaking performance from Elliott. Calling it now: Give him some awards attention!\n“I wasn’t raised to father a son.” Damn, Tommy is getting introspective!\nWow, Tommy’s upbringing was a nightmare.\nCooper’s moment telling Tommy he loved him and his best was good enough… instant tears! A great emotional beat. Also love Thornton’s acting while Tommy is trying not to cry.\nWhat are the odds that Cooper’s new business partner is Gallino (Andy Garcia)?\n\n\n\n\tUntil next time, feel free to debate if Gallino will eventually kidnap Cooper and put a sack over his head in the comments below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOasis Honor Stone Roses Bassist ‘Mani’ With ‘Live Forever’ and ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Star’ in Brazil\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow Oak Affects the Flavor of Wine\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNCAA Rescinds Rule to Allow Betting on Pro Sports Amid Reckoning\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

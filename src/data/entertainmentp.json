    "body": "\n\tThe premium streaming market in Southeast Asia gained significant momentum in 2025, powered by a resurgence in account growth, expanded connected TV adoption and a landmark year for locally produced programming, new data from Media Partners Asia and its measurement platform AMPD shows.\n\n\tPaid streaming accounts across the region increased 19% year-over-year to exceed 61 million across Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore in 2025. Indonesia dominated new account additions and consumed the largest portion of total watch time, while Thailand and the Philippines contributed consistent incremental expansion. In Malaysia and Singapore, where markets have reached saturation, operators focused on boosting user activity and revenue generation rather than adding subscribers.\n\t\n\n\tSoutheast Asian viewers consumed 4.2 billion hours of premium streaming content in the final quarter of 2025, up 8% from the previous quarter. Netflix‘s regional viewing jumped 14% while iQIYI climbed 10%, though Indonesian service Vidio posted the sharpest increase at 24%.\n\n\n\tIndonesia’s streaming subscriber base expanded to 26.9 million accounts, with Netflix, Vidio, Viu and iQIYI all contributing to the gains. The market reached a historic milestone in Q4 2025 as Indonesian productions equaled Korean programming in viewership share at 30% each, while both content types reached nearly identical portions of the user base at 47-48%. Several Indonesian originals placed among the quarter’s top-performing titles, led predominantly by Vidio’s content lineup, demonstrating how homegrown productions are becoming commercially viable drivers of subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\t\n\n\t“Korean content continued to anchor reach across Southeast Asia in 2025, but local originals are now playing a far more central role in driving both acquisition and engagement,” said Dhivya T, lead analyst and head of insights at MPA and AMPD. “Indonesia stood out this year, with local titles competing directly with Korean dramas at the top of the premium VOD rankings. This is a meaningful shift that reflects improving content quality, stronger distribution and rising audience confidence in local storytelling. Thai content also demonstrated strong cross-border travelability, while Chinese dramas remained a key engagement driver on freemium and hybrid platforms across multiple markets.”\n\n\tNetflix held its position as the region’s dominant streaming service across all key metrics including subscriber count, monthly active users and total watch time. The platform’s strength came from its combination of global hit franchises, major Korean series and locally acquired content from Indonesia and Thailand. Viu claimed the second spot regionally in subscribers, MAUs and user engagement for 2025, benefiting from consistent appetite for Korean dramas alongside targeted local productions. \n\n\tVidio led among Indonesian local platforms in both subscribers and monthly active users while placing second to Netflix in watch time and revenue generation. The service recorded the region’s second-highest streaming hours in Q4 trailing only Netflix, propelled by an expanding library of Indonesian originals and sports programming. iQIYI regained subscriber and viewership momentum in the latter half of 2025, especially in Indonesia and Thailand, driven by full-length Chinese dramas, live-action productions, Chinese short-form dramas and Thai series.\n\n\tThai productions achieved the strongest international reach within Southeast Asia, drawing 11.1 million viewers from outside Thailand’s borders. This performance stemmed largely from Netflix-licensed and Netflix-produced horror films and series.\n\n\tAMPD’s expansion of connected TV tracking beginning in Q2 2025 uncovered a substantial shift in how Southeast Asian audiences consume streaming content. Although mobile devices continue to serve as the dominant viewing platform, connected TVs now account for an increasing portion of total watch hours, longer individual viewing sessions, and greater interaction with episodic series, feature films, sports broadcasts and content watched by multiple household members. The growth in connected TV usage proved most dramatic in Indonesia and the Philippines, highlighting how living room viewing on large screens is becoming central to the streaming category’s evolution.\n\t\n\n\tIndustry concentration intensified as three to four platforms captured roughly 70% of subscriptions and viewing activity across markets, indicating the sector is consolidating around a small group of leading services.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department announced on X Tuesday night that it, in collaboration with the FBI, has detained a person for questioning in connection with the disappearance of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie‘s 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie.\n\n\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department said the person was detained south of Tucson, Ariz. during a traffic stop. Authorities told ABC that law enforcement is preparing to search a location in relation to the detainee. There was no indication whether the detainee was the individual in the front door photos released on Tuesday morning.\n\t\n\n\tNancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared from her Arizona home on Jan. 31, triggering an intensive investigation that has brought “Today” show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie’s personal tragedy into the public eye.\n\n\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Office declared the disappearance a crime on Feb. 2 after investigators discovered “concerning” evidence at Nancy’s home. Sheriff Chris Nanos said he believed Nancy “did not leave on her own.” Authorities have not identified any suspects, and they received an alleged ransom note with deadlines set for Friday, Feb. 6, and Monday, Feb. 9.\n\n\tSavannah shared a message Monday on Instagram as the search for her missing mother entered its second week. “We’re at an hour of desperation,” she said in the video message.\n\n\tFormer co-anchor Hoda Kotb also returned to the “Today” show on Monday, filling in alongside Craig Melvin while Savannah remained with her family in Arizona. “We are a family, and we show up for each other,” Kotb said during the broadcast.\n\t\n\n\tThe FBI offered a $50,000 reward Thursday for information leading to Nancy’s recovery “and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.” FBI Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke said agents are “working day and night” with local authorities.\n\n\tOn Saturday, the Guthrie siblings posted another video expressing their willingness to pay a ransom. “We received your message, and we understand,” Savannah said, sitting beside by siblings Camron and Annie. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”\n\n\tThis followed an emotional video shared to Instagram on Wednesday in which the siblings pleaded for proof of life. “She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile,” Savannah said. “We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoh Films Germany is returning to India for its first local production since “The Lunchbox” (2013), partnering with First Ray Films India on noir thriller “But First, The Burning.”\n\n\tThe film will be directed by Indian filmmaker Devashish Makhija and star Anshuman Jha. France’s En Compagnie des Lamas (“Manto”), led by Sandrine Brauer, is confirmed to join as French producer. Details will be finalised at the Berlin European Film Market. \n\t\n\n\t“But First, The Burning” follows two brothers sharing one identity in a desperate town, where a small deceit meant to double their chances at survival spirals into a deadly game of secrets with only one survivor.\n\n\n\tMakhija’s internationally recognized filmography includes “Joram,” “Bhonsle” and “Ajji.” His Netflix thriller “Gandhari” is due this year. Jha has built a diverse career across projects including “Love Sex Aur Dhokha,” “Chauranga” and “Lakadbaggha.” \n\n\tThe film is scheduled to begin production in October, following the release of Jha’s action sequel “Lakadbaggha 2.” Jha will represent the film in Berlin as leading actor and executive producer.\n\n\t“Integrity. Conviction. And unadulterated vision – is the basis of this partnership,” Jha said. “We are thrilled to have Roh and Lamas on board for this film which would mark our seventh production. And probably the most ambitious one with one of my favorite cinema makers in India – Devashish.”\n\n\tBenny Drechsel of Roh Films Germany said: “I really think that ‘But First, The Burning’ is probably the most compelling script from India since ‘The Lunchbox.'”\n\n\tSandrine Brauer of Lamas added: “I’m very proud to join forces with the creative duo formed by Anshuman and Devashish. Their film casts a lucid, uncompromising, yet deeply necessary light on the spiral of violence. Devashish’s previous films already reveal a distinctive and promising voice, with a rare ability to take us on powerful and compelling cinematic journeys.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show — or the “Benito Bowl,” as it was affectionally named by his fans — reached an average of 128.2 million viewers on Sunday.\n\n\tMeasured by Nielsen, that’s above the 124.9 million average viewers achieved by this year’s Super Bowl overall but down from the 133.5 million viewers achieved by Kendrick Lamar, who set the record last year. Before Lamar, the record was held by Usher for his 2024 performance.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Ripple Analytics, total social consumption of the halftime show — including fans, owned platforms, broadcast partners and influencers — hit four billion views after 24 hours (up 137% from last year).\n\n\n\tAlso, the NFL’s top three most-viewed social posts of all time now come from the Bad Bunny halftime show: “Only Thing More Powerful Than Hate Is Love” (179 million views on Instagram, most viewed clip on NFL social ever); Bad Bunny listing the countries of the Americas before spiking the football at the end of his performance (168 million views on Instagram) and that same clip on TikTok (100 million views).\n\n\tAccording to Apple Music, listens of Bad Bunny music was up seven times following the halftime show, led by “DtMF,” “BAILE INoLVIDABLE,” and “Tití Me Preguntó.” \n\n\tAccording to the NFL, more than half of its social views came from international markets; with full global viewership for the “Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show” available early next week, that U.S.-only number of 124.9 million viewers could go up dramatically once worldwide data is in.\n\n\tThe halftime show began making headlines months before the big game was even played, both because of Bad Bunny’s status as one of the world’s most popular recording artists in the world right now and because of complaints from right-wing commentators about his penchant for centering his Puerto Rican heritage in his work. Turning Point USA, the conservative group co-founded by the late Charlie Kirk, produced its own alternative halftime show “for folks who love America,” per headliner Kid Rock. Ultimately, TPUSA was unable to compete: the New York Times reported that the YouTube livestream peaked with 6.1 million viewers during the show, and it has since reached 21 million viewers — compared to Bad Bunny’s massive viewership on Sunday and 57 million YouTube views.\n\t\n\n\tHighlights from Bad Bunny’s performance included a real wedding, several stunts, appearances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, 380 people dressed like grass and more. Read Variety‘s interview breaking down the biggest moments with the halftime show’s producers here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMattel, Inc, in agreement with its joint venture partner NetEase, has announced it will acquire full ownership of the Mattel163 mobile games studio. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of Q1. \n\n\tFounded in 2018, Mattel163, a global game studio, has developed games based on iconic Mattel brands including Uno!, Uno Wonder, Phase 10 and Skip Bo. The game developer has over 550 million downloads worldwide and approximately 20 million monthly active users. \n\t\n\n\tThe transaction values Mattel163 at $318 million, with a purchase price of $159 million for NetEase’s 50% interest. More than half of the purchase cost is expected to be funded from Mattel’s share of the JV’s cash, which is not consolidated on Mattel’s balance sheet. \n\n\n\t“Our vision is to extend physical play to the virtual world by creating digital experiences and games based on Mattel IP that drive sustained engagement for fans of all ages. Acquiring full control of Mattel163 does exactly that,” Mattel chairman and CEO Ynon Krei said. “It will play an important role in our digital strategy and significantly enhance our capabilities in self-publishing. The Mattel163 team has done remarkably well building this business from the ground up and we look forward to welcoming them on board. Our portfolio of iconic brands lends itself perfectly to the digital world and the acquisition will strengthen our position and accelerate our presence in a large, high-growth market.”\n\n\tThe acquisition comes as Mattel focuses on capturing the full value of its IP across entertainment verticals. Mattel163’s capabilities will allow Mattel to increase its mobile games output, enhancing alignment with the broader Mattel product roadmap.\n\t\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\tPARTNERSHIPS\t\n\n\tSEGA is expanding its real-world footprint with a new strategic partnership that places the iconic gaming publisher at the center of L.A. LIVE, downtown Los Angeles’ massive sports and entertainment district.\n\n\tUnder the agreement, SEGA becomes an official partner of L.A. LIVE, securing a campus-wide presence across the 4-million-square-foot complex that hosts everything from NBA games and esports-adjacent events to major awards shows, concerts and film premieres. The deal goes beyond traditional sponsorship, positioning SEGA within the flow of high-profile live events that draw global audiences year-round.\n\n\tThe partnership includes prominent placement across L.A. LIVE’s district-wide digital out-of-home network, featuring 11 large-format LED displays spread across high-traffic areas such as Peacock Place, key pedestrian corridors and major entry points near Crypto.com Arena, the Los Angeles Convention Center and the JW Marriott. SEGA will also extend its visibility through freeway-facing digital signage surrounding the campus.\n\n\tIn addition to media placement, the agreement opens the door for immersive, on-site activations, including experiential installations at Peacock Place, the district’s 40,000-square-foot open-air plaza. SEGA will also be integrated into L.A. LIVE’s website and social media channels, tying the brand directly to ongoing event promotion throughout the year.\n\n\tSEGA of America EVP of Publishing Ryan Okum said the partnership reflects the growing overlap between gaming, sports and live entertainment, allowing SEGA’s franchises to appear in spaces where large, highly engaged audiences already gather.\n\n\tThe deal was brokered by AEG Global Partnerships and aligns with SEGA’s broader push into experiential marketing and transmedia expansion, as the publisher continues to grow its presence beyond traditional game launches through film, television and live experiences tied to franchises such as “Sonic the Hedgehog,” “Like a Dragon,” “Persona” and “Total War.”\n\n\tFor gaming fans in Los Angeles — and visitors passing through one of the country’s busiest entertainment hubs — SEGA is about to become much harder to miss.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC‘s, Peacock’s and Telemundo’s simulcast of the Super Bowl LX matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots reached an average 124.9 million viewers on Sunday night. \n\n\tThe number of viewers watching a fairly mild Super Bowl saw Seattle defeat New England 29-13 and win its second-ever Super Bowl. That marks a slight decrease from last year’s game, when the Philadelphia Eagles’ victory over the Kansas City Chiefs achieved the biggest television audience of all time with 127.7 million average viewers on Fox.\n\t\n\n\tBut NBC reported that viewership peaked during the second quarter of the game (7:45 p.m. to 8 p.m. ET) with an average of 137.8 million viewers — making it the highest peak viewership in U.S. TV history. It also repped the most-watched TV broadcast in the history of NBCUniversal.\n\n\n\tThe 124.9 million viewer stat comes from the live+same day Nielsen Big Data+Panel stat, which included NBC, Peacock, Telemundo, NBC Sports Digital and NFL+. That makes it the second-most watched program in U.S. TV history, behind only last year’s Super Bowl LIX on Fox.\n\n\tMeasured by Nielsen, these statistics represent the average number of people who were tuned in at any given moment during each game, though the totals naturally fluctuate throughout the telecasts. The Super Bowl LX aired from 6:40 p.m. to 10:28 p.m. ET.\n\n\tBad Bunny’s halftime performance was an audience grabber of its own, reaching an average of 128.2 million viewers — down from Kendrick Lamar’s record of 133.5 million viewers during last year’s game, but still a tremendous stat.\n\t\n\n\tAs for Telemundo, the broadcast averaged 3.3 million viewers — which made it the most-watched Super Bowl in U.S. Spanish-language TV history. The telecast peaked with 4.8 million viewers during the Bad Bunny halftime show.\n\n\tNBC opted to stick with the Winter Olympics after the Super Bowl, and “Primetime in Milan” and “Milan Prime” averaged 42 million viewers according to the network. That’s the best Winter Games audience for NBC since Day 2 of the 2014 Sochi Olympics and up 73% vs. the post-Super Bowl LVI Beijing Olympics show (24.3 million) in 2022.\n\n\t“The Super Bowl and the NFL once again delivered a blockbuster audience across the NBC broadcast network, Peacock, and Telemundo, and provided an unprecedented lead-in to our Primetime in Milan coverage,” said NBC Sports prexy Rick Cordella in a statement. “The Super Bowl and the Olympics are the two most powerful events in the world, and we salute our talented production, tech, and announce teams who delivered best-in-class presentations for our viewers, stations, and partners.”\n\n\tHere is a look at Super Bowl viewership since 2010, when the big game attracted more than 100 million viewers for the first time:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSOURCE: Nielsen. Super Bowl LX in 2026 was the first Super Bowl reported using Nielsen’s Big Data + Panel methodology. All prior reporting used Nielsen’s Panel-Only measurement. The first Super Bowl to include Out-of-Home (OOH) viewing was SB LV. Nielsen began including OOH viewing into its National TV measurement in September 2020. As of Feb. 2025, Nielsen’s OOH measurement covers 100% of the U.S. contiguous television population. Super Bowl XLVIII included the first Spanish-language broadcast for a Super Bowl.\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBlumhouse continues its push into gaming with the Tuesday release of new first-person shooter “Crisol: Theater of the Idols.”\n\n\tDeveloped by Vermila Studios, the AA title, which is available across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and PC via Steam, is described as a “horror adventure where folklore and religion intertwine in a nightmarish version of Spain.” \n\n\tThroughout the game, players must sacrifice their own blood to use as ammunition against terrifying statues of saints that come to life in order to survive while unraveling the mystery of the cursed island of Tormentosa. But, as one might expect, using too much blood leads to your death.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’ve been going to many, many events worldwide and I’ve seen more than 1,000 people play,” Vermila Studios co-founder and CEO David Carrasco told Variety. “So one big mistake they make is, ‘Oh, I play a lot of first-person shooters. I’ll go right in, I’ll get close to the enemies, and I’ll shoot them, and I’ll blow their heads off, and things will be great.’ I will recommend you take every enemy encounter with some strategy, give them some room, some distance. Aim for the head — but not only the head, maybe some of the limbs could be a little more useful for you, because, as they are made of wood and many other materials, they are not detained or stopped by you blowing their heads off.”\n\n\n\tCarrasco suggests players “approach every enemy encounter strategically and don’t go crazy to kill them, take some distance and think twice before facing the enemies.” “Give them some air,” he said. “See how they behave. Walk slowly back and think about the blood you have and how you’re going to use it. Always keep blood in mind.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile “Crisol: Theater of Idols” just launched, its place within the Blumhouse brand automatically makes it a title ripe for a potential TV series or film adaptation. Carrasco is very open to the idea of more, and planned “Crisol” as a larger universe, but says it will all depend on sales and fan response.\n\n\t“It’s super early. Of course, lots of things come from success and especially now with a super tough gaming industry outlook,” Carrasco said. “But we do have more ideas and of course, ‘Crisol’ was created as a universe, which means we can expand it in games and other multimedia assets like comics, books, or TV shows, movies, whatever it is that digs a little deeper into Hispania, Tormentosa, Gabrielle, or any of the other characters that we’ve known in the game or that we may know exist in that universe. So for us, yes, if we are successful enough to be able to get there at some point.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis year’s nominees for the 98th Academy Awards gathered under one roof Tuesday afternoon for the annual Oscars luncheon at the Beverly Hilton Hotel — a rare pause in the relentless awards-season sprint where competitors became colleagues and rivals turned conversationalists. It is, in many ways, the last truly “happy” day of the season. Everyone in the room is still a winner in the most literal sense: They made it inside.\n\n\tHeld within the Wilshire Ballroom, the luncheon is a carefully controlled logistical ritual. Nominees arrive through a no-frills process in which personal publicists are notably absent unless attending as a plus-one. Table assignments are randomized. There are no entourages, no strategy sessions — just artists and collaborators sharing space. For many, it is the first moment when the reality of an Oscar nomination fully sinks in.\n\t\n\n\tLynette Howell Taylor, the newly elected president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who took office in July 2025 after succeeding Janet Yang, delivered the welcome remarks, underscoring both the significance of the moment and the communal spirit of the gathering. Casting directors, she noted pointedly, were among those being honored this year — a line that drew audible response from the room.\n\n\n\tThe nominations were dominated by Warner Bros., powered by a one-two punch from two of cinema’s most acclaimed auteurs: Paul Thomas Anderson with “One Battle After Another” and Ryan Coogler with “Sinners.” Coogler’s vampire epic led the field with a record-setting 16 nominations, while Anderson’s action drama followed closely with 13. Both films earned best picture nominations alongside “Bugonia,” “F1,” “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “The Secret Agent,” “Sentimental Value” and “Train Dreams.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 10: (L-R) Ryan Coogler and Zinzi Coogler attend the 98th Oscar Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton on February 10, 2026 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s an impossible task to judge applause, but everyone knew who got the loudest one\n\n\tIt is always risky to declare a winner in a room governed by decorum, but one reaction was impossible to miss. When Ryan Coogler’s name was read — for best picture, directing and original screenplay — the applause was unmistakably the loudest of the afternoon. His wife and fellow nominated producer, Zinzi Coogler, appeared to be among its most enthusiastic contributors.\n\n\tA close runner-up in the applause stakes was Benicio Del Toro, nominated for supporting actor for “One Battle After Another,” whose entrance into the room drew a spontaneous and sustained reaction. Guillermo del Toro, a nominated producer on “Frankenstein,” was also greeted with notable enthusiasm.\n\n\tThe annual reading of nominees’ names, conducted this year by Lou Diamond Phillips, a member of the acting branch Board of Governors, began with Delroy Lindo, nominated for supporting actor for “Sinners,” and concluded with “One Battle After Another” supporting actress nominee Teyana Taylor, who joked with Variety on her way out, “They saved the best for last.”\n\n\tThere was also an audible response for each of the five casting director nominees — a moment Howell Taylor had flagged earlier in her remarks.\n\n\tWho wasn’t in the room\n\n\tNot every nominee could attend.\n\n\tTwo-time Oscar winner Ludwig Göransson, widely considered the frontrunner for original score for “Sinners,” was absent, having returned to London to complete work on Christopher Nolan’s upcoming epic “The Odyssey,” an adaptation of Homer’s ancient Greek poem.\n\n\tNorwegian actor Renate Reinsve, earning her first Oscar nomination for best actress for “Sentimental Value,” was also unable to step away from production, having recently begun filming Alexander Payne’s Danish-language feature “Somewhere Out There.”\n\n\tSean Penn, who landed his sixth acting nomination for his turn in Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” did not attend — not entirely surprising given his past public remarks about wanting to “smelt” his Oscar.\n\t\n\n\tOscar winner Natalie Portman, nominated as a producer on the animated feature “Arco,” was also absent, as was Oscar winner Sam Mendes, likely deep into production on his ambitious four-film Beatles project.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 10: (2nd L-R) Lorraine Nicholson and Wagner Moura attend the 98th Oscar Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton on February 10, 2026 in Beverly Hills, California.

He loudly celebrated each Brazilian nominee announced, including best actor contender Wagner Moura for “The Secret Agent” and international feature director Kleber Mendonça Filho.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 10: Jacob Elordi attends the 98th Oscar Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton on February 10, 2026 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOnly the NBA might have a “taller” room of players.\n\n\tOne lighter observation circulated quietly: This may be one of the tallest groups of Oscar nominees in recent memory.\n\n\tBetween Jacob Elordi (6-foot-5), nominated for supporting actor for “Frankenstein”; producer Scott Stuber (6-foot-4); Stellan Skarsgård (6-foot-3); and Laxe (6-foot-6), some group photos required creative staging. One reliable solution was to include Guillermo del Toro, whose humor consistently loosened the room and ensured genuine smiles during the Class of 2026 photo.\n\n\tHollywood power players were on deck\n\n\tJosh D’Amaro, the newly minted CEO of the Walt Disney Co., attended alongside Dana Walden. When D’Amaro entered the ballroom, Walden trailed a few steps behind. He paused to wait for her before they walked in together, accompanied by Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment.\n\n\tThe gathering also carried added resonance as ABC enters its final three years as the Academy Awards’ broadcast partner, lending the afternoon an understated sense of transition.\n\n\tSome advice for Hollywood’s biggest night\n\t\n\n\tBefore the luncheon concluded, Howell Taylor offered practical guidance for nominees preparing for Oscar night — advice met with knowing laughter and attentive nods.\n\n\nBe prepared. Don’t say you didn’t expect it. You have a one in five chance of winning for best picture.\nGet yourself to the stage quickly. You have 45 seconds to complete your speech. A countdown will help you keep to time. The producers signed a contract with ABC, and they will play you off. You can still say an awful lot in 45 seconds. Also, extending your speech is unfair to your fellow nominees when there is a limited amount of time on air.\nMake it heartfelt. Make it authentic. The instinct is to list all the people who have contributed to your success leading up to this moment and thank them publicly. But the truth is, you’ll forget someone, you’ll feel terrible, and they’ll feel terrible. Or someone you never even intended to thank will wonder why you didn’t thank them. Instead, think about what it means to you and try to communicate that.\nHave a single voice. If you are a group, decide ahead of time who will speak.\nNo cell phones. Use paper. It looks better on TV.\nDon’t lean into the microphone. It will pick you up no matter where you stand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 10: (L-R) Julia Aks and Kate Hudson attend the 98th Oscar Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton on February 10, 2026 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHeartwarming moments and reunions\n\n\tKate Hudson, a best actress nominee for “Song Sung Blue,” was among the first spotted in the lobby, returning to the Oscars after 25 years since her breakthrough nomination for “Almost Famous.”\n\n\tWhen Jessie Buckley entered the room, she lit it up with her smile, celebrating her first best actress nomination for “Hamnet.” She was previously nominated in supporting actress for “The Lost Daughter.” Buckley shared a tender moment with fellow best actress nominee Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You”), the two embracing and exchanging compliments on each other’s work. Both are widely considered leading contenders in the category.\n\n\tChloé Zhao moved easily through the room, happy and animated. Elle Fanning was also on hand, savoring her first Oscar nomination for “Sentimental Value.”\n\n\tEJAE, the singer-songwriter behind “Golden” from the Netflix hit “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” was a lively presence, chatting with numerous nominees, including Emma Stone. The two paused for a photo together.\n\t\n\n\tJosh Safdie, director, editor, producer and co-writer of “Marty Supreme,” attended as the only individual nominated for four Academy Awards this year.\n\n\tThere were many warm interactions, including Ethan Hawke circulating with fellow nominees alongside Michael Barker, co-head of Sony Pictures Classics. At one point, Hawke, Timothée Chalamet and Barker shared hugs, with both actors telling Barker he was the reason they had careers — a moment that visibly moved him.\n\n\tOutside the ballroom, Anderson — triple-nominated for producing, directing and screenplay for “One Battle After Another” — was seen chatting with Steven Spielberg, a nominated producer on “Hamnet.” The two were catching up amiably in the lobby.\n\n\tAmy Madigan, nominated for “Weapons,” drew attention as she entered the room. It was her first nomination since the 1980s, and the energy around her felt markedly different this time. Dressed in a striking blue suit, she was greeted warmly by Netflix film chief Dan Lin.\n\n\tPast Oscar nominees were also in attendance as guests, including “Mudbound” screenwriter Virgil Williams, who was seen exchanging numbers with Diane Warren after she encouraged him to call her when he directs his next project. Williams was later spotted chatting with Teyana Taylor, a supporting actress nominee for “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio attended with his father. He spoke with Scott Stuber and caught up with Hawke. Nearby, Chalamet and Emma Stone lingered in an extended conversation at their assigned Table No. 3 near the front of the room.\n\n\tElordi, who is starring opposite Margot Robbie in “Wuthering Heights,” the upcoming Emerald Fennell adaptation that opens Friday, was seen hugging Warner Bros. Pictures co-chief Pam Abdy. A nice reminder that even on a day meant for reflection, the next season is already waiting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRichard Harbaugh / The Academy\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet recently reunited with his “Interstellar” director Christopher Nolan at the AMC Universal Citywalk in Los Angeles to screen the film in Imax 70mm. In a video shared by the Nolan Archives, the “Marty Supreme” Oscar nominee interviewed Nolan ahead of the screening and declared “Interstellar” his personal favorite among his own films.\n\n\t“Though my role is not enormous in ‘Interstellar,’ I think I was number 12 on the call sheet, this film came to me at a time in life, in my career, where things were certainly not set yet,” Chalamet told the audience. “And it’s remained my favorite project I’ve ever been in. It’s the film I’ve seen the most of, of all the films ever made in human history.”\n\t\n\n\tChalamet has previously admitted he “wept for an hour” after watching “Interstellar” for the first time and discovering his role as Tom, the teenage son of Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper, had been drastically cut down. He told Nolan ahead of the screening that his expectations for his role were distorted from the beginning.\n\n\n\t“This was a script [Nolan’s brother Jonathan] wrote for Steven Spielberg,” Chalamet reminded the audience. “When I got the part, I googled the project. The original story was about a father and his son, so I thought, ‘Oh man, I made it!’ And then obviously they reworked it and young Tom was a smaller part, but that’s okay.”\n\n\tNolan interjected, “Never believe what you read online!”\n\n\tAs Chalamet and the audience laughed, Nolan explained how “the genesis” of “Interstellar” started as a pitch from physicist Kip Thorne to Spielberg about “doing a science fiction movie about looking out into the greater universe with real science behind it.”\n\t\n\n\t“Right after we collaborated on ‘Dark Knight,’ my brother got the job and went to work with Steven. I get to call him Steven. He’s Mr. Spielberg to you,” Nolan told Chalamet. “He worked on it for a lot of years. It had incredible ideas and moved through all these different iterations, but until Steven was ready to make it, whatever it is, it never quite got that momentum. Steven went off to do another film, so it became available.”\n\n\tNolan continued, “I had a lot of conversations with Jonathan over the years and what he was doing and what his ambition was. I was excited by it. I was incredibly struck by his first act. I had been working on a time travel idea… things looking at time. I had half-baked projects that I hadn’t committed to. When it became available, it was a case of me saying to Jonathan, ‘How would you feel if I took this and tried to combine it with some of my ideas and change a bit with what it was?’ He was fine with it. He could tell the spirit of what I was trying to do was to get to what he was initially excited about it.”\n\n\t“Interstellar” opened in theaters in November 2014 and grossed $681 million worldwide during its initial run and scored five Oscar nominations, winning for best visual effects. But reviews for the movie were far more mixed compared to the praise Nolan had received for his “Dark Knight” movies and “Inception.” \n\n\t“You’re trying to be polite. The film was received in a slightly ambiguous way,” Nolan told Chalamet as the actor tried to broach the topic of “Interstellar’s” rocky initial reception. “It was a little bit sniffy. Some of the responses were a bit sniffy from critics and a little from audiences. It made very good money around the world, particularly. There was a sense of people not quite being… it sounds egotistical to say they weren’t ready… but they weren’t ready for it from me.”\n\n\t“I had some producer anonymously say of me, ‘He is a cold guy who makes cold films.’ Then it sort of stuck on me for several projects,” the director continued. “The reason I was attracted to my brother’s first act is because it’s about family and humanity, and it’s deeply emotional. That’s the film I wanted to make. It’s a film that wears its heart on its sleeve.”\n\n\tChalamet told Nolan that “it kills me you didn’t feel that love right away,” adding: “This movie makes me weep more than anything.”\n\t\n\n\t“When you make a film on that scale… every screening we did as we were finishing the film, there would be somebody who would be in tears and deeply moved by it. That’s enough,” Nolan said. “You can’t also ask the culture to immediately embrace something. It’s asking too much in a way. If you talk to individuals who’ve connected with the film in a really profound way, then you know it’s there. You’ve done your job. The rest is about the zeitgeist and where you fit in with it.”\n\n\tNolan said that it was “an incredible relief and a humbling thing” when “Interstellar” proved a hit at the box office, even with mixed reviews. But “the project seems to touch people more and more year after year and sort of grows,” he noted.\n\n\t“For years, people would recognize me somewhere and talk about ‘Dark Knight,'” Nolan explained. “But over the last 10 years it’s become ‘Interstellar.’ It’s a wonderful thing. We re-released it two years ago and it made $5 million. It’s amazing the success it’s had. It’s incredibly rewarding. One of the strange things about directing is you immerse yourself in an obsessive way with a project. The worst response you ever get is when people say, ‘Meh, it’s okay. It’s fine.’ You’d almost rather they felt something, either they passionately dislike it or passionately, obsessively fall in love with it.”\n\n\tRegardless of the initial mixed reviews, nearly everyone could agree that a highlight of “Interstellar” was the scene in which Cooper watches years of messages from his kids as they grow up. Chalamet recorded scenes for the sequence.\n\n\t“When you were filming the messages from home, there was a particular thing where you were hitting a dark tone,” Nolan remembered. “It felt too much for me. I didn’t particularly like it. I told you about it and you went ahead and did whatever the fuck you wanted and carried on. But I was like, ‘He knows what he wants to do and has an idea.’ It wasn’t about being stubborn. You had planned what you wanted to do. You planned your choices and you didn’t want to abandon that on a casual whim for me. You wanted to test that and challenge that and see if I kept coming back, which I didn’t. I’ll find a logic to that in the edit suite.”\n\n\tWatch Chalamet and Nolan’s full “Interstellar” reunion conversation in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

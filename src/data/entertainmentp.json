    "body": "\n\tAMC has given “Dark Winds” a Season 5 renewal ahead of the premiere of its fourth season.\n\n\t“Dark Winds” is set in the 1970s and follows three members of the Navajo Tribal Police — Zahn McClarnon as Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn, Kiowa Gordon as Jim Chee and Jessica Matten as Bernadette Manuelito — who solve the mysteries behind violent crimes on their reservation. Season 4, which premieres on Feb. 15 and will run for eight hour-long episodes, “focuses on the search for a missing Navajo girl, which takes Leaphorn, Chee and Manuelito from the safety of Navajo Nation to the gritty terrain of 1970s Los Angeles in a race against the clock to save her from an obsessive killer with ties to organized crime,” per the official description.\n\t\n\n\tSeason 5 enters production in Santa Fe, N.M. in March and will debut in 2027.\n\n\n\t“Dark Winds” is based on Tony Hillerman’s “Leaphorn & Chee” book series and was created by Graham Roland with John Wirth serving as showrunner. Executive producers include Robert Redford, George R. R. Martin, Roland, Wirth, McClarnon, Chris Eyre, Tina Elmo, Jim Chory, Thomas Brady, Max Hurwitz, Vince Gerardis and Anne Hillerman.\n\n\t“Over four seasons, ‘Dark Winds’ has masterfully blended compelling character-driven stories, Navajo culture, spirituality and breathtaking cinematography. We are elated to continue the journey alongside showrunner John Wirth and the incomparable Zahn McClarnon,” said Dan McDermott, chief content officer of AMC Networks and President of AMC Studios. “Our extraordinary producing and creative team, cast and crew have crafted a gripping crime drama that continues to be embraced by fans and widely celebrated by critics. We can’t wait to share more of this incredible story with audiences across the globe.”\n\t\n\n\t“Thank you to Kristin Dolan, Dan McDermott and all of AMC Networks for continuing to support and believe in ‘Dark Winds,’” said McClarnon. “It’s such a privilege to embody the character of Joe Leaphorn, and I’m excited to return to Santa Fe with this amazing cast and crew to craft another thrilling season of the show that means so much to all of us.”\n\n\t“For four seasons now AMC Networks has provided us with the opportunity to entertain audiences through the unique lens of a traditional crime story set on the Navajo Nation in 1972,” said Wirth. “We are one of one and never take this strong support for granted. Thanks to everyone at AMC Networks, our talented writing staff, stunning cast and a Santa Fe crew that’s become a training ground for Native artists, we’re thrilled to be coming back for a fifth season of Dark Winds.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first trailer for “Exit 8,” released Thursday, is giving fans a glimpse into the anticipated film adaptation of the global hit video game of the same name. The film will be released in theaters nationwide on April 10. \n\n\tDirected by Genki Kawamura, the Japanese thriller brings Kotake Create’s video game to the big screen, adapting the game’s premise: a man (who Kazunari Ninomiya plays in the film), trapped in an endless subway passageway, must find Exit 8. “The rules of his quest are simple: do not overlook anything out of the ordinary. If you discover an anomaly, turn back immediately. If you don’t, carry on. Then leave from Exit 8. But even a single oversight will send him back to the beginning,” reads the official log line. “Will he ever reach his goal and escape this infinite corridor?” \n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Ninomiya, Yamato Kochi, Naru Asanuma, Kotone Hanase and Nana Komatsu star. Genki Kawamura and Kentaro Hirase wrote the film and Yuto Sakata, Kenji Yamada, Akita Yamamoto and Taichi Ito produced. \n\n\n\tThe film first premiered in the midnight section of the 2025 Cannes Film Festival to strong reviews. \n\n\t“When I adapted this video game into a film, I didn’t set out thinking, ‘Let’s make this video game into a film,’” Kawamura told Variety in Sept. 2025. “What I wanted to create is a unique cinematic experience that blurs the lines between video game and film.” \n\n\tPreviously, Kawamura directed his first feature, “A Hundred Flowers,” in 2022, and “Duality,” a short film, in 2018.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristoper “Kid” Reid, half of the hip-hop duo Kid ‘n Play, has revealed he has a new heart. During an interview with Michael Strahan on “Good Morning America” on Thursday, Reid said he underwent the life-saving procedure after being diagnosed with congestive heart failure last summer.\n\n\t“Over the last year or so, [I] maybe just starting feeling more fatigued than before, shortness of breath, sleeping more than normal,” said Reid, who gained fame with Christopher “Play” Martin in the late 1980s and early ’90s for their upbeat music as well as their “House Party” movies. “I think sometimes you chalk it up to, ‘I’m getting older, the road is harsh, doing the old kick step.’”\n\t\n\n\tWhen the symptoms intensified, he went to the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, where doctors diagnosed him with congestive heart failure. He was initially treated with medication, but at his three-week follow-up his cardiologist, Dr. Erika Jones, noticed something wasn’t right.\n\n\n\t“He came in very swollen again and that is a little unusual in somebody who’s been started on treatment, for the swelling to come back that quickly,” Jones told “GMA,” adding: “The blood work confirmed my suspicion. It showed that his heart was failing and it was starting to affect his other organs.”\n\n\tReid, 61, was told that a heart transplant was his only option and placed him on a transplant wait list. “When we think about status for heart transplant, he was high on the list because of how ill he was and really kind of dealing with a life-or-death situation,” his surgeon, Dr. Laura DiChiacchio, said.\n\t\n\n\tWithin nine days, doctors found him a new heart. “They’re saying, ‘Yeah, we got the heart and we want to put it in tomorrow night at 10 p.m.,'” Reid recalled. “We are like, ‘Excuse me?’ But that’s how it is. So the next night, 10 p.m., we go in and about seven hours later, I have a new heart.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChristopher “Kid” Reid and Christopher “Play” Martin in the 1990 film “House Party.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©New Line Cinema/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHeart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S. and stroke has moved up to the No. 4 spot, according to the American Heart Association. On average, someone dies from cardiovascular disease every 34 seconds. However, almost 80% of cardiovascular events can be prevented with education and lifestyle changes like moving more, eating healthy, reducing stress and getting enough sleep.\n\n\tReid said he’s speaking out about his experience to help others. “A lot of people are walking around with heart disease because they don’t go to the doctor. And you know, traditionally, people of color, we don’t go,” he said. “We don’t go for a lot of reasons. Sometimes we don’t go because we don’t have insurance. A lot of times we don’t go because we don’t want the bad news or we too busy just hustling trying to make it from day to day and we feel we don’t got time or we’ll get over it.\n\n\t“Well, you might not,” Reid continued. “So I’m urging all of my fans, all of your loved ones to get checked out.”\n\n\t(Dr. Jones is also the cardiologist of Variety’s Marc Malkin.)\n\n\tWatch Reid’s “GMA” interview in the video below.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKerry Washington is set to executive produce and star in “An Innocent Girl,” Jaume Collet-Serra‘s next film for Netflix. James Marsden and Chloe East co-star in the psychological thriller, about a young and ambitious woman seduced by a high-powered D.C. couple who draw her into a dangerous world of sex, power and murder. \n\n\tCollet-Serra (“Carry On,” “Cliffhanger”), who inked a rare overall film deal at Netflix last summer, directs from a script by Michael Mohan, Marc Guggenheim, and with current revisions by Carly Wray.\n\t\n\n\t“An Innocent Girl” is the latest in a string of Netflix hits for Washington. Last year, the Emmy winner and Golden Globe nominee starred in Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,” the highest-reviewed entry in the detective franchise. In 2024, Washington executive produced and starred in Tyler Perry’s war drama “The Six Triple Eight,” which reached Netflix’s Top 10 in more than 85 countries. She also starred alongside Meryl Streep in the streamer’s movie musical, “The Prom,” in 2020. Washington is repped by CAA, Washington Square Arts, the Lede Company and attorney Gretchen Rush.\n\n\n\tThe movie also marks a return to Netflix for Marsden, who starred in the cult dark comedy, “Dead to Me.” The show was a big hit for the streamer, with the final season spending four weeks on Netflix’s global top 10 list and reaching that milestone in 46 countries. Marsden will next be seen reprising his Emmy-nominated role in the second season of Hulu’s post-apocalyptic thriller “Paradise.” Later this year, he will make his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, reprising the role of Scott Summers (aka Cyclops) in “Avengers: Doomsday.” Marsden is repped by CAA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.\n\t\n\n\tEast is best known for her breakout turns in Steven Spielberg’s semi-autobiographical drama “The Fabelmans” and the psychological horror film “Heretic,” opposite Hugh Grant. Her next projects include the Netflix comedy “Roommates” and the teen mystery series “Foster Dade,” from Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter, who also produce “An Innocent Girl.” East, who also appears in the forthcoming drama “At the Sea” opposite Amy Adams, is repped by WME, Link Entertainment, Vault Entertainment and Felker Toczek Suddleson McGinnis Ryan.\n\n\tBerlanti and Schechter produce the project under their production company’s creative partnership with Netflix. Marc Guggenheim, Mike McGrath and Scott Greenberg serve as executive producers alongside Washington.\n\n\t“An Innocent Girl” is Collet-Serra’s follow-up at Netflix after the director scored with 2024’s “Carry On.” The Christmas-set action thriller, starring Taron Egerton and Jason Bateman, is the streamer’s third-most-watched film of all time. “Carry On’s” 172.1 million views and 344 million hours watched tally just behind this year’s global sensation “KPop Demon Hunters” and the heist movie “Red Notice,” starring Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIconic horror classic “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” is getting a contemporary reimagining from the Dowdle Brothers, who have tapped Michael Shannon, co-star of their Emmy-nominated “Waco” mini-series, to lead the project. \n\n\t“Doctor Caligari’s Cabinet of Wonders” will be directed by John Erick Dowdle (“No Escape,” “As Above So Below”) from his own screenplay, alongside his brother and producing partner Drew Dowdle. \n\n\n\tAnton is fully financing the film as well as handling worldwide rights at the upcoming European Film Market in Berlin. CAA Media Finance will co-rep North American rights with Anton.\n\t\n\n\tThe mind-bending psychological horror will star Shannon (“Man of Steel,” “Nuremberg”) as the titular villain, Doctor Caligari, a traveling mesmerist who journeys from town to town with a sleepwalker under his control, leaving a trail of grisly murders in their wake. When a young woman’s boyfriend disappears mysteriously, she believes that the enigmatic Caligari is somehow responsible. The problem is — nobody believes her.\n\n\t“Having worked with Michael Shannon on multiple projects, my brother and I have seen firsthand the unnerving intensity he can bring to even the simplest moments,” said John Erick Dowdle. “The idea of seeing him play the horrifying Doctor Caligari became an obsession for us. The trust and creative shorthand we’ve built together will allow us to push deeper and bolder as we reimagine this iconic German Expressionist classic for a modern audience. I couldn’t be more excited to bring this nightmare to life with him.”\n\n\tSébastien Raybaud (“Victorian Psycho,” “Greenland 2”) and Brandt Wrightsman (“Greenland 2”) will produce for Anton, alongside Drew Dowdle for Brothers Dowdle Productions, and Stuart Manashil (“His House,” “Pieces of a Woman”). Principal photography will commence June 2026.\n\t\n\n\tRobert Wiene’s original “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,” a German silent film released in 1920, is widely considered to be the first true horror movie and the most famous example of German Expressionist cinema that heavily influenced the U.S. film noir period of the 1940s and 50s. \n\n\tOther upcoming projects for Anton include “My Darling California,” the darkly comic crime thriller featuring Jessica Chastain, Josh Brolin, Chris Pine, Mikey Madison, Don Cheadle and Charles Melton and “In Love,” an illuminating modern love story starring George Clooney and Annette Bening. It most recently announced the alien invasion thriller “Soon You Will Be Gone and Possibly Eaten” starring Sophie Wilde, for sales at EFM.\n\n\tShannon is represented by CAA and Range Media Partners, and Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBill Nye is set to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences at the 4th Annual Children’s & Family Emmy Awards next month.\n\n\tNATAS on Thursday also announced its 2026 Children’s & Family Gold Circle and Silver Circle Honor Society inductees, as well as the Children’s & Family Emmy Awards winners for Individual Achievement in Animation and Outstanding Public Service Initiative. Winners include PBS’ “Carl the Collector,” as well as individuals from Netflix’s “Star Trek: Prodigy,” “Ultraman: Rising,” “Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld” and “Spellbound,” as well as HBO Max’s “Daffy in Wacklyland,” Paramount+’s “Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and Disney+’s “Win or Lose.”\n\t\n\n\tNye is being honored for his work as a science educator, engineer, television presenter, inventor, and New York Times bestselling author. His TV credits include “Bill Nye the Science Guy,” among other shows; in 2025, Nye was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Biden. He was included in the Time 100 Health list, has a Hollywood Walk of Fame star and served for 15 years as CEO of The Planetary Society, a non-governmental space organization co-founded by Carl Sagan.\n\n\n\t“Mr. Nye is one of the most revered broadcast educators in television history, having instilled multiple generations of children with an appreciation for the extraordinary world of science,” said NATAS president/CEO Adam Sharp. “It is an honor to celebrate his career, as well as the esteemed careers of this year’s Gold and Silver Circle inductees and individual honorees, alongside this year’s fantastic nominees who are building upon their work with important children’s programming today.” \n\t\n\n\tSaid Nye in a statement: “This is quite an honor. Thank you. As you may know, I pretty much put my heart and soul into all the shows I’ve worked on. I believe that the process of science is the best idea humans have ever had. I loved making shows that encouraged kids of all ages to embrace the P, B, and J – the Passion, Beauty, and Joy – of science, while also showing that you, the viewer, can change the world. I’ve spent my life doing what I love, and this award is not only a celebration of my past work, but a reminder of the impact we can have if we choose to invest in science education and the next generation of leaders.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, here are the honorees, as determined by juried panels, for Individual Achievement in Animation (in each of the six animation disciplines) and Outstanding Public Service Initiative:\n\n\tOutstanding Public Service Initiative\n\n\t“Carl the Collector” (PBS)\n\n\tOutstanding Individual Achievement in Animation – Background Design\n\n\tBastien Grivet, Visual Development Artist, “Star Trek: Prodigy” (Netflix)\n\n\tOutstanding Individual Achievement in Animation – Character Animation\n\n\tJames Saunders, Animator, “Ultraman: Rising” (Netflix)\n\n\tOutstanding Individual Achievement in Animation  – Character Animation\n\n\tMax Winston, Animated and Fabricated By, “Daffy in Wacklyland” (HBO Max)\n\n\tOutstanding Individual Achievement in Animation – Character Design\n\n\tKaloyan Athannassov, Character Designer, “Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld” (Netflix)\n\n\tOutstanding Individual Achievement in Animation – Color\n\n\tMark Anthony Mohamed, Color Supervisor, “Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” (Paramount+)\n\n\tOutstanding Individual Achievement in Animation – Production Design\n\n\tBrett Nystul, Production Designer, “Spellbound” (Netflix)\n\n\tOutstanding Individual Achievement in Animation – Storyboard\n\n\tEsteban Bravo, Storyboard Artist, “Win or Lose” (Disney+)\n\n\tAlso, here are the 2026 inductees to the Gold and Silver Circle Honor Society in the Children’s & Family community.

    "description": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel won’t stop ragging on “Melania,” the Amazon MGM-backed documentary that follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to her husband ",
    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel won’t stop ragging on “Melania,” the Amazon MGM-backed documentary that follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to her husband Donald’s second presidential inauguration. During his latest “Jimmy Kimmel Live” monologue, the late-night host questioned the documentary’s box office numbers. “Melania” opened to $7 million domestically, a strong start for a documentary feature (although not the best start for a movie that Amazon bought for $40 million and then spent $35 million to market).\n\t\n\n\t“Sources say there were signs that blocks of tickets to ‘Melania’ were purchased and then distributed to Republican activists and senior citizens’ homes, which are really the same thing,” Trump said, referring to recent reports that bulk buying played into the film’s increased box office debut.\n\n\n\t“Imagine those poor senior citizens,” Kimmel quipped. “‘Good morning, Mrs. Greenwald. Here are your heart pills and here are your liver pills. And here’s a pair of tickets to ‘Melania.'” \n\n\t“To be fair, some people actually did go see the movie, including this group who call themselves the Church Ladies,” Kimmel continued, throwing to a photo of a group of white women all wearing the same white dress with black stripes. “The rest of us call them the Dumb-as-the-Rockettes. They look like they dressed up as a group of redacted documents from the Epstein files. It’s all very sus, as the kids like to say.”\n\n\tKimmel then turned his attention towards “Melania” reviews, which have largely been negative compared to through-the-roof audience scores. “As of tonight, Melania has a score of 5% on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics. That is very low,” Kimmel said. “To put that in perspective, that is 1% lower than ‘Gigli.’ The audience score for ‘Melania’ is 99% positive, which is 1% higher than ‘The Godfather.’ And I’m sure Donald J. Corleone had nothing to do with that at all.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel concluded, “We need to get to the bottom of this. Send in Tulsi Gabbard and the FBI! Seize the ticket machines, the popcorn buckets, the box office receipts, at every multiplex in America!”\n\n\tAs Variety reported, the audience for “Melania” during its opening weekend was 72% female and 83% over the age of 45. Nearly 75% of ticket buyers were white, according to PostTrak data. While Los Angeles and New York City theaters are traditionally among the top markets, “Melania” performed best in red cities such as Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix and West Palm Beach.\n\n\tKimmel has been critical of “Melania” since before the documentary opened, when he ripped the movie as a “$75 million bribe” that “Amazon made for her.” The host then roasted the movie’s $7 million box office debut by saying “it set a record. It was the biggest opening for a non-musical vanity project/brazen corporate bribe in the last 10 years.”\n\n\tWatch Kimmel’s latest monologue in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGaumont has already scored a raft of pre-sales on two highlights of its slate, “Just an Illusion,” Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano‘s (“The Intouchables”) coming-of-age film, and “Rays and Shadows” by Xavier Giannoli (“Of Money and Blood”), a €30 million WWII-set drama. \n\n\tGaumont will host exclusive market screenings for both anticipated movies at the European Film Market in Berlin next week. \n\n\n\t“Rays and Shadows” is set in Paris during the 1940’s and explores the moral compromises of French high society during the Occupation through the intertwined fates of journalist Jean Luchaire and his daughter Corinne, a rising movie star once hailed as the “French Garbo.” \n\t\n\n\tOscar-winning French actor Jean Dujardin (“The Artist,” “An Officer and a Spy”) stars as Luchaire, who rises to become a powerful press baron under the protection of Nazi ambassador Otto Abetz, ultimately helping to pave the way for collaboration between France and the Nazi regime, propelling Corinne into an opulent, yet perilous world of deception. Dujardin stars opposite August Diehl (“A Hidden Life,” “Disappearance”) and Nastya Golubeva (“Paris Memories”).\n\n\n\tThe movie has pre-sold to Australia (Palace), Spain (A Contracorriente), Italy (Rai Cinema / I Wonder Pictures), Benelux (Cineart), Poland (Monolith), Romania (Independenta), ex-Yugoslavia (MCF), Baltics (ACME), Switzerland (Pathé), Portugal (Alambique) and Greece (Spentzos).Gaumont is producing alongside Curiosa Films (“The Taste of Things,” “Lost Illusions”) and Waiting for Cinéma (“Barbara”) and is handling international sales. The French studio will also handle the theatrical release on March 18. \n\n\tThe project marks Giannoli’s return to prestige historical drama following the success of “Lost Illusions” which bowed in competition at the Venice Film Festival and went on to win seven César Awards, including best film. \n\t\n\n\tIn his director’s statement, Xavier Giannoli says he wanted to make a film “that dares to examine evil,” looking Corinne Luchaire and her father “in the eye, with no indulgence and no reassuring judgments.” Giannoli also describes Jean Luchaire as a man convinced of his destiny as a press magnate, “trying to forget that it was all a sham — but at what price?” Rejecting romanticism or easy moral framing, he adds, “We do not intend to judge or absolve. But we do want to trigger another attitude on the part of the audience, via the narrative strength and terrible violence of this story.” Giannoli also points to a Paris of the Occupation rarely depicted on screen – “opulent feasts under the bright lights of the German embassy, with famous actors, writers and journalists” — and suggests the film has a contemporary resonance, “Asking, what would I have done back then? Because whether powerful or abject, History will not release us from its grip.”“Rays and Shadows” reunites Giannoli with key collaborators on “Lost Illusions,” including co-writer Jacques Fieschi, cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne and production designer Riton Dupire-Clément, as well as costume designer Pascaline Chavanne (“An Officer and a Spy,” “Renoir”).\n\n\t“Just an Illusion” starts off in 1985 as Vincent, about to turn 13, lives in the suburbs of Paris with his middle-class family, caught between an older brother who brushes him off and parents who never stop arguing. On the cusp of adolescence, Vincent starts questioning his identity, friendships and family, while experiencing his first crushes.\n\n\tNakache and Toledano stand out as one of France’s most beloved filmmaking duos with credits including the global smash hit “The Intouchables,” which grossed $426 million worldwide; as well as “C’est la vie” and “The Specials.”\n\n\tFor “Just an Illusion,” the Paris-based directors have assembled a strong cast, including Camille Cottin (“Call My Agent!”), Louis Garrel (“Coutures”) and Pierre Lottin (“The Stranger”).\n\n\t“Just an Illusion” has already pre-sold to Spain (A Contracorriente), Germany (Weltkino), Canada (TVA), Benelux (Cineart), Switzerland (Pathé), Poland (Monolith), Portugal (Cinemundo), Israel (Lev), ex-Yugoslavia (Karantanija) and airlines (Skeye).\n\n\tThe duo said the film stemmed from their wish to make a film about adolescence set in the 1980’s because “it was a creative, bustling decade.” \n\n\t“Our characters hang out at video clubs, tune in to free radios, discover the new TV channels, and find their feet in a world filled with injustice and revolt, yet one to which music brings a new kind of energy.” \n\t\n\n\tBudgeted at €15.5 million, the movie is produced by Quad Films and Ten Cinema, who’ve previously teamed on “A Difficult Year,” “C’est la vie” and “The Specials.” “Just an Illusion” boasts a key crew including Augustin Barbaroux (“And Their Children After Them”) and set designer Jean Rabasse (“Jackie”). Gaumont will release the film in France on April 15.\n\n\tGaumont is rolling off a banner year with Olivier Assayas’s “The Wizard of the Kremlin” starring Jude Law as a fictionalized Vladimir Putin opposite Paul Dano as his mysterious strategist Vladislav; and François Ozon’s “The Stranger,” the adaptation of Albert Camus’s classic novel, starring rising stars Benjamin Voisin and Rebecca Marder. Both films premiered in competition at last year’s Venice. “The Stranger,” which won several Lumières prizes in France and is nominated for four Cesar Awards, will have its New York premiere on opening night of The Rendez-Vous With French Cinema, co-organized by Unifrance and Film at Lincoln Center.\n",

The first scheduled training session got wiped out by heavy snow in Cortina ... but she's expected to get more chances Friday and Saturday.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The downhill event -- the race Vonn was widely favored in before the crash -- is set for Sunday ... and if her workout video is any indication, she's far from counting herself out.\n      \n    \n          Vonn also shouted out her support system for helping her power through the setback ... telling fans to keep the faith as she chases one more Olympic moment.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Lindsey Vonn\n              \n                          \n                Sports\n              \n                          \n                Olympics\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

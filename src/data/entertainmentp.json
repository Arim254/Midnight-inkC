    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney is drawing a firm line when it comes to discussing her political views.\n\n\tThe “White Lotus” and “The Housemaid” actress told Cosmopolitan in a recent cover story that she has no plans to become a voice on political issues, despite public pressure to do so.\n\n\t“I’m in the arts. I’m not here to speak on politics,” Sweeney said. “That’s not an area I’ve ever even imagined getting into. It’s not why I became who I am.”\n\n\n\tThe 28-year-old star explained that her passion lies solely in her craft. “I became an actor because I like to tell stories,” she told the magazine, while emphasizing her core values: “I don’t believe in hate in any form. I believe we should all love each other and have respect and understanding for one another.”\n\t\n\n\tSweeney acknowledged that her refusal to engage politically has paradoxically made her more of a target. “I’ve always been here to make art, so this is just not a conversation I want to be at the forefront of,” she explained. “And I think because of that, people want to take it even further and use me as their own pawn. But it’s somebody else assigning something to me, and I can’t control that.”\n\n\tThe actress’s stance comes as she continues to navigate fallout from last year’s American Eagle campaign, which centered on the slogan “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans.” Critics accused the ads of promoting eugenics through the “great genes” wordplay and white supremacy, while others objected to the campaign’s sexualized tone.\n\n\tSpeaking to Cosmo, Sweeney addressed how it feels to have beliefs projected onto her. “It’s definitely not a comfortable thing to have people saying what you believe or think, especially when that doesn’t align with you,” she said. “It’s been a weird thing having to navigate and digest, because it’s not me. None of it is me.”\n\t\n\n\tThe controversy, which she previously called surprising in a December People interview, has pushed her to reconsider her relationship with social media. “I’m online and I see things, but I’m slowly pulling myself away,” Sweeney told Cosmopolitan. “It’s definitely gone to a level where it’s just not healthy for me to digest it all.”\n\n\tDespite the backlash, Sweeney maintained in her December comments that she loved the brand and the jeans themselves. “I don’t support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign,” she said at the time. “Many have assigned motives and labels to me that just aren’t true.”\n\n\tThe actress reiterated to Cosmo that leading with kindness remains her priority as she continues to focus on her acting career.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Bridgerton” Season 4, Part 1, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tIf “Bridgerton” Season 3’s big Part 1 cliffhanger was defined by the rush from that iconic carriage scene between Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), Season 4’s first half will be known for that whiplash of passion and rejection between Benedict (Luke Thompson) and Sophie (Yerin Ha) in the stairwell.\n\n\t“First of all, that stairwell moment is something I had in my mind from the very beginning of the season,” “Bridgerton” showrunner Jess Brownwell tells Variety of the Part 1 finale scene that saw Benedict and Sophie passionately kissing and exploring each other’s bodies betwixt the kitchen and the family’s bedrooms at Bridgerton House. In a scene set to Caleb Chan’s instrumental version of Olivia Rodrigo’s “bad idea right?,” the two release all their inhibitions about their simmering upstairs/downstairs love, with Benedict going so far as to intimately touch Sophie under her dress, before he ruins it all by asking the young housemaid to be his mistress, rather than his wife.\n\n\t“It felt like a really meaningful place for the two of them to have their first real encounter; in this liminal space between the upstairs and the downstairs,” Brownwell says. “I really love the way it came out. I think it is a really sexy moment — until, of course, that record scratch moment when Benedict asked Sophie to be his mistress. In part, we are trying to illustrate just how big the class divide was then. And I think truly, what Benedict asks would have been considered the only way for a man — a gentleman — and a housemaid to be together during that era. So it’s not that unusual for him to think that that’s romantic. However, in the larger context of this being the love of his life and us watching their love story, I think it’s absolutely the right reaction to be outraged and to be mad at him. So I think that reaction is correct and his lack of understanding about how it will come out is something we’re going to bring him up on in the back half.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton in “Bridgerton” Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tElsewhere in Part 1 of the fourth season of the hit Shonda Rhimes romance: Penelope is trying to balance her personal life with Colin with her ongoing (and now public) job as Lady Whistledown, the Queen (Golda Rosheuvel) is refusing to let Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) leave her longheld position as the top lady in waiting, Eloise (Claudia Jessie) is facing the reality of one day becoming a spinster as Hyacinth (Florence Hunt) is bursting with joy to join society, Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) and Kate (Simone Ashley) are still away in India with their newborn baby, Violet (Ruth Gemmell) is reviving her sex life, and newlyweds Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and John (Victor Alli) are having trouble communicating in the bedroom.\n\n\n\tSee below for more from Variety‘s interview with “Bridgerton” showrunner Brownell, including hints at what’s coming in Part 2 on Feb. 26, where things are headed for the upcoming fifth season of “Bridgerton,” which will be the first installment since Season 1 to focus on a Bridgerton daughter — and what’s planned for the remaining seasons of Julia Quinn’s eight-book “Bridgerton” series.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLuke Newton as Colin Bridgerton, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Bridgerton in “Bridgerton” Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFirst thing’s first: Pen and Colin’s baby boy is named Elliot. This is clearly in honor of Eloise, yes?\t\n\n\tBecause we changed the gender of their baby so that they could win the Featherington Heir Race last season, we felt like we had an opening where we could be inventive about the name. And I think it just felt like a poetic way to close out a chapter of the Eloise-Penelope storyline by honoring Eloise with the name.\n\n\t\n\t\tMoving to the Cinderella-esque storyline here for Season 4, how did you go about embracing the upstairs/ downstairs storyline from Julia Quinn’s book, “An Offer From a Gentleman”?\t\n\n\tWe wanted right away to signal to viewers that this is a different type of season and that you’re going to be let into places in this world that you’ve never been. So we dip in right away downstairs. I do think that “An Offer From a Gentleman” adapts himself really easily to television, because there are a lot of plot-driven visual set pieces in that book. So plot wise, it felt like we were able to follow it pretty closely. I feel like the Cinderella story, Julia Quinn is already invoking the trope and then turning it on its head a little bit, because the Sophie character, she’s not a maid waiting to be saved by a prince. She’s got pluck, she’s got moxie, she’s got all those words that you would use to suggest a woman who’s making her own way in the world. And our version definitely honors that character. And so we’re telling a story of not just a maid who wants to be with a gentleman, but also a gentleman who has to learn to grow to become worthy of the maid.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek, Oli Higginson as Footman John, Sophie Lamont as Celia in “Bridgerton” Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPart 1 includes the iconic masquerade ball, time spent at “My Cottage” — all of these callouts to the book that fans were looking for. Can you tease specific beats from the book that will be coming up in Part 2?\t\n\n\tI don’t know how many spoilers we should give — but there are a couple key set pieces from the book in the back half. I will tease that there’s one light-hearted, sexy moment in the back half that is an homage to the book. And then there’s one darker set piece that we also invoke.\n\t\n\t\tLuke Thompson has been with “Bridgerton” from the beginning. What conversations did you have with him as to how Benedict would look or act differently as a lead, or were there changes you didn’t want to make?\t\n\n\tI think Benedict, at the very start of this season, he really hasn’t changed. It’s not until he meets Sophie, actually — or the masked woman, in this case — that he is inspired to change. So I think going into the season, there wasn’t a big glow up in the way that there have been for other characters. Frankly, Benedict has always been a really handsome, romantic character who presents in a glowed-up way from day one. But with each installment of this season, Luke was given the script to see how the character was going to change, and he really rose to the challenge of taking the character to a much more vulnerable place.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLuke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton, Yerin Ha as Sophie Baek in “Bridgerton” Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBenedict’s bisexuality was greatly explored in Season 3. You don’t shy away from that in Season 4, it’s definitely very much acknowledged in the first episode, but I want to know how you chose to navigate that, because ultimately he will end up with a woman character.\t\n\n\tIt’s really important that just because someone might end up in a heterosexual-presenting relationship, that does not negate their queerness. I think Benedict’s queerness will always be a piece of his identity. And when we were talking about representation, I don’t think there’s a lot of representation that I’ve seen of bisexual men. There is a really harmful and untrue stereotype that bisexual men are actually just gay men. More often, we see bisexual men ending up in media in homosexual-presenting relationships. And it felt fresh and important to see a bisexual man ending up in a heterosexual-presenting relationship and still owning the fact that he is still queer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek in “Bridgerton” Season 4 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFor the ball, masquerades are always complicated scenes because you have to wonder, how did you not know that was that person later, and figure that out? So how did you design what you wanted Sophie’s mask to look like, and toe the line between believability that later on, Benedict still would not be able to put it together he had met her and she was the one he’s been looking for?\t\n\n\tI think there’s got to be a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief. We definitely talked about putting Sophie in a full face mask, a wig, etc, and at the end of the day, the meeting between the masked woman and Benedict is so important that she needed to be able to emote, and that wasn’t going to happen in a full face mask. But I think what we’re really relying on is the fact that class was such a major divide in that time period that even for someone like Benedict, who is fairly progressive, he just would never expect that the lady that he’s been looking for who he met at a ball would be a housemaid. The staff were essentially invisible during that period, and his inability to recognize her is something we’re going to interrogate in the back half.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you decide how far you wanted Benedict and Sophie to go in that stairwell scene at the end of Part 1? We’ve seen examples in the show of not doing anything sexual until marriage, and we’ve seen carriage scenes. How do you decide what’s the right tone for the couple?\t\n\n\tWe let the characters lead how far the intimacy should go. And I think in this case, because Sophie’s origin story and her great trauma is about being an illegitimate child and being recognized, she is not a character who is going to, quote, unquote, go all the way unless she’s married. So that boundary that was baked into her character core really set the tone for us in terms of how far we could go with them, intimacy-wise.\n\t\n\t\tBecause we are waiting for that moment still for Benedict and Sophie, is that why you chose to focus on more intimate scenes with Penelope and Colin, Violet and Lord Anderson, and others in the first half, so that there was still that steaminess?\t\n\n\tI don’t know that it was as calculated as, we’re not going to get there yet with Benedict and Sophie, so we’re going to do with other people, but more organically wanting to explore different kinds of intimacy from different characters. The Francesca story specifically I’m really excited about because I think on the show, obviously, people are always having magical simultaneous orgasms, and that fantasy is really fun, but also it doesn’t represent accurately most women’s experience. And so I think there’s actually something really empowering, hopefully, about the relatability of Francesca’s story. \n\t\n\n\tAnd I hope it’s very clear from our storytelling that we’re not trying to indicate that, just because she can’t have an orgasm, that it means there’s something wrong with her relationship with John. They just have a different kind of slow-growing passion. Her situation is really common, and I think it’s great to represent all different types of love and different types of intimacy on screen.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton, Victor Alli as John Stirling in “Bridgerton” Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWith Francesca and John and the “pinnacle” problem, is a certain amount of that trying to allude to Francesca’s sexuality and if there’s a block there, or is it truly just exploring what is a common problem for many people, and figuring out exactly how to navigate?\t\n\n\tI think it’s probably a combination of the fact that it is a common problem and also a problem that feels really specific to who Francesca is as a character. I wouldn’t say it’s about John versus Michaela necessarily, but I think Fran is someone who is not in touch with herself, literally or metaphorically, and that may be part of the reason she’s unable to orgasm.\n\t\n\t\tDo we think Violet is going to get better at explaining sex to her daughters at a certain point? By Hyacinth, will she have this down?\t\n\n\tWe continue to play with that trope. We’re nearly done with Season 5 at this point, and we are continuing to play with the trope of Violet not being able to explain certain things to her children. It’s funny, and a lot of it is for comedic effect, but also there’s a point that’s being made, which is that part of the difficulty of being a young woman in the Regency is that no one told girls anything. It’s not just Violet — I don’t think any of these mothers are telling their girls anything. And in some ways, it hasn’t totally changed. I still think in the modern age, sex education has its flaws. And so it’s a cautionary tale, I would say, about not empowering women with information.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClaudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton, Hannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton in “Bridgerton” Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of Season 5,  is the plan to go directly into Eloise’s season — which would be the next story, following the books — or may you skip to Francesca and John first?\t\n\n\tI will say, the last three seasons have been focused on Bridgerton boys, so all I can say Seasons 5 and 6 are definitely about the middle Bridgerton girls. That’s as much as I can say. \n\t\n\t\tWill we know by the back half of the season who Season 5 stars?\t\n\n\tSimilar to the end of Season 3, there are some clues for people to parse.\n\t\n\t\tKate and Anthony are still away in India, but we know they had a healthy baby and will be coming back. When and how are they coming back?\t\n\n\tHow is by ship. Yes, we’ve confirmed Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley are both in the season, and if you haven’t seen them in Part 1, you’re going to see them in Part 2.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSimone Ashley as Kate Sharma, Jonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton in “Bridgerton” Season 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow much? \t\n\n\tYou’ll have to wait and see. They do have an integral role to play in terms of being the viscount and viscountess and the elder siblings. And I think it’s lovely to have them back to advise and guide.\n\t\n\t\tAnthony has a job to do, and he’s left Benedict to do it.\t\n\n\tHe has, he has. But also, there are multiple seats of the Bridgerton estate. So he’ll be able to do that job, not only from Bridgerton house, but also from Aubrey Hall.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRege-Jean Page, Phoebe Dynevor as Simon and Daphne in “Bridgerton” Season 1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of other siblings, we have a family dinner, we have so many balls that everyone’s attending, and we’re still not seeing Daphne and Simon, and I don’t think there was even mention of them in this first half. So I want to know how you continue to navigate it when it’s a family dinner and they just don’t attend and they’re not mentioned, or that the Duke and the Duchess aren’t coming to these things when the Queen can make an appearance and attend?\t\n\n\tIt’s a practical complication. In our minds they, of course, are still involved in the family. We’re not seeing every family gathering and every family dinner. So of course, they would hypothetically still be involved in the world. But it’s the nature of the show that we focus not only on the new leads, but we’re also working to set up the younger siblings for their upcoming seasons, and so there’s just a natural flow to the show where the focus shifts a little bit.\n\t\n\t\tLooking to future seasons, how are you balancing what characters will remain and who will come back? Because if we start to lose more of the older ones each time as we go, we’re not going to have as many by Hyacinth’s season at the end.\t\n\n\tWe hope to always have previous leads, when and if they’re available, be a part of future seasons. And especially as we get into Seasons 7 and 8, we’ll hope to populate the world with smaller appearances from more of the leads, as well as broadening the world and introducing new characters as we go.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHugh Sachs as Brimsley, Golda Rosheuvel as Queen Charlotte, Adjoa Andoh in “Bridgerton” Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Queen and Lady Danbury’s storyline this season is all about Lady Danbury essentially wanting to retire from the professional side of their friendship, and the Queen saying no. Where did that come from?\t\n\n\tThe inspiration for that story was really looking at the overall themes of the season, where we’re exploring the relationship between employers and employees in a lot of ways, or people and the people who serve them. And Danbury and the Queen absolutely have a real friendship, but there’s a power imbalance. And it was interesting to us thematically to explore what happens when the person who has less power in the relationship asks for something for themselves. So it’s really about exploring the nuance in their friendship. I want to be very clear, we’re not done with Lady Danbury, and she will absolutely be back for more.\n\t\n\t\tWhat can you tease about Penelope/Whistledown in Part 2, and how this job will continue to work? Because she’s very exposed now, but still has the Queen’s very high expectations of her reporting.\t\n\n\tYeah, Penelope is in kind of an impossible situation. She told us that she started writing Whistledown to give a voice to the voiceless, and because she herself felt voiceless. She’s actually now in quite a position of power. She has a relationship with the Queen. She’s married to a Bridgerton. She’s incredibly public, versus the anonymity she had when she first started as Whistledown. So I think the back half is about Penelope navigating what all that means and what she really want for her life. If Whistledown, started as a way to give her a voice, what does she want to use her voice for now?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFlorence Hunt as Hyacinth Bridgerton in Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe upcoming seasons, back to back, will focus on daughters — but they are two women who have already come out, so it will be very different from Season 1 with Daphne. In this case, both of those storylines are set up to not revolve around that marriage market. How are you exploring what a “Bridgerton” season will look like when it doesn’t have that as a storytelling device?\t\n\n\tIn the same way Season 4 breaks the mold, and suddenly we’re going downstairs, I think as we get into Seasons 5 and 6, we are shifting away from the traditional pattern. However, Hyacinth has not debuted yet, and Hyacinth is eager to debut early. So I think it’s likely that we will still have Hyacinth debut before we get to her season to sort of anchor us back in society.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about Hyacinth and Gregory. Gregory is off at Eaton, and Hyacinth is already sneaking down and trying to get involved in balls before she’s officially out. How have you decided how much you want to introduce them as adult characters, and bring that in? They were the littles — and now they are growing up and one day will be adult leads, and there are sexual components to those characters.\t\n\n\tTo be honest, I have not thought about their seasons in that way yet. I’m not prepared to. I will have to think about that at some point, but for now, I’m just focused on giving them more chances to shine. Both Florence and Will are tremendous actors, and it was really exciting to give both of them more to do this season. You’re right that Gregory is away for a bit in the front half, but in the back half, you’ll see more from Gregory, as well as Hyacinth. It’s exciting to start fleshing out the world with the younger siblings as we get closer and closer to their season.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek in “Bridgerton” Season 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe last time we talked, you had not cast the lead for Season 4, so I want to go back and ask about the casting process — finding Yerin, and looking for your Sophie.\t\n\n\tWhat we found was just an absolute star: Yerin Ha is an incredible actor. She is one of the most down-to-Earth people I’ve ever met. And I think that groundedness really comes across on screen. The character was hard to cast because you needed a young woman who felt like she could counterbalance Benedict, who has done everything, seen everything, is kind of becoming a little jaded when we meet him at the top of Season 4 and he needs to be so blown away by this new person in his life — but not just because she is hard working and resilient. She also needed to have a real playfulness. Yerin is able to communicate depth, but also breadth — but also humor, but also has this real, playful, childlike spirit. It was a tall order, and Yerin has all of it.\n\t\n\t\tDid you go into the casting process thinking about race?\t\n\n\tWe knew that we were casting for an East Asian lead. I think when we sat back and looked at the world and talked about how Sophie would fit into that world, it felt like there was a dearth of representation in terms of a leading lady of East Asian descent. But when we met Yerin, it was really just all about her and all of the special qualities that she brings to the character.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBill Maher told the newly-launched California Post that Hollywood celebrities need to “shut the fuck up” when it comes to politics if the Democratic party wants to have even a shot at reclaiming the White House in future elections.\n\n\t“Hollywood [is] sort of the epicenter of the woke left. I don’t think they’re doing the Democratic Party any favors,” the “Real Time” host said. “I think if Democrats want to win elections in the future, job one, tell the celebrities to ‘Just shut the fuck up. You’re not helping. You don’t strike people in most of the country as sensible or in touch with reality.’”\n\t\n\n\tMaher is often outspoken against the Hollywood left, and he’s previously blamed them for his continued awards losses in the industry. Maher’s “Club Random” was a Golden Globe nominee this year for best podcast but lost to Amy Poehler’s “Good Hang.” Prior to the ceremony, Maher predicted he would lose.\n\n\n\t“Sweetheart, I’ve been nominated for 33 Emmys, and they would never give it to me,” Maher told his guest. “That’s not a gag number. That’s a real number. It’s crazy… it’s [because of] everything I said. I speak freely, and this woke town fucking hates that. And that’s okay. I’ve made my peace with that. So I know how this goes. This is not something I would ever … I have good standing. If I win this by some miracle, to go what people always say, ‘I can’t believe it, I’m shocked.’ I really should be shocked.”\n\n\tHBO recently renewed “Real Time With Bill Maher” for two additional seasons, extending the political talk series through 2028 on HBO. The show returned on Jan. 23 for its Season 24 premiere. Maher has hosted “Real Time” since 2003.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNick Frost recently told The Guardian that he manifested playing the role of Hagrid in HBO’s upcoming “Harry Potter” series reboot by watching all eight “Harry Potter” movies on television and writing the name “Hagrid” thousands of times by hand. As drastic as that may sound, the universe clearly listened as the “Hot Fuzz” and “Shaun of the Dead” favorite landed the role of Hogwarts’ beloved groundskeeper, previously played by the late Robbie Coltrane on the big screen.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve seen all the films. We go through them all as a family during Christmas every year,” Frost told the publication. “We start on December 20 and finish a week and a half later. Before I was cast as Hagrid, my partner suggested trying to manifest it. So last Christmas, I watched all the films back to back on the Sky ‘Harry Potter’ channel, while writing out the word ‘Hagrid’ 7,000 times.”\n\n\n\tSpeaking to Collider earlier last year, Frost praised Coltrane’s Hagrid performance and told fans not to expect a carbon copy.\n\n\t“I’m going to try and do something, not ‘different,’ I think you have to be respectful to the subject matter, but within that, there’s scope for minutia,” Frost explained. “I always read Hagrid as he’s like a lovely, lost, violent, funny, warm child. I think the beauty of being able to do a book a season means I get to explore that a lot more, and I can’t wait.”\n\n\tOriginal “Harry Potter” director Chris Columbus made headlines last year during an interview on “The Rest Is Entertainment” podcast in which he questioned HBO’s reboot after he saw set photos of Frost as Hagrid.\n\t\n\n\t“So, I’m seeing these photographs… and [Nick Frost is] wearing the exact same costume that we designed for Hagrid. Part of me was like: What’s the point?” Columbus said. “I thought the costumes and everything was going to be different, but it’s more of the same. It’s all going to be the same. It’s very flattering for me, because I’m like, that’s exactly the Hagrid costume that we designed. So, part of it is really exciting, so I’m excited to see what they’re going to do with it. Part of it is sort of deja vu all over again.”\n\n\tIn a separate interview with The Standard, Columbus said he had recently run into Nick Frost and he got honest with him: “I said, ‘This is very surreal for me — you have to understand, Robbie Coltrane and I were so close.’ So it’s just weird, bizarre.”\n\n\tHBO’s “Harry Potter” is set to debut sometime in 2027.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmazon Game Studios boss Christoph Hartmann is exiting his post as the tech giant shakes up its overall gaming strategy, Variety has learned.\n\n\tHartmann, the co-founder of Take-Two Interactive publisher 2K Games, leaves amid Amazon’s choice to pivot away from its AAA PC and console game development and focus on party games and third-party titles for its cloud gaming service, Luna.\n\n\tHartmann is leaving on the heels of Amazon’s Wednesday announcement of another round of corporate layoffs following a sweeping set of cuts last fall. He joined Amazon in 2018 his role as head of Amazon Game Studios.\n\t\n\n\tIn October, Amazon laid off thousands of employees, including gaming division staffers. That move came just after the launch of original game “King of Meat,” the unveiling of a revamped version of Luna, and amid outlined plans to continue internal development on big-budget AAA titles (including massively multiplayer online games) alongside its new push for party games.\n\n\tAt the time of those October layoffs, Amazon audio, Twitch and games boss Steve Boom said that while the cuts were happening in connection with the overall company layoffs, the reductions also indicated a larger strategy shift within the games business, which consisted of Amazon Game Studios, led by Hartmann, and Amazon Luna, overseen by Jeff Gattis.\n\n\tAmazon recently announced it will be releasing its new “Tomb Raider” video game in 2027, which will be preceded by the launch of a remake of the original Lara Croft game from the ’90s this year. Those titles are being developed as Amazon’s Prime Video is also working on a live-action “Tomb Raider” TV series starring Sophie Turner.\n\t\n\n\tBloomberg’s Jason Schreier was the first to report the news that Hartmann is leaving Amazon.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor an incredible 51 years, the hottest ticket in the music industry has been Clive Davis’ Pre-Grammy Gala, staged in partnership with the Recording Academy, that takes place the night before the Grammys. From Beyonce to Barbra, from Jane Fonda to Jay-Z to Nancy Pelosi, the show has a completely unique guest list and roster of performers that reflect both the past year and the past several decades of popular music.\n\n\tWhile a common refrain during this year’s Grammy Week has been a sense of relief that it’s not taking place against the backdrop of Los Angeles wildfires (like last year) or a pandemic, it is taking place against an existential crisis in the country in the form of the Trump Administration’s multiple aggressive moves against democracy and the rule of law, which have come to a tragic climax in Minneapolis, which has seen violence between thugs masquerading as Federal law-enforcement officers and demonstrators, as well as many innocent people. ICE has murdered two non-violent demonstrators and incarcerated, beaten and brutalized countless thousands of others — which inspired Bruce Springsteen to release a blistering song against the administration called “Streets of Minneapolis.” \n\t\n\n\tIn 1972, Davis, of course, signed Springsteen to his first record deal with Columbia Records in associated with the legendary A&R executive John Hammond, so he has a unique perspective on the man and his talent. That was one of several topics Variety asked Davis about in our traditional Thursday-before-Grammys-at-the-Beverly-Hilton interview.\n\n\tWhile Davis, a young 93 years old, demurred, as usual, from revealing what will take place at the gala on Saturday, we did hear the “KPop Demon Hunters” anthem “Golden” blasting from the Hilton’s ballroom, where rehearsals were taking place, and he allowed that a moment paying tribute to Ozzy Osbourne was possible.\n\t\n\n\tWhat can we look forward to this weekend? What are the things you’re willing to say that’ll happen? \n\n\tIt will be an illustrious audience — as illustrious, as celebrated as ever before. It’s so gratifying after all these years to see the demand hold up as vigorously as it has. As far as artists’ performances, I can’t and won’t go into individual revelations, but the group of artists performing, both new and perhaps legacy, is very special. So I’m really proud of where it stands, both from the point of view of music, artistry, and audience. It’s going to be a great night. \n\n\tYou introduced Sharon Osbourne at the Billboard Power 100 celebration yesterday and presented her with the inaugural Clive Davis Visionary Award there. When did you first meet her?\n\n\tI don’t remember where we first met, but we know each other, and I have great admiration.\n\n\tBetween the award and the already-announced tribute to Ozzy Osbourne at the Grammys, could we possibly expect something along those lines on Saturday? \n\n\t(Smiling) It’s within the realm of possibility. \n\n\tOkay, big question. Have you heard the new Bruce Springsteen song? \n\n\tYou know, I haven’t yet, but I have read about it. Going back to when I signed him, when I was head of Columbia, I did have the belief that he would emerge along with Bob Dylan as the poet laureates of this country. So that the fact that he’s written this song certainly fits his emergence as one of the two poet laureates of America. \n\n\tIn the early days, did you see the potential for him to be as politically outspoken as he’s become? Because he didn’t really do that at first. \n\n\tMy prominent feeling when I first signed him was not that he would turn into a political figure, but that I somehow had to distinguish him from Dylan, and that I could not help contribute to your colleagues [journalists] calling him the next Bob Dylan, or another Bob Dylan. \n\n\tSo I remember vividly scheduling a nationwide call of the Columbia personnel — sales, marketing, press — and I read the lyrics of each song on the album, [focusing on] the symbolism and the writing. It was so different from Dylan, so unique to Bruce, and so special that it would avoid comparisons because he was such a definitive, unique poet as he is. So I would say that was my primary goal, to make sure that the focus is on him as the next Poet Laureate of America in his own right.\n\t\n\n\tI also, may I hasten to add, feel great pride when I hear Bruce talk about when he sent me the album and asked what I thought. And it’s always very touchy if you’re going back to an artist to write more, because certain artists can be very defensive or resentful. So I never know.\n\n\tBut I remember calling him and saying, Look, I love your music. I know why I signed you along with John Hammond. But putting my professional ears to what I have to do to break you [commercially], I need one or two more radio songs. Because without radio songs, how will the public know that you have an album or material out? So would you consider doing, let’s say, two more songs with an eye for them to be particularly commercial radio songs? And he, with great maturity, did not get defensive. He said, Look, I like the radio — and in those days, radio was it. And when he tells the story, he adds that he went to the beach, went to a particular park, and sat there and wrote two additional songs, “Which I never would have written if you did not ask me to go back.” And they were “Spirit in the Night” and “Blinded by the Light.”\n\n\tDid you ask him in the way that you just described? In the 90th birthday feature on you that we published where we spoke with your executives about your career, one of them said a common practice was “the polite pass,” where you take into account that these are people’s dreams that you’re working with and you can’t stomp on them.\n\n\tIn my position, I could be doing that to manipulate or to [obscure] the hard news. So I was conscious, if I had not-good news. But I would not stomp on the recipient’s feelings. So I think it’s a combination of both — of delivering the truth and not obscuring it or coming off like a phoneme. But on the other hand, not doing it in a way to add to the stress of what was taking place. \n\n\tOn a slightly similar note, how do you lead a staff through challenging times like we’re in now?\n\n\tLook, I remember [the early 2000s] when the prevailing public mood was that people should get music for free. It would be incredibly stressful to what the future music would be if there would be resentment over paying for music. And it threatened the health and future of both music companies and artists. I thought of the students in my school that I’ve endowed at New York University — “Am I picking a career that could be prosperous? Or am I going into a dying industry?” So  I was very much aware of that.\n\t\n\n\tBut I did believe in the power of music. I did believe in the role that music plays in people’s lives. And I kept that belief so that my outlook when asked “Are we safe?” or “Are we healthy?” was to say yes. You’re in the pursuit of a profession of an art form that’s needed permanently — music is needed permanently. And I’m happy I did, because we’re healthy. \n\n\tJust going back to the political climate for a moment, are there any plans to address it or ICE in the show on Saturday?\n\n\tNo, I have no plan for a specific political stance to be taken. I’m happy that some of the best music and albums of this year will be represented Saturday night. \n\n\tAnd a lot of the time at these events, people say things onstage that you don’t plan for.\n\n\tThat’s for sure! \n\n\tOK, now we’ll get to the easy questions. This year’s honorees, Monte and Avery Lipman of Republic Records. How long have you known them?\n\n\tI know Monte better than I know Avery, so I’m in touch with him more — we’re social friends as well. So when I hear him reminisce that his career began in 1986, and where did it begin? Working for Arista, and he often says how much he learned from me. So I’m both gratified and proud of this incredibly talented executive. You hear people say, “Well, they’re on a hot streak.” You don’t have a hot streak if you never cool off, and they never cool off. And so when he reminisces about his career development and learning, he’s always very kind to include me as a material part of that. \n\n\tWho are some new artists in the past year that have impressed you? \n\n\tOlivia Dean has impressed me. “Ordinary” by Alex Warren has impressed me. In the R&B and hip-hop field, the Clipse have impressed me. On [less-new artists], I’m also very impressed with the magnitude of Taylor Swift’s success, and Kendrick Lamar’s album.\n\n\tAre you still listening to the top 20 every single week?\n\n\tI do. First of all, I enjoy it. Secondly, I like feeling informed, so that when I meet the new artists or we spend time together, they’re not talking to yesterday’s maven, so to speak. Just a few months ago Alicia [Keys] called and said she’d like to come to my home for the weekend in Miami. So we spent the entire weekend together, she brought her two boys with her. But it’s not just reminiscence — it’s to be able to appraise with her where music is today and where it’s going and how it’s changing and how complex career direction is. \n\t\n\n\tI find Alicia brilliant. I find her well-informed and the perfect combination of what successful, influential, influencing artists should be.\n\n\tHave you heard the new songs from either Harry Styles or Bruno Mars? \n\n\tI have not yet, but I will. I’m so impressed by how many tickets Harry can sell for Madison Square Garden, I mean, my jaw dropped. It’s a phenomenon.\n\n\tAnd I like Bruno — who will not be there Saturday night. But if I had my way, he’d be there, which I don’t. \n\n\tHe might be saving it for next year when he’s up for all the awards he’s likely to be up for. \n\n\tLet’s hope so!\n\n\tIs there anything you’d like to say or talk about that I haven’t asked?\n\n\tYes I do. The party is in its 51st year, and it’s more in-demand and vibrant than ever — the notes I get from people looking forward to it make me feel great, and it’s so good to hear everybody so looking forward to coming to the night of music that we share. \n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMNET, Emily Watson, 2025. © Focus Features / courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tOscars Commentary (Updated: Jan. 29, 2026): February is where the big moves happen.\n\n\tThis year’s Directors Guild of America (DGA) Awards ceremony — set for Saturday, Feb. 8 — lands just 10 days after the Oscar nominations were announced on Jan. 22, and notably 19 days before the Producers Guild of America (PGA) Awards on Feb. 28. The Oscars, meanwhile, will close out the season on Sunday, Mar. 15.\n\n\tIn between, the Winter Olympics kick off in Milan on Feb. 7, providing a global distraction and adding another wrinkle to a compressed awards calendar. Hosting duties for the 78th annual DGA ceremony will be handled by comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n\tThe DGA voting period closes Friday, Feb. 7, just one day before the awards. That proximity to the nomination announcement makes this DGA event particularly influential.\n\n\tFew films are arriving at Phase Two with more momentum than Warner Bros.’ “Sinners,” which scored a historic 16 Oscar nominations, the most of any film this year. The vampire-tinged period drama earned nods for best picture, original screenplay and directing — each attributed to Ryan Coogler, who made history with his triple nomination.\n\n\tCoogler’s chances to win at the DGA and beyond appear strong. The DGA has predicted the Oscar winner for best director in all but eight instances since its inception:\n\n\n1968 – Anthony Harvey, “The Lion in Winter”; Oscar: Carol Reed, “Oliver!”\n1972 – Francis Ford Coppola, “The Godfather”; Oscar: Bob Fosse, “Cabaret”\n1985 – Steven Spielberg, “The Color Purple”; not nominated for the Oscar\n1995 – Ron Howard, “Apollo 13”; not nominated for the Oscar\n2000 – Ang Lee, “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”; Oscar: Steven Soderbergh, “Traffic”\n2002 – Rob Marshall, “Chicago”; Oscar: Roman Polanski, “The Pianist”\n2012 – Ben Affleck, “Argo”; not nominated for the Oscar\n2019 – Sam Mendes, “1917”; Oscar: Bong Joon-ho, “Parasite”\n\n\n\n\tLast year, Sean Baker won the DGA’s top honor for his work on “Anora.”\n\n\tThe PGA, which announced its nominees on Jan. 9, concludes final voting on Tuesday, Feb. 3, ahead of its Feb. 28 ceremony. That timing means voters at both the DGA and PGA will be casting ballots during a narrow window, and just days after nominations, and before Oscar narratives fully harden.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Netflix continues to show strong awards traction with two best picture nominees: “Frankenstein”, directed by Guillermo del Toro, and “Train Dreams”, which earned nods for cinematography, screenplay and song.\n\n\tThe DGA is often viewed as the most predictive guild, especially in the best director category. Should Coogler win for “Sinners,” it would position him as the clear favorite heading into the final stretch. But intense competition remains from Zhao (“Hamnet”), Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”), Anderson (“One Battle After Another”) and Joachim Trier (“Sentimental Value”).\n\n\tProjected winner leaders (films): “Sinners” (6), “One Battle After Another” (3), “F1,” “Frankenstein” and “Sentimental Value” (2)\n\n\tProjected winner leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

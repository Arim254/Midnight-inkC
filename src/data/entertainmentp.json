    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe Golden Globes is glowing this year, thanks in part to one Hollywood-loved skincare line taking over the ceremony: The Beauty Sandwich by Iván Pol.\n\n\tStars such as Emma Stone, Teyana Taylor, Tessa Thompson, Chase Sui Wonders, Rhea Seehorn and more prepped their skin with a trio of products: the Snatching Brightening Vitamin Sauce ($295), Snatching Lifting Vitamin Sauce ($250) and Amuse Bouche Appetizing Antioxidant Spritz ($175).\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHis  signature sculpting method — a more affordable, at-home alternative to his $1,800 facials adored by the industry — delivers facelift-like results using three different types of radio frequency to tighten, lift, and firm the skin. “You can literally feel it plumping the face,” Pol tells Variety.\n\n\tPol has quietly become one of Hollywood’s most in-demand skin savants, with a client list that reads like an awards-season seating chart. The name behind his skincare line nods to his signature philosophy of thoughtfully layering active ingredients. The products essentially offer a distilled version of what happens during one of his high-touch facials, engineered to create visible firmness and definition without relying on aggressive actives or device-driven tricks. The “tightening” effect comes from a disciplined approach to layering: hydrating bases that plump the skin first, followed by targeted actives that support elasticity and barrier strength, then sealing everything in with rich but breathable occlusives. Rather than chasing short-lived tautness from drying ingredients, the formulas are designed to improve how skin holds water and responds to stimulation, which in turn makes facial contours appear more lifted and sculpted over time. \n\n\n\tMany of the products work in tandem with Pol’s recommended massage techniques, encouraging circulation and lymphatic drainage to enhance cheekbones, jawlines and overall facial architecture. But if you aren’t planning on an $1,800 facial (with a thousand-person waitlist) any time soon, the products below will do:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnO. 1 BESTSELLER\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmuse Bouche Appetizing Antioxidant Spritz\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from Season 2, Episode 9 of “Landman,” “Plans, Tears and Sirens,” now streaming on Paramount+.\n\n\tPaulina ",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from Season 2, Episode 9 of “Landman,” “Plans, Tears and Sirens,” now streaming on Paramount+.\n\n\tPaulina Chávez has had a whirlwind arc on “Landman.” During the first season, her character, Ariana, was widowed, and a relationship bloomed with Cooper (Jacob Lofland) as she picked up the pieces of her life. This season, she juggled caring for her child along with getting a bartending job at the local watering hole, Patch Cafe. While she had low lows (kicking Cooper out of the house) and high highs (accepting his proposal), the last minutes of Episode 9 saw her nearly get killed.\n\t\n\n\tThe moment took place behind the Patch Cafe, where she was approached by Johnny (Mike Harkins), whom she had rebuffed while working behind the bar during an earlier shift. After beating her, calling her slurs, ripping her shirt open as he started to unzip his pants, Johnny was thwarted by Cooper, who just happened to enter the alley at the right time.\n\n\tChávez spoke with Variety about her preparation for the emotional scene.\n\n\t“It’s a woman’s worst nightmare for that to happen,” she says of the assault. “I remember reading this episode and immediately bawling my eyes out. As an actor, I’ve been training since I was 10 years old, and it’s very easy for me to put myself in that headspace. I always feel like most actors are just psychopaths, because we’re able to feel everything so deeply, but it’s also our greatest superpower. I went into it not emotionally preparing at all, and I trusted myself to be present and allow myself to be fearful and live scared in that moment.”\n\t\n\n\tChávez, who has had other sensitive scenes on the show, cites on-set experts as making her feel supported.\n\n\t“Everybody is so respectful on set,” she says. “Our intimacy coordinator and stunt coordinators are absolutely incredible. We had stunt rehearsals that whole week before we shot it, so we got really comfortable with each other. The guy who plays Johnny — Mike — is a sweetheart in real life, and was super respectful. We went through the motions, and locked it down. But when you’re rehearsing, you don’t actually do everything. So the first time they ripped the shirt, that first take where we went through the whole sequence, was absolutely terrifying. I definitely needed a minute to recover to do the whole rundown again. But we did it in sections. It was punching, and then before we get to a tackle part, we’ll cut, and then we’ll continue. But — I’m shaky just talking about it. It is a very scary moment for anyone to experience. It’s fake, obviously, but your body doesn’t differentiate what’s real and what’s not.”\n\n\tOne other challenging part of the role was facing the slurs Mike hurls at Ariana, who is often the only Mexican woman in the Patch Cafe, surrounded by white men. Chávez’s parents are both from Mexico, and she says that language stings to hear even in performance, but it’s accurate to the show.\n\n\t“Unfortunately, that is the reality of walking through this world,” Chávez says. “Being from El Paso and San Antonio, we’re all Latinos. So we’re always walking amongst each other. But it is interesting driving through smaller parts of Texas, and you do feel that glare, the stare. Personally, no one’s ever used those terms towards me. Hearing it honestly just makes my blood boil. So I used the rage when those words were being said to me in the scene. It’s so weird, but that’s the state of the world right now. I did a movie about golf in the ’60s [2023’s “The Long Game”], and those terms were used back then very frequently. But those terms are still being used nowadays, and I really admire that we are creating art and telling these people’s stories, and that does come with harsh truths and realities.”\n\n\tDespite the horror of the attack, Chávez predicts that Ariana can overcome it.\n\n\t“I think that this incident is something that is not going to define her,” she says. “Even with what we witness her go through, you see she is still very much a fighter. If anything, I feel like it’s going to bring her closer to Cooper and the rest of the family.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch some of Ariana and Cooper’s key moments together in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSingapore filmmaker Nelson Yeo has assembled his principal cast for “The House on the Moon,” a genre-blending feature that fuses mythology, science fiction and martial fantasy.\n\n\tYeo’s debut feature “Dreaming & Dying” made history at the 2023 Locarno Film Festival, becoming the first Southeast Asian film to win both the Golden Leopard in the Filmmakers of the Present category and the Best First Feature award. \n\n\n\tLim Shi An leads the ensemble as Chang Er, a fairy maiden dwelling in the titular lunar residence with her lover Hou Yi, portrayed by Dominick Rustam. The film’s narrative kicks into gear when the legendary sun-shooting archer vanishes during a mission to rescue the dying sun, prompting Chang Er to embark on a perilous journey to the moon’s dark side alongside an earthbound bandit who crash-lands into her world.\n\t\n\n\tAkira Huang takes on the role of the Bandit, with Harry Chang as Feng Meng. Taiwanese thespian Lee Kang-sheng, a frequent collaborator of director Tsai Ming-liang, portrays Yue Lao, while Doreen Toh rounds out the cast as Yin Yuan.\n\n\t“Growing up on genre-defying Hong Kong cinema of the 1990s shaped how I see film, and ‘The House on the Moon’ is my way of carrying that spirit forward,” Yeo said. “I am incredibly excited to work with this cast – they embrace the freedom to bend genres and bring both physicality and emotional depth to the story.”\n\n\tThe production marks a Singapore-Taiwan collaboration, with Momo Film Co and Aview Images steering as producers. Tan Si En, Wendy Lie and Kuek Shee Heng serve as producers on the project.\n\t\n\n\t“As producers, we see ‘A House on the Moon’ as an unclassifiable work that draws from the past while imagining new futures, and we are excited to bring Nelson’s reflective and ambitious vision to life alongside a remarkable cast and through meaningful collaboration in Taiwan,” said Tan from Momo Film Co.\n\n\tThe film’s proof of concept secured backing from the Singapore Film Commission’s VP Grant. Financing comes from Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA), with Asian partners 9LB Film and KawanKawan Media joining the production.\n\n\tKuek of Aview Images said: “Akira Huang and Harry Chang are widely regarded as two of Taiwan’s most promising young actors. I am pleased to introduce them to Singaporean director and producers, with the aim of further expanding the presence of Taiwanese talent in the Asian market. In addition, internationally acclaimed actor Lee Kang-sheng will take on a unique and highly anticipated role in the film, marking an important new milestone in his career. As a producer, I am excited to see Taiwanese actors contribute to this creative and challenging project, which I believe will bring fresh and diverse energy to the production.”\n\n\tFounded in 2018, Momo Film Co has produced award-winning titles including Venice winner “Don’t Cry, Butterfly,” Cannes-winning “A Useful Ghost” and “Dreaming & Dying.” The company also operates the Momo Distribution Grant to support regional filmmakers.\n\n\t“The House on the Moon” is currently in production, with a planned release later in 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA sprinkling of celebrities at Sunday’s Golden Globes red carpet wore pins with the messages “Ice Out” and “Be Good” to honor the memory of Renée Macklin Good, who was killed by ICE in Minneapolis this week.\n\n\tNominees, presenters and guests including Mark Ruffalo, Natasha Lyonne and Wanda Sykes wore pins from the ACLU-endorsed protest campaign organized by a group of entertainment industry professionals. Other organizations supporting the effort include Maremoto, Move On, National Domestic Workers Alliance, and Working Families Power.\n\t\n\n\tThe celebrities were spotted on the red carpet before the ceremony during the Variety Golden Globes Pre-Show presented by Amazon Fire TV.\n\n\tThe campaign, which also honors Keith Porter, who was shot by an off-duty ICE agent on New Year’s Eve, is “reminding us what it means to be good to one another in the face of such horror – to be a good citizen, neighbor, friend, ally and human. Everyday, everywhere, regular people are being good: keeping kids safe when they walk to school, filming fathers who are being disappeared from their workplaces, donating to fundraisers to support organizations who are keeping us safe,” said a statement from the organizers. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizers noted that 2025 was one of ICE’s deadliest years in two decades, and the campaign comes in response to the current administration’s $100 million wartime recruitment campaign aimed at expanding enforcement capacity.\n\n\t“For the past year, the Trump administration has been stretching federal power to punish and intimidate communities, often by turning immigrants into scapegoats and using the Department of Homeland Security as the tip of the spear. ICE is not making our communities safer. They are bringing chaos into our streets, and families, immigrants and U.S. citizens alike, pay the price,” organizers said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA month after Quentin Tarantino made headlines for slamming actors Paul Dano, Owen Wilson and Matthew Lillard, George Clooney is making it known where he stands. \n\n\t“By the way, Paul Dano and Owen Wilson and Matthew Lillard, I would be honored to work with those actors. Honored,” Clooney said while accepting his best actor award for “Jay Kelly” at AARP’s Movies for Grownups Awards on Saturday. He described “Jay Kelly” as being “made by people who love actors — that’s an important part. People I’ve known most of my life… actually, most of them are actors. I have a great affinity [for them], and I don’t enjoy watching people be cruel.” \n\t\n\n\t“We are living in a time of cruelty,” the star continued. “We don’t need to be adding to it.”\n\n\tIn December 2025, Tarantino made headlines for a range of claims against Dano, Wilson and Lillard. The “Pulp Fiction” director called Dano “the weakest fucking actor in SAG,” said he “can’t stand” Wilson and stated that he doesn’t care for Lillard. Back in 2024, the director also fired a shot at Clooney, claiming the Oscar-winning actor wasn’t a movie star. The two previously starred in the 1996 Rober Rodriquez film “From Dusk Till Dawn” together. \n\n\t“Quentin said some shit about me recently, so I’m a little irritated by him,” Clooney told GQ. “He did some interview where he was naming movie stars, and he was talking about [Brad], and somebody else, and then this guy goes, ‘Well, what about George?’ He goes, he’s not a movie star.” \n\n\tIn the same interview, Clooney added that it was a “great time as a young actor,” a statement he likely stands by today; at the Movies for Grownups Awards, the actor joked that “the only way I was going to win anything is that Timothée Chalamet is too goddamn young.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile accepting his award, Clooney expressed his gratitude for getting to work with director Noah Baumbach on “Jay Kelly.” “The script is beautiful,” he said. “I couldn’t believe my luck that I got to play the part.” He also noted that he “couldn’t believe the luck” that he got to reunite with Laura Derns, whom he previously worked with on “Grizzly II: Revenge,” his first movie. “It’s going to be a long, tough couple of years, but we’ll all get through it together,” he concluded. \n\n\tClooney’s former “ER” co-star Noah Wyle presented the actor with his award. Clooney returned the favor when Wyle won his best actor award for “The Pitt,” and joked that AARP should do a “sexiest man still alive” issue. “I would nominate Noah Wyle as the first guy,” Clooney said. “When I grow up, I want to be Noah Wyle.” \n\n\tCelebrating entertainment by and for people ages 50 and up, the annual AARP Movies for Grownups Awards will premiere on “Great Performances” on PBS on Feb. 22. See the full list of winners here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tGayle King isn’t ready to make any announcements about her future at CBS — at least not on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\n\tThe longtime “CBS Mornings” anchor was asked about her plans at the network while speaking with Variety’s Marc Malkin at the Variety Golden Globes Pre-Show presented by Amazon Fire TV. It comes as CBS News continues a period of corporate and editorial restructuring under new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.\n\n\n\t“Well, I’m certainly not going to make any announcement here,” King said. “I’m not going to, but we will keep you posted.”\n\t\n\n\tKing has been a central figure in CBS’ morning programming since joining “CBS This Morning” in January 2012, guiding the show through multiple co-anchor changes and its eventual rebrand to “CBS Mornings.” Her current contract is set to expire in May, and Variety previously reported that CBS executives are interested in retaining her in some capacity, potentially with a deal to produce her own programming for the network.\n\n\tOn the Globes carpet, King reflected on her longtime affection for awards shows. “I love the pomp and circumstance and the pageantry of a night like this,” she said. “These award shows never get old to me.” And after decades of interviewing Hollywood’s biggest names, King said she no longer gets starstruck. “Once you meet really famous people, you realize they’ve got issues just like everybody else,” she said. “They really are people.”\n\n\tKing also joked about the few times she’s been approached about acting, noting the only role she’s ever been offered was playing herself. “It’s very difficult to play yourself,” she said. “What’s my motivation here?”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” star Wunmi Mosaku revealed she was pregnant with her second child at the 2026 Golden Globes red carpet.\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety’s Angelique Jackson during the Variety Golden Globes Pre-Show presented by Amazon Fire TV, the actress — wearing a dazzling yellow dress — expressed how glad she was to finally reveal the news. \n\n\t“It’s a relief. I’m not gonna lie,” Mosaku said, adding, “Hiding pregnancy is really, really hard, and just being able to be really present in the moment, and accepting myself exactly how I am in the moment is really a relief. It’s a beautiful thing.”\n\t\n\n\t“Sinners” is up for seven nominations, including best director – motion picture for Ryan Coogler and best picture – drama.\n\n\n\tLast year, Mosaku spoke with Variety about playing Annie in the film. “When I read the first scene of Annie and Smoke, I was just completely blown away by the depth and breadth of the humanity captured in Ryan’s writing,” she said. “He has such a way with words. He has such a love of humanity, and women, and lovers, and family. He had painted such a picture of these two people that I loved so dearly in seven pages, that I cared so much about in seven pages.”\n\n\tMosaku also talked about the film’s themes, particularly love of community and family. “I’m a mom, so out of my nine-to-five, I have to be at home with the family. We had a couple of weeks at rehearsals, and, in between takes, we found time to get to know each other — to share with each other, to talk about our hopes, dreams, fears, loves, everything,” she said. “But everything was contained to in and around the set because I had to get home.”\n\t\n\n\tAt last week’s Critics Choice Awards, “Sinners” was recognized for its original screenplay, casting and score. Miles Caton, the film’s 20-year-old star, was named best young actor.\n\n\tAt the SAG Actor Awards, “Sinners” scored five nominations, tying it for the second-most nominations in SAG history. The film earned individual nominations for Mosaku (supporting actress), Michael B. Jordan (best actor), Caton (supporting actor), along with a cast ensemble nod.\n\n\tVariety parent company PMC owns Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge. Polymarket is the exclusive prediction market partner of the Golden Globes.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile Adam Sandler plays a more dramatic role in the recent “Jay Kelly,” his speech at AARP’s Movies for Grownups Awards was all comedy. Sandler brought down the house with a characteristically humorous address as he received the career achievement honor at the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills on Saturday. \n\n\tFirst greeting the audience as his “silver-haired daddies” and “salt-and-pepper mommies,” Sandler said that many people in his life told him receiving an AARP award means he’s officially considered old now. But, “It’s not because of this award,” Sandler continued. “I got 10 other reasons that let you know why.” \n\t\n\n\tThe first reason? “The other day, I had to swallow a Viagra just to take a piss,” Sandler laughed. He joked that he has only one tastebud left (“Everything I eat now tastes like oatmeal”), his texts are so large they can be read by “anyone with a window seat on a Delta flight” and most of his high school reunion was spent with him saying “I’m so sorry to hear that.” “When I received the Academy Award screeners app, even though I press play on 44 different movies, I can only stay awake for a combined total of eight minutes,” said Sandler to raucous laughter. “To every one of you out there who are getting all the accolades, I must say I loved the first 30 seconds.” \n\n\tSandler expressed gratitude to his family for supporting his goofiness after all these years in his speech. “Thank you to my lovely wife for staying with me even though no part of my body is where it used to be,” said Sandler. “Thank you to my two gorgeous children for not laughing every time I walk down the hallway shirtless.” \n\t\n\n\tTo close out, the actor thanked all the attendees in the room, including George Clooney, Kathy Bates, Noah Wyle, Laura Dern and more. “I promise to every one of you here tonight, I will make at least 50 more movies before I am dead. And at least 25 of them will be good.” \n\n\tBefore Sandler took the stage, his longtime friend Henry Winkler delivered an introduction for the star. Sandler may have defined a generation with comedic turns in beloved films like “50 First Dates,” “Click” “The Wedding Singer” and “Bedtime Stories,” but “under that layer of comedy is this wonderful, sincere dramatic actor,“ Winkler said, pointing out Sandler’s excellence in “Uncut Gems” and “Jay Kelly.” “All the while, this man has never changed his Hawaiian shirt and sport shorts,” Winkler laughed. \n\n\tSandler originally rose to fame for his stand-up comedy, getting his start on “Saturday Night Live” in 1990. Now a global movie star, in 2025 alone, Sandler starred in both “Jay Kelly” and “Happy Gilmore 2.” \n\n\t“He is challenging the stereotypes of aging within Hollywood and across the country,” AARP CEO Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan told Variety about honoring Sandler. “People know him, people appreciate him. We laugh with him. We cry with him. We’ve seen all of the different characters that he’s been able to represent so successfully. And as we think about someone who’s had such an expansive career, we can think of no one better. He has a body of work that is representative of all the things that we can do as we age in this country.” \n\n\tIn Netflix’s “Jay Kelly,” Sandler plays Ron Sukenick, Jay Kelly’s (George Clooney) agent and closest friend. Sandler earned 2026 Critics Choice and Golden Globe nominations for best supporting actor for the role, and previously received a Critics Choice nomination in 2020 for best actor in Benny and Josh Safdie’s 2019 crime thriller “Uncut Gems.” Sandler also received the Chairman’s Award at the 2026 Palm Springs International Film Awards for his work in the film “Jay Kelly.” \n\n\tThe night’s winners included George Clooney, who received the best actor award for “Jay Kelly” and Laura Dern, who received the best actress award for “Is This Thing On?” Regina Hall won best supporting actress for her role in “One Battle After Another” and Delroy Lindo took home the best supporting actor award for “Sinners.” \n\t\n\n\tAARP’s Movies For Grownups Awards has celebrated entertainment by and for people ages 50 and up for more than two decades, working to fight ageism and recognize the talent and experience of older actors and filmmakers. Alan Cumming, Tony- and Emmy Award-winning host of “The Traitors,” hosted the awards. The full ceremony will premiere on “Great Performances” on PBS and the PBS app on Feb. 22.\n",

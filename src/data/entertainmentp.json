    "body": "\n\tKevin Costner is circling the role of former U.S. President Bill Clinton in the political drama series “United.” Sources confirm the project is in early development and is to be produced in association with the United Nations. Costner will executive-produce the series along with Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\n\t“Night Hunter” director David Raymond will helm and pen the series, which will tell true stories of heroism and perseverance by humanitarians in pursuit of making the world a better place for all. Producers for “United” include Appian Way, Onwards Studios and Prime Focus DNEG. Fifth Season serves as the distributor.\n\t\n\n\tRaymond is a known collaborator of the UN’s Creative Community Outreach Initiative. He hosted a dinner in 2016 for industry leaders on behalf of the organization. \n\n\n\tCostner most recently served as director, co-writer, producer and star of “Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1,” the first part in his sprawling four-part film epic on the American frontier. “Chapter 1” premiered at Cannes in 2024 before hitting theaters that June. “Chapter 2” premiered at Venice last year and is awaiting a timeline for theatrical release. The Oscar winner also led Taylor Sheridan’s contemporary Western series “Yellowstone,” which ran for five seasons until 2024 on Paramount Networks. Costner earned a Golden Globe for best actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Montana rancher John Dutton. He left the show partway through Season 5. His upcoming projects include “Honeymoon with Harry,” “Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 3,” and “Headhunters.”\n\n\tCostner is repped by WME and Jeffer, Mangels, Butler & Marmaro.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Mirzapur” star Pankaj Tripathi is venturing into production for the first time with “Perfect Family,” an eight-episode dramedy.\n\n\tPresented as a JAR Series and produced by Ajay Rai under the JAR Pictures banner and Mohit Chabbra, the show represents one of India’s first long-format series to debut on YouTube using a structured pay model. The approach follows the earlier example of Aamir Khan’s “Sitaare Zameen Par,” which opted for a direct YouTube release following its theatrical run.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Sachin Pathak and created by Palak Bhambri, “Perfect Family” will premiere on JAR Series’ official YouTube channel with the first two episodes available permanently at no cost. Viewers can access the remaining episodes through a one-time purchase of INR59 (65 cents) per episode.\n\n\n\tThe series features an ensemble cast including Gulshan Devaiah, Neha Dhupia, Seema Pahwa, Manoj Pahwa, Giraja Oak Godbole, Kaveri Seth and Hirva Trivedi. The narrative centers on the Karkaria household and young Daani Karkaria, an emotionally sensitive child whose anxiety attack at school prompts the entire family to enter therapy, triggering a series of revelations about their patterns, dysfunctions and expectations.\n\n\t“‘Perfect Family’ is incredibly close to my heart, not just for its story but also for the bold distribution path we’re choosing,” Tripathi said. “Today, audiences discover stories directly, and platforms like YouTube have evolved into strong spaces for premium long-format content. Producing my first series in a model that steps away from traditional formats felt both refreshing and essential.”\n\t\n\n\t“When I first heard the idea, I was immediately moved — it’s a real story told with a warm, humorous touch,” he added. “Sachin has approached a sensitive topic with such empathy and balance that I believe families everywhere will see a part of themselves in this show. I hope viewers embrace the series and this new way of bringing stories to them.”\n\n\tProducer Rai said: “At JAR Pictures, we’ve always believed in expanding the possibilities of storytelling, not just in form but in how stories reach people. The YouTube pay model unlocks an entirely new frontier for Indian creators. With a cast of this caliber and Pankaj stepping into production for the first time, ‘Perfect Family’ felt like the right project to help define this new space. We’ve believed in this show from day one and can’t wait for audiences across the world to experience it.”\n\n\tEach of the eight episodes runs approximately 35 to 40 minutes. “Perfect Family” premieres Nov. 27 exclusively on JAR Series’ YouTube channel.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDaniel Radcliffe revealed on “Good Morning America” that he wrote a letter directly to Dominic McLaughlin after the child star was cast as the new Harry Potter in HBO’s television series reboot. Radcliffe will forever be associated with the franchise after playing Harry in Warner Bros.’ eight-film franchise from 2001 to 2011. McLaughlin is taking over the lead role in HBO’s series opposite Arabella Stanton as Hermione and Alastair Stout as Ron.\n\t\n\n\t“I wouldn’t say that anyone who is going to play Harry has to [reach out to me], but I know a few people working on the production,” Radcliffe said of the HBO series. “I wrote to Dominic and sent him a letter and he sent me a very sweet note back”\n\n\n\t“I don’t want to be a specter in the life of these children but I just wanted to write to him to say, ‘I hope you have the best time, and an even better time than I did — I had a great time, but I hope you have an even better time,’” Radcliffe continued. “And I do, I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them. They just seem so young. I just look at them and say, ‘Oh it’s crazy I was doing that at that age.’ But it’s also incredibly sweet and I hope they’re having a great time.”\n\n\n\tThe young cast of HBO’s “Harry Potter” series also includes Lox Pratt (Draco Malfoy), Alessia Leoni (Parvati Patil), Leo Earley (Seamus Finnigan), Rory Wilmot (Neville Longbottom) and Amos Kitson (Dudley Dursley), among others. The BBC reported in July that Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, the series’ production home, built a temporary school so the young actors can keep up with their studies amid filming over the next near-decade, as each season of the show is set to cover one of J.K. Rowling’s books.\n\t\n\n\tThe “Harry Potter” series is set to debut on HBO and HBO Max in 2027. Watch Radcliffe’s full interview on “Good Morning America” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor 35 years, Reisenbach Philanthropies has been focused on one central mission: Find ways improve safety and the quality of life for New Yorkers.\n\n\tThe nonprofit organization, which will host its annual fundraiser on Nov. 19 at the Lighthouse at Chelsea Piers, went through a big shift two years ago when it moved from making direct grants to other organizations to an incubator model. Now Reisenbach provides resources, talent and perhaps most important, encouragement to a range of nonprofits with specific targets in education, anti-hunger campaigns, digital literacy for the underprivileged and even an ambulance service to patrol Central Park.\n\t\n\n\tNaomi Ryan, president of Reisenbach Philanthropiesm who has headed the organization since 2015, said the shift to the incubator model has allowed for deeper relationships with nonprofit entrepreneurs and advocacy organizations. At present, Reisenbach is nurturing include Technology for Families in Need, or TechFin, which works to give low-income families access to technology; Central Park Medical Unit, which aims to close the gap in ambulance service in Manhattan’s 843-acre green space; Brooklyn Community Kitchen, which rescues food waste and provides meals in northern Brooklyn; and Safety Saints, which teaches everyday people how to perform CPR.\n\n\n\t“We have basically completed our evolution that began about a decade ago, from a pass-through grant maker to an incubator of very high potential, emerging nonprofits throughout New York City,” Ryan told Variety. “We do still give away money. We help raise and give away financial support to the organizations that we incubate, but we also provide them with a curriculum that essentially explains how to run a nonprofit, and it’s tailored to their needs.”\n\t\n\n\tRELATED CONTENT: Unsolved Murder of a TV Executive Drives Foundation’s Work for a Safer NYC\n\n\tThe annual Reisenbach Philanthropies Benefit has been refashioned as a showcase for its incubator nonprofits and the talent and determination that those leaders demonstrate. This year’s event will honor George Cheeks, who heads CBS and TV Media for Paramount Skydance, and Nigel Frankson, co-founder and chair of TechFin.\n\n\tThe John Reisenbach Foundation was formed in 1990 in the wake of a tragedy that coincided with a violent crime surge in New York. John Reisenbach was a 33-year-old TV advertising executive who was shot dead on a West Village streetcorner while talking on a pay telephone. His murder, which has never been solved, deeply rattled the close-knit TV advertising community. Reisenbach’s friends and family rallied to create the foundation with the hopes of seeding a legacy of good works for New York to honor John’s memory.\n\n\tAmy Reisenbach, who is president of CBS Entertainment, was 11 when her brother was murdered. The loss took an unimaginable toll on her family, especially on her father. Sanford Reisenbach was a longtime top film marketing executive at Warner Bros. Pictures. He poured his energy into building the foundation as a means of channeling his immense grief.\n\n\tThe longevity of Reisenbach Philanthropies has been gratifying for those who have worked to maintain its strong support within New York’s TV and advertising sectors. It has also helped Amy Reisenbach hold on to her emotional bond with the brother she lost to horrifying violence.\n\n\t“The fact that the organization is actually growing – the word I go back to is ‘stunned,’ because I just can’t get over that in this difficult environment, we’re growing,” Amy Reisenbach told Variety. “It still speaks to the mission 35 years ago, which was that my brother had such a deep love of New York. And I think everybody who loved him also loved New York.”\n\n\tThe 35th anniversary event will be a reunion for Reisenbach and her extended family (Sanford Reisenbach died in 2015 at age 82). Other honorees this year include Omnicom CEO Ralph Pardo, Danya Herman, founder and president of Future Girl Entrepreneurs; and Joanna Stone, a partner at Oaklins DeSilva+Phillips. Actor Erika Henningsen (Netflix’s “The Four Seasons”) will host.\n\t\n\n\t“Many of the people who got involved 35 years ago are still involved, which is amazing. And it all stems from everybody knows somebody who lives in New York or has family in New York, no matter where you’re from, and so it’s such a relatable organization,” Reisenbach said. “I’m so proud of what Reisenbach has been able to do, especially since the pandemic. It’s deeply personal to me.”\n\n\tThe next level for Reisenbach Philanthropies will be expanding its focus beyond New York City to a handful of organizations in Los Angeles and that are focused on recovery from January’s devastating fires Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Gotham will remain the primary focus of Reisenbach. But having the wherewithal to extend help to the West Coast is another source of pride for Amy Reisenbach and Ryan.\n\n\t“Our fundamental focus is still in New York City, and it is still on safety and quality of life in the city,” Ryan said. “There’s a lot that falls under that umbrella, and we always try to be a funder that lets communities tell us what they need.”\n\n\t(Pictured: TechFin’s Nigel Frankson)\n",

    "body": "\n\tHuman decency in the midst of inhumane atrocity is the powerful emotional drive of China’s international Oscar entry, “Dead to Rights,” a stirring drama set during the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Centered on a postman who poses as a photo developer to survive the Japanese occupation while secretly hiding a group of terrified citizens, Shen Ao’s handsomely produced follow-up to his 2023 hit “No More Bets” expertly balances intensely claustrophobic drama with spectacular depictions of the fall of Nanjing and its shocking aftermath.\n\t\n\n\tThough a little melodramatic in the final stretch and containing several scenes that some viewers may find hard to watch, China’s third-biggest domestic hit of the year thus far serves as a potent reminder of a chapter in human history that must never be forgotten and sadly continues to have parallels today. It is also a stimulating examination of how photographs shot during wartime can become weapons for justice long after gunshots have stopped.\n\n\n\tA long-standing source of diplomatic discomfort between China and Japan, the Nanjing Massacre has been the subject of numerous Chinese features over the past four decades. An authorized adaptation of Luo Guanqun’s “Massacre in Nanjing” (1987), “Dead to Rights” follows in the footsteps of Wu Zinui’s “Nanjing 1937” (1995), Lu Chuan’s “City of Life and Death” (2009) and “The Flowers of War,” directed by Zhang Yimou and submitted as China’s international Oscar entry in 2011.  \n\n\tShen and co-writers Xu Luyang and Zhang Ke (“The Volunteers: To the War”) have based their story on the real-life figure of Luo Jin, a teenage apprentice at Huadong Photo Studio who secretly developed and concealed photographs of atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperial Army. These photos were later discovered and used as critical evidence at the 1946 Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal.\n\t\n\n\tThe spirit of Luo Jin inhabits the central character of A-Chang (Liu Haoran of “Decoded” and the “Detective Chinatown” franchise), a postal worker whose kind nature prevents him from escaping during the city’s capitulation. A likable young man whom audiences will quickly warm to, A-Chang takes refuge in a photo studio where he was saved from execution by claiming to be the shop’s apprentice. Suddenly useful to the invading forces, A-Chang is assigned to work for Hideo Ito (Daichi Harashima), a Japanese army photographer ordered to document happy moments of  “Japanese and Chinese friendship.” Reporting to sadistic commander Maj. Kuroshima (Shinji Azuma), Ito also takes pictures of atrocities that are strictly forbidden for distribution and intended exclusively for the satisfaction and “glory” of military brass.\n\n\tWith the help of Wang Guanghai (Wang Chuan-jun), a compromised local working as an interpreter and “friend” of the Japanese in the belief he’ll prosper under occupation, A-Chang is permitted to live, provided he develops Ito’s negatives by the following day. What nobody knows at this point is that studio owner Jin Chengzong (Wang Xiao) is hiding in a secret room under the floorboards with his wife, Zhao Yifang (Wang Zhener), young daughter Jin Wanyi (Yang Enyou) and an infant son.  \n\n\tWith no choice but to acquire professional skills overnight, A-Chang is given a crash course by the kindly Jin. In the first of many memorable scenes set in Jin’s darkroom, the master and his accidental apprentice watch in horror as photographic paper in chemical baths slowly reveal the butchery captured by Ito’s lens. Thus far a survival drama, “Dead to Rights” now takes on an extra thriller dimension as the duo decide they must, at whatever cost, find a way to copy and eventually smuggle these images to a place where they can be used as evidence.  \n\n\tSuspense and moral complexity intensify with the arrival of Lin Yuxiu (Gao Ye), the mistress of Wang Guanghai. An opera singer and aspiring movie star who has narrowly avoided being raped by Japanese soldiers, Lin has also smuggled her rescuer, policeman Song (Zhou You), into the hiding place. Compelling and convincing drama ensues as this cross-section of Chinese society responds to living in a permanent state of extreme fear, while knowing that only two or three of them at best have even a remote chance of escape. While much of this is bleak, it remains gripping as group dynamics shift and characters change under intense pressure. Most notable are the believable transformations in Wang Guanghai, whose willingness to close his eyes to everything but self-preservation begins to crack, and Lin Yuxiu, who proves to be much more than the flighty diva she seems at first.  \n\t\n\n\tPerformances are excellent across the board, but the standout is Harashima (the son of Chinese and Japanese parents) for his delicately understated portrayal of a non-combatant soldier documenting appalling crimes against humanity. The question of whether Ito truly embraces his work or is simply surviving within a brutal system is one that lingers for a good measure of the runtime thanks to Harashima’s finely controlled acting under Shen’s precise direction. \n\n\tThe only real let-down is some clunky melodrama in the final passages. There’s nothing wrong with characters expressing love for their country but the high-spirited messaging about “our beautiful motherland” feels tonally inconsistent with the tense and gritty realism that began “Dead to Rights.” Still, this is a minor concern in a film that has already done enough to impress and elicit strong emotional reactions from audiences everywhere.\n\n\tLarge scale action set-pieces are carefully woven into what’s predominantly an intimate human drama unfolding in cramped indoor spaces. Having shown the massive scope of Nanjing’s fall in the stunning opening, Shen and editors Jiang Zhen and Huo Zhiqiang opt for relatively short, high-impact outdoors sequences thereafter. Strong but never exploitative or lingering, these moments include the mass slaughter of innocent civilians on the banks of the Yangtze river and an almost unbearably tense passage involving a crying baby on a crowded street. \n\n\tThe most difficult, but essential, scenes involve Japanese troops storming the international safety zone to commit rape and terrify staff working alongside Minnie Vautrin (Apryl Mei Reagan), the revered American missionary and educator who saved countless lives in Nanjing. Suggestion is masterfully employed elsewhere, with half-glimpsed images on the edge of cinematogrpaher Wang Tianxing’s probing camera and superbly layered sound design creating a sustained atmosphere of dread and leaving no doubt that this place at this moment in time is truly hell on Earth.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tPopular children’s TV host Ms. Rachel just landed her first two Emmy nominations — as did 96-year-old actress June Squibb. There were among the nods announced Tuesday for the 4th annual Children’s & Family Emmy Awards. The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, which administers the Children’s & Family Emmys, also announced that the next edition will take place in New York for the first time, at Jazz at Lincoln Center’s Frederick P. Rose Hall on March 1 and March 2, 2026.\n\t\n\n\tMs. Rachel received her noms for outstanding preschool, children’s or family viewing series and outstanding writing for a preschool or children’s series, via her “Ms. Rachel — Toddler Learning Videos” YouTube channel. Squibb earned her nod for outstanding children’s personality via the “Storyline Online” YouTube channel. (Squibb’s competition includes Yvette Nicole Brown, for “Cookie Monster’s Bake Sale: Block Party.”)\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, among viral sensations that turned into Emmy nominations, the clip of star Andrew Garfield talking to Elmo about grief on the “Sesame Street” YouTube channel earned a nod for outstanding short form live action program.\n\n\tIn the “’Friends’-turned-competitors” category, “Friends” stars Lisa Kudrow (“Time Bandits”) and David Schwimmer (“Goosebumps: The Vanishing”) are both nominated in outstanding lead performer in a preschool, children’s or young teen program category. They’re up against Kit Connor and Joe Locke (both for “Heartstopper”), Jude Law (“Star Wars: Skeleton Crew”), Danya Griver (“Malory Towers”) and Nina Toussaint-White (“The Primrose Railway Children”).\n\t\n\n\tAnother star-studded category is outstanding single role voice performer in a children’s or young teen program category, including Cynthia Erivo (“RoboGobo”), John Lithgow (“Spellbound”), Maya Rudolph (“Dream Productions), John C. Reilly (“An Almost Christmas Story”), Ernie Hudson (“Angry Birds Mystery Island”) and Erik Todd Dellums (“The Dragon Prince”).\n\n\tNATAS announced the nominations live on its social media accounts, as well as at a membership event with the Children’s Media Association New York chapter.\n\n\tAmong changes to this year’s categories, the outstanding voice performer in a preschool program is the result of a merger between outstanding single role voice performance in a preschool program and outstanding multiple role voice performance in a preschool program.\n\n\tAlso outstanding directing for a live action series came from the merger of single camera and multi-cam categories. Single and multi-cam were also merged for the outstanding editing for a preschool or children’s live action program, and outstanding editing for a young teen live action program fields.\n\n\t“We’re excited to honor the extraordinary individuals and teams who bring children’s and family television to life every day,” said Rachel Schwartz, head of the Children’s & Family Emmy Awards. “As the landscape continues to grow—and as studies highlight the positive impact educational programming has on young children—we look forward to coming together to celebrate this meaningful and inspiring work.”\n\n\tHere are the 4th Annual Children’s & Family Emmy Awards nominees:\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Preschool, Children’s or Family Viewing Series\t\n\n\t“Jane” (Apple TV+) [Sinking Ship Entertainment]\n\n\t“Kids Baking Championship” (Food Network) [Sonic Dog]\n\n\t“Ms. Rachel” (Ms. Rachel – Toddler Learning Videos YouTube Channel) [Songs For Littles, LLC | Lifeboat Productions]\n\n\t“Odd Squad” (PBS Kids) [Sinking Ship Entertainment | BBC Studios | Fred Rogers Productions]\n\n\t“Sesame Street” (HBO Max) [Sesame Workshop]\n\n\t“Tab Time” (Tab Time YouTube Channel) [Kids At Play]\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Young Teen Series\t\n\n\t“Goosebumps: The Vanishing” (Disney+) [Sony Pictures Television]\n\n\t“Heartstopper” (Netflix) [See-Saw Films]\n\t\n\n\t“Star Wars: Skeleton Crew” (Disney+) [Lucasfilm Ltd.]\n\n\t“Sweet Tooth” (Netflix) [Warner Bros. Television]\n\n\t“Time Bandits” (Apple TV+) [Paramount Television Studios | Anonymous Content | MRC Productions]\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Fiction Special\t\n\n\t“Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Road Trip” (Disney+)\n\n\t“Descendants: The Rise of Red” (Disney+) [Disney Branded Television]\n\n\t“Girl Haunts Boy” (Fifth Season) [Wonder Worldwide]\n\n\t“Henry Danger: The Movie” (Nickelodeon)\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Informational Program\t\n\n\t“Building Outside the Lines” (Magnolia Network) [Painless Productions]\n\n\t“Harlem Ice” (Disney+) [Imagine Entertainment]\n\n\t“Makayla’s Voice: A Letter to the World” (Netflix)\n\n\t“A Real Bug’s Life” (National Geographic) [Plimsoll Productions]\n\n\t“Super Animals” (FOX)\n\t\n\t\tOutstanding Preschool Animated Series\t\n\n\t“Carl the Collector” (PBS Kids) [Spiffy Pictures | Fuzzytown Productions | Yowza!

    "body": "\n\tFor Phil Rosenthal, there’s only one thing he loves more than food: his family. So, he mixed the two worlds for Max & Helen’s, a new diner he opened Tuesday with his daughter, Lily Rosenthal.\n\n\tWorking alongside famed chef Nancy Silverton and his new son-in-law, Mason Royal, the television writer and food enthusiast spends a great deal of his time on Larchmont Boulevard in Los Angeles. And he’s had a lease at 127 N. Larchmont for nearly 22 years.\n\t\n\n\t “It was the right time years ago. It just takes years. The city is not easy. There’s a lot of bureaucracy,” Phil says during our interview at one of Silverton’s other restaurants in Hancock Park, Osteria Mozza. “We’ve had the lease since 2004. It takes months just to have them look at your plans, then they sometimes change their minds, depending on the person. It’s like dealing with the studios.”\n\n\n\tBut Max & Helen’s, aptly named after his late parents, whom audiences fell in love with on “Somebody Feed Phil,” won’t feel like Hollywood, and it won’t have the stuffy vibe so many L.A. restaurants seem to have today.\n\n\t“There’s this thing happening where restaurants have an attitude like you, the guests, are so lucky we let you in here. I hate that. The best part of the dining experience should be the hospitality,” says Lily, who serves as the creative director of the diner. “You want to feel taken care of. We’re so lucky that you, the guest, are spending your money on us. That can be a really small detail, and it’s the attention to those details that really make you feel like we care about you.”\n\n\tShe also hired the staff, which has a heavy task: Help foster a community while serving delicious food.\n\t\n\n\t“This is about the culture,” she adds. “We’re trying to create a culture within Larchmont of not just the food being great, but you feeling like you’re part of the community. That’s everything. So it takes a specific type of person to fill those roles.”\n\n\n\tPhil Rosenthal is known in the food business already, thanks to the 49 episodes of “Somebody Feed Phil” — and the fact that he spends “every single day that I’m in town” walking around Larchmont and usually having coffee and breakfast at Go Get ‘Em Tiger. But through the years of visiting and eating at some of the best restaurants in the world, one place from Season 8 stood out: Biddeford’s famed Palace Diner Restaurant in Maine.\n\n\t“That one that stuck with me. I think that’s a relatable thing — when we find the best version of something we loved our whole lives, you remember. It’s like ‘Ratatouille.’ You go back to your childhood and have the ideal version of that. It’s stronger than just the food itself,” he says. “The diner is the center of many communities. Rich, poor, everyone in between can appreciate the diner. They’re disappearing from America, and with that disappearance, maybe we lose our sense of community, and maybe with that, we lose the country. So we’re going to fix everything with our diner.”\n\n\tHe laughs but in a way, he’s serious. “Think globally, act locally. This is literally our neighborhood. For me, it’s a way to show love for our neighbors. It’s my hangout now — it’s like I planned my retirement.”\n\n\tLarchmont isn’t exactly cheap — in fact, it’s pretty pricey. But, Phil and Lily promise, this will be high quality without the crazy price tag. “It’s going to be as cheap as we can possibly make it. I don’t do things for money, I never did,” he says. “It’s very important to me that it remains democratic with a small fee that almost everyone can afford to eat here. I promise you we’ll have the cheapest coffee on the block.”\n\n\tThe menu will include drip coffee (but no espresso machine, so don’t expect a latte), two different types of grilled cheese, an omelette of the day, and a plethora of desserts — milkshakes, banana splits and hot fudge sundaes, etc. Plus, Max’s fluffy eggs and Helen’s matzo ball soup will be listed to honor his parents. There will also be a smoked salmon platter with a sesame bagel from Phil’s favorite bagel spot — yes, even as a New Yorker — Courage Bagels.\n\t\n\n\t“That was no small feat,” he says of the collaboration with Courage. At first they said no, but he countered. “I said, ‘How about, give us one bagel. We won’t do anything to it other than heat it up. We’re not even going to make the sandwich — the platter will come separately. They said, ‘You can have the sesame bagel.’ I said, ‘That’s the best one!'”\n\n\tNot everyone always agreed on the menu, though — and one item he debated with Silverton over. The acclaimed chef didn’t think a burger was necessary since she makes a patty melt. He pushed back. “It was a big point of contention,” Lily laughs. \n\n\t“I said, ‘It’s a diner. We’ve got to have a burger.’ To her point, everyone else has burgers. We went back and forth, and she said, ‘Taste the patty melt.’ I tasted it. The best patty melt I’ve ever had in my life,” recalls Phil. “As soon as I swallowed, I said, ‘We still need a burger.’ My other argument is that she happens to make the best burger I’ve ever had.”\n\n\tSo, there’s also a hamburger, a hot dog and Max & Helen’s Not for Me Hot Sauce on the menu, the latter of which Lily says, is “for both people who love spice and are a little wary.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLily Rosenthal and husband Mason Royal\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor Lily, working on the diner has been the first time she’s dipped her toe into the restaurant world — and she is learning everything she possibly can.\n\n\t“I would just go to the places Dad would bring me. But now I’m married to a chef, and he’s running operations on this, and I have been able to take a front seat and learn the ins and outs of the process itself — how much work and dedication it takes from the back to what we see when we go out to eat. This is all I want to do now: open restaurants,” she says.\n\n\tNow, she dreams of opening other restaurants. To this, her dad chimes in: “I’d like to be a VIP.”\n\n\tAnd yes, they’re already thinking ahead, hopeful that maybe they could open another Max & Helen’s in New York — eventually.\n\n\t“We would love if this could build into becoming a big, national diner chain. That would be great. But for right now, we have to focus on getting this 100% right, because the worst thing you could do is go too big too soon,” says Lily. “So the priority is making sure this is perfect.\n\n\tOne more, and then see how that goes, Phil adds. “The quality of this has to stay. I’ve seen it happen with restaurants that I’ve invested in that started to spread themselves too thin. The first thing that happens is the quality goes down. I got offers when we were making ‘Raymond,’ ‘Hey, do you want to create another show?’ ‘No, I really don’t. I’m writing this show. This is important, this one. Let’s make this one good, and then later we can talk.'”\n\t\n\n\tDon’t expect to see Max & Helen’s on “Somebody Feed Phil” — even though, I tell him, the title “Phil Feeds Somebody” writes itself. But, he would like to have it featured in a different show.\n\n\t“What I would be open to is a documentary series about the diner — just a four-to-six episode thing about the making of our diner, while exploring the great diners of America and exploring this idea of community,” he says. “It’s about something larger than just about the food.”\n\n\tMax and Helen’s Diner is now open at 127 N. Larchmont Blvd. in Los Angeles.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are countless gift options for the music lover in your life, whether it’s a high-end speaker, a swanky vinyl storage solution or some quality guitar picks.\n\n\tVariety has curated this list of the best music books, merchandise and listening devices — as well as instruments and gear for both beginners and veteran musicians — so you can surprise your audiophile friend or guitar-playing relative with the perfect present this holiday season.\n\n\n\tShop our curated list below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFor vinyl-curious music lovers, the Audio-Technica AT-LP60x-BK is a great starter record player. At $200, it’s a budget-friendly option that will hold up better than the $50 ones, while still offering a similar sound quality to many high-end turntables. It doesn’t have built-in speakers, so you will need to connect it with headphones or another listening device (we have plenty of options down below). Check out more of the best record players to buy this year here.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tCameron Crowe wrote and directed the film “Almost Famous,” based on his experiences as a 15-year-old music journalist who embedded with rock legends like Led Zeppelin and David Bowie. With “The Memoir,” Crowe strips down the Hollywood version and tells the true stories of his youth that led him to become Rolling Stone’s youngest-ever contributor, a movie director and an Oscar-winning screenwriter. Fans of classic rock will marvel at Crowe’s access and descriptions of a bygone era in music. Check out more celebrity memoirs here.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIf you’re looking for a more elevated speaker to pair with your record player or put on your bookshelf, the Sonos 100 is a beautifully designed and versatile option. Buy two for a complete stereo setup, or connect them with a soundbar for surround sound.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHave you ever wanted to play your electric guitar outside your home, but you didn’t want to lug around an amplifier? Fender’s Mustang Micro Plus is like an amp you can fit in your pocket. The compact device allows you to plug headphones into your guitar and jam on the go, with dozens of amp sounds and effects. It even has Bluetooth connectivity, meaning you could plug in and shred with no cables.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFifty years after the original album’s release, Pink Floyd‘s classic “Wish You Were Here” album will get 50th anniversary editions that include a greater wealth of unreleased material, collectively dubbed “Wish You Were Here 50.” The new sets arrives Dec. 12, just in time for holiday gifting. You can pre-order the set here.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Riptide” anyone? For those who want to learn an instrument but don’t know where to start, a ukulele is a good entryway. Fender has a handful of stylish options that keep the instrument’s approachable charm and beachy vibe intact. At $120, the Avalon blows a souvenir shop uke out of the water while still being affordable compared to other professional models.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFor bigger gifts for more advanced musicians, consider one of Fender’s Player II guitars. The iconic axe house has upgraded its most reliable models — the Stratocaster, Telecaster, Jazzmaster, Jaguar and more — with improved hardware, fresh colors and more.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIf you have a loved one who saw the Oasis reunion tour and won’t stop talking about it, get them one of these gorgeous prints by Sonic Editions. The shots of Liam and Noel Gallagher come in different sizes, and you can buy them pre-fitted in a black or white frame.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFor the vinyl collector in your life, there’s no more thoughtful present than a gift card to Rough Trade. The New York-based independent record store boasts vinyl editions from thousands of artists — from Justin Bieber to Led Zeppelin. But you’ll want to wait until Record Store Day next week when they announce dozens of vinyl-exclusive releases and Black Friday deals.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tQuestlove’s latest music history lesson is a chronicling of the first half-century of hip-hop. Of course, as a co-founder of the Roots, the Oscar and Grammy winner plays a role in hip-hop history, so the book functions as both a record and a personal reflection, full of stories no one else could tell.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMarshall’s Heston 60 soundbar is perfect companion device for any television or stereo system. It’s sleek and smaller than many alternatives, still providing crisp and punchy audio that clears up dialogue and deepens the bass. Mount it on the wall and turn any living room into a home theater.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThis gift is for the guitarist with a vintage soul — or for the guitarist who is always losing picks. This collectible tin is packed with 12 tortoiseshell picks of assorted gauges. And according to Fender, they’re stamped with the brand’s logo using original dyes from the 1960s.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFor the guitar player who likes to clean and restring their own instrument, this musician’s tool kit from Ernie Ball has all the necessary tools, including a microfiber polish cloth, heavy duty string cutter, peg wilder, screwdriver, wonder wipes and more.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThis 38″ record stand from Symbol is a beautiful and understated piece of furniture for any audiophile looking to store their turntable, stereo and vinyl collection. The item can hold up to 265 LPs, includes a stereo shelf and features a vibration-isolated turntable platform.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Night People,” which is subtitled “How to Be a DJ in ’90s New York City,” is the memoir of seven-time Grammy winner Mark Ronson. Before he was the decorated producer of songs like “Uptown Funk” and “Valerie,” Ronson was a teenaged crate-digging club rat in Downtown Manhattan. The book has been acquired by Warner Bros., so read it before it becomes a movie.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe Akai MPK Mini is the perfect device for both professional musicians and wannabe producers — or someone casually interested in making beats on their computer. With 25 keys, eight drum pads and eight assignable knobs, there are endless sounds and songs to be made on the digital instrument. It even comes with a software, providing everything one needs to start making music.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHedley & Bennett’s newest Grateful Dead collab includes canvas tote bags, aprons and chef’s knives decorated with Dancing Bears and “Steal Your Face” imagery. Check out more Grateful Dead gifts here.\n",

She followed up by asking Kelly to share more \"if you feel comfortable.\"\n      \n\n          Minka leaned back slightly, looking surprised by the sudden switch in subject. Though she appeared a bit unsure at first, she remained composed as Hager referenced the heartfelt birthday message Minka recently posted for Dan.\n      \n    \n          \"It was beautiful,\" Kelly replied with a small smile, adding, \"I'm very lucky. He's a really good guy.\" Her glance off camera suggested she was choosing her words thoughtfully, but she never shut the question down just handled it with hesitation.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Sensing the moment, Olivia stepped in with a warm story about working with Reynolds on an Imagine Dragons music video. Her praise of the musician helped lighten the mood, and Minka quickly relaxed. \"He's the best, they're all the best,\" Minka said, opening up more about Reynolds and his bandmates.\n      \n    \n          Kelly and Reynolds first sparked dating speculation in November 2022 after being spotted together in Los Angeles, shortly after his split from ex-wife Aja Volkman.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Dan Reynolds\n              \n                          \n                Minka Kelly\n              \n                          \n                Olivia Munn\n              \n                          \n                Jenna Bush\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Today Show\n              \n                          \n                Interview\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Couples\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

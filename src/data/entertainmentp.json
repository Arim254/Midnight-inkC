    "body": "\n\tJosh Safdie told Sean Baker during a recent episode of the A24 Podcast that an early draft of “Marty Supreme” took Timotheé Chalamet’s titular ping-pong star all the way through the late ‘80s, where he becomes a successful business owner. However, in the film’s final moment, Milton Rockwell, played by Kevin O’Leary, would take “a bite out of his neck,” paying off Rockwell’s “I’m a vampire” line earlier in the third act.\n\t\n\n\t“He turns that [shoe store] into the most successful shop on Orchard Street. He changes it to Marty Mauser’s Shoes,” Safdie said of the scraped ending. “Franchises, franchises again, leaves New York State, becomes a very rich man. All the metrics of success are there. His family grows, he leaves the city, has this beautiful house, and it ends with him at a concert for Tears for Fears with his granddaughter. They’re great seats, up front, and he’s watching it. And he’s thinking about ‘Everybody Wants to Rule the World,’ and youth, and what does it mean, and he has this success, but he’s not doing the thing that he believed he was born on the planet to do.”\n\n\n\tSafdie then dropped the punchline, “You’re on his eyes, we built the prosthetics for Timmy and everything, and Mr. Wonderful shows up behind him and takes a bite out of his neck, and that was the last image. And he hasn’t aged.”\n\n\tSafdie recalled that when A24 read the ending, studio execs asked him, “’This is a mistake, right?’”\n\n\tO’Leary recently told Variety that he was all for the vampiric payoff, sharing that Safdie “went as far as to make digital teeth.” He added, “I know that sounds nuts, but to me that would be the right punishment.”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Shark Tank” star shared that he was “really unsatisfied” with the conclusion of “Marty Supreme,” given that his character gets “fucked over” while Marty and his family have a “kumbaya ending.” O’Leary suggested Odessa A’Zion’s Rachel had to “die in childbirth” at the end as punishment for Marty Mauser’s selfishness. Safdie allegedly considered the change but ultimately deemed it too “sick.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow from Season 14, Episode 2 of “The Masked Singer,” “Fear Night,” which aired Jan. 14 on Fox. More details coming at 9 p.m. ET.\n\n\tTodd and Julie Chrisley, who were fully pardoned by Donald Trump last year after the reality stars were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud, were revealed on Wednesday as the celebrities under the Croissant costume on Fox’s “The Masked Singer.”\n\n\n\tThe Croissants were actually eliminated at the end of the season premiere episode last week, but the show ended on a cliffhanger. The Chrisleys were revealed at the start of Wednesday’s episode. Panelist Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg was right, guessing the Chrisleys, while Robin Thicke said it was Snooki and the Situation from “Jersey Shore,” Ken Jeong guessed Tim McGraw and Faith Hill and Rita Ora went with Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag.\n\t\n\n\tThe Chrisleys performed “Jailhouse Rock” on last week’s episode. Here was the voiceover from their performance last week: “’They were upper crust socialites. Living at the top. And it all came crumbling down.’ So it’s true, life was good. And we were inseparable. Until we were torn apart. That’s right. We were canceled, separated. And we didn’t know when we’d see each other again. It was the darkest moments of our lives. And just when I thought all hope was lost, a miracle. Out of nowhere, we’re back. Back. And best of all, reunited. We feel everyone just had the wrong idea about us. So we’re here to change it. And rise again. Together.”\n\n\tThe “Fear Night” episode is a tie-in with Fox’s new “Fear Factor: House of Fear,” which premieres right after “Masked Singer” on Wednesday. Host Johnny Knoxville was a guest on this week’s episode.Todd and Julie Chrisley as Croissant and David “Big Papi” Ortiz as Googly Eyes are the celebrities unmasked so far on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\t\n\n\tBack for Season 14 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists McCarthy-Wahlberg, Jeong, Ora and Thicke.\n\n\tNew this season is “America’s Insider,” in which singer, dancer and social media personality Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues for viewers. The twist: Cantrall is in costume, but will unmask for viewers — so the audience knows who she is, but the panelists don’t.\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment. Rosie Seitchik, Craig Plestis and Cannon are executive producers, while Seitchik serves as showrunner. The series is based on the South Korean format created by Mun Hwa Broadcasting Corp.\n\n\tCome back later tonight for the evening’s second unmasking.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEmilia Clarke called out “Game of Thrones” linguist David J. Peterson during a recent stop at “Late Night With Seth Meyers” while promoting her new Peacock espionage series “Ponies.” The Emmy nominee recalled feeling “hurt” and “really pissed” when she read an article in which Peterson was critical of the way she spoke Dothraki, one of the fictional languages on “Game of Thrones.”\n\n\t“I put so much energy into learning Dothraki,” Clarke said. “But the creator of the language, I read in an article, said I sucked at Dothraki. I was like, ‘What, bro?’ It’s not real! It’s not a real language! I can’t suck at it because me saying it on the TV, that’s how it goes… Honestly, I was so hurt. And then really pissed.”\n\t\n\n\tNot so fast, though. Peterson spoke to Entertainment Weekly after Clarke’s “Late Night” interview and said the actor was mistaken if she ever read criticism about her Dothraki accent. He clarified that yes, he believed Clarke’s Dothraki was somewhat wobbly on the show, but that’s exactly what was needed for her character, Daenerys Targaryen, since she was not a Dothraki native.\n\n\n\t“I think Emilia may have misunderstood what I said, because I’ve never criticized her Dothraki,” Peterson said in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. “Why would I? Her character was never supposed to speak it like a first language, so she never had to be good at it.”\n\n\t“Criticizing any imperfections in her Dothraki performance would be like criticizing Colin Firth for stuttering in ‘The King’s Speech.’ It would be entirely missing the point,” he continued. “In fact, grammatical and punctuation errors were built into many of her Dothraki lines — and these were included in the MP3s I recorded for her — for this very purpose… Emilia Clarke did a fine job with Dothraki, in that she was portraying a character who, through incredible hardship, is forced to learn a language she’s never heard before and eventually becomes functionally fluent in the manner of a non-native speaker — and in a relatively short amount of time.” \n\t\n\n\tIt’s unclear what interview Clarke read in which Peterson allegedly criticized her Dothraki accent. He spoke to Rolling Stone in 2017 and said the following: “It’s always funny to me to hear Emilia Clarke speak Dothraki. Of course, her character is not supposed to be fluent, and it really sounds… not fluent. It’s great for her character, she understands and she can speak. She just doesn’t sound quite right.”\n\n\tPeterson also commended Clarke’s work in a 2019 Vanity Fair interview, saying, “Emilia, thank you for everything you did. Your non-native, yet fluent Dothraki always sounded very nice, so well done.” \n\n\tClarke starred on all eight seasons of “Game of Thrones” and earned four Emmy nominations for her portrayal of Daenerys. She recently told The New York Times that she is not interested in returning to the fantasy genre, explaining: “You’re highly unlikely to see me get on a dragon, or even in the same frame as a dragon, ever again.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tTeyana Taylor addressed in a recent Vanity Fair cover story whether she has remained friends with Kanye West, despite his controversial behavior in recent years, including antisemitic remarks and his 2020 presidential run.\n\n\t“I don’t have to agree with everything that he does or says, but I’m not going to, like, abandon him and be like, ‘Yeah, eff that motherfucker,’” she told the publication.\n\n\n\tThe “One Battle After Another” star added, “My brothers do shit that I don’t agree with … I don’t get into none of that.”\n\t\n\n\tTaylor has collaborated with West on multiple projects in the past. The singer-actor starred in his 2016 “Fade” music video, becoming widely known for her dance routine in an empty gym. She also worked with West on his 2010 album “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” notably singing on the hook of the opening track. \n\n\tIn 2022, West posted on X that he was going to go “death con 3 on Jewish people,” weeks after promoting a “White Lives Matter” shirt at his Paris Fashion Week show. Adidas, Universal Music Group, Balenciaga and other major partners subsequently cut ties with him. Despite the backlash, the rapper continued to share antisemitic rants for the next several years. In one post in 2025, he declared, “I’m a Nazi,” and referred to Hitler as “so fresh.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Taylor shifted her focus to her acting career, landing a breakthrough role in the 2023 indie film “A Thousand and One.” This year, she won the Golden Globe for best supporting actress for her performance as Perfidia Beverly Hills in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another.” \n\t\n\n\tRead Taylor’s Vanity Fair cover story in its entirety here.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Star Trek: Starfleet Academy” can thank more than one member of the Kurtzman family for how it took shape. \n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, “Starfleet Academy” co-showrunner Alex Kurtzman said that interactions with his college-aged son and his son’s friends greatly informed how he approached the new Paramount+ series.\n\n\t“My wife and son and I are very close, and we feel very inside of his world,” Kurtzman said. “And so our house became the house where all of his friends come and congregate. So for many years, I’ve been listening to them talk, and we’ve both been amazed at how much they sound like us — but also how much they don’t sound like us.”\n\t\n\n\tHe went on to say that his son and his generation are contending not only with questions about their own futures, but whether there will be a future at all. “They’re able to grapple with that, and they’re also able to approach it with this incredible sense of optimism, and this kind of youthful exuberance of ‘anything’s possible.’ This is the first generation, I think, that’s truly holding both of those very condradictory things in their hands.”\n\n\n\tSet in the “Star Trek: Discovery” timeline of the 32nd century, “Starfleet Academy” begins with the United Federation of Planets just getting back on its feet after the devastating effects of a cataclysmic event known as The Burn roughly one century earlier. Keeping things in that timeline — and utilizing the dark ramifications of The Burn — was critical to the show, Kurtzman said.\n\n\t“If we had done, let’s just say the 24th century, it would have been a lovely fantasy, but it wouldn’t have been an accurate reflection of what certainly my son and his generation are going through now,” he said. \n\t\n\n\tLeading the cast are veteran actors Holly Hunter as academy chancellor Capt. Nahla Ake and Paul Giamatti as the villainous Nus Braka, a part Klingon-part Tellarite-part human pirate. With Hunter’s Ake, Kurtzman says that the more the writers developed the role, the more he came to realize the voice of the character matched Hunter’s.\n\n\t“The thing about Holly is that she’s capable of really any tone that you throw at her, because she always grounds whatever it is, even something as big and broad as ‘Raising Arizona’ in an emotional truth that is unique to Holly Hunter,” he said. \n\n\tAs for Giamatti, the “Starfleet Academy” team reached out to him after he revealed he had always wanted to play a Klingon. “We offered him, like, six roles, assuming he was going to be a one-off, that he would maybe do one episode,” Kurtzman said. “And he came back and said, ‘No, no, I want to be in this thing! I want to play the villain.”\n\n\tBut the heart of “Starfleet Academy” is its young cast of students, which includes Sandro Rosta, Karim Diané, Kerrice Brooks, George Hawkins and Bella Shepard. Maintaining a strong balance between the storylines of both the adults and the young cast was essential to making the show a success.\n\n\t“The death of this show would be if you’re 18 and watching the show, and every time the adults come on screen, you want to fast-forward to the next scene with a kid,” Kurtzman said. “It should be more like Harry Potter, in terms of loving everybody — and loving the teachers as much as you love the students.”\n\n\tThe first two episodes of “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy” premiere on Paramount+ on Jan. 15. \n",

The problems continued through the afternoon, with error reports for Verizon concentrated on the East Coast in cities including New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., as well as in other parts of the U.S. including Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Seattle, L.A. and San Francisco, according to Downdetector.\n\t\n\n\tThe cause of the major outage was not immediately known. In a social media post at 4:12 p.m. ET, Verizon’s media-relations team said, “Verizon’s team is on the ground actively working to fix today’s service issue that is impacting some customers. We know this is a huge inconvenience, and our top priority is to get you back online and connected as fast as possible. We appreciate your patience while we work to resolve this issue.”\n\n\n\tEarlier, the telecom provider said in a post at 1:07 p.m. ET that it was “aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers” and its engineers were working “to identify and solve the issue quickly.”\n\n\tOn social media, many Verizon customers said their phones showed “SOS” in place of wireless network bars. The outage prevented some Verizon users from making 911 calls, and officials in New York and Washington advised affected customers to use other wireless providers or landline phones to make emergency calls.\n\t\n\n\tSome AT&T and T-Mobile customers also reported service outages Tuesday — but those may have been related to an inability to reach customers on Verizon’s network. “T-Mobile’s network is keeping our customers connected, and we’ve confirmed that our network is operating normally and as expected,” T-Mobile said in a statement at 2:28 p.m. ET. “However due to Verizon’s reported outage, our customers may not be able to reach someone with Verizon service at this time.”\n\n\tAs of the end of September 2025, Verizon had 146.1 million total wireless retail connections as well as 3.2 million fixed wireless access broadband connections.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran TV writer and producer Don Reo, whose lengthy career includes everything from “MASH” and “The Golden Girls” to “Blossom,” “My Wife & Kids” and “Two and a Half Men,” will receive this year’s Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television Writing Achievement at the Writers Guild Awards. The honor, presented by the Writers Guild of America West, is given to a member who has “advanced the literature of television and made outstanding contributions to the profession of the television writer.”\n\t\n\n\tReo will receive the award during the 2026 Writers Guild Awards ceremony on Sunday, March 8, at JW Marriott L.A. Live Los Angeles. “Blossom” star Mayim Bialik will present the honor to Reo.\n\n\n\t“I am touched and honored to receive this wonderful award,” said Reo. “It gives me hope for the future.” Added Bialik: “Don Reo is a living legend: a master of the written word and an inspirational thinker and creator. I am honored to be a part of the acknowledgment of his diverse, hilarious, and phenomenal career.”\n\n\tEarly in his career, Reo worked as a staff writer on shows including “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In,” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” “All in the Family,” “Sanford and Son” and “MASH.” He also wrote on “The Golden Girls” and its spinoff series “Empty Nest.”\n\n\tAfter that, Reo created “Blossom,” followed by co-creating “The John Larroquette Show.” He was also showrunner on the short-lived but critically acclaimed Hollywood satire series “Action.”\n\n\tReo later co-created and executive produced “My Wife & Kids” with Damon Wayans, and he was a writer and exec producer on “Everybody Hates Chris.” Reo was an exec producer on “Two and a Half Men” through its 12-year run, and became co-showrunner with Jim Patterson in 2012.\n\t\n\n\tConsidered the WGA West’s highest honor for television writing, the Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television Writing Achievement last year went to “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan. Past recipients include Linda Bloodworth Thomason, Yvette Lee Bowser, Merrill Markoe, Jenji Kohan, Diane English, Aaron Sorkin, Steven Bochco, Susan Harris, Stephen J.

    "body": "\n\tNever work with kids or animals, the Hollywood cliche goes. Thankfully, actor Johnny Sequoyah didn’t pay attention.\n\n\tAs the lead of last weekend’s buzzy horror debut “Primate,” Sequoyah heads a cast of young stars in a battle for survival against a killer chimp – worse, one that was raised as a sibling to Sequoyah’s character. The film held its own at the box office against juggernaut “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and the sleeper hit “The Housemaid,” in part thanks to Sequoyah’s sensitive (but still terrifying) work under director Johannes Roberts (“47 Meters Down,” “The First Omen”).\n\t\n\n\tAt 23, Sequoyah is something of a veteran. She began acting at age 8, eventually landing the lead of the NBC series “Believe,” created by Alfonso Cuarón and Mark Friedman and executive produced by J.J. Abrams. As she enters a new chapter and looks toward adult roles, Sequoyah caught up with Variety to discuss her academic approach to the craft and the surprising way she used the late Jane Goodall to inform her performance.\n\n\n\tYour director, Johannes, has a very specific POV. How familiar were you with his work before you read for this part?\n\n\tI had always been too afraid to watch his films. I struggled to make it through “47 Meters Down” once I got this role. He is such a brilliant director in building suspense that it honestly was hard to watch his stuff in preparation. It’s that scary.\n\n\tHe said before that he originally imagined your character, Lucy, as a “nerd,” but you brought an interesting take in your audition that made him change his mind. What was it?\n\t\n\n\tI grounded myself in my relationship with the chimpanzee, Ben. I think that wasn’t the expected route to go, because it’s a horror movie, and you have to be scared. For me, what I thought was scariest was the thing you love most turning against you. I also took a big risk in my audition. I threw a very big “horror girl” scream in there. It wasn’t scripted.  I watched the producers, Johannes and our casting director jump out of their seats and land back in them. The casting director told me she peed a little.\n\n\tYou nailed it.\n\n\tIt was also in person, which I was so grateful for. I got to own this space and feed off their energy. I’m glad it worked out.\n\n\tIt’s probably so rare for an actor of your generation to get an in-person audition.\n\n\tOld school approach!\n\n\tIt’s also a big deal to be number one on the call sheet – on a theatrical movie, no less – at your age.\n\n\tI thought about my younger self a lot taking on this role. I was first on the call sheet as a kid, when I was about 10 years old. I was the lead of a television show called “Believe,” created by Alfonso Caron and J.J. Abrams. I hadn’t been since this movie. When it comes to leading a set, I think the most important thing is just being kind. You can let go of the expectations and the pressure if you come with kindness.\n\n\tWhat did you learn in between those “number one” experiences?\n\n\tGrowing up in the industry isn’t easy for anyone, and I also had some challenges. I was cast in the pilot for “American Housewife” but wasn’t attached to the rest of the series. I was only in the pilot.  I’ve taken experiences that have maybe made me feel ashamed — or even made me think, ”Oh, well, am I supposed to quit now?” — and I used them to work way harder. It’s almost like my war paint. I’m grateful for all of it. It’s made me take my craft more seriously.\n\n\tYou’re 23, I think you’re doing just fine. One of the impressive things about “Primate” is that there’s no CGI. There’s a performer in the chimp suit. Do you ever get used to that? Is it not terrifying every take?\n\n\tI felt like a kid in a candy shop. They don’t really make movies like this anymore. Ben was practical, our wounds were practical. We used a projector for the stars in the sky, our crew painted 1,000-foot murals for palm trees. There was so much love and craftsmanship and care in this film. Ben comprises a 50-person “chimp team,” and he was really scary. When he’s on top of you, your body doesn’t know what’s real or not. I walked off some takes uncontrollably shaking.\n\t\n\n\tWithout giving anything away, it seems like the big scene of the film is you hiding in a closet from Ben – a rickety old thing with slats you can barely see through.\n\n\tThat was the first day of filming. Victoria Wynat, who plays Kate, and I were thrown into the deep end. Neither of us had ever done a horror film, and I’m grateful that we started off there. It set the bar for what was expected from us. Walter Hamada, our producer, gave me an interesting piece of advice before we started. He said, “The audience will only ever be as scared as you are, so you have to be terrified.”\n\n\tYour director has said “Cujo” was a major inspiration point for this film. Did he show you any films or give you any reference points for your character?\n\n\tI love to prepare. I’m in a conservatory and I approach it like a student. I watched every monkey horror movie I could find. The top one is definitely “Monkey Shines.” It’s early ‘80s, and I really loved it. I also listened to a lot of Jane Goodall, her clips and biographies, to understand her research around chimps. I framed my character’s mom on Jane. In the film, my mother was a linguistics professor who was studying chimp and human connections. Who else better to learn from than Jane, the queen? I also did stunt training and learned ASL for this film.\n\n\tYou have Oscar winner Troy Kotsur in this movie. Talk about your dynamic.\n\n\tHe’s the best scene partner you could ever ask for. I was a little intimidated going into working with him, especially learning a new language. I wanted to show up accurately for the role and to work with him. He could not have been more kind. He really took so much time to sit down with me and work on the role and look at the script as a whole, and find moments that I could possibly bring in ASL\n\n\tWhat’s next for you? I hear you’re producing your own stuff now.I am focused on developing and producing my own content. I sold a show that I’m in development on. I can’t say anything more specific at the moment. But doing “Primate” has significantly helped me on my future projects, and I’m passionate about being on the other side of the camera, too.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 2 finale “Palm Royale,” “Maxine Does Something Good,” now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tAt first glance, Apple TV’s “Palm Royale” is a visually lavish, 1970-set satirical look at society climbers in south Florida. While Season 2 has kept its foot on the gas with the same stylish fun, it also digs much deeper. It peels back the glitz of the time and place to reveal a timely story about the power of women supporting each other and, as showrunner Abe Sylvia puts it, “The ways in which women band together to make their way in the world.”\n\t\n\n\tThe season finale dives into Norma/Agnes’ (Carol Burnett) mind, exploring a lifetime of choices and haunting regrets. Maxine (Kristen Wiig, who’s also an executive producer) shoots and kills Jed (Ryan Dorsey), who was in the act of trying to kill Evelyn (Allison Janney). It forces Maxine and Evelyn into a desperate but comedic “Laverne and Shirley”-like alliance, bonding them through shared secrets and a very big problem to get rid of.\n\n\n\tThe overall theme of female empowerment in the context of what was happening in the real world in the late-‘60s and ‘70s was a natural fit. “It creates enough distance for the audience so that we’re not telling a contemporary tale that’s overly moralizing,” Sylvia says. “We can have fun, we can set it in this fairytale universe, but still be extrapolating on really contemporary, evergreen themes.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe evolution of that premise didn’t happen overnight. In the show’s pilot, Maxine helps Dinah (Leslie Bibb) get an illegal, albeit safe, abortion in order to get find her way into the club. “I wrote that, thinking it was something that would’ve happened in that time. And that was before Dobbs was overturned,” Sylvia says. “Then it was like, the more things changed, the more they stay the same. And as we got into Season 2, we really leaned into that.”\n\t\n\n\tA pivotal moment comes as Douglas (Josh Lucas) and Mitzi’s (Kaia Gerber) wedding approaches, and Maxine tells him that he isn’t the father of Mitzi’s baby. He tells Maxine he wants his life with her back the way it used to be, but she’s not interested, and tells him, “I don’t care what you want.”\n\n\t“It showed the real Douglas, because he’s a little scary,” Wiig says. “It felt really good for me as Kristen to be able to tell Douglas, you know — ‘Fuck off!’” Wiig says with a laugh. “It’s heartbreaking, because it’s always been Maxine and Douglas, and you don’t want them to stop. But at that moment you’re like, ‘Oh no, they need to not be together.’”\n\n\tMaxine wants Douglas to marry Mitzi for the sake of the Mitzi’s pregnancy. That moment, when Maxine turns to him and says, “Don’t just do this for me, do it for all women in Palm Beach,” is an important step for her. “Maxine never thought she would ask him to go marry another woman and ‘Do it for me, do it for Evelyn and for Dinah and for a Mitzi. I owe these women this. After all I’ve done for you, will you do this thing for me?’” Sylvia says. “Not to moralize too much, but we were writing and shooting this in the middle of the election, and I remember Michelle Obama giving that wonderful speech where she’s appealing to men. That’s really what we’re touching on in that moment.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The moment when she, in a sense, finally says, ‘I’m not doing this anymore,’ it’s truly devastating at a level that’s incomprehensible to him,” Lucas says. “So then his only option — and this goes to this very specific kind of rich white male [mentality] — ‘Well then, I’m going to destroy you.’ If there’s a Season 3, the drama’s gonna come out of that moment. That’s where I think Douglas saw himself. My assumption is that that’s now when Douglas is gonna descend into the worst side of himself.”\n\n\tMaxine’s life changes in a very big way after that — she and Norma exchange apologies and, in a final, audacious twist rooted in Robert’s (Ricky Martin) custody battle for Rapheal (Ben Palacios), a surprising proposal surfaces that suggests Robert and Maxine get married. That neatly ties up more than one issue.\n\n\t“I think she doesn’t wanna be alone, and she kind of was alone with Douglas,” Wiig says. “Now she’s trying to create this other family with her friends. And I think she just wants people around her that love her, and she wants to have fun. She just wants to know her place and feel secure in it, rather than always trying so hard.”\n\t\n\n\tSylvia says that they knew from the very beginning that Robert and Maxine were going to get married in the finale. The question then became, he says, “Other than the fact that this is a non-traditional relationship between two people who love each other more than probably most married people do, how do we tell this in a different way?” With music, that’s how. As Norma reflects on her life, she expresses her feelings in song, with assorted couples voicing in shorts segments how they see their life playing out.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Let’s tell it from the perspective of people watching the wedding and what’s going through their minds, because at any wedding, that’s the most interesting thing,” Sylvia says. “It’s the feelings that the act of a marriage brings out in everyone else. That was the interesting thing to me. So when the lights go down and it falls out of time, Norma’s reflecting on her life — she can’t imagine that for all the bad that she’s done in her life, that it’s come to this beautiful moment.” Evelyn, Mitzi and Dinah all have similar moments of introspection.\n\n\tIn the end, Evelyn comes to terms with Eddie’s (Jason Canela) true feelings, Perry (Jordan Bridges) has political aspirations with Dinah at his side, Norma and Linda (Laura Dern) begin a life as mother and daughter — and Maxine and Evelyn take over Palm Royale, and set their sights on bigger adventures.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAll wrapped up in a pretty bow? Think again. Sylvia reveals there are plenty of places take this cast of characters, should Apple TV want “Palm Royale” to go on with a Season 3.\n\n\t“Happiness is fleeting,” Sylvia teases about potential new stories. “You have to live in your happiness, but trouble’s just around the corner. We wanted to leave the characters in a moment of suspended bliss. We’ve got a perfectly positioned Russian mole in Patti Lupone [Marjorie]. You’ve got Robert’s son, who is not all that he seems to be. You’ve got Maxine barreling towards motherhood. Is it going to be what it’s cracked up to be? The thing that she’s always wanted was to be a mother. Well, now she is one, and the son’s most likely some kind of plant coming for her money. Dinah is now a political wife, and that’s not necessarily a happy ending for her.”\n\n\tHe adds: “While we leave on an effervescent note, they live in Palm Beach. When Maxine and Evelyn are looking at each other and Maxine says, ‘We’re at the center of the town that runs the world, so what’s next?’ And Evelyn says, ‘The world,’ we planned it that way. So it’s like, let’s go out on big applause, but we’ve got lots of places we can go.”\n\t\n\n\tWiig puts it this way: “I honestly don’t know what Season 3 has in store, but I think with any of the women, the more power they have, the more dangerous they are.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

Video appears to show physical contact between Ross and the vehicle.\n      \n    \n          Tuesday night, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News Digital ... \"There is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.\" The incident was being investigated by the FBI ... the bureau excluded Minnesota state investigators from the case last week.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The Trump Administration maintains Ross shot Good in self-defense.\n      \n    \n          In the aftermath of the shooting, GoFundMe campaigns have been launched for each party involved. The campaign for Ross has raised more than $700K since it launched over the weekend. The fundraiser benefiting Good's wife and son has surpassed $1 million.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          It's unclear if Ross will be able to accept his donations, as federal government employees can't receive any supplementations to their salaries as compensation for their services, according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.\n      \n    \n          The events of Jan. 7 are still under investigation.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Renee Nicole Good\n              \n                          \n                Jonathan Ross\n              \n                          \n                ICE\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

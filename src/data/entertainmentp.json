    "body": "\n\tVietnam‘s “Fish, Fists and Ambergris” (original title: “Long Diên Hương”) is heading to international screens, with Southeast Asia-based distributor Mockingbird Pictures steering a worldwide theatrical rollout and a streaming deal with Netflix covering the region.\n\n\tThe 89s Group production proved a solid commercial performer at home, selling upward of 2.5 million tickets and taking in around $8 million at the Vietnamese box office.\n\t\n\n\tThe film centers on two impoverished brothers whose fortunes appear to change when a chunk of ambergris – the rare, ocean-derived substance sometimes dubbed the “floating gold” of the sea – turns up on the shores of their coastal village. Their bid to cash in on the find quickly unravels into a dangerous pursuit, as smugglers and rivals close in and an unlikely band of companions, including a resourceful fish vendor and a volatile local troublemaker, get swept up in the mayhem. The deeper the brothers wade into the chase, the more the prized commodity comes to symbolize something more fraught than a simple windfall.\n\n\n\tThe film opened theatrically in North America on Jan. 30. Cambodia follows on April 17, with Taiwan and other Asian territories currently being finalized. A Netflix launch across all 11 Southeast Asian territories is set for March 5.\n\n\t“We created ‘Fish, Fists and Ambergris’ to capture the resilient spirit of Vietnam’s coastal communities,” said producer Mai Bảo Ngọc of 89s Group. “At its heart, the film is a universal story of human connection, redemption, and the difficult choices people make to survive. We are thrilled that audiences across Southeast Asia will now be able to experience and connect with this deeply emotional journey.”\n\t\n\n\tProducer Võ Thanh Hoà framed the project within the company’s wider ambitions. “This film represents a bold new chapter for Vietnamese cinema and reflects our 89s Group philosophy of ‘Local Story, Global Telling,'” said Võ Thanh Hoà. “By blending dynamic action with the rich cultural heritage surrounding the legend of ambergris, we are proud to present a distinctly Vietnamese cinematic experience to audiences across the region and beyond.”\n\n\tPhong Duong, business director of Mockingbird Pictures, pointed to the film’s local performance as evidence of Vietnamese cinema’s broadening appeal. “The breakout success of ‘Fish, Fists and Ambergris’ in Vietnam demonstrates the strength and international potential of Vietnamese cinema,” said Phong Duong. “At Mockingbird Pictures, our focus is to connect Vietnamese and Asian films with global partners and audiences. We are proud to lead the film’s international rollout and to continue expanding the global presence of Vietnamese storytelling.”\n\n\tMockingbird Pictures has been an active force in taking Vietnamese content abroad, having previously handled international sales on Victor Vu’s supernatural thriller “Detective Kien: The Headless Horror.” The company is a regular presence at major markets including the Cannes Film Market, Busan’s Asian Contents & Film Market and Hong Kong FilMart.\n\n\tFurther theatrical release dates are expected to be confirmed in the coming months.\n",

    "body": "\n\t Casting directors Francine Maisler (“Sinners”) and Nina Gold and Douglas Aibel (“Jay Kelly”) were among the film winners at the 41st annual Casting Society Artios Awards.\n\n\tThe ceremony honors top casting in the year’s films, TV and theater. The celebrations took place in Los Angeles, New York and London with What We Do in the Shadows” actor Harvey Guillén hosting the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Jeff Hiller from “Somebody Somewhere” hosting at the Edison Ballroom in New York City. “Baby Reindeer” star Jessica Gunning hosted the London Ceremony at One Moorgate Place.\n\t\n\n\tOn the TV side, the casting directors behind “The Pitt” (Cathy Sandrich Gelfond, Associate Casting Director: Seth Caskey) and “The Studio” (Melissa Kostenbauder, Francine Maisler, Associate Casting Director: Jesse Haddock) were winners. \n\n\n\tThe Casting Society also handed out special honors. The Lynn Stalmaster Award for Career Achievement was presented to Ayo Davis, president of Disney Branded Television and the Rosalie Joseph Humanitarian Award was presented posthumously to casting director and former CSA Administrator Laura Adler and The Hoyt Bowers Award for Excellence in Casting was awarded to casting director Julie Ashton. In New York, the Marion Dougherty New York Apple Award was presented to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. \n\n\tDuring her speech, Davis said, “What I love about casting is that it taught me how to really see people. Not just the person who walks into the room, but who they could become. That diamond in the rough who stays with you long after they leave the room. When (as a casting executive) your #1 priority becomes translating that potential into language that producers and executives can understand, trust, and ultimately believe in — helping to complete the puzzle in a way that elevates the entire story. Because casting is an art… but it is also advocacy.”\n\t\n\n\tIn London, The Global Impact Award was presented to GAP Workshops and The Capelier-Shaw Award for Excellence in Casting was awarded to casting director Kate Rhodes James. The Associate Casting Director Spotlight Award recipients were presented to Leslie Wasserman in Los Angeles and Dustin Presley in New York.\n\n\tThe full list of winners for feature film and London Theatre categories is below.\n\n\tFeature: Big Budget: Comedy\n\n\t“Jay Kelly”: Douglas Aibel, Nina Gold, Associate Casting Director: Matthew Glasner, Location Casting Directors: Francesco Vedovati, Barbara Giordani\n\n\tFeature: Big Budget: Drama\n\n\t“Sinners”: Francine Maisler, Associate Casting Directors: Molly Rose, Amber Wakefield, Location Casting Director: Meagan Lewis\n\n\tFeature: Animated \n\n\t“Zootopia 2”: Grace C.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains major plot details for Thursday’s episode of ABC’s ”9-1-1: Nashville.”\n\n\tIt’s the moment all “9-1-1: Nashville” fans have been waiting for: the origin story of Don Hart (Chris O’Donnell), his old flame Dixie Bennings (LeAnn Rimes) and his wife Blythe Hart (Jessica Capshaw).\n\n\tTitled “Don Begins,” the episode flashes between the present day in Nashville with the 113 back to when Don was a young boy who suffered through the trauma of his parents and baby sister dying during an arson at their family home. That same night, little Don meets little Dixie, who happened to live down the street from him with her grandmother. Dixie and her grandmother comfort Don and stay with him at the hospital as he waits for CPS to come and his whole life to change. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDon and Dixie as young children in “9-1-1: Nashville” Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTime then skips ahead to when Don was a young adult (played by Ben Winchell) and crossed paths with Dixie (Noa Bess Solomon) once again — this time when they’re both stuck in a jail cell overnight. Once they were out and able to reconnect, their love story properly began. They moved in to a tiny apartment together, he supported her in her music career, she supported him in his firefighter training, and their life together was lovely until it started to unravel due to stress and time.\n\n\n\tDon eventually meets and falls in love with Blythe (younger version played by Hunter King) when Dixie takes off to go on tour as a backup dancer for Faith Hill and he figures out what he wants to do with the rest of his life. When Dixie returns and wants to pick things back up, it’s too late. Don and Blythe are so close that Blythe has gotten the Nashville Police Department to reopen his family’s arson case, leading to the arrest of the killer. \n\t\n\n\tThe episode ends with one more flashback, this time to the night Dixie and Don slept together — conceiving their son Blue — when he was separated from his wife Blythe.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLeAnn Rimes as Dixe in “9-1-1: Nashville” Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It was so cool to know that this was coming and that people really got a glimpse into the origin story of Dixie and Don,” Rimes told Variety. “I think it gives you a different point of view on these characters from here on out. It changes the dynamic between Don and Dixie. I think people have seen Dixie in all of her manipulative ways. But I think that now, seeing young Dixie and the heart of her through Noa, who is just, she’s so brilliant. In this episode seeing her portray Dixie, this wild heart and just the heart of her before life got a hold of her and turned her into a more bitter kind of manipulative flair. It is so fun for me as an actress to play all these different layers of her.”\n\n\tRimes added: “I’ve seen so many people conflicted, ‘We love her, we hate her.’ It’s back and forth depending on the episode. And now I think they’re really going to be conflicted, because you really see the connection that Don and Dixie had.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Winchell as Young Don and Noa Bess Solomon as Young Dixie on “9-1-1: Nashville” — Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnother reason why the episode was a special one for Rimes, though she was only playing Dixie in the current timeline, was she wrote and performed a song as young Dixie called “Wild Things Run.” Solomon originally sang the song while shooting, but Rimes recorded the vocals two weeks ago to be used on top of the scene. And in order to do that, Rimes had to make some adjustments to the way she sings these days.\n\n\t“Her voice is my voice, and I had to make myself sound 20 years younger,” Rimes said. “I took all the bottom end out of my voice, and kind of just did the whole resonating through like my nasal area. And it took me back to the ‘Coyote Ugly’ days when I had to do that for Piper Perabo’s voice.”\n\n\tRimes pitched the idea of her writing a song for the show when “9-1-1: Nashville” showrunner Rashad Raisani first told her he was plotting this origin story episode for Dixie and Don.\n\n\t“I know they have so many great writers for the show, but when I heard that they were looking for a song that kicked off Dixie’s career, I was like, this is what I do,” Rimes, who co-wrote “Wild Things Run” with collaborator Darrell Brown, said. “I do write music and sing for a living. So utilize me. And I went to Rashad and said, ‘Hey, I want to take a stab at this, because I think it would be so powerful for someone who’s lived in this character to write for her.’ And he said absolutely. So he sent me the first draft of the montage scene, just to give me an idea where to jump off from. And I was laying on a massage table in Hawaii and the title ‘Wild Things Run’ came to me. And I was saying, oh, man, it’s perfect, because it felt like that was kind of these two wild hearts as youngsters running towards each other and then running away.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Winchell as Young Don and Hunter King as Young Blythe on “9-1-1: Nashville” — Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBy the end of the present-day timeline in the episode, Don is making a testimonial on behalf of the man who killed his family, offering forgiveness but not to forget. Blythe thanks Dixie for helping Don reach that moment of peace through an earlier conversation when they shared their memories of the night of the fire. But when Blythe and Dixie part, it’s with Dixie declaring once more that the “universe” will always bring her and Don back together.\n\n\tAnd Rimes says Dixie isn’t just antagonizing Blythe — she means it.\n\n\t“Oh, I think she knows that that’s very true,” Rimes said. “She thinks it’s really, constantly, from the very beginning they can’t seem to get away from each other. And she’s clearly always going to be in love with this man. And I mean, it’s her baby daddy. But it’s not just that. I think there is a real connection and a real pull and history that Blythe and Don don’t have. And I think maybe it’s the universe, and maybe it’s also Dixie always putting herself in the line of fire that, she always somewhat makes herself available to that, too. But I think there is this real connection; that she truly believes, no matter what, they’re going to be connected in some way.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tPeter Shaffer’s “Amadeus” is, at heart, a great love triangle. At one vortex, there’s 18th century composer Antonio Salieri, wavering between piety ",
    "body": "\n\tPeter Shaffer’s “Amadeus” is, at heart, a great love triangle. At one vortex, there’s 18th century composer Antonio Salieri, wavering between piety and murderous peevishness. At another corner, there’s the God whose favor Salieri craves, quite unrequitedly. And then, standing between them, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, God’s true love, or at least it seems to Salieri for a while. It’s a pleasure to report that all three of these roles are exceptionally well-played in a splendid new production at the Pasadena Playhouse, here to remind us that genius and the lack of it can both be hell.\n\t\n\n\tGod does not have a speaking role in “Amadeus,” being an absentee kind of guy, but he does occasionally loom over the proceedings, projected onto the stage house’s back wall as a spooky, painted projection seen just long enough to be established as the apparently disinterested foil for Salieri’s entitled prayers. As far as the actual casting goes, anyone who’s seen the 1979 Broadway play (oft-revised by Shaffer) or the hit 1984 movie comes in knowing this is really going to be a two-hander… bordering at times on a one-hander. As Mozart, Sam Clemmett is wonderful, carefully navigating the silliness and sullenness of a character who’s been drawn as part boy, part man. But it’s no slight to what Clemmett is doing to be reminded that the title of “Amadeus’” is an act of misdirection, and that Salieri sucks up all the main character energy in the drawing room. This ingratiating villain spends so much of the final monolog going on about being the “patron saint of mediocrity,” he’s pretty much daring any actor who plays him to show up with anything short of greatness.\n\t\n\n\tJefferson Mays is the man for that job. Nothing against more evenly proportioned ensemble dramas, but 22 years after he won the Tony for the one-actor show “I Am My Own Wife,” Mays is giving the kind of singular performance that we all go to the theater for and remember in years to come. It’s a portrayal that sits right at the intersection of ridiculously flamboyant, allowing us to stew, at leisure, in someone else’s juices for a bitter yet delicious two hours and 45 minutes. The most recently revised version of the play is bookended by long stretches of an apparently dying Salieri — decrepit but more poisonous than ever — alone on stage, to the point where even Shakespeare might look at the script and go, “Too many soliloquies.” But who’s to mind, when you’ve got an actor as great as Mays treating the audience as his gossip-hungry confidante, when he’s not bugging the Almighty with a longer list of grievances than Job’s? Bring it all on; we could listen to Mays deliver these death rattles if they went on till dawn.\n\n\tNot to suggest that “Amadeus” is truly a one-man show, and even positioning it as just an actor’s showcase would be doing this production a disservice. Because even if its Salieri were actually mediocre, the show would still be worth a visit just for every other element firing on all cylinders — most obviously Alexander Dodge’s striking and clever scenic design, followed by costuming by Linda Cho that looks as if every bit was handmade to complement Dodge’s color schemes. (The Playhouse has its own rare on-site scene shop, while Cho’s costumes were made by the folks at downtown’s L.A. Opera.) Under the direction of Darko Tresnjak — who won his Tony directing Mays 12 years ago in “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder” — this overdue revitalization of “Amadeus” is among the most thrilling recent examples of the Pasadena Playhouse consistently punching above its weight.\n\n\tPablo Santiago’s lighting design is top-notch, too, in pulling all these other visual threads together. But there’s nothing to dimly light up a room quite like Salieri’s gaslighting. In his many scenes with Clemmett’s Mozart, Mays comes off as so genuinely attentive and supportive that you might find yourself wishing, against all sense, that the earnestness was genuine, and that the genius might be recognized and the arts fully supported. But this is Vienna, not Pasadena, so…\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEnsemble in ‘Amadeus’ at the Pasadena Playhouse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe first sight that greets a Playhouse upon lights going down is enough to elicit a very slight gasp from an audience. Behind a scrim painted with the notes of Mozart’s “Phantasie für eine Orgelwalze,” there’s the first glimpse of the magically elongated room that will remain the show’s sole set, a sight that’s intriguing and eye-tickling enough to leave you feeling just fine about the prospect of no major scenic changeovers for the next three hours. It’s a forced-perspective rendering of a hall that seems to extend halfway to Pasadena’s Old Town. (Later on, that will make for a pretty good visual gag when the actor who’s by far the tallest in the show, Matthew Patrick Davis as Emperor Joseph II, climbs through one of the small doors on the far end.) Part of the ensemble stands supernaturally perched over this crimson room, elevated, like a biblical cloud of witnesses gathered to watch the beginning of this slightly demonic fable.\n\n\tAnd then, for most of the introductory stretch, it is Mays’ scenery to chew — and we say that lovingly, because he is a bit like a fleshier version of the Crypt Keeper, when we meet him in his most rickety capacity, not so much raging against the dying of the light as against the memory of the frenemy, Mozart, who died 33 years earlier. Mays is wheelchair-bound for this wheezing prelude, so there’s a bit of a magic act that seems to happen when he is transformed into a young Salieri for most of what follows. Fellow cast members turn the chair around and perform some ministrations, and when we suddenly see him turned back around, transformed, we’re convinced they must have done some kind of makeup job while Mays’ back was turned. But then it happens again, later in the play, with the actor facing the audience, and we realize that really all that happened in either transformation is the addition or removal of a wig that covers up a bald pate and age spots. The second instance is kind of an “illusionist reveals the trick” moment, and the trick is… maybe not so surprisingly… acting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJefferson Mays in ‘Amadeus’ at the Pasadena Playhouse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOnce we’ve gotten quite a good dose of that opening spittle, the action moves on to scenes from decades earlier being recalled by Salieri — a character that has been called an unreliable narrator over the years, but actually seems a lot more reliable than he’s been given credit for. Having been warned that a former child prodigy is coming to town, Salieri first happens to spy Mozart playing a naughty game of hide-and-seek with his wife-to-be, Constanze Weber (Lauren Worsham), in and out of her skirt. Maybe it’s meant to be suggested that Salieri is remembering Mozart as more childish than he really was. But beyond some introductory goofiness, the composer that many consider the greatest of all time is not portrayed as being as much of an idiot savant as he was in the Milos Forman movie. Then, Tom Hulce gave us certainly the most vivid Mozart we could ever get, with that unforgettable giggle. That was a fine choice, in drawing sharp contrasts for a fable about how unchoosy the Almighty can be in picking his prime vessels. But to the extent that audiences may want to believe that the character really could have composed all those masterpieces — with or without channeling the divine — it may be helpful to have him feel more grounded, as in the portrayal here by Clemmett (known for “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story” and playing Albus Potter on Broadway in “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”). He veers more toward adult than child in the man/boy equation, but we see just enough of him as a sweetly arrogant Li’l Rascal to understand why a humorless rival might devote his life to ruining him. He’s Goofus, to Salieri’s Gallant, but also touched by God, a mixture that never gets old, or at least hasn’t since 1979.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSam Clemmett and Lauren Worsham in ‘Amadeus’ at the Pasadena Playhouse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf you really started to internalize the themes in “Amadeus,” you might start to develop a mid-show ulcer to rival whatever maladies there are that begin to sap Mozart of his strength. Every time Salieri starts to fool Mozart again, you may have the impulse to shout at the stage the way someone might at a horror movie screening. The idea that some of the greatest artists of all time were treated poorly or forgotten during their lifetimes? That’s about as upsetting to dwell on as anything in the news right now. So it’s a good thing that Mays is able to make Salieri actually feel like a good hang, unlike most of our real-life villains. The framing device for the play makes it pretty clear how things are going to turn out, so there’s only so much creeping dread to deal with, as we see Mozart be dealt the bad cards of poverty, illness and those notes about “too many notes.” There’s plenty of satisfying comic justice to come when Salieri is left alone to his own devices — and to spend a lot of climactic alone time with the audience — long after his bete noire is gone. He suffers a fate worse than death: living too long. And boy, does Mays wring some laughs out of that, even as he appears increasingly corpselike.\n\n\tThere are so many pleasures along the way, even if that tiny knot is developing in your stomach. Like: some great tunes. The instrumentation is pre-recorded, naturally. (If you do want to hear a full orchestra play this stuff, there will be a live-to-picture performance at the Hollywood Bowl on Sept. 3, with the L.A. Phil delivering every cue.) But there are some real operatic voices on stage for the performance scenes, principally Michelle Allie Drever and Alaysha Fox, and it’s like taking a wonderful vacation from all the seriocomic anxiety any time real singers pop in to show us what all the verbal jousting and jealousy has been about. Rock me, “Amadeus,” indeed.\n\n\tIs there an appetite to revive “Amadeus” on Broadway? There ought to be. (Right now there’s a five-part Sky series that adapts this same material that has been just picked up by Starz for the U.S., which may offer an indication of how much hunger Americans have to see a variation on this particular cat-and-mouse game right now.) It’s hard not to believe that if producers were to keep building a house for Mays to do his thing, they will come. Certainly all of us who’ve suffered from imposter syndrome at one point or another deserve a chance to come identify with, if not bow to, the ultimate embodiment of a guy tortured with the secret knowledge that he really is overrated. No one will ever play just-good-enough greater than Mays does.\n\t\n\n\t“Amadeus” runs at the Pasadena Playhouse through March 15. For tickets, call 626-356-7529 or visit Pasadena Playhouse.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Bonta, California’s Attorney General, is promising to conduct a “vigorous” review of Paramount Skydance’s acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery as he warned the companies not to get ahead of the regulatory process in their celebrations.\n\n\t“Paramount/Warner Bros is not a done deal. These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,” Bonta said in a statement issued Thursday evening. \n\t\n\n\tBonta’s missive came at the end of a day of extraordinary twists and turns that have put Paramount Skydance in position to buy up Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. After raising its bid price by $1 a share, WBD board members had little choice but to accept that offer. Netflix, which had previousy sealed a sale agreement with WBD in December, had the right to match. But Netflix cut bait early, issuing a statement saying that the deal was “no longer financially attractive” with the price tag growing.\n\n\n\tBonta had already put Netflix and WBD on notice that the Golden State would take a hard look at the consolidation of a legacy Hollywood studio with the industry’s dominant subscription streaming platform.  Bonta’s move from the deep-blue state of California adds to the political backdrop swirling around big business, particularly Big Media at a time when President Trump himself regularly bashes mainstream entertainment and news outlets.\n\n\tOn Tuesday, before Netflix pulled out of the hunt for WBD, a coalition of 11 state attorneys general — all Republicans — urged the Department of Justice to carefully scrutinize the Netflix-Warners deal. In a letter, the attorneys general warned that the deal “will likely result in undue market concentration that stifles competition and therefore creates higher prices, lower reliability, and less innovation.”\n\t\n\n\tThey also expressed concerns that streaming subscribers will face higher prices, and that the merger will be bad for the theater business. Noting that the U.S. remains the “world leader in movies,” the letter closed with a premonition: “Netflix’s quest to become ‘the one platform to rule them all’ through its acquisition of Warner Brothers threatens this dominance.”\n\n\tThe 11 attorneys general represent the following states: Alabama, Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFormer “Grey’s Anatomy” star Eric Dane died on Feb. 19, one week ago — and in Thurday’s episode of the long-running ABC drama, the show paid tribute to him and to his character, Dr. Mark Sloan, in a video at the end of the episode. The 65-second-long McSteamy montage was set to Tommee Profitt & Fleuries’ cover of Snow Patrol’s “Chasing Cars,” a song that was made iconic after being used in the show’s Season 2 finale when Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) died and Izzie (Katherine Heigl) wouldn’t let go of him. Different versions of “Chasing Cars” have been used on “Grey’s” and in its promos ever since to great effect, always to underscore an emotional event. (The full video is below.)\n\t\n\n\tDane joined the cast of “Grey’s Anatomy” in Season 2, playing a plastic surgeon and a ladies’ man — Mark, nicknamed McSteamy, was the best friend of Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) whose affair with Derek’s wife Addison (Kate Walsh) had broken up that marriage. Mark Sloan proved to be a popular character, and Dane became a series regular in Season 3. He died during Season 8, after a bunch of the hospital’s doctors were in a plane crash. Nevertheless, Dane appeared in a few more times on the show, including with Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) in Season 19 when she was in a hallucinatory state from COVID, and characters who had died on the show visited her.\n\n\tDane was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2025; despite his terminal illness, he played an ALS patient on NBC’s “Brilliant Minds” in the fall, and completed filming Season 3 of “Euphoria,” on which he played Cal Jacobs. “Euphoria” will premiere on HBO on April 12.\n\t\n\n\tDane’s death prompted an outpouring of grief from his colleagues at “Grey’s Anatomy,” from creator Shonda Rhimes to Heigl to Walsh and beyond, all of whom wrote loving tributes to him on social media.\n\n\tThe video, with “Chasing Cars” playing, begins with Mark’s earliest appearances, when he referred to himself and Meredith as the “dirty mistresses” through his becoming a father. Mark’s advice to Jackson (Jesse Williams) from his deathbed plays over a montage: “If you love someone, you tell ’em, even if you’re scared that it’s not the right thing. Even if you’re scared that it will burn your life to the ground, you say it. You say it loud.”\n\n\tWatch the “Grey’s Anatomy” tribute to Eric Dane below.\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe surprise news Thursday that Netflix was ending its pursuit of Warner Bros. caught nearly everyone in Hollywood off guard, including staffers ins",
    "body": "\n\tThe surprise news Thursday that Netflix was ending its pursuit of Warner Bros. caught nearly everyone in Hollywood off guard, including staffers inside Warner Bros., Paramount and Netflix. The reaction, of course, varied — depending on which side of the Hollywood Hills you sat, what division you’re a part of and even your political persuasion.\n\n\t“It’s obviously very upsetting to employees,” said one exec inside Warner Bros., who described the news as a “gut punch.” Employees at the studio were said to be holding out hope that Netflix would come up with a new bid to out-maneuver Paramount Skydance‘s “superior proposal,” and thought they’d at least have four days to keep their fingers crossed. But then came Thursday afternoon’s swift announcement that the streamer had bowed out.\n\t\n\n\tSeveral miles away from Burbank on Melrose Avenue, the champagne was literally being popped open as execs there celebrated their turn of fortune, and also breathed a sigh of relief that their long campaign to nab Warner Bros. had won a decisive battle.\n\n\n\t“There were tears of exhaustion and happiness,” said one exec, who said it had been hard to focus on the business at hand inside Paramount Skydance when there was so much work to be done in trying to win the derby for Warner Bros.\n\n\tAnd at Netflix, when the streamer announced shortly before 3 p.m. PT that it was giving up on its Warner Bros. bid, there was a lot of instant rumbling in the halls of Netflix’s Hollywood offices. There were audible sounds of “Whoa” and other surprised noises emanating from offices and cubicles.\n\t\n\n\tQuestion number one inside Warner Bros. is now what becomes of the company — its staff, its culture, its storied Burbank lot. \n\n\tThe fate of many jobs on the studio production side is a big question mark, both in film and TV. There’s a general sense that 1+1 will still equal 1, as a combined Paramount/Warner Bros. will need to shed some of its production infrastructure, particularly in TV — where the company will now own Warner Bros. TV Group (which includes Warner Bros. TV, Warner Bros. Unscripted & Alternative TV, Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios), CBS Studios and Paramount Television Studios. \n\n\t“Think about the bloodletting of thousands of employees at CBS and Paramount, and now it will be more. Just awful,” says an insider. “It’s really going to be a shakeup for the whole community, the losses of jobs and content. Places to sell, places to buy.”\n\n\tAnother Warner Bros. exec, weary of what the company has been through over the past decade (including four owners between Time Warner, AT&T, Warner Bros. Discovery and now Paramount Skydance), just sighed. “Another day, another merger. I just make shows. That’s all I do. Head down, make the show,” she said.\n\n\tAt Paramount Skydance, there was some relief because departments had been at a bit of a standstill while waiting to see how the challenge for Warner Bros. played out. In particular, some lean departments inside Paramount Skydance had been holding off on staffing up, specifically because they wanted to wait and see if they’d be merging with Warner Bros. (which would then create redundancies). After last year’s massive layoffs, several divisions inside Paramount Skydance (such as the cable outlets and the last vestiges of Showtime) have been cut to the bone.\n\n\tThat might give some Warner Bros. staffers hope that, depending on the division, there will be room for them in the combined company. \n\n\tBut there are so many more questions than answers. Will HBO Max and Paramount+ continue as separate entities, or eventually merge? Will Paramount Skydance sell the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank? And what happens to CNN, particularly given Donald Trump’s desire to mute his critics?\n\n\t“Look at what they’ve done to CBS News,” said a Warner Bros. Discovery insider. \n\n\tAs for whether the Paramount-Warner Bros. merger will create a culture clash between the two historic companies, one Par insider pointed out that their studio didn’t really have much of a cohesive culture anymore, given its recent mergers with CBS and Skydance, then coupled with all of its layoffs. Contrast that with Warner Bros., where staffers still boast a solidarity that the company has managed to maintain despite a decade of management shifts.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s less angst inside Netflix, as one insider there said sentiments among staffers about losing the WBD deal seemed to range widely from relief to disappointment. Without any prompting from leadership, there was much discussion in the hallways that Netflix made the right call to exert financial discipline and not get caught up in the hunt.\n\n\tThat said, some did express frustration at missing out on content development opportunities from the Warner Bros vault. There had been excitement about bringing WBD’s considerable capabilities to produce TV shows and movies into the company that still does not have a large studio arm. Calling the deal off also squashes a host of questions Netflix insiders had about how HBO and Netflix would realistically co-exist in the same company, another staffer said. “I guess doesn’t matter any more who Casey Bloys will or won’t report to,” the staffer quipped, referring to industry chatter about the HBO chief.\n\n\tOutside of Warner Bros., Netflix and Paramount Skydance, there was plenty of cynicism in a town already scarred from a decrease in production and tremendous job losses. “The new company will be saddled with $87 billion in debt,” said one observer. “To put that in context, in four years, Warner Bros. Discovery took more than $50 billion in debt and was only able to reduce it to $30 billion. So this has double that debt load, and all you’re doing is adding Paramount to it.”\n\n\tElsewhere, the reaction was also one of concern: California attorney general Rob Bonta wrote that “Paramount/Warner Bros is not a done deal. These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.”\n\n\tWatchdog groups also shared their alarm, focusing on Paramount Skydance’s impending control of both CBS News and CNN: “The Ellisons have already promised the Trump administration that they’ll make sweeping changes to CNN given the chance, and we know what the means: firing journalists, spiking important stories, and replacing the news with empty propaganda,” said Free Press co-CEO Craig Aaron. “This deal endangers our democracy by giving a family of pliant billionaires even more control of vast swaths of our news coverage, TV stations and movie studios. Allowing more mergers in the already highly concentrated movie business will harm filmmakers and industry workers when Paramount delivers on its promise to make deep cuts to please its Wall Street backers. While a few Hollywood execs and sovereign-wealth fund managers in the Middle East might get rich from this deal, thousands and thousands of American workers will lose their jobs.”\n\t\n\n\tSaid Freedom of the Press Foundation chief of advocacy Seth Stern: “Ellison will readily throw the First Amendment, CNN’s reporters and HBO’s filmmakers under the bus if they stand in the way of expanding his corporate empire and fattening his pockets. But censorship is bad for business.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSeries Mania unveiled 15 new projects selected for its Co-Pro Pitching Sessions, which will take place on March 24 as part of the Series Mania Forum (March 24-26).\n\n\tThe winner will be awarded €50,000 ($59,000) and will be chosen by Alexandre Piel, Laura Mae Harding, Alon Aranya and Johanna Gårdare. Jorge Pezzi, head of fiction and entertainment at Spain’s Movistar Plus+, will serve as jury president. \n\n\n\tThe 16th project, “Gold,” was announced on Feb. 17 as part of the Berlinale’s Co-Pro Series Market. It will be excluded from the competition for the Pitchng Sessions’ Grand Prize. \n\t\n\n\tAmong the lineup which is packed by thrillers, one of Iceland’s leading production companies, Glassriver, will present “Konrad” based on best-selling novels by Arnaldur Indriðason. In the story, a retired Icelandic detective is pulled back into his dark past, confronting personal demons on a painful road to redemption.\n\n\t“This series is based on a best-selling IP from an author whose work has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, bringing a built-in global audience,” pointed out creator and writer Andri Óttarsson.\n\n\t“Drawing from the first two books in the series, it follows an older, retired and deeply flawed protagonist – not a heroic detective archetype, but a man seeking moral redemption – in a psychological character study wrapped in the tension of a crime thriller. Each episode will blend slow-burn mystery with moments of emotional revelation as Konrad is forced to confront the one mystery he’s never solved: himself.”\n\n\tAnother Icelandic offering, “Death of a Diplomat,” is produced by Truenorth Nordic, which produced and serviced the fourth season of HBO’s “True Detective,” as well as “The Darkness,” co-produced with CBS Studios.  \n\t\n\n\tBased on the debut novel by Eliza Reid, former First Lady of Iceland, it sees the wife of the Canadian ambassador as she’s pulled into an unexpected role as a detective after a murder at a high-profile event in Iceland.\n\n\t“Diplomacy is lying in a tuxedo, and nobody knows this better than Eliza Reid. She spent eight years smiling through state dinners with politicians, corporate sharks and performance artists angling for a patron,” said Kamm, calling the show “wickedly fun.” \n\n\t“‘Death of a Diplomat’ is what happens when the smile finally cracks, the cocktails get poisoned and somebody has to pay the price.” \n\n\tGerman series “Ignition,” about a car mechanic who starts to flirt with the criminal underworld, is a “high-octane, female-led action series” that “fills a major gap in the market for gritty, East German-set, high-end dramas,” said co-creator and producer Sebastian Herbst. \n\n\t“It tells the story of an anti-heroine’s fight for survival, filled with dark humor, and explores the lengths she will go to in order to save her family’s legacy when the system of late-stage capitalism crushes her.”\n\n\tAnother series, “Fit,” is about the residents of a suburban high-rise who are about to be exposed when security footage from the building’s gym goes viral. \n\n\t“This project mixes satire and heart with an unapologetically sexy take, as it examines the clash between our societal family roles and our deeper secret passions,” said producer Alona Refua. Green Productions, with branches in Australia and New Zealand, is also behind “Red Alert.” \n\n\tBrutal Media, a Spanish production company owned by BBC Studios, will bring “The Glacier Murders,” adapted from a novel by Cristian Perfumo. \n\n\tIt follows a young Spaniard, who has inherits a remote hotel in Patagonia and discovers a corpse – frozen for thirty years in the nearby San Quintín Glacier.\n\n\t“It’s one of the projects born from Brutal’s strategy to open up to international co-productions, particularly with Latin America and other global partners. We’re excited to join forces with Fábula and bring our talent together to build something ambitious and meaningful,” said Brutal Media’s Arlette Peyret, with co-producer Alvaro Cabello adding: “Patagonia and Barcelona are currently two of the most visually striking places on our planet, each in its own unique way. The environment surrounding our story is infinitely enhanced by this visual richness, intensifying both the narrative and the thriller [element].”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Ignition’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArkanum Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s not the only show from Spain, which also brings “Without Standing” about the turbulent time when divorce finally becomes legal and one-woman law firm ready to represent them. \n\n\tFrom France, “Dejima” goes back to 1828, when a French doctor and a Japanese noblewoman of samurai blood flee together. “Montroc,” produced by Haut at Court TV, explores the 90s, when a tragic avalanche tests the limits of its protagonist, Blaise. \n\n\tIn “Dark Moors,” also known as “Fagnes” and set in Belgium’s Little Siberia, a Yenish teenage girl and a young female sergeant seek a truth that could trigger a war neither of them wants to fight.\n\n\tProducer Catherine Burniaux (Les Gens Studio) praised its “intimate power and rare territorial grounding.” \n\n\t“Born from Vero Cratzborn’s personal vision, it explores the emancipation of two women in a world – that of the High Fens and the Yenish community – that is still rarely depicted on screen. What distinguishes the series is the tension between a deeply local narrative and a universal ambition, driven by rigorous writing and a strong visual identity.”\n\n\tMore thrills will come courtesy of “Imposter Syndrome,” where a failing actor is hired as a security double for a member of a famous family dynasty.\n\n\tAccording to executive producer Eve Gutierrez, “it feels like the perfect time to shine an unflinching light on the world of the uber-wealth through the eyes of Kevin, an ordinary guy who always wanted to be somebody famous but now finds himself fighting to prove he isn’t. This fiendishly clever and entertaining original series from Tom Stuart grabbed us straight away.”  \n\n\tEleventh Hour Films, majority-owned by Sony Pictures Television, is currently producing a second series of “Rebus” for BBC and is in post on “Marble Hall Murders.” Other productions include “Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue,” “The Killing Kind” and “Alex Rider.”\n\n\tFinnish thriller “Power Couple” will explore the dilemma of a presidential candidate who learns that her husband is actually a Russian-born sleeper agent. \n\n\t“Beneath the sleeper-agent premise, the series explores whether it is ever truly possible to know another person – even after twenty years of marriage,” said Mikko Pöllä, the show’s co-creator and producer at Fire Monkey. \n\t\n\n\t“At its heart, it is also a story about love, resilience, and the strength of genuine partnership in the face of overwhelming forces.”\n\n\tItaly is represented thanks to “The Transfer of the Century,” about the worst club in the league, while “Twisted Vines” from South Africa focuses on a crime novelist with writer’s block, who’s forced to return to her hometown where her father was murdered. \n\n\tThe lineup also includes Latvian series “Aurora.Newsroom.,” starring Agnese Budvoska, in which an investigative journalist exposes a new Cold War spy network operating in the Baltics after an explosion in a wind farm. \n\n\t“We believe this story is both urgent and essential, not only for the Baltic region, but for Europe and global audiences,” said Gints Grūbe, who created the show. He produces for Mistrus Media, established in 2000, also developing “She-Devil.”\n\n\t“This series responds directly to escalating hybrid threats, growing political disinformation and rising distrust in democratic institutions, which are shaping public life across the continent. As producers based in Latvia, we have seen first-hand how disinformation campaigns, sabotage operations and intelligence activity unfold in our region. Not as fiction, but as daily geopolitical realities.” \n\n\t“Aurora.Newsroom.” is “more than a thriller,” he assured. “It’s a timely and necessary political drama that blends genre entertainment with deep relevance.”\n\n\t“The Co-Pro Pitching Sessions have had a tangible impact on many projects over the years,” said Series Mania general manager Laurence Herszberg, noting that “a wide variety of countries were represented, both in the submissions and the selected projects.”\n\n\tThis year’s applications came from 65 countries, including new territories such as Palestine, Kyrgyzstan, Cyprus, Uruguay, Panama and Malaysia. \n\n\tThis includes “Red Pants” from Kyrgyzstan: a “unique, bold dramatic series inspired by true events in set in the rarely explored world of Soviet-era Central Asia,” noted Erke Dzhumakmatova, founder of Oymo Studio. \n\n\t“At its core is the story of teenage girls – barely more than children – who refuse to be erased by patriarchy and silence in a country where history has buried women who dared to fight back. Their rebellion, at once violent and tender, exposes the fragile line between survival and criminality, justice and vengeance.”\n\t\n\n\tDzhumakmatova is also behind “Kurak.” “This project continues the thematic path I began with ‘Kurak,’ dedicated to violence against women in Central Asia. If ‘Kurak’ exposes the systemic brutality women face today, ‘Red Pants’ travels further back, into the late 1970s, to reveal how young girls, dismissed by the society and the Soviet authorities, created their own language of power and survival.”\n\n\tThe show is co-produced by Pavel Felman and Alexander Seliverstov for Human Films.\n\n\t“We are drawn to stories that uncover silenced histories through a powerful human lens. ‘Red Pants,’ created by Kyrgyz voices, reveals a rarely explored chapter of Soviet Central Asia while speaking to a universal struggle for dignity, agency and survival. The project stands out for its emotional rawness and its fearless young female protagonists,” said Felman.\n\n\tCreator Tilek Cherikov called “Red Pants” a “deeply personal story.” \n\n\t“I was born in Issyk-Kul, the region where the events of this project unfold. What matters to me in this story isn’t just the crime plot: it’s the deeper exploration of power, identity and female agency within a rigid, patriarchal and controlling system. The title comes from an awkward moment when their leader’s jeans were stained with menstrual blood. The girls transformed into an act of solidarity by dyeing their own pants red, turning it into a symbol of strength, unity and womanhood without shame.”\n\n\tSince the launch of the initiative, more than 40 projects have been produced and successfully broadcast across numerous territories, according to Francesco Capurro, Director of Series Mania Forum. That includes “Unspoken,” “Off Season,” “Keeping Faith,” “Stella Blomkvist,” “Devils”, “The Head” and many more. \n\n\t“As a true development accelerator, these sessions offer producers a unique opportunity to connect with potential co-producers, distributors and international broadcasters, helping ambitious series reach audiences worldwide,” he added. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Aurora.Newsroom.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMistrus Media\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe titles:\n\n\t“Aurora.Newsroom.”\n\n\t(6 x 52) \n\n\tLatvia\n\n\tGenre: Drama, Thriller\n\n\tCreated by: Gints Grūbe\n\n\tProduced by: Gints Grūbe, Inese Boka Grube and Elīna Gedina-Ducena for Mistrus Media (Latvia)\n\t\n\n\tCo-produced by: Riina Sildos for Amrion (Estonia) and Petri Kempinnen for Good Hand Film & TV (Finland)\n\n\tWritten by: Katri Manninen, Juris Kursietis, Osvalds Zebris, Martin Algus\n\n\tDirected by: Juris Kursietis\n\n\tA blackout in Latvia spirals into digital energy terrorism ahead of national elections.

The payments are due on the 5th of each month starting March 5 and will continue until further order of the court.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          In addition, the docs state Denise must foot Aaron $25K in attorney's fees, plus an additional $5K that may be used for a forensic accountant. The $30K total will be paid in three $10K installments at the end of March, April and May.\n      \n    \n          The ruling stems from Aaron's October 2025 request for spousal support. Both he and Denise were sworn in and testified before the judge made the decision.\n      \n    \n          As we previously reported ... the split between the former \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" star and Phypers has been anything but amicable. The two have traded accusations over finances, income and business dealings, with disputes over who should shoulder mounting legal costs becoming a central fight in the case.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tThe Zurich Film Festival will honor Swiss director Petra Volpe on Monday with the Golden Eye Award for her film “Late Shift,” which is on the shortlist for the Academy Award for best international feature film.\n\n\tThe award will be presented alongside a screening of the film for members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at Soho House in Los Angeles, hosted by ZFF in collaboration with U.S. distributor Music Box Films. Volpe will accept the award in person.\n\t\n\n\tThe film, which stars “The Teachers’ Lounge” actress Leonie Benesch, portrays the demanding night shift of a nurse. (See Variety review here.) It had its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\n\tChristian Jungen, ZFF CEO, said: “Petra Volpe has once again succeeded with ‘Late Shift’ in creating a socially realist auteur film that is firmly rooted in the present, shedding light on the precarious working conditions in the nursing profession while paying tribute to the dedication of healthcare workers.\n\n\t“In Switzerland, ‘Late Shift’ became the most successful domestic film of the year with more than 200,000 admissions and sparked a national debate about improving working conditions in the care sector.\n\n\t“In recognition of the film’s cinematic quality and its powerful contribution to public discourse, we are honoring Petra Volpe with the Golden Eye Award and wish her every success in the Oscar race.”\n\n\tVolpe said, “ ‘Late Shift’ continues to travel internationally and shows that Swiss cinema can have global impact. I have a special connection to Zurich Film Festival, as my first feature film celebrated its premiere there.\n\t\n\n\t“It is wonderful to see how the festival has evolved, and I would like to sincerely thank Christian Jungen and the entire team for the award as well as for their support during the Oscar campaign.”\n\n\tIn 2013, Volpe’s feature film debut “Dreamland” celebrated its world premiere in the ZFF competition. In 2022, Volpe served as a member of the ZFF international feature film jury. That same year, she also presented the film “Golden Years,” directed by Barbara Kulcsar, at the festival as its screenwriter.\n\n\tVolpe was at ZFF last year with “Late Shift,” when the festival organized a screening for participants of the ZFF Summit.\n\n\tVolpe, who studied at the Film University Babelsberg Konrad Wolf in Potsdam, has established herself as both a director and screenwriter.\n\n\tHer feature film “The Divine Order” (2017) became one of the most successful Swiss films of all time, screened at festivals worldwide, and was selected as Switzerland’s official submission for the Academy Awards.\n\n\tHer latest film, “Frank & Louis,” her first English-language feature, will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndo-Japanese romance “Toh Ti Ani Fuji” (Him, Her and Fuji) has unveiled its first looks as the film prepares for its world premiere at the 24th Pune International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe bilingual production, shot extensively across Japan and India, has been selected for PIFF’s competitive Marathi Feature Film section, where it will compete for the Government of Maharashtra’s Sant Tukaram Award for Best International Marathi Film.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Him, Her and Fuji”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlatoon One Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe film reunites actors Lalit Prabhakar and Mrinmayee Godbole, who previously starred together in the 2017 hit “Chi Va Chi Sau Ka.” Written by Irawati Karnik (“Jhimma,” “Anandi Gopal”) and directed by Mohit Takalkar (“Anatomy of a Suicide”), the project centers on a former couple who unexpectedly reconnect in Japan seven years after their separation.\n\t\n\n\tThe narrative explores how their once-passionate relationship deteriorated due to conflicting priorities and emotional imbalances, with Japan serving as both physical setting and metaphor for the emotional distance between the characters.\n\n\tProducer Shiladitya Bora of Platoon One Films emphasized the film’s thematic core. “‘Toh Ti Ani Fuji’ is, for me, rooted in one simple yet profound line from the film: ‘What if we both have different memories?'” Bora said. “That question lies at the heart of the story. It speaks to how two people can share the same relationship, the same moments, yet carry them very differently.”\n\n\tBora, whose credits include “Bayaan” (Toronto 2025), “Ghaath” (Berlinale 2023) and the Indian National Film Award-winning “Picasso,” described the project as part of Platoon One’s efforts to expand regional cinema’s scope. “With this film, we wanted to take that journey further and explore a space we hadn’t worked in before,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tDirector Takalkar called the PIFF selection “deeply affirming.” “PIFF is more than a festival – it’s a cultural moment the city returns to each year with seriousness and curiosity,” he said. “It’s especially meaningful because the film is unapologetically urban, rooted in contemporary Pune, and willing to sit with emotional discomfort rather than resolve it neatly.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Him, Her and Fuji”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlatoon One Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGodbole, whose credits include “Jhimma” and “CRD,” said her character reflects contemporary challenges. “For me, this character is an apt depiction of a woman in today’s time and age who tries to balance love, autonomy and responsibility,” she said.\n\n\tPrabhakar (“Anandi Gopal,” “Zombivli”) called the production “challenging at many points, but also deeply rewarding,” adding that the PIFF premiere makes the moment “truly special.”\n\n\tThe film is set for worldwide theatrical release this summer.\n\n\tPlatoon One Films, founded by Berlinale Talents alumnus Bora, has four titles releasing this year: “Bayaan,” “Bindusagar,” “Minimum” and “Toh Ti Ani Fuji.”\n\n\tPIFF takes place Jan. 15-22. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tVisit Films has acquired worldwide sales rights to U.S film “The Gymnast,” which will have its world premiere in the Tiger Competition at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. The film will also screen next month at the European Film Market in Berlin.\n\n\t“The Gymnast,” which was written and directed by Charlotte Glynn, follows a 16-year-old elite gymnast and her single father, a die-hard “gym dad,” in a former mill-town devastated by the loss of industry, as they fight to reinvent themselves after a potentially career-ending injury.\n\t\n\n\tThe film stars Ethan Embry (“Grace and Frankie,” “Christy,” upcoming in “Scream 7,” “By Any Means”), Britney Wheeler, Margarita Levieva (HBO’s “Task,” “Daredevil: Born Again”) and Will River (“Son of the South”). It is produced by Ricky Tollman (“Run This Town”) and Luke Spears (“Child Eater”). Executive producers include Randy Manis (“Margin Call,” “Kill Your Darlings”) and David Thion (“It Was Just an Accident,” “Anatomy of a Fall”). Co-producers are Max Mooney (“A Fresh Hell”) and Ariella Naymark (“Nirvanna the Band the Show”).\n\n\n\tGlynn was named one of the “25 New Faces in Independent Film” by Filmmaker Magazine and has been awarded residencies at Yaddo and the Berlinale Talents.\n\n\t“The Gymnast” previously participated in Sundance’s Catalyst Program, IFP Week’s Project Forum, Cine Qua Non Screenwriting Lab, U.S. & French Connection, and the Los Cabos International Film Festival Works in Progress market.\n\n\tGlynn said, ” ‘The Gymnast’ is a world and story that’s been with me for a decade. Monica’s story, the struggle of loss and reinvention, is at the heart of the film and is connected to the fire that’s been keeping me going through these years of trying to get the film made.”\n\t\n\n\tVisit’s president Ryan Kampe said, “It is so rare to find a film with such universal themes. Charlotte has masterfully depicted the pressure and ambition involved in high level competition as well as the abyss that can come with changes to one’s goals and dreams.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBYD, which recently surpassed Tesla as the world’s leading electric car supplier, is getting into the content business with Mediawan, the award-winning European studio behind “Adolescence,” “F1: The Movie” and “Miraculous.”\n\n\tFinancial details about their deal was not disclosed but it’s believed to be a significant cash investment from China’s BYD into Mediawan, whose portfolio spans over 80 companies, including Plan B, See-Saw Films and a stake in LuckyChap.\n\t\n\n\tThe pact was touted by both companies as an unprecedented strategic partnership to “support European and international creativity,” driven by shared values of innovation, sustainability, and global openness. They’re also interested in championing emerging talents. As such, they’re launching the “Build Your Dreams” Award, celebrating the best emerging creative and young talents over the next three years. The event, set to take place during the Cannes Film Festival, will give a €40,000 grant to the winner of the award.\n\n\n\tMediawan will also collaborate with BYD on content in various ways, ranging from brand integration in select titles across Mediawan Group productions. This include featuring BYD vehicles in upcoming flagship projects, such as the recently announced “Miraculous” theatrical movie. Mediawan will also be producing original formats inspired by the BYD brand. \n\n\t“This partnership with Mediawan marks a new chapter in BYD’s mission to connect innovation with inspiration. At BYD, we believe technology and creativity share the same purpose: to imagine a better world. By joining forces with one of Europe’s most visionary studios, we’re not just supporting the arts—we’re empowering the next generation of storytellers to dream beyond boundaries and share meaningful stories that move the world,” said Stella Li, vice president of BYD.\n\t\n\n\tMediawan’s boss Pierre-Antoine Capton, meanwhile, said “this partnership with BYD perfectly embodies our ambitions, to champion creative excellence and global growth, especially through the creation of strategic alliances that bring together creativity, innovation, and international vision.”\n\n\tCapton – who was part of Variety’s 120 ranking of the world’s most powerful executives and co-founded Mediawan in 2015 with Xavier Niel and Mathieu Pigasse — argued that, “In today’s landscape, where demand for content is booming across every platform, increasingly involving brands as partners in our productions is becoming essential as it allows us to innovate at scale and invest in ambitious projects both locally and internationally.” \n\n\tThe financial and creative alliance with BYD illustrates a growing trend of consumer brands investing in the film and television business to ramp up their global presence in pop culture. For companies like Mediawan that have the ambition to produce upscale films and TV shows and are faced with limited resources from traditional outlets, having a partner like BYD represents a lucrative avenue and opens up perspectives. \n\n\tMediawan, whose output includes more than 400 titles produced each year across drama, unscripted, documentary, cinema and animated original content, is rolling off major hits, including Plan B’s “F1,” the multi-Emmy Award-winning series “Adolescence,” See-Saw Films’ “Slow Horses,” Jeremy Zag’s “Miraculous” and the popular series “Call My Agent!”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWell Go USA Entertainment has acquired North American rights to “Rise of the Conqueror,” the historical action epic based on the true story of 14th century conqueror Amir Timur.\n\n\tThe film, directed by Jacob Schwarz (“Iron Cowboy”), stars Christian Mortensen and Mahesh Jadu (“The Witcher”). Well Go USA has set a digital release date of April 14, 2026.\n\n\tThe English-language film is produced by Mystery Box, whose recent work includes “The Wayfinders,” “The Chosen: The Messengers,” and “Artifact War.”\n\t\n\n\tCapture, which is handling global sales of the title, has also closed multiple deals with distributors, including for the U.K. with Signature Entertainment, France with Perspectives Entertainment, Spain with Youplanet, Italy with BlueSwan, Eastern Europe with SPI, Portugal with Cinemundo, Turkey with Vagon Film Limited, ANZ with Rialto, LATAM with Global Media Distribution, Japan with Pflug, Mainland China with Neo Glow Culture and Technology Co., South Korea with Lumix Media, India with Multivision Media and Mongolia with Film Bridge\n\n\n\t“Rise of The Conqueror,” also known as “Tamerlane: Rise of The Last Conqueror” is an action-packed historical epic following the true story of Timur, a fearless warrior who turned betrayal and disorder into one of history’s greatest empires.\n\n\tIn 14th-century Central Asia, as the Silk Road crumbles and rival factions tear the land apart, Timur emerges from exile. Stripped of everything, he fights to unite the fractured kingdoms, using strategy and sheer will to carve an empire from chaos. Undefeated in battle and widely regarded as one of history’s greatest military leaders and tacticians, not to mention one of its most brutal, Timur would found the Timurid Empire, which ruled over modern-day Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia.\n\t\n\n\t“’Rise of the Conqueror’ tells a compelling origin story, brought to life through large-scale practical action and expansive locations that give the film the scope and authority of a true historical epic,” said Brennan Lane, director of acquisitions and production at Well Go USA. “We are thrilled to bring this story to US audiences.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix‘s “His & Hers,” based on the acclaimed novel by Alice Feeney and adapted for television by William Oldroyd, appears, at first, to be a typical, albeit engaging, mystery thriller full of death, secrets and lies. Yet, as the limited series unfolds, audiences quickly realize there is nothing normal about this show. At the center of the narrative is a sidelined Atlanta news anchor, Anna (a fascinating Tessa Thompson), trying to reclaim her career through a shocking murder case. However, a volatile detective, Jack (Jon Bernthal), leading the investigation, becomes increasingly concerned that Anna has other motives. A delectable, detailed story spotlighting revenge, women’s rage and deceit, “His & Hers” seeps into your psyche, shifting everything you thought you knew. \n\t\n\n\tAs many mysteries do, “His & Hers” opens with a tragic scene. In the woods surrounding  Dahlonega, Georgia, a dead woman, Rachel (Jamie Tisdale), is sprawled on the hood of a cherry red sports car. The unrelenting rain beats down on her, washing away the majority of the evidence. Elsewhere in Atlanta, Anna walks into her luxury apartment drenched and weeping. Her apartment is in complete disarray. Papers, takeout containers and half-drunk alcohol bottles are strewn everywhere. But this is Anna’s last day wallowing in her own self-pity. Disgusted after seeing a massive billboard of the anchor who took her job, Lexy Jones (Rebecca Rittenhouse), Anna has decided her year-long work hiatus is over. It’s time to return to reclaim her desk. \n\n\n\tIn Dahlonega, Jack gets a call from his partner Priya (Sunita Mani) telling him that a dead body has been found. Though Jack tries to keep the news quiet, word is already beginning to spread across the small town. In fact, Anna has convinced her boss to let her work as a field reporter covering the case in an effort to salvage her career. With her cameraman Richard (Pablo Schreiber) in tow (who also happens to be Lexy’s husband), she heads to her hometown, determined to win back the network and viewers. \n\t\n\n\tBut this will be no straightforward investigation for Anna or Jack. Following a devastating loss, which led her to becoming a recluse, Anna is still acting strangely, and always conveniently showing up in odd places across Dahlonega. For his part, Jack is also an erratic figure. Though he appears to be a decent investigator on the surface, his choices are beginning to alarm Priya, who begins eyeing him suspiciously as more facts about Rachel’s demise come to light. \n\n\tAt its core, “His & Hers” has all the delicious elements of a stellar thriller. Thompson and Bernthal are formidable in their roles, and there are enough twists and turns to keep even the most eagle-eyed viewer on their toes. The pacing is fantastic, and at just six zippy episodes, the show is crammed with detail from Anna’s past into her present. Still, this is not the show you think it is, and that’s why it’s masterful.  \n\n\tWhile murder and mayhem are at its core, “His & Hers” is a series about the anguish we feel as human beings, the incidents we wish we could forget, how we try to absolve ourselves after harming others and what anger can do when it’s carefully cultivated and used willfully and deliberately. Society pressures people to move on after horrible things happen to them, and while many do, others choose to respond differently. After all, fury can be one hell of a motivator. \n\n\tThere’s no shortage of limited series on TV, especially as streamers try to pull in A-list talent who would otherwise be unwilling to commit to extended shows. However, “His & Hers” is one of the most unhinged shows ever seen on television. It has a jaw-dropping, layered ending that will leave viewers gobsmacked. (I literally sat in shock, screaming “WHAT?!!” continually as the final credits rolled.) The series’ conclusion is so astounding because it taps into our own societal biases. We constantly overlook and underestimate those seen as “worthless,” and, according to this tale, it’s to our own peril.\n\n\t“His & Hers” is now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix barnstormer “Secrets We Keep,” Canneseries top winner “A Better Man” and “Vignis,” directed by “The Witcher” star Björn Hlynur Haraldsson, will do battle for the 2026 Nordic Series Script Award, the Göteborg Film Festival’s weightiest industry award.\n\n\tAlso making the shortlist cut, announced Thursday, is “My Brother,” the second Nordic Script Award nomination in three years for Denmark’s Karin Arrhenius, and Finland’s “Queen of Fucking Everything,” from former actor Tiina Lymi who burnished her writer-director credentials with Góteborg-selected feature with “Stormskerry Maja.”   \n\t\n\n\tPresented by the Nordisk Film & TV Fond, in partnership with Sweden’s Göteborg Film Festival, the Script Award promotes series writers from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, carrying a cash prize of NOK 200,000 ($19,800). \n\n\n\tIn the past, its five-title shortlist has often mixed established and on-the-rise creators, such as its 2025 winner, emerging scribe Pelle Rådström behind the sensational “Pressure Point.”\n\n\tFor 2026, however, the Award simply highlights the main writer or writers talent behind five of the biggest Nordic drama series hits premiered in 2025. That’s saying something, given Scandinavian series’ ability to command audiences at home and abroad. \n\n\tThe portrait-thriller of a well-heeled woman faced to rethink her woolly liberal platitudes, Denmark’s “Secrets We Keep,’ written by Ingeborg Topsøe, proved one of Netflix’s three biggest non-English series over Jan.-Sept 2025, scoring 35 million views, only bettered by “The Squid Game” Season 3 (122 million views) and Germany’s “Cassandra” (36 million).\n\t\n\n\tCreated by Thomas Seeberg Torjussen (“Zombielars”), Norway’s “A Better Man,” sold by Beta Film, won Canneseries best series and performance (Anders Baasmo, “Kon-Tiki”) prizes in April, then scored best international series and the Audience Award at November Barcelona’s Serielizados. \n\n\tWritten by Ágústa M Ólafsdóttir and Björg Magnúsdóttir (“The Minister”), helmed by Björn Hlynur Haraldsson, King Eisin in “The Witcher,” and produced by Vesturport, behind Series Mania top prizewinner “Blackport,” “Vigdis” scored a 60% market share for Icelandic public broadcaster RUV from a Jan. 1 2025 bow.\n\n\t“Queen of Fucking Everything,” an original series from Finnish public broadcaster YLE, has often been billed as Finland’s “Breaking Bad.” Produced and sold by Rabbit Films, behind Disney+’s “Mobile 101,” sold well to New8 European broadcasting partners ZDF (Germany), NPO (Netherlands), VRT (Belgium), SVT (Sweden), NRK (Norway) and RUV (Iceland). It also delivered Yle’s biggest domestic series first week ratings for several years.  \n\n\tFrom “The Bridge” and “Caliphate” producer Filmlance International, part of Banijay Entertainment, and sold by TrustNordisk “My Brother” is a big swing by Swedish pubcaster SVT, bowing Dec. 26 on Swedish state TV SVT to 1.5 million views, more than a tenth of Sweden’s population.\n\n\tDirected by Sanna Lenken (“Thin Blue Line,” “Pressure Point”) it is written by Arrhenius, increasingly renowned after “Rebecca Martinsson” (2017-20) and “Blackwater,” up for the Nordic Series Script Award in 2023 and also a Series Mania International Panorama best series winner.\n\n\t“Nordisk Film & TV Fond daily celebrates the excellence of Nordic drama quality through our top-financing schemes. Since no productions happen without the visions and skills of Nordic creators and writers, we yearly want to shed an extra spotlight on the talents behind outstanding drama series, one from each Nordic country,” said Nordisk Film & TV Fond CEO Liselott Forsman.\n\n\t“We’re proud to once again celebrate some of the most talented screenwriters from the Nordics,” added Cia Edström, head of Göteborg’s TV Drama Vision, its TV forum and market. “The nominated series for 2026 vary in tone and style, but they share a common strength: bold, compelling storytelling that offers hope for the future of drama in the Nordics.”\n\t\n\n\tThe jury for the Nordic Series Script Award is Norwegian actor Agnes Kittelsen; Nanna Frank Rasmussen, a journalist, from Denmark and Henning Kamm, an executive producer and managing director at Real Film Berlin.\n\n\tThe winners of the Nordic Series Awards will be announced at a ceremony on Jan. 27. A second prize, the Creative Courage Award,celebrating the producer and commissioner of a series that boldly pushes creative boundaries and embraces innovation, will also be announced at the ceremony.\n\n\tA closer look at the series:\n\n\t“A Better Man,”\n\n\tNorway, 4 x 50 minNominated writer: Thomas Seeberg TorjussenBroadcaster: NRKProduced by: Maipo Film; produced by Christian Fredrik Martin, Synnøve Hørsdal; director: Seeberg Torjussen; co-Director: Gjyljeta Berisha; sales: Beta Film   \n\n\tA misogynist internet troll, Tom, who is outed. Disguised as a woman to avoid further persecution, he becomes a better man, finding a sense of self-respect as he treads a rocky road to redemption. Tackling three burning issues of the modern age – internet trolling, the cancel culture and masculinity – “A Better Man” manages to give an explanation for trolls and suggest how they can stop and wraps this is an engrossing, affecting narrative. That’s a large achievement demanding a nuanced performance from lead Anders Baasmo which takes in two physical transformations and a hard-won spiritual makeover.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnders Baasmo in ‘A Better Man’ photographer Lukas Šalna, credit – Maipo Film, NRK\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“My Brother,” (“Jag for ner till bror”)\n\n\tSweden, 4 x 45 min \n\n\tNominated writer: Karin ArrheniusBroadcaster: SVTProduced by: Filmlance International; producer: Anna Wallmark; director: Sanna Lenken; sales: Nordisk Film Danmark, TrustNordisk \n\t\n\n\tArrhenius adapts  the first novel by Karin Smirnoff, who shot to fame when she was invited to write a new book in Stieg Larssen’s “Millennium” novel series. If Lisbeth Salander is dark, the story of Jana Kippo in “My Brother” is even darker, teased as she returns home to remote Smalånger to save her twin brother, drinking himself to death after heartbreak. Gradually, however, she confronts her own raw story of ghastly abuse. Intense, often brutal, distinguished by three lead performances led by Amanda Jansson as Jana who just doesn’t take shit as the series delivers a scathing put-down of small town community hearsay and heartlessness.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJana and John, played by Amanda Jansson & Jakob Öhrman, in ‘My Brother’ Courtesy of Saga Berlin, SVT\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Queen of F*cking Everything,”\n\n\tFinland, 6 x 50 min\n\n\tNominated writer: Tiina Lymi \n\n\tBroadcaster: Yle \n\n\tProduced by: Rabbit Films, producer: Minna Haapkylä; director: Tiina Lymi; sales: Rabbit Films\n\n\tLinda, a real estate sales whizz living in the lap of luxury, wakes up one day with her hubby missing and a $3 million debt. She resorts to anything – trading cocaine to the Costa del Sol mob, becoming a Shakespeare sonnet-quoting drug kingpin’s lover, even murder – to keep her lifestyle. Written-directed by Lymi (“Stormskerry Maja”), a drama comedy which develops a distinctly dark thriller edge from Episode 3, powering a parable of a woman who reaps revenge on a world she’s convinced has never loved her, until she achieves the work’s titular status; and social status be damned. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQueen of F*ucking Everything – Courtesy of the Göteborg Film Festival\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaakko Kahilaniemi jaakkokahilan\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Secrets We Keep,”\n\n\tDenmark, 6 x 30-40 min\n\n\tNominated writer: Ingeborg Topsøe \n\n\tCo-writers: Ina Bruhn, Mads Tafdrup \n\n\tBroadcaster: Netflix  \n\n\tProduced by: Uma Film; producer: Claudia Saginario: director: Per Fly; sales: Netflix\n\n\tSet in North Zealand, a Copenhagen riviera of white stone mansions, au-pair Ruby disappears, having begged neighbor Cecilie for help. Prime suspects are Rasmus, a smarmy big shot or his son, 15, who drone-cams Cecilie having sex. A mystery thriller packed with social observance – on noblesse-oblige privilege and its economics, as well as parenting, racism and gender violence – “Secrets We Keep” is sumptuously shot by Per Fly (“Follow the Money”), layering further social sarcasm on a tight, tense social-issue mystery thriller written by Topsøe, who impressed with Milad Alami’s “The Charmer,” building to Fly’s majestic final shot, loaded with the protagonist’s new-found cognizance of her own social horror.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(L to R) Simon Sears as Mike Vinter-Jensen, Marie Bach Hansen as Cecilie and Lukas Zuperka as Viggo in ‘Secrets We Keep’ Credit –.

Kicking off at the televised presidential debate in 1980, the series traces her origins from a secondary school student in WWII Iceland riled by the era’s manosphere through life vicissitudes – miscarriage, divorce, a years’ long battle to adopt. What’s so impressive, however, is how “Vigdis” locates her driving passions – her determination, for instance, to make her parents proud of her after early family tragedy – sparking large emotional payoff in a moving finale.   \n",

    "body": "\n\tMichelle Visage will feature in “Sea Witch,” a new musical reimagining the origins of one of the sea’s most feared villains, at London’s Theatre Royal Drury Lane.\n\n\tThe “RuPaul’s Drag Race” star and broadcaster will portray Tante Hansa in the show, which is inspired by “The Little Mermaid” and follows Evie, a witch surviving in a world where magic is outlawed.\n\n\tJoining Visage in the all-star cast are “Strictly Come Dancing” winner and The Wanted member Jay McGuiness as Iker, Olivier Award nominee and original “Six” cast member Natalie Paris as Evie, “Mamma Mia!” alum Mazz Murray as Queen Charlotte, Olivier Award and WhatsOnStage Award nominee Amy Di Bartolomeo, fresh from her role as Emily in “The Devil Wears Prada,” as Annemette, and “Moulin Rouge!” leading lady Natalie Kassanga as Malvina.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s really special to be able to create a role in a new musical, especially when it is as exciting and dynamic as ‘Sea Witch,'” Paris said. “I cannot wait to bring this magical show to life alongside an epic cast and team of creatives.”\n\n\n\tMcGuiness added: “It’s really exciting working on something new, and especially an amazing fantasy novel being brought to life on stage – I can’t wait to get in the rehearsal room and see what the team brings to life.”\n\n\tThe musical features choreography by Dean Lee, who has worked with Janet Jackson, direction by Kristopher Russell, and a book by Michael David Glover. Music and lyrics are by Segun Fawole, with music production by Jeff Nang. The show features a soundtrack that blends cinematic pop, dark soul, and musical-theatre songwriting.\n\t\n\n\t“With ‘Sea Witch,’ we’re not just staging a story, we’re creating a new blueprint for musical theater,” Russell said. “Every visual, every beat, every emotional moment is crafted to push the genre forward.”\n\n\tGlover added: “‘Sea Witch’ challenges everything we thought we knew about heroes, villains, and storytelling. It’s daring, emotional, and unapologetic, designed to carve out a new path for modern musicals.”\n\n\tChoreographer Dean Lee said: “With ‘Sea Witch,’ I’ve been exploring a completely fresh movement language for theater – something born from years of experience, instinct, and deep love for storytelling through the body. Drawing from my journey working with artists like Janet Jackson and Pussycat Dolls whilst blending cinematic, contemporary and theatrical influences, we’ve crafted movement that doesn’t simply decorate the story… it is the story. Every gesture carries meaning, every sequence holds intention. My hope is that audiences don’t just watch the choreography – they feel it, live inside it and experience theatre in a way that feels new, emotional and deeply human.”\n\n\tThe show is based on Sarah Henning’s novel “Sea Witch” and adapted with permission of HarperCollins Publishers. The production is produced by Russell & Glover Theatrical & Pictures together with the Nederlander Organization, the Shubert Organization, John Gore Organization and Willette Klausner.\n\n\tThe production will receive its world premiere on March 1. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAlan Ritchson is returning to Queensland, Australia to begin production on an untitled Amazon MGM Studios feature about decorated Navy SEAL hero Mike Thornton, Screen Queensland has revealed.\n\n\tPrincipal photography kicks off this month at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast. The project marks Ritchson’s return to the region following his recent action thriller “Runner,” which filmed in Brisbane and the Gold Coast in 2025.\n\n\n\tAustralian director Patrick Hughes is helming the project, which chronicles Thornton’s real-life survival story in the South China Sea that earned him a Congressional Medal of Honor. Ritchson, known for his roles in “Reacher” and “Fast X,” stars alongside Joe Cole (“Subversion,” “A Prayer Before Dawn”) and Hoa Xuande (“The Sympathizer,” “Avatar: The Last Airbender”).\n\t\n\n\tSylvester Stallone and D. Matt Geller are producing under Balboa Productions, alongside Hidden Pictures’ Todd Lieberman and Alex Young, Ritchson’s AllyCat Entertainment, and Alan Rautbort. Executive producers are Valerie Bleth Sharp and Mike Thornton. The screenplay was written by Mark Semos (“SEAL Team,” “Y: Marshals”), Ritchson and Jason Hall (“American Sniper,” “Thank You for Your Service”).\n\n\tThe film is supported by the Australian government through the Location Offset, the Queensland government through Screen Queensland’s Production Attraction Strategy and the City of Gold Coast’s Screen Attraction Program.\n\n\tThe production was secured for Queensland through Screen Queensland’s Production Strategy and the federal government’s Location Offset.\n\n\tActing Minister for the Arts Tim Nicholls said the project demonstrates strong momentum for screen production in the state heading into 2026 under the Crisafulli Government.\n\t\n\n\t“This latest project for Amazon MGM Studios will create employment for around 260 local cast and crew while injecting an estimated AUD50 million ($33.5 million) into the Queensland economy and supporting numerous small businesses,” Nicholls said in a statement, adding that the government remains committed to keeping Queensland as the country’s top destination for screen production.\n\n\tScreen Queensland CEO Jacqui Feeney highlighted the state’s expertise with military and water-based productions as key factors in the production’s return to Queensland.\n\n\t“Queensland crews have an internationally renowned reputation for delivering complex action films and series and it’s fantastic to start the new year with such an ambitious production coming into Village Roadshow Studios,” Feeney said.\n\n\tHughes said he was excited to bring the project back to Australia. “The Gold Coast offers world-class crews, facilities, and locations, making it an ideal home for a production of this scale,” the “Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard” director said. “I’m thrilled to be working with Screen Queensland to bring this film to life.”\n\n\tThe Mike Thornton project joins a growing slate of Queensland-based films for Amazon MGM Studios, including “Balls Up,” “The Bluff,” “Voltron” and “Subversion.”\n",

Ray J remains in the hospital where he has received X-rays and an echocardiogram ... no word yet on the results.\n      \n    \n          This follows a serious case of pneumonia Ray J had four years ago during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The 44-year-old \"One Wish\" singer was diagnosed with non-COVID pneumonia in 2021, and it was so bad, we were told Ray J thought he could die.\n      \n    \n          The bout put him on oxygen and temporarily required him to use an inhaler ... but he later recovered and soon after was breathing fine again.\n      \n    \n          Three weeks ago, Ray J announced from Tampa, Florida, that he was hitchhiking across the country. It's unclear if that's how he traveled to Vegas or if it had anything to do with his illness.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Ray J\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Hip Hop\n              \n                          \n                Nurse!\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tMacy’s is leaning into its superhero era. The retailer unveiled today an exclusive “Spider Man” collection today, fusing the energy of New York’s favorite web-slinger with the cultural clout of the NBA. Available now in on the Macy’s website, the 27-piece assortment spans adults’ and kids’ apparel, accessories and home décor.\n\n\tTimed with the return of the Spider-Man balloon at the 99th Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the drop marks a crossover moment between Marvel, the NBA and Macy’s own holiday heritage. “These covetable pieces celebrate the spirit of adventure and the iconic New York City energy that resonates with fans of all ages,” Cynthia Kiang, VP of merchandising strategy at Macy’s, said in a statement. The line features standout items like fleece pullovers and plush basketball pillows, while artwork throughout nods to classic comic panels from legendary Marvel artist John Romita Sr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the merchandising side, the timing couldn’t be better: with major gatherings like the recent New York Comic Con, there’s been a push from Marvel Brand (“Marvel Must Haves”) to promote collectibles, apparel and accessories tied to the superhero.\n\n\tThe next major installment, “Spider‑Man: Brand New Day” is still on track to release in July of next year following a brief pause in production after Tom Holland suffered a mild concussion on set. The next film will mark the 29 year-old actor’s s fourth standalone movie as the iconic web-slinger and his seventh overall Marvel movie.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the original trilogy starring Tobey Maguire is being re-released in theatres via the “Fathom Fan Favorites: Spider-Man Trilogy” special event.\n\n\tCheck out the entire Marvel x NBA collection here.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcademy Award nominee Adriana Barraza has joined the cast of Jonah Hill’s upcoming Warner Bros. comedy “Cut Off,” Variety has learned exclusively.\n\n\tThe film follows a pair of wealthy siblings who find themselves suddenly cut off from their parents. Barraza will play the endearing family caregiver, starring alongside Hill, Kristen Wiig, Bette Midler and Nathan Lane.\n\n\tHill is set to direct “Cut Off” from a script he co-wrote with Ezra Woods. He will also produce alongside Matt Dines and Ali Goodwin under their Strong Baby banner. Jesse Ehrman and Zach Hamby are overseeing the project for Warner Bros., which has scheduled the film for a worldwide theatrical release on July 17, 2026.\n\t\n\n\tThe project is one of the few studio comedies currently set to shoot in California, with production slated to begin this fall. It received a $10 million tax credit, as Variety also exclusively reported.\n\n\n\tBarraza is widely recognized as one of the most accomplished Latina actresses in film and television, with more than five decades in the entertainment industry. She earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her performance in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Babel” (2006), becoming one of only 13 Latinas ever to receive an Oscar nomination — and one of just six Mexican actresses.\n\n\tHer other notable credits include “Amores Perros,” also directed by Iñárritu; “Cake,” opposite Jennifer Aniston; and Netflix’s global hit “We Can Be Heroes,” directed by Robert Rodriguez. In 2024, she received an International Emmy nomination for best actress for her role in “El Último Vagón,” in addition to being one of the honorees at the 4th Celebration of Latino Cinema and Television for her performance in Roadside Attractions’ “My Penguin Friend.”\n\t\n\n\tMost recently, she portrayed the fan-favorite Nana in the DC Studios superhero film “Blue Beetle,” opposite Xolo Maridueña and directed by Ángel Manuel Soto. She will next be seen in the upcoming Amazon Prime Video series “El Gato,” starring Diego Boneta, which is also slated for release in 2026.\n\n\tBarraza is represented by Innovative Artists and DePaz Management.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” has won the Grand Jury Prize at the 8th annual Animation Is Film Festival.\n\n\tThe features jury said, “Showing us the world from the perspective of a toddler, ‘Little Amélie or the Character of Rain‘ portrays the wonders and pains of being alive like poignant revelations. As it finds whimsy in the everyday through its dazzling style, the film also grapples with the complexity of two cultures clashing, connecting, and simultaneously shaping the young protagonist’s nascent identity.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Fumi Kitahara Special Jury Prize was awarded to “Decorado.” During opening night of the festival, AIF director Matt Kaszanek announced the prize’s renaming in memory of beloved publicist Fumi Kitahara, who died in February.\n\n\n\t“Fumi devoted her professional career to championing animators and was one of the earliest and most vocal supporters of Animation Is Film and its mission. While there is a tremendous sadness at her not being at AIF this year, we take comfort in knowing that we’re about to spend the weekend doing what she would’ve wanted for us — coming together as a community in celebration of great animation,” Kaszanek said. The jury praised Decorado, stating, “Set in a dystopian reality where authoritarian forces control every aspect of the individual’s life, Decorado cleverly explores how we adapt and push back against accepted normalcy. Though it unflinchingly tackles timely and mature sociopolitical themes, it does so through satirical humor and fantastical characters — including the protagonist couple, Arnold and Maria — making it a wholly unexpected experience.”\n\t\n\n\t“Arco,” directed by Ugo Bienvenu, was awarded the Audience Award. This imaginative, inventive and tender time-travel adventure, which weaves together themes of friendship, collective memory and the forces of a shifting planet, resonated strongly with the AIF audience.\n\n\tThe Shorts Jury Grand Prize went to Cynthia Calvi’s “Gigi,” described by jurors as “a deeply intimate, conversational chronicle of the title character’s gender transition. ‘Gigi’s’ strong visual metaphors ably enrich a story of inherent personal authenticity. It is a film that works on every level.”\n\n\tThe Special Jury Prize in Shorts was awarded to Giovanna Ferrari’s “Eiru.” The jury noted, “With visually stunning use of light and color, this rousing adventure set in ancient Ireland unfolds as a tale of mortal courage and divine reckoning, elevated by its breathtaking technical execution.” \n\n\t“Animation Is Film offers its sincerest congratulations to all of the filmmakers who participated in this most recent edition,” Kaszanek said in a statement. “The 2025 Festival experienced record-shattering numbers in terms of attendance. This doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Thank you to the filmmakers, the audiences, the festival sponsors and community partners for celebrating the art of animation.”\n\n\tThe 2025 feature competition lineup included “All You Need Is Kill,” “Arco,” “Chao,” “Decorado,” “I Am Frankelda,” “Lesbian Space Princess,” “Little Amélie Or The Character Of Rain,” “Nobody,” “Scarlet” and “A Story About Fire.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe 2025 World Series matchup is set, with the Los Angeles Dodgers taking on the Toronto Blue Jays for the Major League Baseball (MLB) Championship.\n\n\tThe Dodgers are hoping to repeat as World Series champs after defeating the New York Yankees in five games last fall. L.A. would be the first time to win back to back titles since the Yankees three-peated in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Toronto, meantime, earns a spot in the Fall Classic for the first time since the Jays won it all in 1993.\n\n\n\tWant to watch the World Series on TV? This year’s games air live on FOX and you can watch the Dodgers vs. Jays with any basic antenna or cable package that includes a local FOX affiliate. You can also stream the World Series online with a live TV streamer like DirecTV (new customers can get a five-day free trial here).\n\n\tIf you want to watch the World Series in person, you’ll want to snag tickets while they’re still available online. As of this writing, tickets are already sold out on MLB.com and seats to see the Dodgers vs. Jays are going for up to $14,000 on third-party ticketing sites like Stubhub and Vivid Seats.\n\t\n\t\tFind World Series Tickets on StubHub\t\n\n\tStubHub has the widest selection of World Series tickets that we’re seeing right now, with prices starting at $800 for the Dodgers’ first home game at Dodgers Stadium on October 27. \n\n\tStubHub lets you search for tickets by price point and section, and you can even narrow your search down by zones — say, if you want to be behind the dugout, along the baseline, or in the “home run seats” to (hopefully) catch a ball. You can also search for tickets by perks, with StubHub currently showing availability for VIP passes that include food, drinks and parking. \n\n\n\tStubHub’s FanProtect Guarantee ensures valid tickets or your money back. And if there is an issue with your order, the site says customers will receive comparable or better tickets, or be provided with an option to get you money back.\n\t\n\t\tFind World Series Tickets on Vivid Seats\t\n\n\tThere are also few ways to score a deal on World Series tickets and find “cheap” (or discounted) seats online. We like Vivid Seats, which has Jays vs. Dodgers tickets starting from $700 for Game 1 at the Rogers Centre in Toronto. If you’re buying group tickets, Vivid Seats is a solid bet, with a rewards program that gets you your eleventh ticket free (in the form of site credit) after you purchase ten stubs.\n\n\tLooking for a promo code for World Series tickets? Use code VR30 to save $30 off your purchase of $300 or more at VividSeats.com. New customers can also save 15% off their first purchase by signing up for the Vivid Seats email list. As of now, the discounts cannot be combined so do a little calculation before you add to cart to see which promotional offer works best for you.\n\t\n\t\tFind World Series Tickets on SeatGeek\t\n\n\tThe Dodgers announced a new partnership with SeatGeek in March, with the third-party site acting as the “Official and Exclusive Ticket Marketplace Partner” for the team this season. Fans looking to buy and sell Dodgers tickets with the team’s official partner can head to SeatGeek’s website or download the SeatGeek app.\n\n\tWorld Series tickets on SeatGeek start at $772 as of this writing, with a decent selection of seats available. Use the promo code VARIETY10 to save an extra $10 off purchase of $250 or more at SeatGeek.com. The site offers digital delivery of tickets so you’ll have them “in hand” (on your phone or in your email inbox) in time for the game.\n\t\n\t\tFind World Series Tickets on TicketNetwork\t\n\n\tTicketNetwork is an online marketplace offering authentic World Series tickets with fees included in the viewable price. TicketNetwork currently has Dodgers tickets starting from $1,000 for the Dodger Stadium home games, going all the way up to $19,000 for seats behind home plate.\n\n\tNew customers can use our exclusive promo code VARIETY150 for $150 off purchases of $500 or more. Use discount code VARIETY300 for a $300 savings on orders of $1000 and up. Like the sites above, TicketNetwork offers a 100% money-back guarantee. And since they are a resale marketplace, and not a box office or venue agent, prices could be above or below face value (say, if you search for tickets after the game has kicked off).\n\n\t\n\t\tFind World Series Tickets on Gametime\t\n\n\tAnd you’ll want to browse the listings on Gametime, which is one of the most popular online marketplaces for sporting events. Gametime has 2025 World Series tickets starting from $762 right now, with an easy-to-use booking platform that gives you a more realistic view of what the baseball diamond will look like from your seats.\n\n\tGametime’s “Price Guarantee” ensures the lowest prices on tickets online. If you find a lower price elsewhere, the site says it will credit you with 110% of the difference between the price you found and Gametime’s price in your account.\n\n\tLooking for a Gametime promo code for World Series tickets? Enter SAVE20 at checkout to save $20 off your first purchase of $200 or more. See more details here.\n",

Each episode brings viewers inside a high-stakes operation, capturing the tension, danger, and ultimate payoff as scammers are unmasked.”\n\n\tEach episode sees Bingham and Kulik chase down a different scam, ranging from a $53,000 PayPal refund scheme, a $500,000 cryptocurrency sham and an Arkansas scam ring that has stolen more than $80,000 from local seniors.\n\n\tThe series is produced for Fox Nation by Texas Crew Productions and Trilogy Media. David Karabinas, Robby O’Neil and Brad Bernstein serve as executive producers for Texas Crew, and Art Kulik and Ashton Bingham serve as EPs for Trilogy. Trilogy Media is represented by the Green Room’s Alex Czuleger, who also serves as a producer.\n\t\n\n\tWatch a trailer for “Scammed: Getting Even” below.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAsk any music pro in Nashville who their five favorite singers are, and there’s a good chance that Maggie Rose will be part of their shortlist. Not that she hasn’t developed a notoriety outside of Music City, too, with the handful of albums she’s released, especially 2024’s Grammy-nominated “No One Gets Out Alive.” And her vocal talents get her called in as a collaborator far and wide, like when she was brought in as a duet partner for My Morning Jacket’s Jim Jones at this year’s MusiCares Persons of the Year event. But it’s in her hometown musical community that she might be most known as a singer’s singer, among the type of people who are especially qualified to render that judgment.\n\t\n\n\tAnd a writer’s writer? Her talents in that regard are catching up to the appreciation for her vocal chops, as evidenced in how she was nominated at the most recent Americana Honors & Awards for Emerging Act of the Year, kudos that wouldn’t come if she was only revered as a vocal stylist. Now, she’s quickly followed up the heavily orchestrated and dramatically balladic “No One Gets Out Alive” with a more buoyant, pop-focused EP, “Cocoon.” The subject matter of these six new songs was influenced on the hopeful side by the then-impending birth of her first child, Graham, and on the more cynical side by some of the music-industry dealings that found her making a label change between these two most recent projects. \n\n\n\tRose caught Variety up on the EP and other recent developments backstage at Nashville’s Schermerhorn Symphony Center, where she was doing a bucket-list show with the Nashville Symphony that blew the roof off the rather well-constructed joint. There, Rose sounded like she was to the orchestral manor born, although “Cocoon” (unlike the previous album) eschews that kind of elaborate instrumentation for a leaner kind of pop. Rose discussed her stylistic evolution — which will further be seen in an album she’s working on with Daniel Tashian and Lawrence Rothman for 2026 — and why she feels at home in pop, Americana, the jam band circuit and, yes, even country, although she hasn’t really been a part of that latter scene for a while.\n\t\n\n\tYou were just nominated for Emerging Artist of the Year by the Americana Music Association. But you’ve been releasing music for 12 years. So how does it feel to be emerging?\n\n\tI think that’s the brilliance of the award: they know that there’s a distinction between new artists and emerging artists. I moved to Nashville in 2008, so I’ve been kicking around a while, and that’s evident to a lot of people who’ve been following me. But it has been a big year for me, and I haven’t always been making music in this space. I feel welcomed by this community that I really respect and love, so I’ll take it. It’s a huge honor, and I also think that it’s a sign that I’ve continued to stay in love with making music and continued to examine myself as an artist and find myself in these new places. And I came by [the changes] honestly. Maybe it just took me a little bit to find my voice, but now I’m making music that’s the most authentic to who I am and what I want to do. And Americana also casts a very wide net, so I don’t feel beholden to some kind of sound. I think that they honor a lot of artists who explore their capabilities and artists who want to have sustainable careers and provide an accurate snapshot of where they are at, at that moment in their life, with each album.\n\n\tEven though Americana is a big umbrella to the people who really identify with it, a lot of people on the outside still think of it as meaning “twangy” or something like that. And anyone listening to your most recent album or EP would not go there, in thinking of your music.\n\n\tYeah, I agree. I feel like there’s always a little explaining to do. But I think Americana as a community is still trying to tell their story, and they’re doing a good job of it. It’s exciting to be part of that community now because it’s an evolving genre. I do think that it’s a bit of a catch-all. I think there might be more of a belief system behind Americana than it is sonics at times. It’s analog, very human-made music. I don’t know that MJ Lenderman and I sound super similar, but I love his music and I think that we like to make music for a lot of the same reasons. But this is just a theory. No one’s wrong. There’s a lot of ways to define what today’s Americana is.\n\n\tI was just looking up some of the articles that have been written about you in People magazine. Because People magazine seems to cover all your important life developments — marriage, impending motherhood…\n\t\n\n\tThey’ve been very consistent about that! Which is great.\n\n\tBut looking back to their article about you getting married, in the mid-2010s, I couldn’t help noticing they identified you as “country singer Maggie Rose,” by definition. Probably nobody is going to stick that ID on you now.\n\n\tEven then I was kind of trying to shake it. I think about what you said with people thinking Americana is twangy — and because I’m a Nashville artist, especially with a publication like People that covers a wide audience, I think there’s something synonymous with being in Nashville and country. Also, I play the Opry once a month, still, to this day. So I think there’s a lot of reasonable factors that make people associate me with that. And I did release commercial country music early on. But I think at that point I was already beginning to explore what I was capable of.\n\n\tAnd it happened with [the 2018 album] “Change the Whole Thing,” which I did completely live. That’s when I abandoned the Music Row way of recording — which is not bad, but it was limiting for me to find the session guys who play on so many records, then you go into the studio and lay down the track, you sing your vocal, and you comp the hell out of the vocal and manicure it and perfect it. I kind of lost myself in that sound, so I tried to make a record with a live band and no isolation booths, where we all had to kind of live and die by the take that we liked. And thus began my departure from country. And it wasn’t a very hospitable climate to women trying to get played on the radio, particularly in 2015. So I’m happy for those challenges now because it was like, “Well, I’m still gonna make music, but this is not working for me.”\n\n\tOn your last album, “No One Gets Out Alive,” you were on Big Loud, which of course is known as a country label. But you’re back off that now with your new EP. So was that a one-album experiment?\n\n\tYeah. With Big Loud, I actually brought them “No One Gets Out Alive” completely finished, [after] I figured I would release it independently, like I had my previous two albums. I think Big Loud was trying to diversify their roster. I do believe they really loved the project, and they promised me the world, so I said, “Okay, let’s release it together.” They wanted what I had to offer in terms of being outside of what they typically release as their bread and butter, I think to kind of have some skin in the game of a critically acclaimed artist’s career. Three months after we finally released the album, they just decided that they were moving on. I felt like this album’s life was over, and I was super devastated and had to recommit myself to the music.\n\t\n\n\tI think I found out a week later that I was pregnant with Graham. Then I found out a couple weeks after that that we got an album of the year Grammy nomination in the Americana category, because I submitted for a Grammy on my own. And I was like, well, that’s what this album’s all about —going for it and believing in yourself. And while there was this disappointment early on in the life cycle of this record, I’d been around the block. I’d seen the underbelly of how disposable artists can be to certain labels. And I felt very let down by that, but I was so encouraged by what happened after that and felt complete ownership of the success that we eventually did have with this music. I just had to not falter and continue to believe in it.\n\n\n\n\n\tThere’s some other songs on the new EP, “Cocoon,” that are me processing that surprise and grief, and also accepting some of that strength and anger, and also trying to encourage the listener — and myself, and my son — to take those chances. So it definitely colored a lot of my creative process, just that event in particular. But I got my masters back and got all the assets back, and I moved over to One Riot with Virgin Records pretty quickly after, and they helped me just continue to put gas on the fire with this music.\n\n\tYou’ve got six songs on the new “Cocoon” EP, and we know you’re working on another full album for 2026. “Cocoon” seems to be in a different direction from “No One Gets Out Alive.” We’re not hearing any 60-piece orchestras on the EP.\n\n\tNo. The intention with “Cocoon” was to bridge moments in time. It’s an examination of growth in all of its glory and all of its edges. I was expecting my son, who’s now six months old, and I wanted to have songs that I would want Graham to hear when he was feeling moments of doubt or needing encouragement. And some songs were written to unburden myself of certain emotions or feelings that I didn’t need to carry with me into this new chapter. A lot of these songs were recorded towards the end of my pregnancy and before he arrived, so it felt like a really great way to honor that growth that I was feeling as a person and as an artist, and sort of be a lily pad to get me to the next project that I was working on simultaneously, which has yet another kind of sound to it. This was vocal-forward, and some of these songs were just more pop-structured. Also, getting to do a duet with Grace Potter was something I was really excited about doing. So I feel like it’s a cool collection of songs that is pretty dynamic for the short time in which it was created.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tSo do you think the EP has a distinct personality apart from what the next full album will be?\n\n\tIt definitely does. With the record that I am currently working on, I knew that the sound was gonna be yet another big departure. I’m still trying to cultivate this LP I’m working with Daniel Tashian and Lawrence Rothman. … I hesitate to characterize it, but it’s very dreamy and there’s serious elegance to it. Daniel and Lawrence are such capable musicians, and there’s a little bit of jazz to it, there’s some R&B, and it’s ethereal.\n\n\tWith the “Cocoon” songs, it’s an exploration of identity, and there’s excitement in there, but there’s also worry about what my life will be like after this very significant change. There’s a lot of happiness in the record, and that’s hard for me to do sometimes, just really step into and embrace the joy.\n\n\n\tThe title “Cocoon” already sounds more upbeat than “No One Gets Out Alive.”\n\n\tThe cocoon implies that there’s so much more to come —that there will be an emergence after this stage. And it also was a little mode of me kind of trying to protect myself a little bit, and knowing that I kind of needed to recover from such a big time and be creative and kind of hunker down for a little bit. So, it’s a happy record in many, many ways. There’s lots of nature imagery. There’s a song called “Sting,” and lots of insects. I don’t know what was going on, thinking unintentionally about that. But I can’t wait for Graham to be old enough to know what was going on when those songs were being recorded. It’s hard to sing when you’re seven months pregnant, though. I did feel that in the studio a little bit. But it’s easier to sing them live now.\n\n\tWhat do you think Graham will get from the music when he listens someday?\n\n\tI think the novelty of just the fact that they were all recorded while we were expecting him should be pretty cool for him. It’s like he’ll be able to read my diary of those moments before he arrived. And then there’s other songs still that have yet to be released that will be an even deeper dive into the vulnerability I was feeling. I think he’ll maybe understand some of the difficult things I was trying to juggle at the time as well. But he certainly is anything but a burden to me. Knowing he was coming made me work so hard and get my shit together, and being more selective about my time, treating this as the business that it is, even though it’s my dream job. Touring as much as I do is no joke, and you need to take care of yourself. And I wanted him to come into a great environment, so I was also trying to get my surroundings right and be selective about that too.\n\t\n\n\tYou mentioned the first single, “Sting,” sort of fitting in with the unintentional insect theme. What’s that about?\n\n\tThat’s me processing some emotions that I needed to leave behind — just feeling a little slighted and let down by people in the industry who had totally not delivered on promises they made to me and my music. But also, there’s so much tongue-in-cheek to it. I was at that point realizing things were gonna be just fine, but I had to make sure that I just got one little jab in there about how “I see you, and what you did, but I’ll be all right. I’m not stinging over here.”\n\n\n\n\n\tYou’ve referred to your duet with Grace Potter, “Poison in My Well,” being a song about people who don’t support each other. Is it maybe iabout women specifically not doing that? Which, in that case, would make it interesting, or ironic, that you made the choice to sing it as a a duet with another powerful woman.\n\n\tI actually feel like my support system of women in this industry is really strong. It was more about just having so many good things happening and just seeing certain people having a little difficulty embracing that. Or they kind of want to suspend you in this place, or they refuse to see your growth or genuine accomplishments that you’ve come by in an honest way. And Grace is so not that person. I felt like [the duet] was a way to emphasize: “This is what it looks like to support one another.”… She’s an incredible vocalist. She knows exactly what she wants to do, because I’m not gonna tell her what to sing on it. I was like, “Second verse and whatever [else] you want.” She delivered, and that song has attitude and also playfulness, which she has in spades. She’s a good time. If you know Grace, you love Grace.\n\n\n\n\n\tTalking about Grace reminds me that I just wanted to ask a real basic question about how you see your voice. In a way, you remind me of Grace a little bit, or vice versa, in that when you listen to some of her music, you don’t know immediately what she’s capable of…\n\n\tTotally.\n\n\tAnd you have a reputation as a singer’s singer, and you’re a real go-to person if somebody wants a guest or a duet. But in your music, you’re not showing off a lot in any obvious fashion. I feel that about Grace, too —that she and you aren’t always doing the soulful thing all the time.\n\t\n\n\tYeah. I mean, you won’t catch us doing vocal runs in everything. She and I do love to go full-sail and belt. Like, we need to do it regularly; singers have to sing. But we also have some restraint. She and I are really good collaborators, obviously with each other, and with other people, and that means being able to blend with other people and with the track and not being too heavy-handed on something that doesn’t need it. Just as sometimes vulnerability and a very sparse track are gonna be more effective than having a huge orchestral arrangement. But we know we have this rasp. We both love Tina Turner and Bonnie Raitt, and we love kind of stepping into our masculinity as vocalists. We want to be committed when we’re singing at times, but it becomes overbearing if it’s just constant. And so dynamics are so important — those quiet moments make those other moments pop. But she’s rock ‘n’ roll, for sure…. She’s got the growl, and I think I have the vibrato, and there’s a cool little mixture that we both have.\n\n\tYou recently released a non-album single of yourself and Vince Gill singing “I Can’t Make You Love Me.” It takes a certain amount of nerve to cover a song associated with Bonnie Raitt.\n\n\tYes, it does, but Vince helped me feel better about it. I just called up and he was watching the World Series and he said yes on a phone call. You gotta make the ask. The worst thing they can do is say no. He’s so legendary and he’s an example of a Nashville country artist who also plays with the Eagles and kind of goes wherever the music takes him. And I would struggle to really pinpoint what kind of artist Vince Gill is, either other than super talented, but he lives in a lot of spaces because he can. I want to hopefully follow in his footsteps and walk through a door that’s open to me if it looks like what’s going on in there is fun.\n\n\n\n\n\tIn terms of collaborations, so many people have loved inviting you to do things on stage. You have talked about the jam band scene and how welcome you are in that world.\n\n\tWhich is so pleasantly surprising and awesome. It’s what we were just talking about in reference to Vince Gill or even Grace. I’m gung-ho. I love a sit-in. If you invite me to join you at a festival, and it feels like a bit of a challenge and it’s like this incredible band that I get to jam with for a song or two, that’s exhilarating. It’s scary, and it’s a great way to make friends and maybe eventually collaborators. That’s what the jam world really seems to love, this live urgency of: Are they gonna pull it off? That’s the thrill of watching a band like Phish kind of meander and like, oh, it’s feeling dark, and then all of a sudden, you’re riding the wave with them and it comes together, and it’s unrehearsed. So I think that is what I attribute the affection I get from that community to. \n\t\n\n\tCollaborations that I’ve loved have included singing with Jim James of My Morning Jacket at the MusiCares Persons of the Year event  this year. I think they are artists through and through. And singing in tribute to the Grateful Dead, it was surreal. I blacked out, I was so nervous, because it was such an incredible room of people, and we were staring at Bobby (Weir), like, “Don’t be mad — trying to do your song justice.” \n\n\tCollaborating with such different types of artists helps expand the talk of which genre you belong in… which, like most artists, you probably get tired of being asked about.\n\n\tWith the genre [conversation, I never tire of talking about it, actually. Because I think it’s a necessity of our industry. And I want people to come to the live show. I want people to not write someone off based just o what their first Spotify song is. But it’s hard to expect that of your audience right now. You know? There’s so much out there. So I think that’s another reason to just keep releasing music and try to continue just being as generous as you can with what’s going on with you right now. There’s that balance between not being too precious with your songs and also making sure that you create that mood and that vibe that you’re trying to render. But when you’ve been taking people along with you through years and years, and trying to kind of figure out what works, you’re gonna have people asking about what genre you see yourself in. And that’s a privilege.\n\n\t“Finding your voice” has figurative and literal implications.\n\n\tI would think that 25-year-old me is a very different person than who I am now. I mean, I admire her and I’m proud of the bravery that she had to do what she enjoys doing, but I certainly think she made some weird decisions. And that’s sort of the beauty of it. I’m happy that I’ve been able to continue making music and arrive closer and closer to what I feel like is the best representation of the music I want to make. … I think we have one voice that should bend and alter and evolve, and that’s okay. We do only get one vessel, but we shouldn’t feel bound to one sound. The audience might disagree, and your marketing team might disagree as well, but you’ve gotta go for it.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix revealed its third-quarter 2025 earnings Tuesday, focusing on revenue results following its decision to stop regularly reporting subscriber data earlier this year.\n\n\tThe streamer reported adjusted EPS of $5.87 on $11.51 billion in revenue. Analysts expected Netflix to report Q3 revenue of $11.51 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $6.97 for the July-September quarter, according to research firm LSEG Data & Analytics.\n\n\n\tThe streamer had projected revenue at $11.5 billion (growth of 17%) and EPS of $6.87, as well as an operating margin of 31.5%. \n\t\n\n\tNetflix explained the miss on earnings in a letter to shareholders Tuesday, writing: “Operating margin of 28% was below our guidance of 31.5% due to an expense related to an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities that was not in our forecast. Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q3’25 operating margin forecast. We don’t expect this matter to have a material impact on future results.”\n\n\tNetflix shares were down more than 6% in after-hours trading on the earnings miss.\n\n\tIn July, Netflix increased its revenue forecast for full-year 2025 to a range of $44.8 billion to $45.2 billion (previously $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion) or 15-16% year over year growth.\n\n\tDuring Q3, Netflix’s biggest achievement by far was the sudden success of animated musical “KPop Demon Hunters,” which has sustained its fandom through the current Q4 and continues to be a driver of viewership — and box office sales — for Netflix. \n\n\tAhead of its earnings presentation Tuesday, Netflix announced it would be re-releasing “KPop Demon Hunters” in theaters following the film’s impressive first theatrical run this summer, which was prompted by the movie’s streaming chart growth following its June 20 debut on the platform. The streamer has also set what’s sure to be a lucrative merch deal with both Mattel and Hasbro for toys, dolls, games and more across the franchise.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to “KPop Demon Hunters,” Netflix says it attributes its Q3 performance to viewership for “Wednesday” Season 2, “Bon Appétit,” “Your Majesty” from South Korea, “Happy Gilmore 2,” and its Canelo vs. Crawford boxing match, which became the most-viewed men’s championship fight this century.\n\n\tNetflix suspended its practice of reporting total subscriber numbers beginning with the first quarter of 2025, which ran January-March. That means the last time Netflix publicly confirmed its overall subscriber count was in back in January, when it reported it had reached 301.6 million global streaming paid members by the end of 2024.\n\n\t(Pictured above: Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters”)\n",

Danny and his son Gilbert were spotted arriving at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday ... and Danny, being pushed along, gave some observers cause for concern.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          A source close to Danny tells TMZ … the beloved actor -- known for his assorted badass characters -- had a knee replacement … and at airports, a wheelchair makes it easier for him to get around. That's it ... Danny is fine.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The explanation is actually pretty important context ... 'cause poor Danny has been the target of death hoxes in the past ... the most recent happening last month!\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... it all started when tributes started to circulate on Instagram ... and the hoax really took off when John Leguizamo shared it.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The actors were both in \"The Infiltrator\" ... so it stood to reason in the moment that JL might know if something had happened to Danny.\n      \n    \n          Take it easy, Danny!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Danny Trejo\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive Details\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tAshes to Films, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit arts organization established in the wake of January’s wildfires, has unveiled its first cohort of fire-affected filmmakers who will receive grants and other support to help craft a short film.\n\n\tAshes to Films was created by industry veterans who were deeply impacted by the Eaton and Pacific Palisades fires that left more than 30 people dead and more than 13,000 homes destroyed. The backers of Ashes to Films aim to harness the idea that creativity and the arts help people heal after intense trauma.\n\t\n\n\t“Ashes to Films exists to prove that hope doesn’t burn; dreams don’t burn—and neither does creativity,” said founder Shiloh Strong, a photorgrapher and filmmaker who lost his own home to a wildfire years ago. \n\n\n\tAshes to Films has raised some $85,000 to date and has lined up such notable backers and partners as Quixote, Blackmagic Design, We Make Movies, Echobend Studios, Samy’s Camera and the New York Film Academy. Alyssa Dudek, an alum of the Creative Coalition, has signed on as executive director. “Supporting artists in Los Angeles is supporting the city’s future,” Dudek said. \n\n\tAshes to Films’ first group of filmmakers are Seriina Covarrubias, Eric Dyson, Carter Hudson, Jennifer Kim, Judy Korin, Kristen O’Meara, Kerry Ann Reid, Elle Schneider and Maxwell Weidenfeld. The nine participants “represent a diverse group of adults and teens who lost homes, schools and communities to the fires. Their films explore resilience, imagination and recovery,” Ashes to Films said. They will receive production equipment, soundstage access and mentorship.\n\t\n\n\tThe short films will premiere at the Ashes to Films Festival set for Jan. 7-11, to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the blazes that changed the face of the Altadena area and the Palisades forever. \n\n\tEarlier this summer, Ashes to Films awarded scholarships to teen filmmakers who completed a week-long intensive and filmed their projects on the Universal Studios backlot.\n\n\t“We are proud to be an early supporter of Ashes to Films and the talented filmmakers they are empowering through our donation of equipment and access to our facilities,” said Sean Griffin, senior VP of sales for Quixote. “These filmmakers deserve to be treated like VIPs, and we are excited to roll out the red carpet for them.”\n\n\tAspiring fire-affected filmmakers are invited to submit works exploring themes of resilience for festival consideration by Dec. 1. More information can be found at AshestoFilms.org. \n\n\t(Pictured: Harper Secada-Borrego, an Ashes to Films Young Filmmaker, directs a scene at Universal Studios)\n",

Planned initiatives include workshops and masterclasses, along with student and faculty exchange programs. Both institutions will also work with industry partners to ensure practical applications of their collaborative work.\n\n\tThe IICT-Deakin agreement is one of several Australia-India partnerships announced at the Bazaar. Australia’s Indian Film Festival of Melbourne formalized a multi-year partnership with IFFI through three separate MoUs, establishing frameworks for festival exchanges, talent development programs, producer labs, and a co-distribution fund to support South Asian films in both territories. A second MoU linked Deakin University’s film school with the Film and Television Institute of India, focusing on curriculum collaboration and joint workshops.\n\t\n\n\tIndian entertainment platform PTC Punjabi also partnered with Australian production company Temple to co-present three Punjabi-language feature films under the Australia-India Audiovisual Co-Production Treaty. Additionally, Australia’s National Indian Film Festival signed an MoU with NFDC India and IFFI, positioning the festival as a key platform for Indian cinema in Australia.\n\n\tIICT is also operating a booth at the WAVES Film Bazaar, where attendees are participating in interactive activities and receiving information about the institution’s programs and initiatives.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures International Productions has forged a multi-year agreement with Qatar’s nascent Film Committee to co-finance a slate of Arabic-language films from the Middle East and North Africa. \n\n\tThe deal is one of several pacts with Hollywood studios being unveiled at the inaugural Doha Film Festival‘s Industry Days by Hassan Al Thawadi, the Qatari lawyer who chairs the Qatar Film Committee and oversaw the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament. It follows similar deals with U.S. indie studios Neon and Miramax announced on Friday.\n\t\n\n\tThe Qatar Film Committee is an official body that is part of the Media City Qatar hub and is tasked with driving growth of the country’s entertainment industry. On Friday, they announced the launch of a regional rebate offering up to 50% in cash.\n\n\n\t“The agreement to develop a presence in Qatar, which includes a commitment to global distribution and the co-development and co-production of multiple Arabic-language feature films, underscores Sony’s commitment to the region,” Qatar Film Committee and Sony said in a joint statement.\n\n\t“Projects may include original stories or adaptations from Sony’s library, managed by a jointly approved local producer, directly benefitting the production ecosystem in Qatar and the wider region,” the statement specified. “Sony will distribute globally, while the Film Committee and Sony Pictures International Productions share approval on all key creative and financial decisions. The agreement also entails the development of a writers’ incubation lab designed to foster a new generation of writers from the region.”\n\t\n\n\tDetails regarding projects that may already be in the pipeline are being kept under wraps.\n\n\t“The commitment of Sony Pictures to co-develop and produce Arabic-language films in partnership with the Film Committee reflects the region’s growing prominence in the global film industry and the Global South’s emergence as a true creative force,” said Al Thawadi in the statement.\n\n\tSony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group’s Steven O’Dell commented: “The Middle East is one of the most dynamic and rapidly growing regions in entertainment. Sony Pictures has a long history of working in growing markets, and this new agreement in Qatar reflects our commitment to the region as we continue to bring impactful, locally resonant stories to audiences.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGlobal post-production and VFX giant Company 3 has signed an agreement with the nascent Film Committee at Media City Qatar to set up a post-production and VFX studio in Doha.\n\n\tThe Los Angeles headquartered outfit, headed by ace colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld, that handles post-production on a large portion of Hollywood series and films – including, most recently, “Wicked: For Good,” “F1,” “Superman,” “Frankenstein” and “Stranger Things” Season 5 – “will provide technical, creative, and operational guidance to shape the foundation for a high-end post-production environment in the region,” according to a statement.\n\t\n\n\tThe plan is for the post-production studio facility in Doha, which is the Qatari capital, to be completed in roughly six months.\n\n\n\tThe Qatar Film Committee – an official body that is part of the Media City Qatar hub, and is tasked with driving growth of the country’s entertainment industry – will support this collaboration “through a structured funding and facilitation framework, reflecting Qatar’s ambition to become the production and post-production hub for the Middle East and Africa,” the statement added.\n\n\t“We are super excited to bring our post-production services here, which I think are the best, coupled with the best rebates in the world,” Sonnenfeld said in a press briefing, noting that the agreement was prompted by talks initiated two years ago by Sheikha Mayassa, the sister of the Emir of Qatar, who personally reached out to him. \n\n\tNegotiations between Company 3 and Qatari authorities then continued with Hassan Al Thawadi, the Qatari lawyer who chairs the Qatar Film Committee and previously oversaw the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament.\n\t\n\n\tSonnenfeld said Company 3 had acted as a consultant in designing the structure of Qatar’s new production rebate. He noted that, when it comes to post-production, the incentive is not tied to a project actually shooting in Qatar.\n\n\tThe freshly announced rebate called Qatar Screen Production Incentive offers an up to 50% in cash incentive on qualifying Qatari production expenditure, combining a 40% base rebate with an additional uplift of up to 10% for productions that meet defined criteria such as hiring Qatari talent, investing in local training, promoting Qatari culture, and other aspects of industry development.\n\n\t“This partnership embodies Qatar’s vision to support the very best creators in Qatar, the region and the Global South. With Company 3’s world-renowned expertise in visual storytelling and our commitment to building advanced creative infrastructure, Doha is poised to become a destination for world-class post-production and visual effects,” Al Thawadi said in a statement.\n\n\tThe deal with Company 3 follows production partnerships announcement on Friday between the Qatar Film Committee and U.S. studios including Neon and Miramax. \n",

    "body": "\n\tLebanese director Sarah Francis brought her quietly devastating marital drama “Dead Dog” to the Cairo Film Festival’s Horizons of Arab Cinema Competition, where the film won the Saad Eldin Wahba Award for best Arabic film. When we met with Francis ahead of the closing ceremony, the impact of the film, anchored by intimate performances from Chirine Karameh and Nida Wakim, was already rippling through the festival.\n\n\tFor Karameh, who had stepped away from acting for years, the project became an unexpected artistic re-entry. She later won best actress at the Next Generation Awards, presented during Cairo Industry Days’ closing ceremony.\n\t\n\n\tKarameh told Variety how Francis’ vision pulled her back to the craft she thought she’d left behind: “Deep inside, there was always a quiet place telling me something was still waiting for me. When I learned the project was with Sarah, something immediately shifted.”\n\n\n\t“Dead Dog” was produced by Lara Abou Saifan and the team at Placeless Films, whose early commitment, Francis said, helped build the film’s stripped-down emotional world. The film’s Arab world sales are handled by MAD Distribution, while MAD World oversees its global distribution. It premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam before traveling to ⁠São Paulo, ⁠Sarajevo and Cairo.\n\n\tBelow, Francis speaks to Variety about how she built the film’s fragile emotional terrain, made the shift from hybrid work to fiction, and the collaborative process behind “Dead Dog.”\n\n\tYou come from a hybrid and documentary background. What sparked “Dead Dog,” and why tell it as fiction?I rarely know how an idea starts. Sometimes it’s an image, sometimes it’s a scene. With this film, it began with two people who know each other well meeting in a kind of transitional space, a temporary moment in time. I wanted to explore the misunderstanding or miscommunication between them, and as I followed that thread, the story of Aida and Walid unfolded.\n\t\n\n\tThey meet over four days in a mountain house he inherited from his parents, a place they don’t really live in, almost semi-abandoned. I was interested in working with very minimal elements: two people, one place, one specific slice of time. And at the same time, certain objects, like a photograph, a letter, open windows into other moments in their relationship. It becomes like a constellation of linked moments.\n\n\tWhat did the move from hybrid forms to fiction allow you to explore that you couldn’t before?With fiction, suddenly there’s a whole architecture you need to build — wardrobe, camera choices, shot lists, and so many practical questions. Some things were very clear in my mind, and others were completely new. Working with actors was also challenging but very interesting.\n\n\tEven with all that preparation, you’re still confronted with the reality of the moment: what the actors bring, how the scene feels that day, even the weather. In a way, it became similar to a documentary again. You watch what’s happening in front of you, sense what’s important, decide what you can let go of, and follow the thread that presents itself.\n\n\tEmigration shapes the distance between Aida and Walid. Why did you choose to root the story in that specific Lebanese reality?It wasn’t something I started with, but as I developed the characters, it felt obvious that Walid would be part of that reality. Emigration has been common in Lebanon for more than a century, even before the civil war, during it, and after every crisis, and today the diaspora is larger than the population inside the country. Often the man leaves alone and returns only occasionally.\n\n\tSo Walid is someone who isn’t fully anchored anywhere. He’s not settled abroad, but he also can’t easily come back, because he’s unsure what he would be returning to. Meanwhile, Aida has been living through Lebanon’s difficulties alone, while raising their daughter, managing daily life, enduring the constant instability. Naturally, each of them carries disappointments and expectations that were never met.\n\n\tWhat truly interested me, though, wasn’t emigration as a subject but the emotional space it creates. They’re both in a transitional moment, searching for a center of their relationship and of themselves. Nothing feels fixed, not feelings, not decisions, not even the sense of safety their marriage once promised. That uncertainty became the heart of the film.\n\t\n\n\tThe relationship between Aida and Walid feels intimate but fractured. How did you approach working with the actors to build that emotional history?Both actors live abroad, so they arrived a few weeks before the shoot for rehearsals. That time was essential. We didn’t just go through the script, we talked a lot about who these two people were before the film starts, defining why they first got married, what each of them expected, what disappointed them, and what they were carrying into this moment. Together we built a kind of shared history, and at the same time each actor also developed their own private backstory. I think that combination gave the characters a richer inner life.\n\n\tThere were also moments when their real opinions about certain things, especially around gender roles or expectations, didn’t align. They sometimes had different views in real life, just as their characters do. That dynamic slipped naturally into their scenes and made the tension between Aida and Walid feel very true.\n\n\tBy the time we began shooting, each actor had formed a very specific “truth” of who their character was. Those truths didn’t always match perfectly in a given moment, which was actually very helpful. The friction, the misunderstandings, the tenderness all came from the perspectives they had fully internalized. The performances felt natural because they were acting from a place they had built and believed in.\n\n\tSilence plays a major role in the film both emotionally and structurally. How did you decide when dialogue was needed and when silence could say more?The script originally had more dialogue, but during rehearsal and shooting, we always ran entire scenes from the beginning, even if we only needed to adjust one line. The actors settled into a rhythm together, and often we realized the scene was already clear through their looks, their body language, or how they moved in the space.\n\n\tSound and music were also essential. With Victor Bresse, the sound designer, we worked to create a very minimal but still impactful world around the characters. And with the original music by Rabih Gebeile, I felt he added a complementary layer, not repeating the film’s emotions, but telling the story in another tone, almost like a narrator with its own voice.\n\t\n\n\tCairo is a major platform for Arab filmmakers. What did it mean to you to screen “Dead Dog” in the Horizons of Arab Cinema Competition, and what were you hoping regional audiences would take from it?We were all very excited to be in Cairo with this film because Cairo is really a hub for cinema and has such a rich history. Chirine (Aida), Lara (producer), my family, so many of us grew up watching Egyptian films. Being here felt like entering a space that belongs to so many people in the Arab world. And the fact that the festival has a genuine public audience was important for us.\n\n\tAfter the screening, an Egyptian woman came up to me and said that with everything happening in the region, so much of our cinema has become centered on catastrophe, which is understandable and necessary. But watching “Dead Dog” gave her a sense of relief, because she felt: “I exist as well.” She was grateful to see a small story about human beings and intimate, existential questions.\n\n\tThat meant a lot to me. I think everyday stories also deserve space. People still live, love, separate, and question themselves even in difficult times. I don’t feel every film needs to represent an entire nation’s trauma. These quiet stories matter too.\n\n\tThe film received key support from Doha Film Institute, the Red Sea Film Fund, and others. What did that support bring to the project?Doha were the first funders, they also supported my first film, and that trust meant a lot. Starting a film in Lebanon is extremely hard given the economic crisis and the lack of a solid industry infrastructure. Red Sea supported us in post-production at exactly the moment we needed it to finish the film.\n\n\tI also felt part of a regional cinematic community rather than isolated. And none of this would have been possible without Placeless Films. Lara Abou Saifan and the producing team trusted the script from the very beginning. We never had to fight over vision. By chance, we also became an all-women producing/directing team, which created a very warm and collaborative partnership.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was a homecoming of sorts for Radiohead on Friday night, when the Oxfordshire-bred band played its first show in the U.K. in eight years at London’s O2 Arena. \n\n\tThis month, the iconic alt-rock group — fronted by Thom Yorke and consisting of guitarist Jonny Greenwood, bassist Colin Greenwood, drummer Philip Selway and guitarist/backing vocalist Ed O’Brien — has embarked on its first tour in nearly a decade, playing four-night residencies in Madrid, Bologna, London, Copenhagen and Berlin. With two cities before it, London attendees had an idea of what to expect (for example, that Radiohead would be playing in the round on a stage in the center of the floor), but not much can prepare one for the feeling of witnessing a band some thought may never return.\n\t\n\n\tRead on for the highlights from Radiohead’s first of four London shows, from the unique stage-set up to a truly cathartic encore.\n\n\n\tRadiohead in the Round\n\n\tWalking onto the O2 Arena’s floor, concertgoers were immediately confronted with a big decision — where is the best place to stand? With a round stage in the middle and panels covering the set-up from view, fans paced around in circles and consulted Reddit threads in an attempt to determine the most ideal location. About 15 minutes to showtime, anticipation peaked in the multi-generational crowd — there were your expected middle-aged men, but also dads with daughters and groups of rowdy teenage boys — as the outside panels on the stage began to pulse. Each section of the crowd hollered when a panel close to them lit up, until the entire crowd was yelling as the band walked through to the stage. \n\t\n\n\tThe lights went down and the first few notes of “Planet Telex” rang out, but the band continued to be shrouded by the panels until mid-way through the second song, “2+2=5.” Once the panels lifted, it was revealed that there was really no bad place to stand. With microphones on both ends, Yorke switched sides every few songs, and the stage’s raised height meant everyone could see (even if a very tall man loomed in front of you). Colin Greenwood and O’Brien were stationed where this journalist was standing — on the opposite side from where attendees entered the floor — as was the piano where Yorke would stop to play the band’s ballads. Though Jonny Greenwood was mainly on the other side of the stage, he too made his way around eventually, ripping his way through guitar solos and pausing to play the piano during “Daydreaming.”\n\n\tThom in His Element\n\n\tThough all members of the band were in peak form, Yorke really seemed to be in his element. Dressed casually in a denim jacket and baggy jeans, he maneuvered around the stage with glee, almost skipping at some points. During tracks like “15 Step” and “Kid A,” he showed off his signature dance moves, flailing his body around and moving to the beat in an almost salsa-like fashion. He also enjoyed working the crowd, motioning for them to scream and clap at points, with a particularly incredible response during “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.” For “Daydreaming,” a roadie brought out a music stand and Yorke began to compose, waving his arms around as if he were Mozart. Though the frontman did not say many words — only a “pleased to meet you” and “thank you very much” every once in a while — his stage presence remained magnetic and enthralling to watch.\n\n\tA Surprisingly Phoneless Crowd\n\n\tGoing into this tour, there was a slight concern that we may be seeing the TikTokification of Radiohead due to songs like “Let Down” and “No Surprises” going viral on the app. Would the crowd just be full of teenagers with their phones in the air? Somewhat surprisingly, the opposite was true. Even when they played the songs that have granted them a new Gen Z audience, there was barely any video-taking, with everyone preferring to stay in the moment. In fact, it was probably one of the least phone-crazed concerts I’ve been to all year, giving the show a real community feel.\n\t\n\n\tSetlist Science\n\n\tSo far, the current tour’s setlist has been a pretty even mix across Radiohead’s discography — except for 1993 debut “Pablo Honey,” which the band rarely performs live. Charts have been made on Reddit just to keep track of the set, with it seemingly following a pattern of playing certain songs every other show. Their first night in London mainly stayed true to this (see the full setlist below), but the band still found ways to switch things up: “Lucky” and “Bloom” traded places, “Idioteque” went back to the 12th spot after appearing in the encore during the last Bologna show, “Everything in Its Right Place” was played 13th (it’s typically been 12th or the final song of the encore) and “Jigsaw Falling Into Place” was played 16th for the first time (instead of third). Despite drawing from the same material every night, this variation has ensured that each show is truly a unique experience.\n\n\tA Cathartic Encore  \n\n\tThe best part just may have been the encore, with a series of seven heavy-hitters — “Fake Plastic Trees, “Let Down, “Paranoid Android,” “You and Whose Army?,” “A Wolf at the Door, “Just” and “Karma Police” — drawing the set to a cathartic close. From the first notes of “Fake Plastic Trees,” the show turned into a true singalong, with the crowd even overpowering Yorke at certain points. This section of the night also elicited the most words out of the frontman, who said before playing “Just”: “This is one we wrote on a freezing cold farm in 1994, when we thought maybe this wouldn’t go anywhere. We thought, ‘Fuck it, let’s just write this one song.'” Thank God they did. \n\n\tSee Radiohead’s full setlist for their Nov. 21 London show below.\n\n\t“Planet Telex”\n\n\t“2+2+5”\n\n\t“Sit Down. Stand Up”\n\n\t“Lucky”\n\n\t“Bloom”\n\n\t“15 Step”\n\n\t“The Gloaming”\n\n\t“Kid A”\n\n\t“No Surprises”\n\n\t“Videotape”\n\n\t“Weird Fishes/Arpeggi”\n\n\t“Idioteque”\n\n\t“Everything in Its Right Place”\n\n\t“The National Anthem”\n\n\t“Daydreaming”\n\n\t“Jigsaw Falling Into Place”\n\n\t“Bodysnatchers”\n\n\t“There There”\n\n\tEncore\n\n\t“Fake Plastic Trees”\n\n\t“Let Down”\n\n\t“Paranoid Android”\n\n\t“You and Whose Army?”\n\n\t“A Wolf at the Door”\n\n\t“Just”\n\n\t“Karma Police”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNews of President Trump’s surprisingly amiable meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani traveled fast, leaving at least one Mamdani voter gobsmacked by the President’s abrupt change of tone.\n\n\t“[During the election, Trump] called him a communist and said New York City was going to go down the drain,” said director Spike Lee at a Torino Film Festival press conference. “I mean, the President said he was going to cut off federal funding. So from the things that were said to this quick turnaround… I’m puzzled.” \n\t\n\n\t“We shall see what we shall see,” Lee continued, still bemused by the sudden Oval Office bromance. “When you go back and see what the President said about him, and what would happen to New York City if [Mamdani] won, it just seems…,” he trailed off. “It seems like they somehow found common ground.” \n\n\n\tOf course, the filmmaker — himself as voluble and emblematic an NYC icon as the two politicians who met on Friday — was just as happy to throw some punches. “There were a lot of people saying if Mamdani won, they were going to leave New York City. Now, I really want the real numbers if anybody actually left!” \n\n\tThe Oscar-winning director arrived in Turin just days after meeting Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, where Lee gifted the Chicago-born pontiff a customized Knicks jersey in an encounter that quickly went viral. \n\n\t“People who never knew who I was now do, all because of this picture of the Pope holding up the jersey,” Lee said with a smile, shortly after exclaiming, “I knew this question was going to come up!” \n\t\n\n\tNearly a week after the meeting, Lee remained effusive — especially given his initial disbelief upon receiving the invitation. “I got an email from his office, and I thought it was fake,” he laughed. “Another word in English for fake is ‘fugazi’… but they wrote back that this was going to be about cinema, so right away I was floating.” \n\n\t“The Pope was telling the truth, as he saw it, about how cinema could have a great impact for good,” Lee continued, before adding: “His people are Black. Do your research. His family comes from New Orleans — Creole. Lot of intermarriage. So Black folks, we claim him. We call him our brother!” \n\n\tLee was equally enthusiastic when discussing “Sinners” auteur Ryan Coogler, calling the blues-and-blood vampire tale his favorite film of the year (“I was jumping out of my seat; it was amazing!”) and praising the younger filmmaker as an equally salutary force. \n\n\t“Hollywood has improved because more people of color are behind and in front of the camera,” Lee said. “I mean, it’s way better now than when I started back in 1986.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked” still knows about popular. Universal Pictures‘ musical sequel “For Good” swept up a spectacular $68.6 million across Friday and preview screenings from 4,115 locations in North America. That puts it on pace for a $151.5 million opening weekend through Sunday.\n\n\tIt’d be the biggest bow ever for a Broadway adaptation and the second-biggest ever for a Universal release, only behind “Jurassic World.” It’s also well ahead of the $112 million haul that the first “Wicked” debuted to in the same pre-Thanksgiving frame last year. If the Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande film hits its current projections, it’ll rank among the biggest domestic openings of the year, currently led by “A Minecraft Movie” ($162 million) and the “Lilo & Stitch” remake ($146 million).\n\t\n\n\tThough the $68.6 million opening day figure on “For Good” technically ranks as the biggest of the year — ahead of “A Minecraft Movie” ($57.11 million) and “Superman” ($56.5 million) — it comes with an asterisk. Universal lifted the curtain early on the second “Wicked,” adding previews on Monday and Wednesday ahead of the standard Thursday evening kick-off. With early screenings for Amazon Prime members and fan-focused double features, “Wicked: For Good” had already earned $12.6 million before Thursday.\n\n\n\tEarly-week releases have become more common in recent years. Over the summer, “Superman” held Tuesday screenings for Amazon Prime members ahead of its Thursday previews.\n\n\tRegardless, it’s still a spectacular start for the PG-rated musical and a shot in the arm for North American theaters, which have been starved of a true blockbuster for several months now. The last film to open in the nine-digits was “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” all the way back in July. The biggest since was “The Conjuring: Last Rites” ($84 million) in early September.\n\t\n\n\t“For Good” has the benefit of getting almost all the Imax and other premium large-format theaters to itself, getting a boost from luxury ticket prices. CJ4DPLex noted that the pink-and-green musical earned $922,000 in 4DX auditoriums and $1 million in ScreenX auditoriums across previews and Friday, marking a 70% uptick from the formats’ collective opening day on the first “Wicked.”\n\n\tThe feature is expected to remain a high-demand release through the Thanksgiving holiday and into December. Reviews have generally been positive, though the reception has been cooler on “For Good” than its predecessor’s awards-heralding raves from last year. Early audiences seem as receptive this time around, with moviegoer pollster Cinema Score turning in an “A” grade, on par with the 2024 predecessor. Universal spent $300 million between both “Wicked” features, not including massive marketing spends, but that investment has delivered not one but two event-status tentpoles.\n\n\tLionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” is falling to second after opening atop the charts last weekend. The ensemble heist threequel earned another $2.6 million on Friday, with projections for a $9.4 million sophomore outing for a 55% drop from its debut. Domestic total should hit $37.1 million through its first 10 days. Overseas grosses have been the lion’s share of ticket sales.\n\n\t“Predator: Badlands” looks to hold in third place, adding another $1.7 million on Friday for a 51% drop from its daily total a week ago. Now in its third weekend, Disney’s sci-fi sequel is set to surpass a $76.5 million domestic total through Sunday — closing in on “Alien vs. Predator” ($80 million) to become the highest-grossing North American theatrical release of the franchise.\n\n\tParamount’s “The Running Man” is slipping to fourth, earning $1.66 million on Friday and projecting a sophomore outing of $6 million. That’d be a significant 63% drop after an already underwhelming opening weekend for the $110 million production. Glen Powell and director Edgar Wright’s dystopian action-thriller is slowing down fast, projected for a $27.2 million domestic cume through Sunday.\n\n\tFifth looks to go to “Rental Family,” a well-reviewed family drama starring Brendan Fraser as an actor abroad in Japan. The film, from Disney’s specialty Searchlight Pictures banner, earned $1.2 million across Friday and previews from 1,925 locations. The hope is that awards buzz and great audience notices will keep the film relevant moving ahead. Cinema Score notched a strong “A” grade.\n\t\n\n\tBowing just outside the top five, Sony is putting out Stage 6 Films and Screen Gems’ “Sisu: Road to Revenge” in 2,222 venues. The bloody R-rated period piece earned about $1.2 million across Friday and previews, a smidge behind the $1.3 million opening day haul for the original “Sisu” in 2023. That film wasn’t much of a theatrical performer, finishing with $7.2 million domestic and $14.2 million worldwide, but it evidently drew enough of a cult reputation downstream to justify a sequel. Reviews have been positive for “Road to Revenge,” while Cinema Score turned in a warm enough “B” grade.\n",

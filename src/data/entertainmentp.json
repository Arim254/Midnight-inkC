    "body": "\n\tMorgan Freeman recently told The Guardian that he is pissed off when it comes to AI recreating his iconic voice without his consent. The Oscar winner said his “lawyers have been very, very busy” as of late working to remove all unauthorized uses of his voice off the internet. \n\n\t“I’m a little PO’d, you know,” Freeman said. “I’m like any other actor: don’t mimic me with falseness. I don’t appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you’re gonna do it without me, you’re robbing me.”\n\t\n\n\tFreeman previously hit out against AI in June 2024, thanks his fans on X for calling out examples of AI ripping off Freeman’s voice for advertisements the actor has not signed off on to promote. He wrote at the time: “Thank you to my incredible fans for your vigilance and support in calling out the unauthorized use of an A.I. voice imitating me. Your dedication helps authenticity and integrity remain paramount. Grateful. #AI #scam #imitation #IdentityProtection”\n\n\n\tThe actor joins a long list of fellow industry professionals who have spoken out against AI using their likeness without consent. Scarlet Johansson has been on the forefront of the anti-AI battle, criticizing OpenAI last year for using a voice similar to hers after she turned down the company’s request to use her direct speaking voice. Johansson said she was “shocked” and “angered” by OpenAI’s decision. Other celebrities, however, have been leaning in to AI. Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine recently inked a deal with AI audio company ElevenLabs to produce virtual replications of their famous voices.\n\t\n\n\tAs for Morgan, he’s been making the press rounds in support of his role in “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.” The actor has appeared in all three “Now You See Me” movies. The latest installment is Freeman’s sole release of 2025, which is unusual for the actor. Even at 88 years old, Freeman has been averaging three film releases a year over the last several years.\n\n\t“Sometimes the idea of retirement would float past me but, as soon as my agent says there’s a job or somebody wants you or they’ve made an offer, the whole thing just boils back into where it was yesterday: how much you’re going to pay, where we’re gonna be?” Freeman told The Guardian.\n\n\t“The appetite is still there. I will concede that it’s dimmed a little. But not enough to make a serious difference,” he concluded.\n\n\tHead over to The Guardian’s website to read Freeman’s latest profile in its entirety. \n",

    "body": "\n\tYouTube once developed and acquired exclusive original content. But the massive video platform has since largely exited that business — and now firmly puts its shoulder into promoting top YouTube creators who drive billions of views.\n\n\tOn Thursday, YouTube announced new programming exclusively coming to the platform from top creators including Ms. Rachel, Trevor Noah, Dhar Mann, Cleo Abram, Mark Vins, Deestroying and Brittany Broski. The lineup was presented at YouTube’s first Creator Premieres showcase, held at New York City’s Metrograph, touted as a “film festival-style” experience for advertisers and other industry execs.\n\t\n\n\tAiming to give YouTube a more entertainment-focused feel, it recently launched a new feature that lets creators organize their episodic content into seasons and shows. The idea: to let fans more easily find and binge-watch the videos on TVs, in a way similar to streaming services like Netflix.\n\n\n\t“YouTube creators are building global communities through content that is authentic, engaging, and premium,” said Sean Downey, Google president of Americas and global partners. “They’re not only driving culture — they’ve created an irreversible change in entertainment, which has redefined viewing behavior. For advertisers, YouTube presents a unique opportunity to make an impact with their desired audiences, by aligning and deeply integrating their brands with the voices that they actively seek out.”\n\n\tHere’s a rundown of the upcoming content featured at YouTube’s Creator Premieres:\n\n\tMs. Rachel: “Friendship” new episode (premieres early 2026) on the official Ms. Rachel channel. Ms. Rachel, a hit with the preschool set (on YouTube as well as Netflix), is joined by her friends for a heartwarming celebration of connection — showing little ones that friends can come from anywhere. Through joyful interactions with a diverse group of kids, this new episode teaches valuable lessons about inclusivity and the magic of making new friends.\n\t\n\n\tTrevor Noah: “Trevor Noah: The Lost SA Special” new special premieres December 2025 on the official Trevor Noah YouTube channel. Filmed in South Africa during the comedian’s last world tour, this never-before-released 90-minute stand-up comedy special captures Noah (former host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show”) performing entirely local material on the biggest stage of his career, back home. It’s touted as a “rare and powerful creative moment” with Noah, as he “reconnects with his roots and his audience in a way the world has never seen.”\n\n\tDhar Mann: “7 Days of Christmas” premieres Dec. 5-19 on the official Dhar Mann Studios YouTube channel. Dhar Mann Studios is a “massive holiday programming event” featuring seven new, 25-minute “heart-driven” scripted episodes. The series, which features the return of favorite characters, promises “a universal holiday message that the greatest gift is the glow of authenticity within.”\n\n\tDeestroying: “America vs London 1v1” new episode premieres Nov. 30 on the official Deestroying YouTube channel. Popular sports content creator Deestroying (Donald De La Hay) is taking his viral football 1on1’s series across the pond to London, where he gathers the top athletes across the country to compete for $5,000 in this episode. But it won’t be that easy for the London athletes as Dee has a secret opponent — all the way from the streets of Detroit — a competitor who is “hungry and ready to put his football reputation on the line.”\n\n\tJulian Shapiro-Barnum: “Outside Tonight” new live weekly late-night series premieres spring 2026 on the official Outside Tonight YouTube channel. The comedian, writer and actor, who is known for his popular online shows “Recess Therapy” and “Celebrity Substitute,” is launching a different kind late-night show “built for the digital age” that is set in public parks and on street corners. The live shows will be “packed with star-studded interviews, audience-driven games, live music and nonstop comedy.”\n\n\tMark Vins: “Reef to Ridge” new feature-length documentary premieres spring 2026 on the official Brave Wilderness YouTube channel. The wildlife filmmaker, explorer and host of “Brave Wilderness” is part of a “daring expedition team undertake a first-of-its-kind journey across the Galápagos’ most extreme habitats, diving deep beneath the sea and scaling the highest volcanic summit” to document rare wildlife and confront mounting threats to one of Earth’s most wild frontiers.\n\t\n\n\tCleo Abram: Huge* If True: “What If An Asteroid Is About To Hit The Earth?” new episode premieres Nov. 15 on the official Huge* If True YouTube channel. The new episode of Abram’s series about using science and technology to make the future better features YouTube creator Mark Rober imagines a fictional crisis: If a real and massive asteroid were coming toward us, how would we know? And what would we actually do about it?” Abram shows viewers the real science and technology we’re using right now to defend our planet.\n\n\tBrittany Broski: “Royal Court” with Paul Mescal new episode premieres this fall on the official Royal Court YouTube channel. Broski’s popular talk show welcomes Irish actor Paul Mescal (“Gladiator 2”) to the medieval realm, in a brand-new Season 3 episode. Other celebrity guests this season include Noah Cyrus, Brie Larson, Kyle MacLachlan, Fred Armisen and Finn Wolfhard as they join her for “laugh-out-loud conversations, offbeat games, and unpredictable moments that only the Queen of the Internet could orchestrate.”\n\n\tPictured top: Ms. Rachel, Trevor Noah, Dhar Mann\n",

    "body": "\n\tThey weren’t always big, or loud, in anything other than aspirational name. There was a certain amount of chutzpah when Seth England, Craig Wiseman and Joey Moi started up the label called Big Loud Records in 2015, although any sense of hubris there was mitigated by the fact that they already had publishing and management arms operating under that moniker prior to that point. The threesome — England best known as an executive, Wiseman as a songwriter-turned-publisher, and Moi as a producer famous for Nickelback and others — reinvested a lot of the profits they’d made from previous star clients in the country space, like Florida Georgia Line, into proving they could run a label, too. True proof-of-concept took a few years, but eventually they became more than worthy of the name, turning into one of those rare independent labels that is easily mistaken for one of the majors.\n\t\n\n\tSaying that Morgan Wallen is a flagship artist is an understatement; he is simply the biggest male artist in the world right now, by most standards — and certainly any having to do with the Billboard 200. But Big Loud is not a one-trick pony, with tunesmiths like Hardy and Ernest who have bubbled up out of their songwriting stable to become successful recording artists and tour headliners in their own right. The label has recently picked up superstar Miranda Lambert while also developing the likes of Stephen Wilson Jr., a critically acclaimed talent currently nominated for the CMA Awards’ best new artist trophy.\n\n\n\tThe three Big Loud founder-chiefs got on a big, loud Zoom call to discuss the rather upward trajectory of the label’s 10 years, and why the song publishing business that led up to it still informs everything they do as a record company.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s a question some of us might have about what level Big Loud should be considered on now. It’s the same question we might have asked about Big Machine, which exploded the way you guys have been: How “big” can you get and still be considered an independent label? Should we think of you in the same terms we think of Universal or Warner or Sony’s Nashville divisions, at some point?\n\n\tJoey Moi: We’re not an independent label, we’re a pissed-off startup. That’s what I call it.\n\n\tCraig Wiseman: We are absolutely and adamantly independent. In our early days, even as a publishing company, I turned down many, many, many offers in order to stay independent. We’ve remained independent. And of course there’s things we have to do — distribution deals, ancillary things. We’re very good friends with Universal staff and work with them some. But nobody owns us. Nobody finances us. Everything has been out of pocket. People ask, “How’d you start your label?” Well, we all put in money, and nobody got a paycheck from this label for frigging years. Some other guys around Nashville, their whole idea would be like, “Here’s how you start a label — first, you gimme a million dollars…” No. If you want to do an independent label, you’re like any small business, you get paid last, and so you don’t get paid at all for a long time.\n\n\tSeth England: I agree with Joey, we’re a pissed-off startup. I don’t care how big we get — if we ever lose that, then we’ve lost the mission. Scott Borchetta is his own kind of entrepreneur too, and through the prime Florida Georgia Line years [when Big Loud was their publisher and/or management for nine years, while the duo recorded for Big Machine], we were helping steer that ship, and I bet I went to a thousand marketing meetings in his building. So I got such a close front-row seat. I believe the reason he was offered many times to go take the keys to the big building — you know, “Which major one would you like?” — because of his skill set and resume. But I think in his fabric, he enjoys being the chip-on-his-shoulder entrepreneur, because he gets up quicker out of bed for that, you know. And so there was lots to be learned from Scott in the early days. The only difference was, he didn’t have a publishing company, originally — but if you look now, they have one of the most competitive publishing companies in town. He just did it a little bit in reverse, but kind of got to that destination all the same. And yeah, he’s definitely a pissed-off startup.\n\t\n\n\tLet’s talk for a minute just about the origins of the Big Loud name, which actually go back to the early 2000s. Before there was this multi-faceted company, there was Big Loud Shirt Publishing. So… who had the loud shirt?\n\n\tWiseman: As a songwriter, you have to name these publishing companies. I finally started my own independent company, and my wife just said, “Well, Big Loud Shirt. Everybody knows that’s you,” because I’m not afraid to wear a Hawaiian shirt. Somebody told me once, “I bet your closet looks like Walt Disney threw up in it.”\n\n\tMoi: He’s under-indexing today, by the way. His collection is diabolical.\n\n\tWiseman: I’ve got one over here I’ll put on in a second. Sorry, I was working out in the yard. When we came up with that, we were still so broke, my wife — who had worked in marketing and advertising — did that logo, as well as doing the first FGL logo that they used for probably three years. Because that’s how much of a startup we were. … I was so happy the day that Blake Shelton showed up at one of our No. 1 parties and said, “Man, when I’m in a pitch meeting, I look over at this stack and I want to see that CD with that big red shirt on it. I know that’s where the good songs are.” Me and Seth were kind of pumping each other, like, “There we go, we got a little brand recognition!” Then, when it was time for a label, the name was already known in town, and everything just morphed down to Big Loud.\n\n\tEngland: In my naïve country wisdom, as I later made lots of friends in New York and L.A., especially in the hip-hop space, I’d walk into studios and they’d say, “Oh, Big Loud. That’s the coolest name I’ve ever heard.” And I’m like, what do you mean? They said, “Isn’t that named after weed?” [“Loud” happens to be slang for a type of cannabis.] And I was like, “No, no, it’s named after Craig.” But the whole time they thought we were just that culturally relevant. So I said, “Hey, I’ll take it.”\n\n\tSo Big Loud — or Big Loud Shirt — was not chosen because you were thinking of how good it’d look in headlines.\n\n\tWiseman: Oh God, no. One of my publishing companies was called Mrs. Lumpkin’s Poodle. I came up with that just because I thought it’d be funny to have Connie Bradley say that every year at the ASCAP Awards.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tL to R: Seth England, Joey Moi and Craig Wiseman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRobby Klein\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEven with the label being as huge as it is, there’s something about the song publishing part of it all that feels especially personal for you. What is the mentality at the core of it?\n\n\tWiseman: Really, it started off with me and Seth. I fired all the grownups, and Seth was an intern pulling weeds. It was a publishing company and we had a couple of really great songwriters, and Seth took over one and I took over another one, and we were getting all the big cuts, with people like Jason Aldean. But basically a publishing company is all about quality of songs and loving on people. Because it’s such an intimate relationship. As a publisher, you’re the manager, too — you’re the everything. I can’t think of how many kids whose first suits I bought for them through the years, including maybe even Seth. You’re in the trenches with ’em. And invariably that ethos followed us into being a label. And that’s kind of our secret sauce. It’s a publishing approach to being a label.\n\n\tAll these labels that you hear about — the Sonys and the Warner Brothers and Universals — they have publishing companies too. But you’d be surprised how not connected they are to their publishing companies. Whereas, like right now, we’re trying to move to a building where we can get everybody back under one roof. We got so big we had to scatter out. But as a record label with a publishing philosophy, if we get an act, the main thing isn’t we wanna put out a record on ’em. We want to get ’em writing and get ’em in development. Write better shit than anybody, always, at all times.\n\n\tEngland: I think all of us, if we carried business cards, the first title listed would be “publisher.”\n\n\tWhat is the division of labor? Is it pretty distinct between the three of you or do you all have hands in everything?\n\n\tMoi: For me, early on, when I first came to Nashville, I think I met a 23-year-old Seth, and I was probably 33 at the time. I realized immediately that obviously we had a good partner dynamic going. My failures in the past were when I’d partner with people who occupied the same corner of the room as me. I loved that the key indicator was that we were all gonna occupy different corners of the room and depend on each other and not try and be each other. It was clear even when Seth was 23 that he had a skillset that I did not possess and that I needed, and I had the same for him, and Craig had a skillset I did not possess that I needed. I watch partnerships where the streams cross and somebody tries to be somebody else, and that’s when they start to fall apart. We’ve always had just a real natural, organic respect for each other’s space and hold each other’s skill set in high value and lean on them and empower them equally.\n\t\n\n\tWiseman: The main thing I did as a publisher was, I was just the guy who was still showing up to write songs every day. These young kids would show up and they were like, “You’re rich. You don’t have to come in here every day.” It’s like, to be good at this shit, you just gotta do it every day. And it turns out that was the biggest contribution I could make was just to be the songwriter guy. But yeah, obviously, I had started off as a publishing company that I was running to where my blood pressure got to 5,000, and Seth came along during a horrible, horrible time, when I was firing all the adults, and even at that point I was kind of like, “Seth might be my guy to run this stuff and to be that connector.” And we no sooner got our legs under us than we’re getting all these cuts. We got like nine No. 1s in a year and God knows how many cuts from all these major artists.\n\n\tAnd we’re going, “We still have all these songs left over. Why don’t we go find a band? Let’s go get a van and a trailer and get ’em on the road and just get a fan base.” Right about that time is when Joey came along, and Joey was like, “Well, man, we’ve been up in Vancouver birthing these rock bands. We could totally do this shit.” And then Seth immediately connected the dots and figured out how to get Joey on the team. There was an act that had lost their producer, which meant all of our songs were gonna go away. Seth figured out a way to get in there, like, “Let’s insert Joey to cut that. It’ll save our songs on the project.” So Seth immediately showed that thing of being connected on business stuff, calling Joe Galante and goingforward with a rock ‘n’ roll producer from frigging Canada who’s gonna cut this record. And Seth figured out how to smooth all that crap out. And we kept all of our songs on there, and Joey cut “Barefoot Blue Jean Night” on Jake Owen, which ended up being like the song of the year. And we were off to the races. [That track was ASCAP’s song of the year for 2012 and was ultimately cited by Country Aircheck as the most-played country song of the 2010s.]\n\n\tEngland: Before us, Joey had attempted joint-venture record labels, but I think he would now say he realized he was missing a toolbox of songs and songwriters that expedited and helped his process and even hopefully made the music a lot better. When he came in, we realized, “Damn, that’s the guy we’ve been waiting on.” And initially we were trying to lure Joey to a publishing deal, whicih he had never signed — correct, Joey? — to that point.\n\t\n\n\tMoi: Right. I was terrified.\n\n\tEngland: Joey had trust issues through the roof, and so I was for a couple years working through those. I was at South by Southwest, still chasing him down, trying to get him to be our publishing client. It was down to three publishers. Ron Perry [then president of Songs Music Publishing, before joining Columbia] was there, and Rich Christina [then senior VP of Sony/ATV Publishing, now Warner Chappell] — and then little young me, who had Craig Wiseman’s personal checkbook. Naturally I got to go third, but I got to overhear the other guys and how much money they were approved for. I had never heard of that much! I thought, “Man, I’m sunk.” … I reminded him I didn’t get a turn, and we walk up to the back of the Four Seasons, and and I’m realizing, I gotta shoot a big shot here. And I said, “Listen, I can’t compete with that money, so we’ll do a publishing deal that’s not about the money necessarily, but in exchange, I want to start a record label with you.” No sooner did I finish that statement than he leapt up out of his chair and put his hand out: “Shake on it.” We represented something who believed in him more than just advancing a mountain of royalties.\n\n\tTrying to win Joey over caused me to have to think differently. Then we started dreaming it out and writing it out. He would be the one in the studio and the time with them on their couch; I’d handle a lot of business stuff and connecting. And that goes to not just the music. There’s been times when, if my role is to hold an artist accountable or challenge them on something, maybe I’m texting Craig on the side, alerting him: “Hey, I had to kind of square off with somebody today. If you catch him, give him a hug in the hallway” — because he gives the best hugs in the building. It’s the realization of the partners that we’ve gotta balance each other, even in how we communicate to the clients. We’ve had better moments than others. Nobody’s perfect, but truthfully, that’s what’s kept us together. Because you are really not going to find this, at least from my experience, anywhere else.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSeth England, Joey Moi and Craig Wiseman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRobby Klein\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter you expanded from being a publishing and management company to having Big Loud Records in 2015, your first country airplay No. 1 was with Chris Lane’s “Fix” in August 2016. Did you feel like you’d started to really make it, as a label, then, even though Morgan was kind of still a year from bubbling up?\n\t\n\n\tMoi: When we had that first No. 1, we already had made the jump to get a promo team, but that put us into: “Let’s get an SVP of marketing.” It was all kind of guerrilla warfare. Everyone was a Swiss Army knife. We were outsourcing some things. But as soon as that landed on that one, I was confident that we were gonna be able to repeat it.\n\n\tWiseman: We knew we could go three to four years without anything really popping, and we were willing to go the distance. In 2018, we started to panic less. Here come all these investment people wanting to own half of it going in, and it was all that shit that I tried to avoid as a publishing company. It was like, “We can’t do that.” So I put some of [his own] money in the checking account, as we all did. Nobody was getting a paycheck, and we decided to (further) commit. We started off in 2015 as nothing but subtraction, and by 2018, it’s like, “Hey man, there’s starting to be some addition over here. Proof of concept is starting to happen.” Joey said, “We’re really doing this,” and we had that (slogan) put onto a T-shirt.\n\n\tMoi: I think we had probably one signing [after Lane] that didn’t land for us, and then out of nowhere, Morgan Wallen walks in our door and plays songs for Seth and I in my studio and our jaws hit the floor. We’re like, is this happening in real time right now? We had literally talked about the style of voice we want and type of artists we want, and he just miraculously roamed in off the street, and it was like, holy crap, he’s got everything.\n\n\tWhat were the earliest days with Morgan like?\n\n\tEngland: We took a development approach with Morgan, even. We knew we wanted to work with him, trying to work through some paperwork, but told him to go ahead and come in and write some songs. Craig, I think, was his first write in the building, with Jamie Moore, correct?\n\n\tWiseman: Yeah. So he was sleeping on a buddy’s couch and borrowed a truck to come to the writing session.I would write with all of our young artists, because our most notable writers would be like, “No, I’m writing with other hit songwriters, to make money!” So I would take the bullet and be like, “I’m gonna go write with this young kid.” We wrote “Chasin’ You.” That second verse is something I wrote that actually breaks that fourth wall: “I’m in Nashville and now I’m on the radio and I haven’t given up. I’m still chasing you on the radio.” I put that in there as I was sitting there thinking, “Holy shit, this kid’s gonna be a star.”\n\t\n\n\tAt that point, we had done Florida Georgia Line [for publishing and management]; we had found them, broken them. “Cruise” happened in 2011, and Joey did FGL, really showing off his production chops with frigging amazing, jaw-dropping shit. That first FGL album still is state-of-the-art. Then they parted ways from us and that was very, very hard for us — and then they quickly parted ways with each other. That was tough, man. So right in the middle of all these other things that were cool for us was a very big “Oh shit.” That in itself was also like, well, welcome to being a record label, man. Like, damn, you gotta take a punch in the gut like that and keep rolling. So that added a lot of gravitas, right in the middle of good things going on.\n\n\tSo you’d had some experience with having a tiger by the tail, but also losing the tiger. So when it came around again on that kind of level for you, it must have been satisfying to know that, first, Morgan’s one guy, so he can’t break up the act.\n\n\tWiseman: Oh, Morgan’s been a piece of cake, man. Walk in the park.\n\n\tAside from how translatable his charisma has proven to millions of fans, what sets Morgan apart from even other good experiences you’ve had?\n\n\tMoi: One of Morgan’s best skills, aside from being an entertainer, is he has an amazing ability to nurture and empower the songwriting community around him. I don’t think I’ve ever witnessed anyone any better at that than him. There’s a lot of great collaborators that he’s been able to inspire and empower, and he’s brought a lot of really young gunslingers with him that have really helped him with that. To me that (songwriting) is the nucleus, and we’re just trying to be as close to the nucleus as we can, and push it in the right direction and use it for our advantage.\n\n\tEngland: Another superpower Morgan has is, he’s such a self-starter. We don’t have to call him to say, “Hey, are you ready to make some music?” Right now we’re two or three weeks done with his tour, and our text thread this morning was Morgan excited to get going; he’s written eight or 10 things.\n\n\tMoi: I got a terrifying text message from him: “Man, I think I’m ready to start cutting more songs.” It has been like four months [since “I’m the Problem” came out].\n\t\n\n\tAnd who is it among you that’s saying a 37-song album sounds like a good idea?\n\n\tEngland: You know why this one was 37? Because he recorded 60. And that’s with Joey; I can’t believe Joey’s not looking 10 years older, just because of the hours. He recorded 60 because he wrote 150, 200.\n\n\tMoi: We cut 60 and had 50 where we actually had a mix on it. Usually I know if it’s not gonna make the record because he’ll sound less inspired when he is singing it, and I’m going, “You don’t want to sing this every night, do you?” He is like, “Nah, I don’t want that,” then we’ll move on from the song. But we cut 60 and got through 50 where he felt inspired to sing them and I was somewhere along the way in a mix on it. We had a whiteboard and were mercilessly hacking songs off to make sure the 37 were the cream of the crop.\n\n\tEngland: We have a couple wrestling matches over the last couple titles.\n\n\tMoi: And he’ll usually give us one. He’s like, “Okay, let’s do that one.” … That’s a very rare quality to see in a primary artist like that, that he can self-A&R with other people and still really drive the standard on his own music. … I’ve been doing this 25 years now, and that’s a really rare quality that I might have seen maybe two, three times.\n\n\tEngland: His 30-plus song efforts started with “Dangerous,” just because he was hyper-creating. We never set out to do a big volume as a strategy. It only came by him sitting in the boardroom with Joey and I and going, “Man, I’m up to 18 songs, what am I gonna do?” I recall a Drake album that had like 30 at the time because he just had a burst of creativity. I was like, “Well, man, just make the music, make it honestly, and we’ll figure this out.” But it wasn’t based off some trite strategy.\n\n\tI’m proud that he has scaled where he has — he deserves it. To sit front row and watch the human being deal with that … we all know he had some speed bumps and some moments of maturity and growth of the last few years. But this year it is been his best year we’ve ever seen him. It’s almost like it’s never over in terms of battling with that duality. But man, I just love being around him. He’s a great dad. He has a fitness club he puts together with some songwriter buddies. He’s just really a good friend to people. And, actually, if anything, what he struggles with is just not being that public face. If he ever feels superficial, he just won’t do it. He just is really a very, very normal guy —  which is funny, to know him behind the scenes as a human, and then to see him go on stage and become this larger-than-life character. He is great at that, but he’s only that for a few nights a year.\n\t\n\n\tWiseman: Really, there’s no ego there. But try to tell people that there’s no diva in Morgan Wallen at all…\n\n\tYou have Stephen Wilson Jr. up for the CMAs for best new artist and really breaking now, having a career as a developing star after years when he “only” thought of himself as a songwriter, and you probably did too. Then there are people on your roster like Hardy and Ernest who have had almost dual existences as artists and writers for other people, without always giving up one for the other.\n\n\tMoi: We’ve had multiple artists that were like, “I’m a songwriter, I’m a songwriter, I’m a songwriter,” and then eventually, six, eight, 10 years into it, they start quietly collecting songs and say, “Well, if I was an artist, I would probably cut this”… A lot of times they need those years to go sing hundreds and hundreds of demos and find their voice and find the character, find out who they’re gonna be, and that was the case with Stephen.\n\n\tBack when I first started coming to Nashville, we were all obsessed with his voice back then, when he was just a songwriter figuring stuff out. So when our new A&R guy, Nate Yetton, came on and revealed that Stephen had gone and made a 22-song record, we were just like, “Wait, what? He’s an artist now? This is incredible.” So to see the record take off and do what it’s doing is pretty magical. He is one of the sweetest guys we’ve ever met; he’s insanely humble. Anytime you start talking to him about his career, he kind of wilts into a little shell and gets so uncomfortable when you talk about how awesome he’s doing, and that makes it even more fun. You’re seeing an insanely organic fan base kind of come in and stay. I think he’s got Dave Matthews potential — he can go on and just release music and be huge forever.\n\n\tEngland: We have signed tons of people that were once songwriters only, in their mind, and slowly became artists. And I think if there’s anybody out there who would be the ones to do that a lot, it would be us three, because we’re song guys. You can have the perfectly shaped people, most beautiful people, but if they don’t have a hit record that’s got some personality, and you know, that transcending feeling, it really doesn’t matter. We’ve all seen so many cases where the unlikely artist has that transcendent piece of music, and, at least for my money, that’s the one I most often bet on to work itself out. Sometimes it takes a little longer for those types, but that’s kind of cool, you know?\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHARDY and Ernest attend the 58th Academy of Country Music Awards at The Ford Center at The Star on May 11, 2023 in Frisco, Texas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for ACM\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHardy and Ernest are the ultimate examples of what Wilson also represents, as writers who took their time in establishing themselves on the front line.\n\n\tMoi: Hardy and Ernest are two other amazing cases of kids that weren’t artists that were hyper creators that came in and found the brotherhood. Morgan’s taken ’em all on tour. Hardy’s taken Ern on tour. They all write each other’s records. It’s just another testament to nurturing that creative environment and letting those guys go in there and cook. \n\n\tEngland: We have a staff lunch here in the record label building, and sure enough, our songwriters in sweatpants start coming through and filling up their plates, and they’re on staff too. More times than not, the supernatural happens because of it. They end up becoming often best friends. You know, Morgan and Ernest met in the hallway of Big Loud, and they sat down for an hour and realized they played against each other in high school in two back-to-back state championship games. Now they’re creatively inseparable, and that wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t create that environment much like Motown, A&M and others.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHardy and Ernest have their own imprints through Big Loud where they sign people, and now, though she didn’t rise up with you, obviously, Miranda Lambert has joined them in that.\n\n\tEngland: Miranda strongly deserves to be in that Big Loud short list of duality creators. She has become our partner in Big Loud Texas and has truly become our good friend. And Jon Randall, her partner in that, is an icon, a brother and an equal new friend like we are to Miranda. … People ask what she’s like, and I’m like, she’s like my favorite old high school buddy that I hang out with. She’s doing a lot of cool things with Big Loud Texas. And Ella Langley just dropped a hit record and a half called “Choosing Texas,” with Miranda as her co-writer and producer. A lot of people know how big a career she’s had, but her God-given talent in the writing room and production, not to mention her ability to mentor people with her experiences and make ’em feel like she’s actually on their side and not a suit, is second to none. There’s no one more Big Loud than her. \n\t\n\n\t—–\n\n\tVariety spoke with some of these leading lights of Big Loud’s roster about their experience with the label and its heads. Here’s some of what they had to say:\n\n\tHardy: “Big Loud is the only label in town that I wanted to do a deal with. From the very beginning, Big Loud has been about the ‘song,’ and as a songwriter, I agree with that mentality to my core. Big Loud has given me full creative freedom all seven years of my artist career, and I’m so thankful for that. They truly let the artist be the artist… I’m incredibly thankful for all of the hard work this label has put into the Hardy brand and I truly stand on the shoulders of all the great people that work at this label.”\n\n\tErnest: “I wouldn’t be where I am today without the support and master minds of Seth and Craig. Joey, too. Countless hours spent soaking in everything I could during the early days at Big Loud. Being a fly on the wall and seeing the way they pieced this whole thing together and navigated through all kinds of life at the same time. \n\n\t“Craig is who I wanna be when I grow up.  Someone who knows that none of this happens without songs first… and with Seth being the maverick he is, he has allowed me to grow in ways I never knew possible. We now have launched my record label, DeVille Records, together as well as my publishing company, ERN’s Cadillac Music. He is a great friend and mentor to me and I cherish our relationship. At the end of the day, I couldn’t be around a better group of leaders to soak in as much as I can. Lucky me.”\n\n\tMiranda Lambert: “It’s a team full of dreamers and doers. I’ve known Craig for a while now as we’ve written a few songs together over the years, and I have always admired his charisma and love for music. Seth is very passionate and really cares about the art. Joey has become a fast friend. He’s incredibly smart, and it’s fun to pick his brain about the creative side.\n\n\t“When the opportunity for Big Loud Texas came about, I was interested and excited because it was an opportunity to work and dream alongside my longtime best friend Jon Randall and our pal Brendon Anthony. We get the benefit of having our family at Big Loud with us every step of the way. I work with the team as both an artist and as a label partner at Big Loud Texas… They dream big. Texas-sized, as a matter of fact.”\n\t\n\n\tStephen Wilson Jr.: “I’m not like some obvious genre artist, and they really tend to adopt those kind of genre rejects of Nashville and really kind of nurture them. They know how to kind of cross all the genres. I kind of call what I do Death Cab for Country, jokingly. But a big reason why I went with Big Loud was because they are a country label too, and I really wanted to start with country first, because I knew this was going to be the hardest mountain for me to climb.\n\n\t“I love that they’re willing to shake things up and kind of move the goalposts around the field and stretch the membrane of what is possible in this genre. I like being another perhaps experiment of theirs, to see if we can do this, and I don’t think we could have a better army of people trying to accomplish what we’re actually trying to accomplish.”\n\n\t—–\n\n\tBack to the three principals…\n\n\tWho’s an example of someone you’ve recently reached out to, beyond these marquee names?\n\n\tMoi: A fresh name to add, that just came out of nowhere to us, is Brad Schultz from Cage the Elephant — he fits the exact description Seth just gave of Miranda, Hardy and Ernest as well. You can’t get him out of a recording studio. He knows every single new band out there; he’s already working with them before he even tells you he’s working with them. He is in there making music, doesn’t ask for any money, doesn’t take points in anything. He’s just a chronic entrepreneur and artist developer, and on the rock side out here in Santa Monica, we’ve done a joint venture with him. When you see it, you’re like, wow, he’s already doing 90% of the hard work already for free, and he doesn’t even know about the infrastructure that we can put around him. And that’s been something that, again, just like Texas and the Hardy and Ern projects, is really starting to yield fruit for us.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(L-R) Joey Moi, Seth England, Craig Wiseman, and Steve Gawley attend the T.J. Martell Foundation 49th annual New York Honors Gala on September 17, 2024 at Cipriani 42nd Street in New York City. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for The T.J. Martel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat led to wanting to branch off Big Loud Rock?\n\n\tMoi: Seth and I both felt over time that we were kind of hitting a wall in the artist development space and had an opportunity at the rock label to kind of redefine what a development label looks like and what the development mechanisms are. So we came out here and have kind of rebuilt a more modern-looking record company designed specifically for rock, that needs to have a heavy emphasis on modern audience impressions, not based off of traditional audience impressions, which are radio and music videos, but really heavy-handed in the online space and content space and paid media space.\n\t\n\n\tWiseman: I went out to Santa Monica for several days and checked it out and it was breathtaking. The Santa Monica stuff feels like us in 2015. Santa Monica is gonna end up being R&D even for stuff we do back here in Nashville, I think. Let’s not forget, Joey’s one of the best rock producers of all time. We didn’t necessarily see this a few years ago, but boy, it’s perfect timing that we’re gonna get back to this and let him rip and run that.\n\n\tI have to say, when I was a kid, I was a bar drummer, and I loved rock ‘n’ roll. And things changed and if fell out of favor. But if Big Loud could help get rock ‘n’ roll back to where it needs to be, where it’s placed on the center of the mantle, I’d have checked every box I’ve ever wanted to.\n\n\tMoi: That’s the final boss. “Make rock cool again” is conquering the final boss in the video game.\n\n\tYou’ve partnered with Republic and Universal on things but you emphasize your independence. Is that the best of both worlds for you?\n\n\tEngland: Best of both worlds — I think that’s exactly how we seee it. From our infancy, up until about four or five years ago, we were with Stem; they were like a white-label service where we self-distributed with some of their assistance, but we didn’t have many of the attributes and bells and whistles you can access in a major system.\n\n\tBy the way, just from an entrepreneurial side of things, shout-out to Clive Calder and Jive Records and Zomba. I, as a nerdy student of the game, found there was something to be learned about his strategy as an entrepreneur when it comes to his distribution deals and global distribution deals. I’ve never had a chance to ask him these questions, but from when you read the story, it was an all-for-one goal.\n\n\tAnd yes, we did partner on a couple things early with Republic — Morgan, Lily Rose,Dylan Gossett— but all of that was kind of “let’s date before we marry,” of sorts. But when we do go all-in, we all win the same things. We all benefit from this all-in mentality. So yes, we have the best. We are still our own budgets. We just distribute to those pipes and request help when needed. And they’ve been great partners. I’ve known the Lipmans the longest; on Florida Georgia Line, they worked their pop crossover records. So, just as a manager, I’d had a lot of experience and time spent in that building. For the reason you stated, that’s why it’s a good situation for us at the moment.\n\t\n\n\tHow willing would you be willing to let go of the reins a little, if you had to, to expand even bigger?\n\n\tWiseman: The last several years, various people have tried to buy us, invest us with us — I mean, the masters of the universe in New York and music people in L.A., and then a lot of these venture capital people, just the frigging prince-of-darkness dudes. All these people would get around us and talk to us before we’d eventually show ’em the door. But they were all going, “Man, what’s really wild about you guys is you guys actually like each other.” I’m proud of that, though it makes me shake my head about whatever other configurations out there that have left them thinking people don’t.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wiseman at the ASCAP Country Music Awards held at The Twelve Thirty Club on November 6, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Tammie Arroyo/Variety)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis is the 10-year anniversary for the label, but Seth and I have been working with Joey going back to 2011, so this (three-way partnership) has worked for 15 years. We’ve drank a lot of Fireball shots together. We’ve made a lot of money, too — and a lot of times, that will reveal fractions. But we’re still good and we’re still fired up about shit, and we still like each other. It turns out people are watching us, and I’m happy they are, and I hope they see that part of it too.\n\n\tEngland: I know each of us individually have had various opportunities thrown at us. People assume this might be be something easy to leave and we’re using this for the next one. But I think at least for me, the realization is, no, this is the journey. We get to build a brand together. We get to remain that pissed-off startup. Not to sound cheesy, but I mean it: Here’s to another 10, and let’s walk in and see where it goes.\n\n\tMoi: This is it for me. This is all I’m doing.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnna Marsh, the New Zealand-born chief of Studiocanal, hasn’t had much time to rest on her laurels since putting on an extra hat as chief content officer for Canal+ Group in March.\n\n\tIt’s been an action-packed year for the Paris-headquartered company which was listed at the London Stock Exchange last December and has recently completed a $2 billion takeover of South African pay TV company Multichoice, as well as the acquisition of a 34-percent stake in UGC, the Paris-headquartered film studio that operates one of France’s leading cinema chains.\n\t\n\n\tWith her international background, strong ties with the global film community and knowledge of the independent film world, the level-headed Marsh has become a pivotal figure within the company she first joined in 2008, and has worked closely with Canal+ Group chairman Maxime Saada on these high-stake strategic moves.\n\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety on the eve of the American Film Market, Marsh said Canal+ Group is no longer simply a production and distribution arm — it’s become a central nervous system inside one of Europe’s most global media machines. While it’s getting into the French exhibition business with UGC, Marsh revealed that the company is also exploring distribution operations in new territories besides France, the U.K., Germany/Austria, Poland, Spain and Australia/New Zealand.Canal+ — which once looked like a French premium channel — “is now in 70 countries with 40 million subscribers, so it’s a great scale,” she says. \n\n\tIn recent years, the company has shifted to full-scale production, financing, and multi-territory distribution, particularly in the English-language space. The group, which comprises 19 production labels, invested €3.9 billion in content in 2024 with 200 films financed and distributed each year by the group and €200 million invested annually in the production of films and TV series. “We have the financial muscles — if we believe in a movie, we get behind it,” she says. The banner is also France’s biggest financier of local movies and is partnering up with ambitious filmmakers, from Cédric Klapisch (“Colours of Tim”) to Jean-Pierre Jeunet (“Changez l’eau des fleurs”), Cédric Jimenez (“Dog 51”), Gilles Lellouche (“Beating Hearts”) and Quentin Dupieux, whose next movie “Full Phil” stars Kristen Stewart and Woody Harrelson.\n\t\n\n\tMarsh points out that although some industry observers still perceive Canal+ as mainly European, it’s in fact “become a very global company” which is no longer dominantly French-speaking. That change in the company’s demographics is shaping the content strategy, notably in Africa, where Marsh says the ambition stretches beyond French-speaking markets. There, the focus , she says, is “particularly English-speaking and Portuguese-speaking Africa, in addition to the French-speaking markets where the group is already very strong.”\n\n\tFor Marsh, Africa is not a sales market — it’s a creative partner. “There is a huge ambition for local storytelling,” she says, “but also stories that travel, that can become global IP.”\n\n\tThat philosophy is already materializing with Studiocanal’s first co-production with MultiChoice’s brand M-Net. The project, which is shooting in Cape Town, underscores the banner’s ambition to build premium African franchises for a global audience.\n\n\tEnglish-language films and series represent another strong strategic axis that Marsh has been spearheading for the last five or six years. But the scale has notably accelerated, both in ambition and in slate visibility, she says, citing the Amy Winehouse movie “Back to Black,” “We Live in Time,” starring Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield, the family blockbuster “Paddington in Peru,” and Danny Boyle’s highly anticipated “Ink,” about media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s early career.\n\n\tStudiocanal’s expertise and track record in theatrical distribution is another competitive advantage that most of its European counterparts don’t have. “We’re active in seven territories, which means when we do local distribution, we can push the box office further,” she says.\n\n\tBesides movies, Marsh has also scaled up Studiocanal’s pipeline of English-language shows with key hires such as M-K Kennedy, who joined from Netflix in 2024, and worked on Studiocanal’s first in-house international series, “Paris Has Fallen.”“Season one sold everywhere, and it was number one on Amazon in the UK, and very strong on Hulu in the U.S,” she says of “Paris Has Fallen.” Marsh said the second installment of the anthology, “Apollo Has Fallen” – whose plot unfolds everywhere from the Libyan coast to the streets of Madrid – has wrapped filming and will air next year. “We are currently working on season three,” she said. The banner produces and distributes roughly between 15 and 20 shows per year.\n\t\n\n\tStudiocanal’s strength also lies on its 9400-title library – Europe’s largest – which Marsh seeks to exploit. Among other projects, the company is developing “The Avengers,” adapted from the iconic “Chapeau Melon et Bottes de Cuir,” for an international audience, and has already enlisted a big pay-TV partner, revealed Marsh who’s attending the AFM where Studiocanal’s robust slate includes “Ink,” starring Guy Pearce and Jack O’Connell; “The Sanctuary” by Xavier Gens; “Woodwalkers 2;” “Everybody Wants to F** Me*” with LuckyChap starring Taron Egerton; and “The Midnight Library” with Blueprint Pictures.\n\n\tHere’s a Q&A based on our conversation: \n\n\tYour role recently evolved — what are your new responsibilities as CCO of Canal+ Group?\n\n\tSince March, Maxime has given me the role of Chief Content Officer outside of sport for the Canal+ Group, which is a real honor and an opportunity as well for StudioCanal to be brought into the heart of the content strategy of the group, where more and more we’re looking to produce in-house for our in-house clients. Canal+ is present in 70 countries with roughly 40 million subscribers. As a studio, it’s an absolute joy — we’re very lucky to be in that ecosystem where our audience is extremely clear and our customers are down the hall.How does Africa fit into your content strategy?There are so many stories to be told in Africa, a lot of fantastic IP, some real talent. I was lucky enough to meet some of the close producers of MultiChoice when I was in Johannesburg last week, and I was really impressed with their energy, with their vision, with their agility. I think the quality of storytelling there is very strong and has real potential to grow, and I think we can learn and grow together. I really want to find strong African stories that have global resonance as well. I believe that there are already some bubbling. We’ve got one series in particular that we are going to announce soon that we’re already developing with M-Net and even shooting down in South Africa, in Cape Town, where there are a lot of really wonderful studios. We shot Glenn Powell’s movie, “Huntington” there and that was just an absolutely wonderful experience that we are planning on replicating. Also, there’s a real opportunity to lean into English-speaking and Portuguese-speaking Africa to complete our French-speaking African footprint, because there are more English-speaking subscribers now within the group than non-English. It’s important to recognize we’re a true global company.\n\n\tThat’s why StudioCanal has expanded in English-language production so much. That mirrors how StudioCanal has evolved in the last 5–6 years. Whether it’s the “Back to Black,” the Amy Winehouse movie, “We Live in Time,” “Paddington in Peru” or “Ink” that we’re shooting with Danny Boyle — we’re ramping up English-language production and distributing successfully around the world. Because we have direct distribution in over seven territories, it enables us to push local box office further. For example, 50% of “Paddington in Peru”’s global box office came from StudioCanal territories. “We Live in Time” found $72 million worldwide, the lion’s share from our territories. We want to be at the forefront of creating content that will attract someone to Canal+ and push them to subscribe.You’re also making big English-language series now. What’s next for “Paris Has Fallen”?Season one was sold everywhere and broadcast successfully, for example on Amazon in the UK and Hulu in the US. We’ve just wrapped shoot on season two, which will broadcast next year, and we’re developing season three. We’re able to continue development independent of the channel, but it must be a healthy relationship — we never enforce anything onto our colleagues.You have a massive library. How are you working with it to build new franchises? We are developing “The Avengers,” an adaptation of “Chapeau Melon et Bottes de Cuir,” as a TV series with a global pay-TV partner. We’re making season one, but we definitely have ambitions to turn that into a recurring franchise. We’re developing “L’Armée des Ombres” with Ronan Bennett, set in a dystopian UK, shooting next year. We are turning “The Red Circle” into a TV series, set in Busan, Korea. And in Africa, we’re developing new stories with local partners.Is your integrated model compatible with working with Netflix? Yes. Netflix is definitely a really important client. We make a lot of TV with them. We’ve got 19 production companies in the Canal Plus group. Those companies, whilst Canal is a really important client, doesn’t preclude us from working with everybody. We definitely have a wide portfolio of clients, including Netflix.Has Canal+ being publicly listed changed your content strategy?We continue to invest as much, if not more, than we always have. We are making more and more series and movies. We’re careful with budgets. A movie like “We Live in Time” was between €10 and €15 million and made €80 million at the box office — it was exceptional. We could have made it for three times more, but we knew we didn’t need to. We approach things pragmatically and stretch budgets as far as possible. Ultimately, content remains extremely important.How do you balance creative ambition with that budget discipline?We fall in love with a script, then step back and apply the figures. We value movies territory by territory. We don’t pull numbers out of thin air. Sometimes it takes a long time to greenlight a film because we’re so granular in how we value it. The key to long-term survival in this business is making a movie for the right price.Are more American producers approaching StudioCanal these days because the indie market in the U.S. is much more difficult?Yes, definitely. More openness to co-produce and distribute than ever. With recent successes I hope they see a standard of quality, and we don’t rush things. We also have the financial muscles — if we believe in a movie, we get behind it. For instance, next year, we’ve got a really exciting movie, “Pressure,” that we did with Eric Fellner at Working Title, starring Andrew Scott, Brendan Fraser, and Kerry Condon. That is going to be a really major event for us in 2026. We are very proud and fortunate to be partnering with Focus Features on it. And “Huntington” with our friend Glenn Powell that’s also going to be a major event. We’re locking arms with A24 who have the US and we’ve got the rest of the world. \n\t\n\n\tYou’ve really built a big profile as a purveyor of family entertainment with “Paddington” and other IP’s. What do you have in store? Yes, big, strong family, local IP is an extremely important pillar. We are developing the next Asterix live-action movie in France, and in Germany, we have “Woodwalkers.” In Australia, “Kangaroo” was the biggest local movie of 2025. We’re also developing a new Paddington TV series and we are developing an animated “Paddington” movie. And we’re working on ideas for the next live movie (“Paddington 4”). We also have a new store at the Savoy Hotel in London and the musical is live in the West End. We’re also developing a “Pippi Longstocking” TV series and a live-action movie with Heyday and the Lindgren family. It’s in development and we hope to announce talent soon. \n\n\tGenre is another area of interest for Studiocanal. Yes, we launched a label called Sixth Dimension, which is run by Jed Benedict. Our first release is a small film called “Silent Night, Dead Night” which will be released around Christmas. It’s a Christmas slasher movie, which is adapted from this B-Movie back in the ’80s, but it’s very cool. We also acquired Eli Roth’s “Ice Cream Man” for our Territories. We’ve got 5-10 developments that Jed is working on some really big IP and some smaller high concept ideas with talented filmmakers. The international market really like these movies if you can make them for the right price.Canal+ now owns 34% of UGC which is a leading cinema chain in France. what does that mean for the group and your strategy?The deal for 34% is done. It’s a minority stake, no operational role, no leadership change — we’re passive investors. It reinforces our absolute commitment to cinema. Films must be released theatrically. Theatrical creates the event, strengthens performance later on Canal+, home entertainment and catalog value.\n\n\tIs Canal+ Group considering investing in exhibition outside of France?\n\n\tNever say never!What about launching theatrical distribution in a new market? There are expansion plans in a new territory similar to what we have in Benelux, Germany, and the UK that we’ll be able to announce soon.What’s your biggest priority as a content leader right now?It’s about identifying stories that can travel, accompanying talent, protecting local specificity, and balancing local and global. We have to be on our toes more than ever.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery is reassuring president and CEO David Zaslav and other top execs that they will be able to retain their stock options even if the company is sold.\n\n\tWBD last month announced that it had received in-bound acquisition interest from “multiple parties” and has commenced a process to review such offers. David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is known to have submitted bids for WBD in its entirety, while Comcast and Netflix have been putting together bids for the company’s streaming and studio operations. The deadline for “nonbinding first-round bids” is Nov. 20, as Warner Bros. Discovery is looking to have the process wrapped up by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\t\n\n\tThe potential bidding war for WBD emerged after Warner Bros. Discovery started a process of splitting in two. In June, the media conglomerate said it would separate into two companies: one entity called Warner Bros. (comprising HBO Max streaming and studios), to be led by Zaslav as CEO, and the other called Discovery Global (TV networks and Discovery+), which will be headed by current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. The separation is expected to be completed by April 2026.\n\n\n\tWith the strategic review process, WBD’s board said it will consider a deal structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. with a third-party acquirer alongside a spin-off of Discovery Global to shareholders. \n\n\tThe original plan for the separation was to spin off Warner Bros. as an independent company, with Discovery Global the remaining entity. In an SEC filing Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery said it was clarifying that if there’s a “reverse spinoff” — in which Warner Bros. is the remaining entity and Discovery Global gets spun off — the same terms of Zaslav’s employment agreement will apply. The amendment specifies that a “reverse spinoff” that occurs before Dec. 31, 2026, will be treated the same way as the originally planned separation for purposes of the forfeiture condition that applies to Zaslav’s signing options. \n\t\n\n\tIn addition, the amendment to Zaslav’s employment agreement says his signing options will remain “outstanding and eligible to vest and be exercised” following Dec. 31, 2026, not only if there’s a reverse spinoff but also if WBD or the new Warner Bros. enters into a “definitive agreement for a transaction that would, upon completion, constitute a ‘change in control’ of WBD, but excluding any sale of Discovery Global or all or substantially all of its assets.”\n\n\tIf WBD enters into a “qualifying change in control agreement” before Dec. 31, 2026, and has not completed a separation (or reverse spinoff) by then, the amendment to Zaslav’s employment agreement provides that the term of his employment agreement will continue until Dec. 31, 2030 (as would have been the case had the separation been completed prior to the December 2026 end date) rather than ending Dec. 31, 2027. “This extension is intended to secure Mr. Zaslav’s leadership of WBD for the same period that we had contracted to have him serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Warner Bros. following a Separation,” Warner Bros. Discovery explained. “This ensures that, if the Strategic Review leads to our entering into a [qualifying change in control agreement] before [Dec. 31, 2026], Mr. Zaslav will have the same opportunity to vest in, and incentives from, the Signing Options that he would have received had a Separation been completed in 2026.”\n\n\tThe amendment also clarifies that “certain internal restructuring transactions necessary to effect any of the strategic alternatives that we are reviewing will not constitute a ‘Change in Control’ or ‘Qualifying Transaction’ for purposes of the Zaslav arrangements, and will not result in accelerated vesting or the release of any forfeiture conditions on the Signing Options.”\n\n\tIn the SEC filing Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery said it also has sent letters to its other executive officers who have entered into new employment agreements that are subject to (and contingent on) a separation, — including Wiedenfels, chief revenue officer Bruce Campbell and head of streaming and games JB Perrette — similarly clarifying that a “reverse spinoff” will be treated the same way as a “separation” for all purposes of such agreements.\n\n\tThe new WBD employment agreement that Zaslav entered into June 12 will “significantly reduce his target annual compensation, including lowering his annual cash compensation opportunity and reorienting the total pay mix toward long-term incentives,” according to an SEC filing. The WBD board’s compensation committee said it believes the new structure “will foster a stronger alignment with stockholders and incentivize sustained, long-term value creation.”\n\t\n\n\tIn 2024, Zaslav’s total compensation was $51.9 million, up 4.4% year over year, including a cash bonus of $23.9 million and $23.1 million in performance-based restricted stock grants. \n\n\tUnder the new agreement, as CEO of Warner Bros. Zaslav will have a base salary of $3 million per year for the duration of the term, as he does now. Following the separation (or “reverse spinoff”), Zaslav’s target annual cash bonus opportunity will be reduced to $6 million, with the actual payout based on the achievement of performance goals — down from a cash bonus target of $22 million under his current agreement. Zaslav will also be eligible to receive annual equity awards following the separation or reverse spin under a new Warner Bros. equity incentive plan with a target value of $15.5 million the first year that he receives an equity grant from the company; that will be reduced to an annual target value of $7.5 million per year thereafter during the term of his employment. According to Zaslav’s current Warner Bros. Discovery agreement, his equity bonus target value per year is $23.5 million. \n\n\tOn June 12, Zaslav also received a one-time “inducement” that the board’s compensation committee believes “will incentivize the successful completion of the Separation and stockholder value creation.” That award consists of 20,898,776 stock options in the form of 60% performance-vesting stock options and 40% time-based stock options. In addition, Zaslav is set to receive 3,052,734 stock options on Jan. 2, 2026, which will be subject to the same split of performance-vesting and time-based vesting conditions (and provided that he remains employed on that date). Depending on various scenarios and contingencies, Zaslav may not be able to exercise all of those stock options.\n\n\tPrior to the separation or reverse spinoff, Zaslav will continue to serve as Warner Bros. Discovery’s CEO with the same annual base salary, cash bonus opportunity and grants of performance-based restricted stock units under his prior agreement.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe winners club at this year’s 26th annual Latin Grammy Awards is a off to strong start as Bad Bunny, Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso and many more claimed their first trophies of the 2025 season. Setting the tone for what promises to be a starry night in Latin music, Bad Bunny’s “Voy A Llevarte Pa Pr” from his highly decorated “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” already took home the award for best reggaeton performance.\n\n\tLike the Grammys, the majority of the Latin Grammys are handed out during the Latin Grammy Premiere ceremony, which precedes the telecast. \n\t\n\n\tArgentinian duo Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso won their first-ever Latin Grammy during the premiere ceremony for best short form and long form music videos for “#Tetas” and their “Papota (Short Film),” respectively. They also won best pop song for “El Día Del Amigo,” and best pop album for “Papota.”\n\n\tOther winners included Fito Paez (for his rock album, “Novela”) and Trueno, who took home his second Latin Grammy for “Fresh” in the best rap/hip hop song category.\n\n\tLive from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, the Latin Grammy Awards have Bad Bunny as the most nominated act with 12 nods. Producer and songwriter Édgar Barrera (Karol G, Grupo Frontera, Bad Bunny, Shakira) is tied with Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso for the second most nominations (10 each).\n\n\tBad Bunny’s “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” (and the title track “DtMF”) appears not only in the best album, song and record categories, but it lands a second nod for “Baile Inolvidable” as record of the year. Ca7riel and Paco’s “Papota” earned a nomination for album of year and the pair has a strong showing for their “#Tetas” single in the general categories.\n\t\n\n\tRecord Of The Year“Baile Inolvidable”

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains details from “On to the Next One,” the Season 3 finale of “Reasonable Doubt,” now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\t“Who killed Wendy?” As Season 3 of Onyx Collective’s “Reasonable Doubt” came to a close, all was revealed. \n\n\tSeason 3’s central storyline found Jax Stewart (Emayatzy Corinealdi) back in the courtroom, tackling a high-profile case involving Ozzie Edwards (Kyle Barry) — a former child star accused of murdering his girlfriend, Wendy (Rumer Willis). ​\n\t\n\n\tWhile defending Ozzie, who was charged with second-degree murder, Jax discovered that the star was a victim of child abuse by his manager, Monica (Brandee Evans). This abuse inadvertently led him to a drug addiction, which he tried to overcome during his trial.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the end, Ozzie managed to avoid prison time and was found not guilty. To celebrate the verdict, Jax invited Ozzie over to her house for a family dinner. Ozzie chose to attend a party thrown by his friends — but after being tempted by his friends doing drugs, Ozzie still wound up at Jax’s dinner.\n\n\tLater that evening, Jax revealed to Ozzie that she called a rehab facility to pick him up from her house. When the transporters arrived, Ozzie was found unresponsive in Jax’s son’s bedroom. Medics attempted to revive him, but he died from an overdose. At Ozzie’s repass, in a shocking turn of events, his sister Kristin (Kiah Clingman) revealed that it was their father who actually killed Wendy.\n\n\tWhile this season revolved around Jax’s latest criminal case, it also found the fictional attorney navigating some of life’s other curveballs.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJax and Lewis were forced to face the consequences following the death of his son, born out of their previous affairs from Season 1.​ Jax confronted her childhood abandonment issues once her father reappeared in her life, alongside a half-sister she didn’t know existed. She was also seen grappling with the devastating news about her mother’s stage 2 colon cancer diagnosis.\n\n\tAs if her family drama wasn’t enough, she faced microaggressions inside her law firm. That included working with shady co-counsel Bill (Joseph Sikora), who achieved his goal of becoming a partner, but without Jax’s knowledge or involvement in the final decision.\n\n\tHer final straw, Jax packed up her corner office and started her own law firm. In what should have been a happy moment for Jax into her new space, the season concluded with a vengeful Monica pointing a gun at Jax and pulling the trigger.\n\n\t“Reasonable Doubt” showrunner Raamla Mohamed spoke with Variety about the explosive finale, how Sal became Wendy’s killer, making Ozzie’s overdose his final fate, how long she sees the show continuing and more.\n\t\n\t\tWe have to start with that explosive cliffhanger of Monica shooting at Jax inside her new law firm. How do you land on that twist?\t\n\n\tInitially, you weren’t going to see who it was. It was going to be a cliffhanger. As we’re prepping the finale, I get a cut of Episode 6, and I’m watching Brandee’s performance where she’s yelling at Jax. I was like, ‘I don’t know if that anger goes away.’ And it made sense that it would be her that shows up. I told Brandee to show up and look like someone who hasn’t slept in months and is angry. I want you to look like you’re out of your mind. You lost Ozzy. You lost everything, and you just zeroed in on whose fault it is. She committed. I love endings that are both surprising, but not out of nowhere, and make sense. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBefore that shocking moment, it was liberating to see Jax quit her former law firm to start her own. From the start, viewers noticed the microaggressions and toxic culture she faced as the only Black attorney at the firm. When Jax walks away, what message did you want to send at that moment?\t\n\n\tIt’s funny because I was listening to a Mariah Carey album and ‘Butterfly’ came on. There was something so freeing about that interlude. I wanted the scene to feel joyous. When Bill is like, ‘Where is she going?’  And she comes back around the corner  with her box, I wanted to feel that feeling. I love the way our director, Anton Cropper, shot it. We talked specifically about what she takes and how she walks out in slow motion. We talked with our costume designer, Mercedes Cook, about what she’s wearing. She’s in red, which is power, but also anger. She pushes her braids back and is like deuces. It’s one of my favorite moments of the season. A lot of women will relate to that – not just Black women.\n\t\n\t\tFans have that Corey and Jax start their own firm together. Has that thought crossed your mind?\t\n\n\tIt crossed my mind. But it’s Jax’s moment, and what she’s been through. I won’t leave out an option for Morris [Chestnut] to come back. He’s a great character, and I love working with him. But it was about telling Jax’s story, what she’s been through over the season and giving her the victory versus going to Corey with the idea to work with him. She’s like, ‘I’m not going to be here, and I know what my worth is.’\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a lot to unpack here in this shocking finale. The big reveal about Wendy’s killer is that it is Ozzie’s dad. Why did you decide to have the Sal as the murderer?\t\n\n\tSal had been emasculated. Rosie is the alpha female in the house and is clearly making the decisions. I thought it’d be interesting to watch what happens when Wendy comes, and Sal is now confronted with a problem that he’s acted erratically. How would he handle it? My favorite moment is when Kristin says, ‘Should we call mom?’ and he says, ‘No.’ There’s this idea that he can handle this. He messes it all up in many ways, or he doesn’t, because he does get away with it until the end. But it’s this idea that he doesn’t feel like anyone appreciates him and he hasn’t been able to have any say in the managing of Ozzie. \n\t\n\t\tWas that always the plan, or did the story evolve over time?\t\n\n\tIt was going to be Kristin. Then, as we started talking about it, it changed to the mom. As we were making changes, I was like, ‘There’s something interesting about a man’s relationship with his mother.’ It’s very telling of the kind of man that he becomes and who he is. It was going to be more interesting to watch how Ozzie shrinks with his mom. Your assumption is that it’s a patriarchal situation, but it’s matriarchal. Once we got a handle on that, it made sense for the dad to be the one because it felt like he had a reason to prove something. If Rosie had done it, I don’t think Ozzie would have been in jail and gone to prison. Rosie would have figured it out in a way where Wendy may have never been found, and none of this would have happened. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMany fans were convinced that Ozzie was the killer, but the trial made it clear that anyone could’ve been a suspect. What made you go the route for a non-guilty verdict?\t\n\n\tLast season, Jax gave a heartfelt speech and convinced the judge not to have Shanelle go to prison, but she lost the case. I wanted to watch Jax have a win. She kept fighting, particularly with the partners, about her strategy. For her to lose, it wouldn’t feel satisfying. It’s a personal win for Jax on the legal side to validate that she does know what she’s doing, and she can win.\n\t\n\t\tOzzie’s trial raises awareness of the sexual abuse and grooming of children in the entertainment industry, which continues to be an issue in Hollywood that has historically been ignored or covered up. Why was it important for you to highlight this issue?\t\n\n\tOzzie is a child star, and I wanted to show all of what he was dealing with. If there’s going to be an addict, where did that come from? Usually, it comes from self-medication, an event or trauma. We started to explore what that trauma was. When it’s a man and an older woman, it’s viewed as cool when it’s not at all. Because of that, it’s sometimes difficult for young boys to understand that it’s abuse. Ozzie says to Autumn, ‘It was consensual because I enjoyed it.’ But you were a child and weren’t able to consent. It was important to show Ozzie realize that on screen where it’s not something you realize in the past, but in the present. We’re seeing that happen as he’s going through this trial, which causes the spiral.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWe often hear more about cases involving women being abused by men than the other way. Can you talk about your approach to exploring this different perspective on sexual abuse?\t\n\n\tFor the most part, I start with character. For Monica, what is the narrative of someone doing something like this? What does she tell herself? What story does she need to hold on to in order to be convinced that what she’s doing is right? Then, what world does Ozzie need to live in so that this feels like it wasn’t wrong and that it could have been condoned? He had this distance with his mom. With the flashbacks of Monica in his web, how does that affect Ozzie as well?  Growing up in the ’90s, we heard some of these stories about young girls and older men. Even with R. Kelly and Aaliyah, we saw it and thought it was odd, but we didn’t really get into the psyche of what that means. It’s posed as a mentor relationship, and then it’s flipped. \n\t\n\t\tOzzie’s trauma becomes the catalyst behind his substance abuse, which ultimately becomes his downfall that takes his life in the end. What led to the decision to make his addiction the final turning point of his story?\t\n\n\tI read stories where people are on the way to rehab, they take one final hit because they’re scared that they’re not going to be able to do the drugs. Then, it ends them. That was always going to be the end of Ozzie. It was bittersweet for me. It’s the fact that he was about to be free. He was about to figure out who he is as an adult when his life was cut short. That’s a story that happens a lot. That’s the sadness that happens when people who are figuring it out and on the cusp of doing something different, their lives are cut short.\n\t\n\t\tJust before his overdose, Ozzie and Jax share an emotional conversation about his addiction and recovery post-trial. What were you hoping to convey in that moment, especially given what happens to Ozzie immediately after?\t\n\n\tJax and Ozzie had a maternal relationship where she felt he reminded her of her son. We haven’t seen her take on that kind of client. Brayden had a different energy. Shanelle was her friend, so there’s personal history. But what about someone who could be her son? That was one of the early things that I pitched was this idea that he gets to see unconditional love without strings toward the end of the season. When a parent or someone cares about you, they what’s best for you. It’s not enabling or allowing you to be a bad version of yourself. He gets to experience that when he says, ‘I’m so mad at you, but I love you too.’ He gets to have that thing he never got.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnother pivotal moment was Jax’s dad returning to her life after her mom’s cancer diagnosis. Although his return was skeptical at first, Jax slowly embraced him. How will her having to put her guard back up with him impact her growth as a character?\t\n\n\tIn this instance, it’s ‘I love you, but there’s Chelsea, you and so many things. I need distance until I can make decisions about all of it.’ The growth is being able to set a boundary. There’s growth there because she’s coming from a vulnerable place. She’s not yelling. Old Jax would have blocked him. I don’t know if she would sit and have a conversation or at least try to figure out how she feels. As adults, we grow and are sometimes challenged by new traumas that come up. That’s what you’re going to see with Jax. Overall, she’ll move forward. But we’re going to see her take a step back and try to restabilize herself because that’s real life.\n\t\n\t\tNow that the show has been officially renewed for Season 4, have you started thinking about what themes you’d want to explore for next season?\t\n\n\tThe [writer’s]room is open. We’re breaking ideas and coming up with stuff. My goal is to make the next season better than the last. It’s always a challenge to make that happen, but I’m up for it.\n\t\n\t\tWhen you first created “Reasonable Doubt,” how many seasons did you envision for the series?\t\n\n\tAs a showrunner, you’re trying to get through the first season. When I pitched it, I liked the idea of four seasons. I was being realistic because it’s streaming, and even getting to four seasons is a feat. As the show has evolved, I’m open to however long it can go and still be good. \n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tStarz is restructuring its operations in Canada from a joint venture with Canadian media giant Bell Media to a content licensing deal with the company.\n\n\t“Today, we are announcing a structural change to our Canadian operation,” Starz president and CEO Jeffrety Hirsch said Thursday during the company’s latest quarterly earnings call. “We are moving from a joint venture model to a stable, consistent content licensing agreement with our partner Bell Canada. Under this new simplified structure, the Starz-branded service will continue to be available in Canada and Starz will generate international licensing revenue, while Bell will assume full operational responsibility in the territory. This approach is consistent with our strategy of owning our content and creating incremental licensing revenue without the need to operate international services directly.”\n\t\n\n\tAs a result of this change, starting with the next quarter, Starz will no longer reported Canadian subscribers.\n\n\n\tStarz says it ended the third quarter, which ran July-September, with 12.3 million U.S. OTT subscribers — an increase of 110,000 customers. Overall U.S. subscribers stood at 17.5 million for Starz, a drop of 130,000. Including Canada, total North American subscribers were 19.2 million, an increase of 120,000.\n\n\tHirsch says this deal, which comes six months after Starz became a standalone company following its spin off from Lionsgate, will “be modestly accretive to Adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow in calendar 2026.” \n\n\tThe Starz CEO says production has already begun on the company’s first-owned series “Fightland” and teased a co-commission partner that, along with the Bell Media deal, “will assist us on our path to reaching 20% margins exiting calendar 2028.” \n\t\n\n\tThis change in the relationship with Bell comes on the heels of Starz facing a recent “carriage dispute in Canada that resulted in the removal of the Starz-branded linear channel from a distributor’s programming packages.”\n\n\tFor Q3, Wall Street forecast a loss of earnings per share (EPS) of $1.86 on $321 million in revenue for Starz, according to analyst consensus data provided by FactSet. Starz reported a loss per share of $3.15 on $321 million in revenue.\n\n\tIn releasing these results, Starz reaffirmed its outlook of generating approximately $200 million of adjusted OIBDA by the end of the year.\n\n\t(Pictured above: Starz’s “Outlander: Blood of My Blood.”)\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a major example of the anti-ICE protests reaching Hollywood, “Grey’s Anatomy” has paused production on Friday in recognition of the call for a national shutdown. \n\n\tIn response to ICE raids in Minneapolis and a string of highly publicized killings by federal agents — hundreds of organizations have endorsed a one-day stoppage of labor and commerce. “No work. No school. No shopping. Stop funding ICE,” reads the website for the strike.\n\t\n\n\tSources close to “Grey’s Anatomy” confirm to Variety that crew members working on the ABC medical drama planned to not show up on Friday, prompting producers to postpone production for the day. Filming will pick back up on Saturday for Season 22 of the long-running series from Shondaland and 20th Century. Deadline first reported the news.\n\n\n\tCalls to join the nationwide protest have circulated on social media, with celebrities such as Ariana Grande and Pedro Pascal sharing information with their followers. Other Hollywood figures have spoken out against ICE amid the agency’s escalation of violence across American cities, including Billie Eilish, Olivia Wilde, Ed Norton and Bruce Springsteen, who released a protest song titled “Streets of Minneapolis” that slams “King Trump’s private army” and “state terror.”\n\n\tWhile promoting her movie “The Gallerist” at Sundance Film Festival, Natalie Portman told Variety, “It’s really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately. But also there’s a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. They’re showing up for each other, protecting each other, and fighting for their freedom. It’s a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we’re so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector Sam Raimi‘s new horror movie “Send Help” may do just that at the sluggish winter box office.\n\n\tThe R-rated deserted island thriller, starring Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien, has made $2.2 million at the box office in previews. The Disney and 20th Century release is aiming to open between $14 million and $17 million this weekend, but good word-of-mouth and diehard horror fans could take that number higher. The movie cost $40 million to produce, so a debut on the higher end and sticking around in theaters amid the dearth of new releases would make it a success.\n\t\n\n\tRaimi, the horror maestro who also made a name for himself in the superhero genre by directing the 2000s “Spider-Man” trilogy and the MCU’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” is returning to the genre after first breaking out with his “Evil Dead” movies in the ’80s. His latest blood-soaked film follows two corporate co-workers who find themselves stuck on an island all by themselves after their plane crashes. Their roles are reversed when O’Brien’s cocky, young CEO must look to McAdams’ strategic planning and survival know-how to stay alive.\n\n\n\t“Send Help” will easily beat its fellow newcomer, Amazon MGM’s Melania Trump documentary. It’s hoping to make $3 million to $5 million this weekend, which wouldn’t be bad for a political documentary, but it cost $40 million to acquire. Amazon MGM also reportedly spent another $35 million on marketing costs, making “Melania” a costly film.\n\n\tThe sci-fi thriller “Iron Lung,” from YouTuber and filmmaker Markiplier, is on track for second place this weekend with a $10 million bow. Jason Statham’s action movie “Shelter” is targeting a $5 million to $7 million launch after making $385,000 in previews.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNow that the full-year numbers are in, the state of the U.S. market for streaming original TV shows and movies in 2025 can be truly understood.\n\n\tAnd as Luminate explores in depth in its newly released “Film & TV Year-End Report,” the previous 12 months saw no shortage of surprising trends that emerged. Here’s five of the biggest surprises discussed in the latest episode of the Variety podcast “Strictly Business,” featuring a conversation with the report’s lead author, Luminate analyst Tyler Aquilina.\n\t\n\n\tThe total volume of original content consumption on the leading streaming platforms in the U.S. spiked over 2024. After plateauing for several consecutive years between 21 and 22 billion hours watched, 2025 saw a sizable 18% year-over-year jump—21% by series alone. “What was really notable about 2025 was that there were just more massive streaming hits across more platforms than we’ve seen in the past,” said Aquilina, citing examples including HBO Max’s “The Pitt” and Paramount Plus’ “Landman.”\n\n\n\tThe most-watched series of the year for the first time was neither on Netflix nor scripted. That honor goes to “Love Island USA,” which towered over the competition at approximately 18 billion minutes watched. It’s all the more impressive considering Peacock has a far smaller distribution footprint than Netflix. \n\n\tNot on the list: the buzzworthy “Heated Rivalry,” which as an acquisition, isn’t technically an original series and didn’t gather significant ratings steam for HBO Max until this year. “The numbers on ‘Heated Rivalry,’ they are good for the type of show that it is, but that was just nowhere close to top 10 levels in terms of the engagement that it’s generating,” said Aquilina.\n\t\n\n\tProduction volume of unscripted content plunged across nearly all subgenres, from true crime to cooking shows. Across linear and streaming combined, there was a massive 31% decline in the number of unscripted programs ordered. The only subgenre that managed to slightly increase volume in 2025 were sports-themed docuseries.\n\n\tWhile Netflix is still dominant, its streaming rivals made significant strides in 2025 to close the gap. What may be most remarkable about the original-content-viewing spike is that it wasn’t driven by Netflix. After seeing its market share hold at 63% in 2023 and 2024, Netflix dropped to 59% in 2025 as rivals like Prime Video, Apple TV and HBO Max inched forward. The leading streaming service had less entries in the top 10 and 20 hits of the year than before.\n\n\tOriginal streaming movies improved relative to theatrically released movies in the SVOD window. While in previous years, the top 10 list of the most watched movies of the year boasted nine theatricals, in 2025, four different Netflix original films managed to hold their own among the top ranked titles.\n\n\t(Pictured: “The Pitt”)\n\n\t“Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tFresh off the back of multiple Oscar nominations and a record-breaking haul of BAFTA nods, “Hamnet” lead producer Liza Marshall has extended her creative partnership with Maggie O’Farrell, the celebrated author of the book the hit film was adapted from. \n\n\tMarshall, who optioned “Hamnet” before its publication in 2020, has now secured the screen rights to O’Farrell’s upcoming novel “Land” for her London-based production company Hera Pictures.\n\t\n\n\tDue for release in June, “Land” is set in 1865 and follows Tomás and his reluctant son Liam as they work on Ireland’s Ordnance Survey in the aftermath of the Great Hunger. As they traverse a country still shaped by loss, displacement and unresolved history, the novel explores themes of separation and reunion, colonization and resistance, buried histories and survival — all anchored in what’s described as a “profound father-son relationship and a vividly realized Irish landscape.”\n\n\n\tThe novel, O’Farrell’s 10th, is already generating early buzz, having been selected in multiple book of the year previews across the U.K. and U.S. and earning stellar pre-publication reviews. The U.K. and Ireland book tour for it — currently standing at 21 events over three weeks in June — has seen unprecedented demand with half the events sold out in a week.\n\n\t“Land is a profoundly moving work — intimate, expansive and deeply human,” Marshall said. “Maggie has an extraordinary ability to illuminate history through the emotional lives of her characters, and this novel feels both urgent and timeless. After the wonderfully collaborative experience of ‘Hamnet,’ I’m thrilled to continue my creative partnership with Maggie and bring another of her remarkable stories to the screen with the same care and ambition.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project is being developed as another prestige literary adaptation with strong international appeal, pairing O’Farrell’s distinctive narrative voice with Hera Pictures’ growing track record in elevated, character-driven storytelling. While no partner is yet on board, given the success of “Hamnet” — which has helped Focus Features to one of its most successful awards seasons in years, not to mention an impressive global box office — it’s unlikely to stay that way for too long.\n\n\t“I’m over the moon that Liza and Hera have taken on ‘Land.’ This screen adaptation is in the best possible hands,” O’Farrell said. “It’s such a personal novel, incorporating my own family history, that I don’t think I could have entrusted it to any other producer. Liza is both a wide and wise reader, and she matches this with an almost uncanny ability to identify the right person for the right job on a film project. I know that for ‘Land’ she will put together a team as incredible and talented as the one for ‘Hamnet’ and I can’t wait to see it all unfold.”\n\n\tDirected by Chloé Zhao, who co-wrote the screenplay with O’Farrell, “Hamnet” has been one of this year’s critical hits and awards season darlings. Starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal and telling the fictionalized and deeply moving story of William Shakespeare’s wife Agnes Hathaway and the death of their son, the film — alongside widespread acclaim — has earned eight Oscar nominations, 11 BAFTA nominations (the record for a film directed by a woman), a PGA nomination and a WGA nomination. Wins so far include the Golden Globes for best pictures and best actress, a Critics Choice award and TIFF’s People’s Choice award.\n\n\tEarly conversations are already underway with top-tier talent for “Land,” which joins Hera Pictures’ growing slate of authored projects including “The Return of Stanley Atwell,” starring Nicholas Galitzine.\n\n\tO’Farrell is published by Headline’s Tinder Press imprint in the U.K. and Alfred A. Knopf in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSet up at Nordisk Film (“Loveable,” “The Girl With a Needle” “Out of Athens,” the feature debut of Badrudin Ga’ar (“Tilt”), has won the Film Finances Scandinavia Award, granted to a title at the Göteborg Festival Nordic Film Market’s Discovery co-production platform, highlighting Nordic film projects. The plaudit recognizes a Nordic feature project that demonstrates artistic excellence and international potential. \n\t\n\n\tIn the other top award announced Thursday by the Nordic Film Market, “Chentian,” the second directorial feature of Suha Arraf, the writer of Eran Ricklis’ “The Syrian Bride,” a Locarno Audience Award winner, walked off with the Tint Post-Production Award. Both prizes are substantial: The Film Finances Scandinavia Award includes, for example, €15,000 ($17,850) in development aid, while the Tint Post-Production Award is worth €35,000 ($41,650) in services. \n\n\n\tBoth Awards also carry the prestige of winning out at the world’s top marketplace for Nordic films as these continue to score Oscar nominations (Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value”, Palme d’Ors (Ruben Östlund’s “The Square,” “Triangle of Sadness”) and significant sales around the world in select cases. \n\n\n\t‘Out of Athens’\n\n\tWritten by Ga’ur, an Oslo-based Norwegian/Somali screenwriter-director and alum of Westerdals, Kristiania University College, “Out of Athens” takes an immigration theme, one of his central concerns, and gives it several twists, delivering a social -issue romantic drama with a thriller edge.\n\t\n\n\tDescribed as an “intimate thriller,” in “Out of Athens,” Maja, a Norwegian woman, is hired by a smuggler to pose as the lover of Kasim, an undocumented man attempting to cross Europe. “What begins as a performance slowly turns into something real and dangerous,” says the synopsis.\n\n\t“The jury decided to award a new talent, a filmmaker who took many risks to be here and tell this story. This film presents a timely, global issue by intertwining it with a deeply personal experience and the hope that young love inspires. After careful deliberation, the jury decided to award the Film Finances Scandinavia Award to Out of Athens,” said the powerful Film Finances Scandinavia Award jury, made up of Cannes Critics’ Week program manager Thomas Rosso, Protagonist Pictures creative executive Emilie Szemraj and Max Malka, an executive producer at Banijay Finland.\n\n\t‘Chentian’\n\n\tProduced by May Odeh at Palestine’s Odeh Films and Germany’s Mayana Films, “Chentian” marks Arraf’s follow-up to Venice Critics’ Week title “Villa Touma,” after Arraf leapt to attention penning Eran Ricklis, “The Syrian Bride,” a Locarno Audience Award winner, and co-writing his “Lemon Tree,” which scored European Film Award nominations for actress (Hiam Abbas) and screenwriter. \n\n\tSet in what the synopsis describes as a Palestinian village inside “Israel,” “Chentian” focuses like all those films on the fate of women, turning on two sisters-in-law, Nabila and Shams, subject to an exchange marriage, who have to navigate hidden desires when when becomes a widow, and the three of eviction from their land.    \n\n\t“A poetic story of women fighting for liberation. The sisters’ personal struggles reflect the complexity of the political context surrounding them. While trying to defend their land, they must deal with their identity and hidden desire of sexuality. In a quiet and delicate way, the film will bring us a story of hope for women who won’t accept being silenced,” said the Tint jury of Malika Rabahallah, director of Filmfest Hamburg, Charades festival manager Léonard Altmann  and Thomas Robsahm a Nordisk Film producer.\n\n\tOther Nordic Film Market Awards and Details\n\n\tIn further recognition, “Tropical Malaise,” directed by Jorge Cadena, was awarded the Coprocity Development Award 2025 by Cineuropa, including a €3,500 grant and a €2,800 promotional campaign by Cineuropa.

    "body": "\n\tLos Angeles-based genre label Spooky Pictures and Image Nation Abu Dhabi have acquired rights to the popular found-footage horror anthology series “V/H/S” from Studio71.\n\n\tThe deal to jointly produce forthcoming titles within the franchise — which debuted at Sundance in 2012 and became a launch pad for up-and-coming genre talents — marks a further step in the six-year partnership between the U.S. genre label, headed by Steven Schneider (“Pet Sematary”) and Roy Lee (“The Ring”), and the deep-pocketed UAE-based studio.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a natural evolution,” said Image Nation CEO Ben Ross, who noted: “This is a piece of IP that we all were very fond of that became available and we’re very excited about it, because one of our mantras is we like to work with emerging talent.”\n\n\n\tRoss specified that the “V/H/S” franchise would provide an opportunity for Arab filmmakers to get into genre, but that “we are looking to find new filmmakers around the world, including that region.”\n\n\tThe “V/H/S” franchise began in 2012, with the first installment including short found-footage films from Adam Wingard, Ti West, Joe Swanberg and more. Various installments along the way have tweaked the format, including 2014’s viral-video centered “V/H/S: Viral,” year-specific groupings like 2022’s “V/H/S/99” and 2023’s “V/H/S/85,” and last year’s sci-fi horror collection “V/H/S/Beyond.” There have also been two feature-length movies based on short films from the series: 2016’s “SiREN” and 2022’s “Kids vs. Aliens.”\n\n\t“Horror anthologies are generally difficult to mount,” Schneider said. “The fact that the ‘V/H/S’ brand and franchise has not just persevered, but thrived — and continues to grow in popularity because of the consistent level of quality control — that was an amazing opportunity for us to get into.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued: “Like Ben said, we really love the opportunity to work with and help break, nourish, foster up-and-coming filmmakers. And this platform for them is incredible.”\n\n\tLee further noted that “the shorts created for the ‘V/H/S’ franchise can be like a proof-of-concept that could potentially turn these shorts into feature films.”\n\n\tPrevious horror titles spawned by the Spooky Pictures and Image Nation partnership include hit “Late Night With the Devil,” helmed by Australian writing/directing duo Colin and Cameron Cairns; Charlie Polinger’s “The Plague” starring Joel Edgerton, which world premiered in Un Certain Regard at Cannes last year; and groundbreaking polygamy-themed Arab horror movie “The Vile,” directed by Majid Al Ansari, which won the top prize at the 2025 Fantastic Fest in Austin.\n\n\tThe Spooky Pictures and Image Nation upcoming slate includes supernatural horror “Hokum” from Irish writer-director Damian McCarthy, which will be released in May; “The Shepherd” from John Hyams (“Sick”) and starring David Dastmalchian and Georgina Campbell; Randall Okita’s “Menace” starring Isabel May; and Bryan Edward Hill’s “Archangel.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom left to right: Roy Lee, Ben Ross, Steven Schneider.\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tScottish star Peter Mullan is not going to the U.S. anytime soon. \n\n\t“There’s a lot about it that I love, but a lot that has become so ugly and so toxic. I’d never have thought, in a billion years, that we would actively not want to go to America,” he says.  \n\n\t“My son is autistic. He wanted to go to Las Vegas, although that’s my idea of hell, and we had to cancel. I didn’t trust border control not to look into my politics. My terror was they wouldn’t take care of my son, who has cognitive issues. It broke my heart, but he knew we weren’t going because of Trump. I’m not alone in that.”\n\t\n\n\tMullan, an institution in Scotland, is known for “Braveheart,” “Trainspotting,” “My Name Is Joe” and powerful turns in “Top of the Lake” or “Ozark.” He also directed “The Magdalene Sisters” and scored a BAFTA nom for “I Swear” just a few days ago.  \n\n\n\tNow, he’s leading Rotterdam festival premiere “The Fall of Sir Douglas Weatherford,” directed by Sean Dunn and being sold by Charades, about an unassuming tour guide Kenneth who becomes obsessed with a historical figure he frequently dresses as. As a popular fantasy series takes over his town, the line between fact and fiction blurs. \n\n\tThe clip debuts exclusively here:\n\n\n\n\n\tHistory and truth are very much on Mullan’s mind, too.\n\n\t“More and more people are less and less interested in what has gone before. There’s a lovely quote from historian E. H. Carr: ‘History is what one generation finds of interest in another.’ Thankfully, we now have a generation that wants to know more about Palestine, slavery and the history of genocide, and how they pertain to Australia, New Zealand and the Americas,” he tells Variety.  \n\t\n\n\t“Scottish history is of less interest than it was 20 years ago after ‘Braveheart.’ It has become ‘boring’ again, and that’s what makes a guy like Kenneth tick. Sadly, he then realizes this revered figure was actually a corrupt and compromised colonialist.”\n\n\tThese days, entire countries are being reduced to keywords.  \n\n\t“Ask anyone what they know about Scotland: William Wallace, golf and whiskey. The U.S.? Movies. Trump. Racism. We’re living in a world that reinterprets history with alternate facts. To paraphrase Jack Nicholson, ‘They can’t handle the truth.’ When people look at the horrors of Farage, Meloni, Trump, Orbán and fucking Bolsonaro, and Putin, they’re all rewriting history as we speak. Even history that happened yesterday, because now Alex Pretti is a ‘domestic terrorist.’” \n\n\tPretti was fatally shot by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis on Jan. 24.\n\n\t“The Trump bandwagon will tell you: ‘Don’t believe your own eyes, don’t believe what you see.’ Then what hope do we have of them believing history?” he wonders.  \n\n\t“You’re informed by the people around you. That’s what’s so disgusting about what Trump is doing: he’s trying to turn Americans against Americans. When he says there’s a ‘good immigrant’ and a ‘bad immigrant,’ what he’s really saying is: There’s a white immigrant and a black or brown immigrant. With Renée Good [shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent] and Pretti, they were hoping to paint him as a radical leftist and that hasn’t quite worked out. But what if he were black? Forget about it.”\n\n\tSo where does Mullan find solace these days? In his own town and his “community of creatives.” \n\n\t“We are fucked up, but we are, on the whole, a decent bunch. I don’t despair for human kind at the moment, because that would be giving in to these fuckers.”\n\n\tDunn, making his feature debut, admires Mullan’s honesty. \n\n\t“That’s what made him so right for Kenneth. There are no airs with Kenneth. He believes what he says. He’s stubborn. Despite his flaws, he’s completely authentic. There’s something very endearing about that,” he admits. \n\n\t“Peter is best known for his raw, humane, and naturalistic approach to acting. I first saw him in ‘My Name Is Joe’ and, like everybody else, I was blown away by that performance.”\n\t\n\n\tAs Kenneth, Mullan shows a man who’s lost everything: his wife, daughter. His “loneliness is his vulnerability,” says Dunn. \n\n\t“What he has left is this role. He’s the sole custodian of Weatherford’s legacy and, by extension, his town’s entire identity. That’s not just a job for him. It’s who he is.” But when that role is challenged, things so awry. \n\n\t“When people stop caring, he becomes untethered. That’s when the loneliness becomes pathological. He has no one to pull him back, so the obsession takes over completely.”\n\n\tIt would be difficult to find actual heroes in “The Fall of Sir Douglas Weatherford.” \n\n\t“Kenneth isn’t a hero. Weatherford certainly wasn’t one either, even though Kenneth desperately needs him to be. The film is more interested in what happens when you build your entire sense of self around something that turns out to be fiction. Or worse, a lie you’re telling yourself.”\n\n\t“Should we know our heroes better? Maybe. But I think the real question is: What do we do when we find out they weren’t who we thought they were?”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNicole Scherzinger is opening up about her mom surviving two strokes.\n\n\tThe Tony winner talked about her mother during her performance at the American Heart Association’s annual Red Dress Collection Concert gala for women’s cardiac health on Thursday night at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City.\n\n\t“She has a mechanical heart,” Scherzinger said. “In 2002, she suffered a stroke and we had to get her a double valve replacement. I don’t talk about this because it’s a little sensitive, but I mean if you’re gonna talk about it this is the place to talk about it, right?”\n\t\n\n\tTearing up, she continued, “We replaced her aortic valve and her mitral valve, and then in 2020 she had another stroke so we replaced her aortic valve again. But she is strong, so on behalf of me and my mom I want thank all of you so much for the beautiful work that you do.”\n\n\tScherzinger also noted that her mom worked for AHA for 15 years in Louisville, Ky.\n\n\n\tThe evening included a celebrity fashion show that featured Uzo Aduba, Christina Chang of “Heated Rivalry,” Normani, Jane Seymour, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Chlöe Bailey, Edi Falco, Amaya “Papaya” Espinal, “Agatha All Along” star Ali Ahn, Selma Blair, reality television star Kandi Buress and her daughter Riley, Sasha Pieterse, NFL sideline reporter Jen Hale and Monty, the winner of the 2025 Westminster Dog Show.\n\n\tAmy Grant, who also performed and walked in the show, spoke about undergoing open heart surgery four years ago after her husband Vince Gill’s cardiologist noticed something might be wrong. \n\t\n\n\t “Life can change in an instant, often before you even realize it,” Grant said. “There’s a moment for so many women they don’t even see it coming when their health, her plans, her sense of certainty, are about to shift. I was that woman. Today, I stand here as the result of a life-saving open-heart surgery.\n\n\tAnd I’m gonna tell you – it’s not on the prompter – for a flat chested woman, I have a lot of cleavage now,” she cracked.\n\n\n\tHeart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S. and stroke has moved up to the No. 4 spot. On average, someone dies from cardiovascular disease every 34 seconds, according to AHA. More than half of people living in the U.S. have some form of cardiovascular disease. AHA emphasizes that almost 80% of cardiovascular events can be prevented with education and lifestyle changes like moving more, eating healthy, reducing stress and getting enough sleep.\n\n\tLaura Linney, in a red Ruben Singer dress, hosted the event. “We have to make heart health visible, understandable and personal long before it becomes urgent,” she said. “And because heart disease has so acutely and unexpectedly impacted my family in recent years, we are aware. We ask questions. We have conversations with our doctors because healthcare isn’t a one-way street. Cardiovascular disease isn’t just a medical issue, it’s a family issue, a caregiving issue and women’s health issue.”\n\n\tThe guest list included Susan Lucci, Star Jones, comedian Drew Lynch, healthcare influencer Dr. Mike, ABC News chief medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula and actors Elisabeth Rohm and Aida Turturro. The red carpet was hosted by Variety’s Marc Malkin.\n\n\n\tSee more photos from the Red Dress Collection below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLaura Linney at the American Heart Association’s Red Dress Collection & Concert Gala on January 29, 2026 in New York, New York.

    "body": "\n\tGet your piping bags and dough hooks ready: Food Network‘s “The Ultimate Baking Championship” series is set to debut March 9. \n\n\tHosted by Jesse Palmer with Duff Goldman as head judge, “Ultimate Baking Championship” will follow 16 pastry chefs tested on their core techniques, from laminated dough and pâte à choux to chocolate work and sugar artistry. In the end, only one pastry chef will be named the Ultimate Baking Champion and win the $50,000 grand prize.\n\t\n\n\tPer Food Network, “In the series premiere, host Jesse Palmer welcomes sixteen of the nation’s top pastry chefs to the most intense baking competition ever. After being randomly split into two groups, they are tasked with creating a dessert that is centered around flavor profiles that test one of the four tastes—sweet, salty, sour, or bitter—combined with a specific texture. Each baker must craft an elevated plated dessert in their signature style inspired by their assigned profile to present to judges Duff Goldman and Sherry Yard. After several eliminations, the remaining bakers advance to the Master Challenge, where the chefs must create a dessert inspired by the roots of their baking journey.”\n\n\n\tThroughout the season, challenges will include a science-inspired dessert battle, 3-D chocolate sculptures and “larger-than-life theatrical experience” edible displays.\n\n\tGoldman will be joined by a rotating panel of baking legend guest judges, including Bryan Ford, Amaury Guichon, Shinmin Li, Jacques Torres, Sherry Yard, Molly Yeh and Zac Young. \n\n\tCompetitors for the inaugural season include: Julian Belon (Miami, Florida); Florencia Breda (San Luis Obispo, California); Molly Coen (Monterey, California); Rochelle Cooper (Washington DC); Sarah Craichy (Lake Tahoe, Nevada); Adalberto Diaz (Salt Lake City, Utah); Casey Doody (Chicago, Illinois); Arlety Estévez (Atlanta, Georgia); Robert Gonzalez (Boston, Massachusetts); Juan Gutierrez (Chicago, Illinois); Clement Le Deore (San Diego, California); Oralia Perez (Houston, Texas); Lasheeda Perry (Fort Walton Beach, Florida); Cesar Ryan Sajulan (Brooklyn, New York); Christopher Teixeira (Chicago, Illinois) and Steven Weiss (Martinsburg, West Virginia).\n\t\n\n\t“The Ultimate Baking Championship” will debut Monday, March 9 at 9 p.m. ET on Food Network and stream the next day on HBO Max and Discovery+.\n\n\tThe series is produced by Sonic Dog for Food Network.\n\n\t“The pastry chefs competing are the best of the best – they are true artists whose desserts are mind-blowingly beautiful and delicious,” Warner Bros. Discovery head of food content Betsy Ayala said. “’The Ultimate Baking Championship’ chefs elevate pastry technique and artistry to the highest level we’ve ever seen.”\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLady Gaga performs onstage during The MAYHEM Ball Tour at The Kia Forum on July 28, 2025 in Inglewood, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live Nation\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAwards Season Calendar (Updated Jan. 30, 2026): “Let God Sort Em Out” reads like a fitting title for one of the contenders for album of the year at the 2026 Grammys. It sounds good in theory, and yet reading the Almighty’s mind has thus far proven difficult in the Grammy-sifting process. So mere mortals must take up the task of predicting who will prevail in the top four all-genre categories.\n\n\tIn our own sorting, we’re seeing a race that’s too close to call in three of the four. But even though Bad Bunny hasn’t traditionally been a major favorite in the Grammys’ top categories, we have reason to wager that he’ll take home a big prize during the Feb. 1 CBS telecast… before he definitively wins the Super Bowl a week later.\n\n\tRead Variety’s final Grammy predictions in select categories, along with expanded analysis of the Big Four races: album of the year, song of the year, record of the year and best new artist.\n\n\tFinal-round voting ran from Dec. 12, 2025, through Jan. 5, 2026, ahead of winners being revealed during the Grammy Premiere Ceremony and the 68th annual Grammy Awards telecast on Feb. 1. The ceremony will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+, with Trevor Noah returning as host.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlbum of the Year\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBad Bunny — “Debí Tirar Más Fotos”Justin Bieber — “Swag”Sabrina Carpenter — “Man’s Best Friend”Clipse — “Let God Sort Em Out”Lady Gaga — “Mayhem”Kendrick Lamar — “GNX”Leon Thomas — “MUTT”Tyler, the Creator — “Chromakopia”\n\n\tWill Win: Bad BunnyCould Win: Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga\n\n\tTruly a three-way toss-up. \n\n\tHere’s why Gaga could win: She’s severely overdue, never having won any of the top four categories, and there’s no ambiguity about how much people love “Mayhem.” \n\n\tBut here’s why Lamar could prevail: Hip-hop can match Gaga in past-due-ness in this category specifically, as the genre last scored here 22 years ago, when OutKast won. Still, Lamar took home both record and song of the year last year and could well repeat with record of the year again this season, so there may be less urgency to ensure he completes a sweep.\n\n\tWe’re taking an admittedly wild swing and going with Bad Bunny. True, his last album wasn’t even nominated, which under other circumstances would make him a long shot this time around. But recently, the Recording Academy invited all Latin Grammy voters to join the main body. The exact number of new voting members with a Latin focus hasn’t been revealed, but it represents a significant influx. That sudden shift in the membership rolls could be enough to tip the scales.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRecord of the Year\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Abracadabra” — Lady Gaga“Anxiety” — Doechii“APT.” — Rosé & Bruno Mars“DtMF” — Bad Bunny“Luther” — Kendrick Lamar & SZA“Manchild” — Sabrina Carpenter“The Subway” — Chappell Roan“Wildflower” — Billie Eilish\n\n\tWill Win: Kendrick Lamar & SZACould Win: Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga\n\n\tAnother near toss-up. As the year’s leading nominee overall, Lamar seems likely to walk away with something in the top three categories, if not a sweep; the multi-month dominance of “Luther,” bolstered by the SZA assist, makes this a prime place for that to happen. The only potential speed bump is voter fatigue — some may feel he was rewarded enough last year, when “Not Like Us” won both record and song, and see this as a moment to consider who’s more overdue.\n\n\tThat could open the door for “Abracadabra” to work its magic and give Gaga her first win in a top category… or for a surge of cultural impact to push Bad Bunny into the conversation here, instead of — or in addition to — an album win. And Billie Eilish remains a dark horse with a song that debuted in a previous eligibility period but crashed this year’s party; even if she’s off-cycle album-wise, never count out a hit as massive as “Wildflower,” or a Grammy princess this queenly.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSong of the Year\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Abracadabra” — Lady Gaga“Anxiety” — Doechii“APT.” — Rosé & Bruno Mars“DtMF” — Bad Bunny“Golden” (from “Kpop Demon Hunters”) — Huntr/x“Luther” — Kendrick Lamar & SZA“Manchild” — Sabrina Carpenter“Wildflower” — Billie Eilish\n\n\tWill Win: “Golden”Could Win: Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga\n\n\t“Golden” is nominated only for song of the year, not record of the year. That may make it seem counterintuitive to imagine the track having enough support to win best song when it didn’t even land a nomination for the category’s closest cousin. Yet there’s also an argument that being nominated in just one of the two could actually concentrate all the enthusiasm that does exist for the song into its lone chance to shine in a major category.\n\n\tSong of the year is, after all, the right place for voters to agree that the “Demon Hunters” tune deserves recognition for its craftsmanship, even if it wasn’t the most bonkers-level smash of the year. And among the electorate are plenty of parents who heard it a million times — and kind of liked it by at least the thousandth listen — who may feel that the K-pop protectors of the universe deserve a significant win, not merely one in a down-ballot category. Still, there are genuinely five or six different ways this one could go.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest New Artist\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBest New Artist\n\n\tAddison RaeAlex WarrenOlivia DeanKatseyeLeon ThomasLola YoungThe MaríasSombr\n\n\tWill Win: Olivia DeanCould Win: Leon Thomas, Sombr\n\n\tLast year at this time, we said this was the only top category that was easy to predict: It absolutely would be Chappell Roan. This year, we feel nearly as confident about Dean. By one measure, she should be a long shot: This is her sole nomination. Then again, that’s also true for everyone else in the category — except Thomas, who has six.\n\n\tSo why not predict him? Because the chart winds shifted dramatically between nominations and final voting, with Dean’s album becoming a beloved top-five staple and a sellout tour on the way, with resale prices through the roof. Should she miss out this year, it’s not as if there won’t be other chances to reward her: Her album arrived just late enough that it won’t be eligible until next year.\n\n\tBut voters do think about career longevity, and the Academy may be happy to give Dean a head start on what looks like years of Grammy love to come.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPop Solo Performance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJustin Bieber — “Daisies”Lady Gaga — “Disease”Lola Young — “Messy”Sabrina Carpenter — “Manchild”Chappell Roan — “The Subway”\n\n\tWill Win: Sabrina Carpenter — “Manchild”Could Win: Lady Gaga — “Disease”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPop Vocal Album\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJustin Bieber — “Swag”Lady Gaga — “Mayhem”Miley Cyrus — “Something Beautiful”Sabrina Carpenter — “Man’s Best Friend”Teddy Swims — “I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy, Part 2”\n\n\tWill Win: Lady Gaga — “Mayhem”Could Win: Sabrina Carpenter — “Man’s Best Friend”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTraditional Pop Vocal Album\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tLaila Biali — “Wintersongs”Elton John & Brandi Carlile — “Who Believes in Angels?”Jennifer Hudson — “The Gift of Love”Lady Gaga — “Harlequin”Laufey — “A Matter of Time”Barbra Streisand — “The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume 2”\n\n\tWill Win: Elton John & Brandi Carlile — “Who Believes in Angels?”Could Win: Laufey — “A Matter of Time”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPop Duo/Group Performance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tCynthia Erivo feat.

The judge ruled stalking is NOT a crime of violence ... the upshot is that Mangione can't even be charged with murder in the federal case. All he can be charged with is stalking, which carries a maximum sentence of life without parole.\n      \n    \n          Mangione is still charged in state court with murder, although in New York, there is no death penalty.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Prosecutors did win a victory ... the judge ruled the evidence searched and found in his backpack was admissible in the trial. The defense argued the evidence should not be admissible because the feds didn't have a search warrant. So now, the jury will see the gun found in Mangione's backpack, and his diary ... which prosecutors say is like a manifesto.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Luigi Mangione\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

The bogus Burrow image showed Kendall sitting at a table and covering her face with a wine glass.\n      \n\n          For what it's worth, that Kendall shot is at least five years old ... but if ya needed further proof this is all B.S., we checked with several sources who confirmed these Instagram Stories were not real.\n      \n    \n          Also, take a second to think -- how likely is it for fans to capture both Stories exactly ONE second after they were posted ... with no one else getting it at like, two or three seconds.\n      \n    \n          The tin-foil hats were secured firmly on noggins over the past few days -- with some folks thinking Jenner's wardrobe choice for \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon was a nod to Burrow's team ... ignoring the fact its a popular Chanel dress.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Some thought it might've been an addition to the rollout for the Fanatics Sportsbook Super Bowl ad ... but it's simply not the case, considering the two sides never actually published the shots.\n      \n    \n          Burrow has been super secretive about his personal life ... but he was most recently tied to model Olivia Ponton. Jenner sparked rumors of a reunion with Devin Booker after the two had a playful back-and-forth on social media on Thursday.\n      \n    \n          Case closed.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Joe Burrow\n              \n                          \n                Kendall Jenner\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Instagram\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

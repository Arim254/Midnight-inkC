    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for “Scream 7,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tGhostface is back in theaters, and so is Neve Campbell’s Sidney Prescott after sitting out “Scream 6.” In “Scream 7,” Sidney is now a mother to a teenage daughter named Tatum (Isabel May), who gets caught up in her own twisted cat-and-mouse game with the masked killer. Like past “Scream” movies, there’s buckets of blood, shocking kills and one big unmasking at the end of the movie — plus several cameos from past films.\n\n\tThe Ghostface killers rack up quite the bodycount in “Scream 7.” Right off the bat, horror movie lovers Scott (Jimmy Tatro) and Madison (Michelle Randolph) are murdered after renting the home that belonged to Matthew Lillard’s Stu Macher in the original “Scream.” Over in Pine Grove, Sidney receives an eerie message from Stu, apparently back from the grave. He claims that he survived his death in “Scream” and is back as Ghostface to get his revenge on Sidney and her family. One of the Ghostfaces then kills Tatum’s classmate Hannah (Mckenna Grace) at her high school’s play rehearsal then goes to Sidney’s house. \n\n\tAfter a fight with Sidney, her husband Mark (Joel McHale) and Tatum, that Ghostface is run over by reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), who’s joined by her new camera crew Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Chad Meeks-Martin (Mason Gooding) from the past two “Scream” movies. Ghostface is revealed to be an unknown murderer who escaped from an insane asylum and had been stalking Sidney. After visiting the mental institution and talking to a supervisor, Sidney finds out that Stu had apparently survived his death. \n\n\tThe real Ghostface starts picking off his victims one by one: Tatum’s friend (Celeste O’Connor), Sidney’s neighbor’s son Lucas (Asa Germann) and Tatum’s boyfriend Ben (Sam Rechner) all die. Mark is wounded, but later survives. It’s also revealed that “Stu” is an AI deepfake created by Marco (Ethan Embry), the supervisor at the mental institute. He makes the AI video transform into late sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette), Nancy Loomis (Laurie Metcalf), who was the Ghostface from “Scream 2,” and Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the killer from “Scream 3.”\n\n\tHowever, the real brains behind the Ghostface killing spree turns out to be Sidney’s neighbor Jessica (Anna Camp). After unmasking, she says she was inspired by Sidney’s autobiography and thought she needed to murder her own husband to reach the same levels of success. When that didn’t work, she discovered where Sidney lived, met Marco and decided to kidnap Tatum to put her through the same Ghostface killings that Sidney survived. But in the end, Sidney and Tatum are able to kill Marco and Jessica (who’s shot repeatedly in the head) and escape with their lives. \n\n\tWith Sidney, Tatum and Mark alive, could they star in an eighth movie and face off against another Ghostface? Mindy and Chad also survive the finale, and in the mid-credits scene they shoot their own news broadcast about the killings; perhaps they could follow in Gale’s reporting footsteps. “Scream” creator Kevin Williams has ideas for an eighth movie, but so far nothing has been officially announced.\n\n\tSee the past “Scream” cameos that appear in the seventh movie below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tStu Macher (Matthew Lillard)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tStu was one of the original Ghostfaces in the original “Scream,” alongside Sidney’s boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), and fans have long theorized that he may have survived his death in the 1996 film after a TV fell on his head. Matthew Lillard returns to play the deranged horror movie fan, but it’s eventually revealed he’s an AI deepfake used to torment Sydney.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNancy Loomis (Laurie Metcalf)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLaurie Metcalf plays local reporter Debbie Salt, who’s later revealed to be original Ghostface Billy Loomis’ vengeful mother Nancy in “Scream 2.” She has it out for Sidney after the heroine killed Billy in the original “Scream.” Nancy later turns on her fellow Ghostface Mickey Altieri (Timothy Olyphant), but is killed in her final showdown with Sidney. She appears as an AI recreation toward the end of “Scream 7.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRoman Bridger (Scott Foley)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tScott Foley played Roman Bridger, director of the in-universe film “Stab 3” who’s revealed to be Sidney’s half-brother in “Scream 3.” Roman was the only solo Ghostface in the franchise, and his actions secretly dated back to the original “Scream.” He was the product of his and Sidney’s mother Maureen being sexually assaulted, but Maureen later rejected him as a son. Spurned by his mother, Roman filmed her affair with Billy Loomis’ father years ago and showed Billy the footage, causing him to go on the original murder spree in “Scream.” Sidney kills Roman in the “Scream 3” finale, and he appears as AI at the end of “Scream 7.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDewey Riley (David Arquette)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDavid Arquette first starred as Dewey Riley, deputy sheriff of Woodsboro, in the original “Scream” and appeared in every film until his death in “Scream 5.” He had survived stabbings by multiple Ghostfaces throughout the years, but he was finally killed for good in the 2022 reboot (or “requel”). He appears as an AI recreation at the end of “Scream 7.”\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 4, Part 2 of “Bridgerton,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tEverything has changed for Hannah Dodd",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 4, Part 2 of “Bridgerton,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tEverything has changed for Hannah Dodd‘s Francesca in Season 4 of “Bridgerton.” Dodd took over the role of Francesca for the show’s third season, after the departure of Ruby Stokes. Since then, Francesca debuted in society, and then met, fell in love with and married John Stirling, Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli). Fans of Julia Quinn’s “Bridgerton” novels — the souce material for Netflix’s mega-hit drama — know that the story doesn’t end there. Francesa’s book, “When He Was Wicked,” is the sixth installment in the series, and focuses on her romance with Michael Stirling, her late husband John’s cousin, who has loved her from the moment they met.As Season 3 set up Francesca and John’s love for each other, John’s rakish cousin finally made an appearance in the finale — as a woman named Michaela (Masali Baduza), in a dramatic gender-flipped departure from the book.While “Bridgerton” has introduced same-sex relationships to the show, it is unclear how the theme will be tackled in upcoming seasons. Francesca’s brother, and Season 4 lead, Benedict, was previously introduced as bisexual and came out to his now-wife, Sophie, during a heartfelt conversation in Part 2. Regardless, Francesca and Michaela (dubbed “Franchaela” by fans) will be Bridgerton’s first central couple to be queer, as well as the show’s first Sapphic storyline. As for when that will happen, though Shondaland and Netflix haven’t yet announced who will be the lead character for Season 5, Francesca’s arc in the fourth season make her the prime candidate. (When Variety‘s Jenny Maas asked showrunner Jess Brownell this question about Francesa, Brownell said, “Can you just put ‘laughs’?” And then added, “Interesting theory.”)Although no overtly romantic moments have passed between the duo yet, they’ve shared several scenes as Michaela’s outgoing and impulsive nature grates against Francesca’s need for order and repressed feelings. Much to the happiness of their mutually beloved John, the two eventually clear the air between them and strike up a friendship. Everything seems to be on track for the newly formed Kilmartin family, until John, suffering from a headache, lies down for a nap in Episode 6 and never wakes back up.The next two episodes feature a devastated Francesca as she attempts to navigate her grief, her suppressed emotions hard to read, until she reveals she is trying to stay calm for the sake of her pregnancy. But when the pregnancy turns out to be a false alarm, she has a devastating meltdown in her mother’s arms.\n\n\n\tThrough it all, her one steady source of comfort remains Michaela, the only one who understands the depth of her loss. Poles apart in character, Michaela proposes a joyful celebration of life for John, where Francesca finally smiles and thanks her for her support. Seemingly a united front, Michaela agrees to stay in London upon Francesca’s request, but secretly flees in the finale.Here, Baduza and Dodd, and Alli in a separate interview, speak with Variety about the trio’s love for each other, what’s next for Francesca’s character arc — and what John’s death means for Francesca and Michaela’s romance.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis is the first time we’ve seen a queer relationship in the spotlight on “Bridgerton.” Is there any added pressure to depict this particular storyline?Hannah Dodd: We’re mainly really, really excited and very proud to get to tell that story, and tell it in a way that it’s the lead storyline and not just the side characters. They get a full eight-episode arc as they deserve, and hopefully there’s audiences that feel really represented and included.Do Francesca and Michaela have feelings for each other at this point? And, more importantly, are they aware of them?Masali Baduza: I think Michaela has feelings for Francesca. I think that she has pushed them down to the very bottom, but they are there, and she isn’t really acknowledging them. Obviously, Francesca is her cousin’s wife, so it’s a lot for her, but she’s definitely feeling that level of attraction for Francesca.Dodd: I think Francesca isn’t even aware of that as a possibility. As much as she’s feeling feelings, she doesn’t really know where they come from and why. For the most part, it’s a confronting energy for her. [Michaela] is somebody who lives their life in quite an opposite way. It’s a little bit like triggering for Francesca, and makes her question herself. There’s a response that comes from Francesca when she’s with Michaela, but I don’t think she has any idea what that is — yet.After helping each other navigate their grief, Michaela promises Francesca she’ll stay in London but ends up leaving without a word. Why is that?Baduza: Michaela’s feeling a lot of emotions, and she’s very overwhelmed. I think that her coping mechanism is to just run away and pretend like nothing is happening. If she’s not there to face it, then she doesn’t have to deal with it. She’s constraining herself, and in doing so, is hurting Francesca a lot. She’s just looking out for herself.It’s clear to viewers that Michaela has an overwhelming effect on Francesca, who ends up being a bit stand-offish toward her. How does Michaela read Francesca’s confusing behavior toward her?Baduza: Michaela thinks maybe that Francesca’s lived a very sheltered life. She’s not used to anything or anyone that really disrupts her state of peace. Michaela reads that as friction and tension. But again, she’s not someone who really loves to interrogate what she’s feeling in the moment. If it’s very hard for her, she’ll give it back to her, or deflect, or just not be in the space and in the environment whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJohn’s last scene is him completing a puzzle with Francesca and Michaela, where he does the ground, and Michaela finishes the sky. His last shot in the show is him looking at Francesca and Michaela getting along with fondness. Did you play into the symbolism of that? What was John feeling in that moment?Dodd: I think that whole scene is a metaphor, and is sort of a symbol for their relationship. I think it’s very, very clever and very well-written that they both complete Francesca’s puzzle [and the pieces they choose] really represent their characters as well. Whether or not the characters are aware of things, I do think it’s something that you can look back on, and it feels like a bit of a blessing.Victor Alli: It’s interesting because John doesn’t know what’s happening next, so I had to play every moment as is, and not think about it being my last. It is really symbolic, but I didn’t want to lean into it too much, and wanted to [keep] it sort of simple.What does John hope for Francesca and Michaela individually?Alli: That post John’s passing, Francesca is able to find her feet again. John would want her to be happy, and would be behind whatever she decides to do. She shouldn’t feel the pressure of having to stay in this wallowing rut, and he expects her to bloom. And with Michaela, he would want her to shine in every single way. She’s such a big part of his life, and he’d want her to carry on the family name and be a Stirling ambassador, whatever that may mean.How is John going to continue to influence Michaela and Francesca’s relationship as it builds?Dodd: John’s an integral character for both of us, and he’s had such an impact on both our lives. He’s what connects them, but also what separates them. He’s going to be with them, as anybody who leaves you is, forever.\n\n\tBaduza: Exactly, and they’ll always be family on some level, because they shared John.Alli: I think there will always be a part of John in Francesca and Michaela, because ultimately, he’s the thing that united them both. Of course, they have to find their own feet and their own journey together. But he’s the glue. So, hopefully, there might be moments where he’s spoken about and remembered, because he’s an integral part of their relationship.What’s next for Francesca and Michaela in terms of reconciliation after Michaela’s departure?Dodd: It is gonna take some work, definitely. They’re both in pain, so I do hope that there’s grace given to both of them. Everybody goes through those things very differently, and it can do things to you. You’re not always your best self in those situations.Baduza: I hope that Michaela comes back to apologize, sets the record straight with Francesca and explains why she did what she did. It would be lovely to see that. I hope so. Fingers crossed.Throughout the season, Francesca is struggling with being unable to have a baby. After John’s passing, there’s a moment where she thinks she might be pregnant but realizes she isn’t, followed by a particularly difficult conversation with her mother, when Francesca says she feels she failed John by not being able to make him a father. How much of Francesca’s grief is her not having a baby versus guilt over not being able to do something for her husband, whom she loved?Dodd: I don’t know if she knows. She’s got a tsunami of feelings. I think it’s something that connects her and her mum, and there’s this idea that this is how her mum got through [the loss of her husband]. I don’t completely know if she’s aware of what is “societal” and what are her own thoughts. I do think that she really, really wanted a baby, and I think that [having one] would have also been devastating in its own right, but also been a piece of John that she gets to keep. It could have given her a purpose, and she’s somebody who would have benefited from that. But sometimes when life goes in unexpected ways, that’s where you can grow the most. There’s so much pressure on women and expectations, and I think for her to work out what she wants and who she is, she needs to break away from all of that. One of the major plot points in Francesca’s book, “When He Was Wicked,” is her struggle with infertility and wanting a child. Is that something that will be incorporated into the show for Francesca and Michaela’s storyline?Dodd: I’m sure what the writers will come up with will be beautiful and wonderful, and there’ll be elements of the book incorporated. Obviously, we have done the infertility storyline, so whether or not that continues, I don’t know, but I do think it’s a really interesting dynamic, and queer couples are included in that story as well. Just because we’re doing a queer storyline, it doesn’t mean that that won’t fit into it, and I’m excited to find out. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrancesca is very overwhelmed by all of the attention from her family is giving her, but does continue to seek Michaela out. In addition to her being John’s cousin, is there a reason why Francesca finds her presence comforting?Dodd: I think it’s a combination of things. There is an instinctual thing — an unspoken and not really understood connection there. Michaela is somebody that she is drawn to, whether or not it’s because she frustrates her, whether or not it’s because she represents home and knows John. But nobody knew John like Francesca and Michaela. She’s really looking for comfort in somebody who is actually experiencing what she’s feeling. As much as everybody around the family loved John, Michaela is the only one who is grieving in the same way as she is, so she’s looking for that familiarity and that comfort from her. But there is a bit of an instinctive pull there as well.Speaking of John and Michaela’s relationship, there’s a scene at Michaela’s welcome-to-society party, where John is adamant that Francesca not attempt to set Michaela up with suitors and gets quite upset when she does. Is there a reason behind that?Baduza: It was never explicitly said. But Victor and I talked a lot about the fact that Michaela would have shared her sexuality with him, or her figuring it out, with him. John is very protective over Michaela. They have a very close sibling relationship, so he knows her very well. He knows that she’s not in the market for her husband, probably never will be. He knows what society expects of her and that she’s just not willing to do that.Alli: He knows Michaela really well and knows that Francesca means well. But John is sort of like, “It’s more than that.” Michaela is not ready for marriage and all that comes with it. She’s pretty content being single and seeing people, and she’s just waiting for the right time and the right love.Does John pick up on any of the romantic tension between the two of them?Baduza: I don’t think so. He would never expect his cousin to be into his wife.Alli: I don’t think he does. He’s so invested in his marriage that he just wants that. It wouldn’t even cross his mind that there’s something there.Throughout the season, Michaela gives Francesca a lot of difficult-to-decipher looks, especially during John’s funeral. How was she feeling overall and dealing with a confusing mix of emotions?Baduza: I think Michaela was definitely in her own world at the funeral. She couldn’t have been there for Francesca, because she was grappling with the loss of her brother. She was just overwhelmed and maybe was thinking of possible exit plans. She was just going through it and also grieving her brother with this family that she’s also getting to know. So she’s just not in the most comfortable environment.The pregnancy test Francesca undergoes is, quite frankly, very invasive. How does that add to the stress of the situation for Francesca?Dodd: It’s awful. It’s just horrible. You’ve got a grieving woman who has also been quite sheltered, so it’s so invasive, even filming it. I think [being pregnant] was something that she was hanging on to. If there was any hope in that situation, it was the baby. So to have that ripped away from her as well, it’s just like, what else can you take? She’s at absolute ground zero, especially once Michaela leaves; she doesn’t know what life looks like anymore. She’s worked so hard to create that life. It’s an opportunity for her to start again, which is horrendous for anybody to have to do, but there’s an opportunity there for her to actually get to know [herself]. There’s a really interesting dynamic of you can’t take anything else from me. I’m hoping that that will kind of contribute towards growth, because she’s been quite a little girl scared of the world, and “what else can you do to me?” is a really interesting place to take her.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJust to switch gears for a second, how do you envision the Bridgertons breaking the Sophie scandal to Francesca in the middle of everything she’s dealing with?Dodd: I know! I know! Francesca is still very close to her family, so I like the idea of Eloise [telling her], just because I think they’re sort of besties. But Francesca would have been like, “OK, do you know what’s going on in my life?” Maybe she would have had something to say in support, like “love whilst you have time.” As awful as it is, maybe there was some motivation that’s given.Speaking of the Bridgertons, they’re a very close-knit family, and you really see that they want to be there for Francesca. Benedict and Hyacinth are really upset by John’s passing in particular, and it affect their actions throughout the next few episodes. How do you think his death affects the family at large?Dodd: It’s really interesting, because the death of our father has connected us as a family. It’s sort of the core of what the Bridgertons are and why we are so close as a family. To see them all kind of go through it again, it’s quite a visceral reaction. They are so close, and they do really feel for Francesca, but I do think it’s because some of them have been there before as well, that reality is probably quite difficult to replay and go through. It’s a beautiful family dynamic where they really lean on each other. There’s still a lot to explore within the siblings and their different relationships. I’m looking forward to hopefully getting to explore some other relationships out of this situation. But it definitely shakes all of them to their core.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "description": "\n\tZack Snyder joined the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast to mark the 10th anniversary of “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” his highly-divisive comic ",
    "body": "\n\tZack Snyder joined the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast to mark the 10th anniversary of “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” his highly-divisive comic book movie that opened to negative reviews on March 25, 2016 but went on to gross a mighty $874 million worldwide. The tentpole was Snyder’s sequel to the already-polarizing “Man of Steel,” which sent comic book fans into a tizzy for depicting Superman killing Zod, and “BvS” only divided fans further with Batman killing criminals, the two heroes bonding over their moms both being named Martha and more. \n\t\n\n\t“My 100% honest reaction to ‘BvS’ and how it’s received in the world is… Do you really want a movie that’s had all the edges shaved off it by the focus groups?” Snyder said in defense of the movie 10 years later. “Do you really want a movie where the decisions have been made in a boardroom, or tested ideas have been rendered for your enjoyment? Do you really want the Kmart version of your story? Is that what you really want?”\n\n\n\t“Batman v Superman” was the second movie in Snyder’s DC Universe, dubbed the ‘SnyderVerse’ online by his legion of fans. “Justice League” came next with its own polarizations after Snyder left the production due to a family tragedy and the studio brought in Joss Whedon to rewrite scenes and conduct reshoots. This led to a social media movement of Snyder fans calling Warner Bros to release the “Snyder Cut” of “Justice League,” which the studio permitted. “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” debuted on HBO Max in 2021.\n\n\t“I love the mythological journey we went on in these three movies,” Snyder said. “The intensity of where we ended up with ‘Justice League’ and how it evovled and where it came from. That whole insanity. When we were trying for the PG-13 rating on ‘BvS,’ the MPAA kept kicking the movie back to us saying, ‘It’s still an R.’ I remember someone saying we got a report from the MPA saying, ‘We just don’t like the idea of Batman fighting Superman. That kind of makes it an R. He really hits him hard with that sink. That’s rude. That feels like an R.’ I’m just like, ‘Okay… let’s just pretend it’s not Batman vs. Superman for one second.'”\n\t\n\n\t“You realize then that we were kicking the zeitgeist in the nuts and that we were going to anger people,” Snyder continued. “Not only do they not want their heroes deconstructed, they don’t want their heroes battling each other on a road to deconstructing the why of their existence. That’s another sacrilege.”\n\n\tThe Snyder Verse ended before Snyder got to make two more “Justice League” movies, although he admitted on the podcast that he’s “absolutely talked about” bringing those two movies to life somehow in other mediums like a comic book or animation. Snyder added: “We live in a world where all that is possible.” \n\n\t“I would never say there is no way,” Snyder said when asked about his fans’ continued pleas for the SnyderVerse to continue. “I was on the ride that created ‘Justice League,’ and if you were in my shoes there were numerous times, dark times, when there was no chance that there will ever be my version of it. It will never exist. It can’t… cost, politics, everything stood against. And yet it exists. The fans should never forget they did that. They also raised a ton of money for suicide prevention. They did a lot of good. They catch a lot of flak for being toxic or whatever, but they literally saved human lives. You can go fuck yourselves if that’s what you think.”\n\n\tThe DC Universe has since been revived at Warner Bros. under the leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. Gunn directed a new “Superman” movie that was greeted with a mostly positive critical and fan reception upon release last year.\n\n\t“James is cool. I wish them all the best. It is what it is,” Snyder said. “That three movie trilogy is a weed that just won’t die. It grows on its own. It has its own life. It’s not concerned with James’ Superman, which is amazing and all the best to them. I can’t wait to see the next movie. It’s awesome. To me, it’s not the same thing. It’s a different thing.”\n\n\tWatch Snyder’s full interview on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSusan Sarandon is speaking out about her current film and television career, saying that after she spoke out and called for a ceasefire in Gaza that she was unable to take on roles in the United States.\n\n\t“I was fired by my agency, specifically for marching and speaking out about Gaza, for asking for a ceasefire,” Sarandon said. “It became impossible for me to even be on television. I don’t know lately if it’s changed. I couldn’t do any major film or anything connected with Hollywood. I found agents ultimately in England and in Italy, and I work there. I just did a film in Italy, and I did a play at the Old Vic for a number of months. I know this Italian director that just hired me — he was told not to hire me, so that’s still recently. He didn’t listen, but they had that conversation. Right now, I kind of specialize in tiny films with directors who have never directed, in independent films.”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Thelma and Louise” star also said that Spain has more intellectual freedom than the United States.\n\n\n\t“In a place where you feel repression and censorship, to see Spain and to see the president and what he says and the support that he’s giving about Gaza, and to have actors like Javier Bardem come forward with such a strong voice, is so important to us in the United States,” she said.\n\n\tHer comments came during a Feb. 27 discussion ahead of receiving the International Goya award in recognition of her career, including “Dead Man Walking” and “Atlantic City.” The Spanish Film Academy’s Goya Awards ceremony is set to take place on Feb. 28 in Barcelona.\n\n\tIn 2023, Sarandon was dropped by UTA after she spoke at a pro-Palestine rally in New York City.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the full discussion below, courtesy of Reuters.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tUncle Joe Benson, a towering voice in Los Angeles radio whose career spanned nearly four decades, died Feb. 24 due to Parkinson’s disease, Parkinson’s dementia and complications from a fall, his family said. He was 76.\n\n\tBenson’s baritone voice made him a fixture on KLOS-FM, Arrow 93.1 and The Sound 103.1, where he was known for blending music with storytelling, giving listeners a personal connection to the artists and the variety of songs he played. From his early days at a small Illinois station broadcasting out of a trailer to his decades in Los Angeles, Benson brought a unique warmth and humor to the airwaves.\n\t\n\n\t“Joe was a man of the people and a friend to all, whether you met him in person or just heard his big, distinct voice over the airwaves,” KLOS wrote on Facebook, noting his career was filled with encounters with virtually every major rock musician. Colleagues and fans flooded social media with memories. “A radio legend silenced,” wrote fellow disc jockey Rita Wilde. “Nothing but love and respect. At least you aren’t in pain anymore. Love you forever, JB.”\n\n\n\tBeyond his weekday shows, Benson hosted specialty programs like “Off the Record,” “Local Licks” and “The 7th Day,” providing platforms for emerging bands and full-album experiences that became Sunday night rituals for many Angelenos. He also authored a series of “Uncle Joe Benson’s Record Guide” books and shared his passion for motorsports with “The Rock and Roll Racing Report.”\n\n\tEven after semi-retiring in 2017, Benson returned to host “Ultimate Classic Rock,” a nationally syndicated show, demonstrating his enduring dedication to the medium he loved.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance has set an ambitious target of closing the Warner Bros. Discovery transaction by the fall as David Ellison’s media conglomerate trumpeted its hard-fought agreement to acquire its much larger rival.\n\n\tIn a statement issued Friday, Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, said, “From the very beginning, our pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery has been guided by a clear purpose: to honor the legacy of two iconic companies while accelerating our vision of building a next-generation media and entertainment company. By bringing together these world-class studios, our complementary streaming platforms, and the extraordinary talent behind them, we will create even greater value for audiences, partners and shareholders — and we couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead.”\n\t\n\n\tDavid Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery emphasized that the new agreement after a whirlwind period when it appeared WBD would be hitched to Netflix marks a good return for WBD shareholders. All in, the deal has an enterprise value of $110 billion, including the $33 billion in debt that WBD has on its books. That represents a multiple of 7.5 times WBD’s “fully synergized” earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\n\n\t“I’m very pleased with the outcome we achieved for WBD shareholders and the entertainment industry. Our guiding principle throughout this process has been to secure a transaction that maximizes the value of our iconic assets and our century-old studio while delivering as much certainty as possible for our investors. We look forward to working with Paramount to complete this historic transaction,” Zaslav said.\n\t\n\n\tParamount Skydance has set a March 2 conference call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the finer points of the complicated transaction that is backed by the personal wealth of David Ellison’s father, tech billionaire Larry Ellison, and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds. To help raise the cash, Paramount said it plans to issue some $47 billion of new Class B shares at $16.02 per share, “supported by a fully committed investment from the Ellison Family and RedBird Capital Partners.” Gerry Cardinale’s RedBird Capital Partners partnered with Ellison in 2024 to buy what was then Paramount Global for about $8 billion.\n\n\tIn its release, Paramount Skydance sketched out key aspects of the deal and the assets that will be brought together, including enduring entertainment franchises “Friends” to “Star Trek” to “The Godfather” to “Casablanca” to CBS to CNN. It also made commitments in key areas that have been lightning rods as the industry has wrestled with the implications of Hollywood’s largest studio being swallowed by either Netflix or its much smaller rival Paramount Skydance.\n\n\tFor starters, Paramount vows to be a “Hollywood Champion” by maintaining both studios — though many questions remain about how they will be structured and will they have separate reporting structures. The company has committed to release a minimum of 30 movies per year in theaters.\n\n\t“We will invest in expanding the creative engines at the core of both WBD and Paramount. We will maintain both studios while prioritizing the attraction and retention of world-class creative talent, strengthening our ability to deliver a broad pipeline of high-quality content, including 15 theatrical feature films per year per studio, for our combined platforms and third-party distribution partners,” the company stated.\n\n\tParamount also reiterated its pledge to invest in and protect the exclusive theatrical window for films, which was a big source of hubbub when Netflix was poised to buy WBD. \n\n\t“Every film will receive a full theatrical release, with a minimum 45-day window globally before becoming available on paid video-on-demand (VOD), with the intention of 60-90 days or more to maximize the audience for our most successful releases,” Paramount said. \n\n\t“Both studios will continue to support a vibrant third-party ecosystem by licensing their films and shows across their own and third-party platforms, while remaining active buyers of content from third-party studios and independent producers. Following its theatrical run, each film will transition to the current industry standard home video window, preserving paid video-on-demand prior to availability on subscription streaming services. Paramount will continue to adhere to specific windowing regimes in geographies it operates in, including in France where Paramount maintains its windowing commitments,” the company said.\n\t\n\n\tIn total, the combined Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery will have a library of film more than 15,000 titles and thousands of hours of television programming.\n\n\tThe company also touted its combined sports portfolio that includes CBS’ NFL rights, Warner Bros. Discovery’s European rights to Olympics coverage, the NCAA’s March Madness basketball tournament, NHL games and UFC. Paramount said it would work to harmonize the distribution across its combined footprint, “thereby giving sports fans easier access to more of the content they want in one place.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tTed Sarandos had just wrapped up a White House meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday when Warner Bros. Discovery released a statement ",
    "body": "\n\tTed Sarandos had just wrapped up a White House meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday when Warner Bros. Discovery released a statement announcing that Paramount’s latest bid for the media company was a “superior proposal” to the one that Netflix had offered. With his deal to buy the 100-year-old film and television giant hanging in the balance, Sarandos quickly consulted with a key team of executives, which included CFO Spencer Neumann and his co-CEO Greg Peters, who had been overseeing Netflix’s bid for Warners, sources say.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the terms of its agreement to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix had four business days to equal or surpass a better offer. But the numbers didn’t lie. Paramount was now willing to pay $31 per share to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its struggling cable business. Netflix, which only wanted Warners’ studio and streaming business, did not want to dramatically enhance its bid of $27.75 per share. Sarandos didn’t see the point of dragging things out.\n\n\n\t“If you know you’re not going to match an offer on day one, why wait until day four?” a source with knowledge of the deliberations said. \n\n\tSarandos placed a call to David Zaslav, Warner Bros. Discovery’s CEO, to let him know the streamer was walking away from a pact that would have given Netflix control of a library that included everything from Harry Potter to Batman and Tony Soprano. Then Sarandos and Peters released a joint statement in which they said, “We’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.”\n\t\n\n\t“This transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price,” they added. \n\n\tAn internal email was sent out to Netflix staffers that hit similar notes; namely that the streamer didn’t want to overextend itself and would concentrate on growing organically rather than by acquisitions, as it has done for most of its nearly 30-year history. However, the brave face put on by the co-CEOs could not shade the truth that the company had been gearing up for what was likely to be a transformational acquisition — and then suddenly, it wasn’t.\n\n\t“This deal could have accelerated Netflix’s growth on top of a strong existing trajectory by attracting new subscribers, reducing churn and driving more engagement,” wrote Robert Fishman, media analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn December, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav hosted Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters on the Warner Bros. Studio lot to meet with leaders across the company.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoe Pugliese and John Nowak for Warner Bros. Discovery\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNetflix was wholeheartedly preparing for a regulatory fight to close the deal at the moment earlier this month that it agreed to WBD’s unusual request for a waiver from the merger agreement reached on Dec. 5 in order to hold negotiations with Paramount Skydance, according to an individual with knowledge of the situation. At the same time, WBD’s board was under pressure from investors and corporate watchdogs to engage with Paramount Skydance, which went from making unsolicited offers last fall to filing a lawsuit against WBD in January in an effort to force it to disclose more details about the valuation methodology used in reaching Netflix’s $27.75 per share offer. It all added up to a lot of noise. Netflix was ready to fight fire with fire — until Sarandos and Peters decided to bow out. That decision too — described by one observer as “putting shareholder value above executive ego” — is drawing praise from the investment community.\n\n\t“It signals that Netflix believes in its internal growth story enough to maintain M&A discipline. We also believe the future Paramount Skydance Warner Bros. Discovery — they’ll need a better name — could finally transform two subscale media companies into a more serious industry player, provided management has the financial flexibility to execute on its vision,” Fishman wrote.\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s new owner, David Ellison, has been relentless in his pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, working his connections on Capitol Hill, while making a spirited case that his company was offering a better deal for shareholders. This month, he and his team pulled off what many analysts and industry figures thought was impossible, forcing Warner Bros. Discovery to come back to the negotiating table.\n\n\tAnd Ellison was determined to make the most of the opportunity. While fine-tuning his pitch, he relied on a core team of trusted advisors and board members such as Safra Katz, Justin Hamill and Gerry Cardinale. Paramount’s Chief Operating Officer Andy Gordon worked closely with his investor relations group and advisor Faiza Saeed of the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Melissa Zukerman, Paramount’s chief communications officer, also was involved in the strategy sessions. Conspicuously absent from all WBD-related proceedings was Paramount president Jeff Shell, who is currently embroiled in controversy over allegations he leaked sensitive financials in CBS’ $7 billion UFC deal.\n\n\tDuring the seven-day negotiating period that ran Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, WBD and Paramount Skydance leaders never once met as a group in person. All the discussions were held via video conference calls, emails and by phone. There was an evident chill — or at least lack of chumminess — between the sides. Some of that has to do with the tangled history between the players. Paramount’s unsolicited offer to buy WBD last September set off a domino effect that forced Zaslav and his team to hold an auction for the company much sooner than they had planned. And Paramount’s desire to buy WBD’s linear cable channels derailed the plan that was in the works to spin them off into a standalone company dubbed Discovery Global.\n\n\tDespite the bad blood, a weekend of virtual talks between Paramount and WBD saw Ellison’s ninth offer sweetened from $30 per share to $31. Paramount also offered shareholders a “ticking fee” for each quarter the acquisition might be stuck in the regulatory process. It was an offer David Zaslav couldn’t refuse.\n\n\tEllison was taking meetings at Skydance’s sleek Santa Monica headquarters on Friday when word came down that the path had been cleared for Paramount to take WBD. Shortly before Netflix publicly bowed out, champagne was rolled into the executive suite at Paramount’s Melrose lot. The mood was ebullient, partly because while Netflix deemed Warner Bros. “nice to have,” Ellison always saw the studio as “must have” if he was going to realize his ambitions to create a new media leviathan.\n\t\n\n\tBut now comes the even harder part. If Paramount is able to secure regulatory approval, a process that insiders predict will take at least a year, it will have to find a way to grow the company’s streaming business while overseeing the decline of cable. And it will have to pull off that transition while servicing more than $78 billion in debt. That’s left some industry executives skeptical that Paramount will make good on its promise to increase its output of streaming programming, while making 30 theatrical film releases a year, the most of any studio by a wide margin.\n\n\tIndeed, if the WBD transaction is completed, Team Ellison will have an even steeper climb to bring the enlarged Paramount back to the summit of Hollywood. The vertical merger of Paramount and Warner Bros.’ film and TV studio operations is guaranteed to be a bloodbath of layoffs and a senior management “Game of Thrones” environment as the new regime decides who stays and who goes between Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures as well as Warner Bros. Television, CBS Studios and Paramount Television Studios, among many other imprints. The same questions loom over HBO Max and Paramount+ and the management of WBD’s large portfolio of linear cable channels that include CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Food Network and HGTV.\n\n\tGiven the behind the scenes drama that has enveloped CBS News since Ellison took over Paramount Skydance, the mood was grim at CNN after the news broke in real time Thursday. One persistent sentiment shared by staffers from various divisions of WBD was what one studio insider described as “complete and total fucking merger fatigue.”\n\n\tIf completed, the Paramount transaction will mark the third time that Warner Bros., HBO, CNN, TNT and other channels have been sold to new owners just since 2018, when AT&T sealed its purchase of Time Warner, after winning an antitrust trial in the first Trump administration. That was followed in 2022 by the WarnerMedia merger with Zaslav’s Discovery Inc. In both cases, WB and HBO endured a long period of limbo while legal and regulatory processes ensued. And all of that has unfolded under the backdrop of massive disruption across the entertainment business.\n\n\tWBD troops were bracing for another long merger slog regardless. But as the tables turned quickly on Thursday afternoon, many rank and file staffers expressed regret that the studio would not be hitched to the industry’s dominant subscription streaming platform but rather to a smaller, struggling rival legacy media conglomerate. There is great skepticism about Ellison’s ability to make the high-wire act work while Paramount Skydance shoulders a mountain of debt supplied by a consortium that includes Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds.\n\t\n\n\t“Debt is debt,” says Rick Morris, a professor at Northwestern University’s School of Communication. “Debt will stop them from taking new initiatives, from investing in content, and it’ll take a period of time to work off. And many companies fail at working off the debt, and that is part of the reason that Warner Bros. is for sale.”\n\n\tThere is little doubt that Paramount Skydance will make massive cuts to WBD operations for the sake of de-leveraging the balance sheet. If all goes as planned, the company will carry a debt ratio of nearly 7 times its annual earnings — a huge red flag for credit agencies and many investors. Paramount has pledged to swiftly cut its debt-to-earnings ratio down to 4.4 times earnings, which means finding billions of dollars in cost savings from the jump. The WBD transaction is backed up to an unprecedented degree by a guarantee made by Larry Ellison against his personal fortune, buoyed by shares in Oracle, the software giant that he co-founded in 1977 when computing was in its infancy. Larry Ellison is also on the hook to invest many more billions should the enlarged Paramount Skydance struggle to maintain enough cash flow to support operations.\n\n\tLaurent Yoon, media analyst with Bernstein, sees WBD as a necessity for Paramount but one that will not be easy on the rank and file tasked with running the businesses.\n\n\t“Overpaying for WBD to accelerate growth is perhaps better than facing a mediocre standalone trajectory — at least this gives [Paramount] a shot at greatness, in our view.. But we do not expect them to come out swinging too hard,” Yoon wrote in a Feb. 26 research note. “Before they can invest in growth, they’ll need to cut deep and fast, and allocate most of their free cash flow to interest expense and de-levering. This is effectively the same position WBD was in from ‘22 (post-merger) through ‘25, a period that constrained growth despite having quality studios and IPs.”\n\n\tIn the Netflix-WBD merger scenario, filmmakers were concerned about Netflix’s commitment to the theatrical business, noting that Sarandos had earlier dismissed cinemas as “outdated.” That left them skeptical of the company’s promises that it would continue to release Warners films on the big screen and honor traditional home entertainment windows. Paramount, in contrast, has loudly argued that it is the true defender of the cinematic experience and has promised to increase the number of films that the combined studios will release in theaters.\n\t\n\n\tYet having Paramount own Warners Bros. Discovery has raised other concerns for artists, some of whom worry that Ellison’s coziness with the Trump administration will stifle free expression. They’ve been alarmed by his moves at CBS News, where he has installed Bari Weiss, a conservative columnist best known for her anti-woke jeremiads, as editor-in-chief. It’s expected that Weiss will have a big role in steering CNN down the road.\n\n\t“Ellison scares the shit out of me,” says one A-list director. “Are the movies they put out going to be catered to Trump’s taste? Are they going to start cracking down on content that they don’t find to be ideologically aligned with the right?” \n\n\tEllison has earned that skepticism. In his aggressive pursuit of WBD, he has not been shy about flexing his family’s wealth (his father Larry Ellison is one of the world’s richest men) and connections to President Donald Trump. In lobbying publicly and privately for Paramount’s unsolicited WBD bids, Team Ellison sought to amp up concerns about Netflix exerting monopoly power over the streaming pay TV marketplace and having the ability to dictate pricing and deal terms for Hollywood’s creative community. The Ellisons also made their case to regulators in the U.K. and European Union, which have a track record of tougher enforcement of antitrust and concentration issues. David Ellison went so far as to attend Trump’s State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday as a guest of Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key confidant of the president. One observer compared Ellison’s trek to the Capitol earlier this week to the row of tech leaders who attended Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 — an image that has become symbolic of the fact that big business and moguls — the likes of Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook — are kowtowing to Trump’s authoritarian style of leadership.\n\n\t“This process speaks volumes,” says J. Christopher Hamilton, a professor of Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications and an attorney. “Companies don’t have to go behind the scenes any longer to court lawmakers and this administration doesn’t feel like it has to be subtle about who it wants to reward and who it prefers to own businesses.”\n\n\tNetflix’s Sarandos also invested in personally lobbying political leaders on the merits of the deal. He endured a two-hour grilling in the Senate at a hearing on Feb. 4 that demonstrated the depth of the fight that Netflix would face. In addition to federal pressure, state attorneys general are lining up to launch their own local probes into the transaction. Now they will focus more on vertical-merger issues for two companies with mostly overlapping operations versus the specter of monopoly power — a loaded term that raised the stakes for Netflix no matter how many times Sarandos pointed to independent Nielsen audience data showing that even combining the streaming service with HBO did not rise to the level of what is traditionally considered to be a monopoly-level of market share.\n\t\n\n\tOn Friday, as Netflix staffers digested all the news, more than a few executives expressed the feeling that the streamer may have dodged a bullet. And for their troubles, Paramount Skydance will pay them the $2.8 billion breakup fee that Netflix negotiated in the agreement it inked with WBD’s board on Dec. 5.\n\n\t“I think there’s a sense of relief on the Netflix side that we came close to getting it, and now we have an out and we got paid for the time we spent doing it. There’s some disappointment in not getting what you want and a relief that you didn’t get it,” said a senior entertainment lawyer with knowledge of the situation.\n\n\tNow, as the town’s attention shifts from the bidding war to what is likely to be a war of attrition, there are fears that the union of Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures will result in one fewer buyer of films — and that WB will be hamstrung on dealmaking and big long-term swings while it waits for the sale to close. Already, filmmakers say that it’s taking longer for them to get an answer from the studio on the status of their projects, noting that the company is wary of committing too much money to new films when a different ownership team is waiting in the wings.\n\n\tEllison’s politics have alarmed many in left-leaning Hollywood, but some people are impressed with the executive team he has installed at Paramount. Josh Greenstein, who was brought over from Sony Pictures to help oversee the film studio with Dana Goldberg, has earned high marks for making tough calls on film projects, while urging the studio to land splashy projects from the likes of James Mangold and Timothée Chalamet.\n\n\t“Josh is the real deal,” says one media executive who has worked with him. “He is a straight shooter. And in a matter of months he’s stocked a cupboard that was bare.” \n\n\tAt the same time, Warner Bros. Pictures has been on an unprecedented roll at the box office since the second half of 2025, after enduring some painful flops in 2024 and early in 2025. To many, it feels as though just as WB Pictures chiefs Pam Abdy and Michael De Luca were hitting their stride with commercial and critical successes — the studio’s “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another” are this year’s top film award season contenders — the executive turnstiles are about to swing once again.\n\t\n\n\t“If they’re smart, they’ll keep Mike and Pam,” says the media executive. “But there’s only so much executive power to go around. Decisions will need to be made.” \n\n\tFor Paramount, the road ahead will be paved with key management and strategic decisions, as well as a herculean effort to revitalize two media giants that have often struggled to navigate the streaming era. Up the road from Paramount’s Melrose lot in Hollywood, Netflix brass also face momentous decisions about their future. But first they’ll need to figure out what to do with the $2.8 billion check that Paramount wrote them on Friday. Think of it as a dowry that a jilted suitor gets to keep.\n\n\tMatt Donnelly and Todd Longwell contributed to this report. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for “Under Salt Marsh,” which had its season finale on Friday.\n\n\t“Under Salt Marsh” is one of Sky Atlantic’s biggest non-HBO drama pushes in recent years. The original six-part series (Sky has yet to confirm where it’ll land in the U.S.) stars “Yellowstone’s” Kelly Reilly as Jackie, a detective turned teacher with an unfinished case that comes back from the dead when, late one night after a secret tryst, she stumbles across the lifeless body of one of her pupils in a ditch. Soon, it’s confirmed that he’s been murdered, making him the second child to die in the small Welsh community of Morfa Halen in three years. With a storm threatening to destroy vital evidence – as well as the coastal village itself — Jackie teams up with her old police partner, Detective Eric Bull (Rafe Spall), to try and find the killer.\n\t\n\n\tAhead of the season finale on Feb. 27, Claire Oakley, who created, co-wrote and co-directed the series, sat down with Variety to talk about her inspiration for “Under Salt Marsh,” if Mac was always going to be the killer and whether audiences will see Jackie and Bull team up again for a second season.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhere did the idea for the show originate?\t\n\n\tI really wanted to set something [in North Wales], because I’d really fallen in love with the area, and particularly the salt marshes. They’re such a rare and unique environment.\n\n\tAnd I came up with the idea that if we had a detective series, then we could get really into the fine detail of these marshes, and suddenly the ecology and the salt content in the water and all of these little things would become really vital.\n\t\n\n\tThis is a bit conceptual, but the salt marshes protect us. They protect us from the sea level rise from the storms. So they’re very important if we want to continue living here, because our island is getting smaller. And so [there as] this idea of protection and “What if we don’t protect the things that we need to?” What if we don’t protect the future generations against potential horrors? I started to think about the plot in that way, like, how would this detective story, this murder mystery, reflect that idea?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClaire Oakley and Kelly Reilly on the set of “Under Salt Marsh” (Courtesy of Sky Atlantic)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne early scene a lot of viewers have discussed is in Episode 1, when Jackie insists on telling Cefin’s parents about his death rather than letting the police do it. Why did you make that choice?\t\n\n\tI liked the idea that Jackie is often acting on instinct and that is probably what made her ultimately leave the police and perhaps not be the best type of person to join the force. In some ways, she’s a very good detective. In other ways […] she can’t cope when things get personal. And I wanted to put her in a position early on where, as a human being, maybe she felt it was right that she had to tell the parents as soon as she could, they were going to be the first people that she would go to and she wasn’t going to wait for the police, who, in this particular community, might take quite a long time to get there. But as it’s happening, [she’s] realizing, like, “oh […] it’s kind of a very irresponsible thing to do.” I was interested in these moments where she’s not responsible, but she’s responsible emotionally, on a human level. \n\n\tI also really liked in that scene the idea that she turns up covered in mud and shell-shocked and pale and obviously in distress. And their response to her is like, maybe that’s not abnormal [for Jackie]. Like, “We thought you were doing well, Jackie. Sit down and I’ll call your dad.” It was a way to understand that she had a complicated past.\n\t\n\t\tViewers have also been remarking on Jackie’s big age gap relationship with Dylan (played by Harry Lawtey). Was that written into the script or was it a result of casting Lawtey?\t\n\n\tIt was written in. I felt that [worked] for Jackie, the idea of a younger boyfriend who might not demand from her all the things that someone her own age might demand — Like, are we going to move in together? What’s going to happen? Is this a real relationship?\n\t\n\n\tShe could get love and passion and sex from this person, while also not having to give much of herself and not have to take responsibility in that way.\n\t\n\t\tWas there a particular intention behind making Jackie pregnant?\t\n\n\tI liked this idea that she’s stuck in the past. She can’t move on until she finds out what happened to Nessa — a little bit like the whole community, they’re already eroded by this awful thing that has happened — but she, in particular, can’t. On the surface she’s got a new job, she’s got a new career, she’s doing it. But the pregnancy allowed me to suggest that all is not quite well. If you are happy and you feel steady about your future, there’s no reason not to tell your boyfriend that you’re pregnant or really anyone else.\n\n\tI was actually also pregnant as I was writing it, so that almost certainly gave me some insight.\n\t\n\t\tIn Episode 6 where the storm has hit the village and Jackie is chasing after Dylan, there’s a huge wave that hits his car. How did you create that scene?\t\n\n\tWe built the whole center of the village. The chip shop, the butcher and that whole T-junction, where that wave occurs, is all a set in Dragon Studios in Cardiff. It was all built outside on the back lot of the studios, and we had to create this special concrete pad that had to take the weight of all of the set and also the water.\n\n\tWe had a first level of water. When Jackie and Dylan are there, it’s kind of knee-high. The cars can still drive through it. So that was the first level of water and we were working in that water. It was January. There were like 1,000 conversations about, “What if the water freezes?”\n\n\tBut we couldn’t heat the water because then it starts to steam. Then there were endless conversations about, “How long could someone — either a member of the cast or crew — be stood in this almost freezing water at a time? Were we going to be able to shoot a 6-page dialogue scene?”\n\n\tAnd then that wave. We had this huge kind of slide, essentially, with massive buckets of water at the top on cranes, and we tipped them down, and so they shot out across. The car was rigged on a winch. So as the water came, we winched the car backwards, because the water was never going to be powerful enough to move the car in reality.\n\n\tA lot of what you see was done in camera but then the water was augmented to be slightly bigger — so that we could believe it would push the car — in VFX.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRafe Spall as Detective Eric Bull in “Under Salt Marsh” (Courtesy of Sky Atlantic)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd what about the scene when Mac has locked Bull in the room, which is flooding with water, until James [Osian Emlyn] stumbles across him and lets him out?\t\n\n\tThat was actually two different sets. Inside the room, when it’s filling with water, we had a hydraulic set that was a three-sided room on a hydraulic platform that went up and down in a tank in like a big swimming pool. So as it’s filling with water, we’re just slowly lowering the set into the water as Bull does his take.\n\n\tThere was no door in that set. So the opening of the door was in another set that we built where it was the outside of the room, that kind of corridor-y bit and the stairs. And when [James] opened the door, in real life we had a stunt person.\n\t\n\t\tWas Mac always going to be the murderer?\t\n\n\tNot really, no. I was commissioned by Little Door to write the pilot, and that was before we took it to Sky.I hadn’t planned out the whole series. I think I had a brief outline […] and that these were the things I wanted to explore with the killer and it needed to be linked to the environmental reasons why he did it or she did it. But I didn’t have anyone pinpointed. And then Sky came on board and they wanted a second episode written before they decided on whether to greenlight it or not.\n\n\tWe did a small writers’ room. It was me and Jonathan Harbottle, who came on board to write Eps 3 and 5 at that point, and we sketched out just the first half, so the next two episodes, so Eps 2 and 3 together, and then I went away and wrote Ep 2, and we still didn’t know who the killer was. We still hadn’t addressed the second half of the series. And so I wrote Ep 2, had [my] baby, we got greenlit, John wrote Ep 3, and then we realized we had to figure out the second half of the series. And so we did another writers’ room, and that’s when Nikita Lalwani came on board, who wrote Ep 4. We did it in my sister’s house, she lives one street away from me, so that I could be brought the baby to breastfeed every three hours while we were doing the room. And I think we did 8 days and we planned out the second half of the series.\n\n\tIt wasn’t ideal, in a way. In some ways it meant it happened very organically, the story. In other ways, it made things hard, because we’d already had three eps written without really knowing the ending.\n\t\n\n\tYou then have to go back to the beginning, and re-work things in and feed things in. Like, we knew with Mac, once we’d settled on him, then it’s about protecting your reveal but when he’s finally revealed, I didn’t want people to say, like, “What the fuck?” I want people to say, “Of course, holy shit, it’s him. How do I not see that?” So it needs to add up and not be too wacky.\n\t\n\t\tWhen you have a story about two kids being murdered, there’s the possibility it’s sexually motivated. But Nessa and Cefin are both killed – directly or indirectly – because of the toxic waste. Did you ever consider giving Mac a different motivation?\t\n\n\tNo, I definitely didn’t want to explore a sexually motivated crime, or even a crime of passion or a psychopath or those sorts of things. I was interested in exploring the idea that someone “normal,” if any of us were in that specific situation, we may have done the same thing. That it was just someone who was under a huge amount of pressure, whose idea of life had become skewed because of that. And it was a bit of a self-protection; he ultimately kills those children in order to protect his reputation and his status in the community and what he feels he’s doing for good. He’s building this seawall, he’s protecting this community, but at what cost? “But at what cost are we doing these things?” was the idea that I was trying to dig into. So I wanted the crime and the killer to represent those themes right from the beginning.\n\t\n\t\tIs there a likelihood we’ll see Jackie and Bull reunite for a second season?\t\n\n\tWe’re exploring what a second season might look like. We’re looking at different options of how we could take it forward, if it got commissioned.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for space and clarity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNeil Sedaka, legendary singer-songwriter behind hits like “Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,” “Bad Blood,” “Laughter in the Rain” and “Calendar Girl,” has died, a rep confirms to Variety. He was 86.\n\n\t“Our family is devastated by the sudden passing of our beloved husband, father and grandfather, Neil Sedaka,” a statement from the family reads. “A true rock and roll legend, an inspiration to millions, but most importantly, at least to those of us who were lucky enough to know him, an incredible human being who will be deeply missed.”\n\t\n\n\tA Brooklyn native and a veteran of the legendary “Brill Building” hit factory of the early ’60s, Sedaka scored three No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and nine in the Top 10, primarily during his peak years in the early 1960s and a mid-’70s comeback assisted by Elton John (who performed with him on the 1975 No. 1 “Bad Blood”).\n\n\n\tSedaka also wrote many songs that were hits for other artists, most notably Connie Francis’ 1958 hit “Stupid Cupid” and, 17 years later, the Captain and Tennille’s breakthrough chart-topper “Love Will Keep Us Together.” He continued to tour and record for many years after his commercial peak. \n\n\tOver the course of his six-decade-plus career, Sedaka was nominated for five Grammy awards (including one at the second-ever edition of the show in 1959). In 1983, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and in 1978 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \n\n\t“This is a gift I was born with,” Sedaka wrote on his website. “My main objective is to always top the last collection, raise the bar and reinvent Neil Sedaka.” \n\t\n\n\tA member of the same Brooklyn generation that produced Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond, Carole King and many others, Sedaka was born on March 13, 1939 and grew up in the borough’s Brighton Beach neighborhood. He showed early musical aptitude and his second-grade teacher recommended piano lessons; within a couple of years he had successfully auditioned for a scholarship to the Juilliard School of Music’s Preparatory Division for Children, and continued at Julliard through his teens. \n\n\tWhile he initially pursued classical music, he was bitten by the pop music bug as a teen. At the age of 13, a neighbor heard him playing piano and introduced him to her son, Howard Greenfield, who was three years older. However, the pair began a songwriting partnership that was to take them to the top of the pop charts multiple times over the following 25 years.  \n\n\tSedaka began performing during his years at Abraham Lincoln High School, and after graduating he formed a doo-wop group with classmates called the Linc-Tones, named after the school. The group released several singles that were local hits before Sedaka left in 1957 to launch a solo career; the Linc-Tones evolved into the Tokens, who scored a global smash in 1961 with “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”\n\n\tBut by that time Sedaka and Greenfield were staples of the Brill Building, along with Diamond, King, Ellie Greenwich, Jeff Barry, Cynthia Weil, Barry Mann and many others. He and Greenfield scored their first hit with Francis and “Stupid Cupid,” who followed with another song from the duo, “Where the Boys Are,” which would be her biggest hit.\n\n\tSedaka parlayed that success into a solo deal with the RCA Victor label, and soon had hits of his own with “The Diary,” “Oh! Carol” (written for Carole King — the pair had dated in high school — who followed with “Oh! Neil”), ” Stairway to Heaven,” “Calendar Girl,” “Little Devil,” “Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen,” “Next Door To An Angel,” “Breaking Up Is Hard To Do” and others.\n\n\tHowever, the advent of the Beatles and the British Invasion signaled a major change in pop culture, and Sedaka sidelined his solo career and focused on songwriting. He and Greenfield wrote hits for Frank Sinatra (“The Hungry Years”), Elvis Presley (“Solitaire”), Tom Jones (“Puppet Man”), the Monkees (“When Love Comes Knocking At Your Door”), the Fifth Dimension (“Workin’ on a Groovy Thing”) and others.\n\t\n\n\tIn 1969, with his career at a low ebb, Sedaka found unexpected success in Australia, where his song “Star-Crossed Lovers” became a major hit. The success gave his career a boost and the title track of his 1972 album “Solitaire” — a collaboration with lyricist Phil Cody — was covered and turned into a hit by both the Carpenters and Andy Williams. The album was a success in the U.K., and a track from it, “Beautiful You,” was Sedaka’s first solo chart appearance in the U.S. in a decade.\n\n\tHe continued working in the U.K. and marked a cap on his long collaboration with Greenfield with the 1973 album “The Tra-La Days Are Over,” which significantly included his version of “Love Will Keep Us Together.” Also around this time, he and Cody were enlisted to write English lyrics for a new Swedish quartet calling themselves Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid. The song became “Ring Ring,” a major hit in Europe and the first of many smashes for the group that was quickly rechristened ABBA. \n\n\tIn 1973, Sedaka met longtime fan Elton John at a party in London, and he soon signed with the superstar’s new record label, Rocket. This played no small role in the resurgence of Sedaka’s career. Several of his recent songs were compiled into an album titled “Sedaka’s Back,” released late in 1974, and just months later he had his first U.S. No. 1 in nearly 13 years with “Laughter in the Rain.” The success of the Captain & Tennille’s version of “Love Will Keep Us Together” followed in short order, and suddenly Sedaka was a major star again. \n\n\tA second album on Rocket, “The Hungry Years,” followed, and featured another No. 1 single in  1975 with “Bad Blood,” which included an uncredited Elton John on harmony vocals. He scored another Top 10 hit the following year with a slowed-down remake of his early hit “Breaking Up Is Hard to Do.”  \n\n\tHe recorded just one more album for Rocket as he and Elton John became estranged, but they mended the fence years later and John wrote the forward to Sedaka’s 2013 biography. \n\n\tSedaka moved over to Elektra Records and scored one final Top 40 hit with “Never Should Have Let You Go,” a duet with his daughter Dara, in 1980. \n\n\tHe continued performing and releasing music, and saw an unexpected comeback in 2003 when “American Idol” candidate Clay Aiken performed “Solitaire” on the show, releasing it as a single and scoring a hit. Sedaka appeared as a guest judge on the show and returned several times; Aiken recorded and released several more of his songs as well.  \n\t\n\n\tIn October of 2007, a concert at New York’s Lincoln Center was staged in honor of the 50th anniversary of Sedaka’s debut in show business. Guests included the Captain and Tennille, Natalie Cole, Connie Francis and Aiken, among others. \n\n\tIn 2022 Sedaka officially retired from songwriting, and sold his song catalog to Primary Wave Music two years later.  \n\n\tSedaka is survived by his wife, Leba Strassberg, whom he married in 1962, and his two children, Marc and Dara. \n",

Either way, today is certainly adding fire to Pizzagate conspiracy theory.\n      \n    \n          The former POTUS is being deposed in Upstate New York in connection to his relationship with the deceased convicted sex offender ... and, around 12:30 PM ET, a group of aides walked into the building with a fat stack of pizzas.\n      \n    \n          No one should have to testify about their alleged ties to a pedophile on an empty stomach ... and, it seems the pizzas were a hit, because around 1 PM a person brought out just a few boxes.\n      \n\n          Now the real question ... Was it the Democratic members, or the Republicans reps, or Clinton himself who called for the pies? Remember Hillary Clinton said yesterday during her deposition that an unnamed member of the House Oversight Committee asked her about Pizzagate -- which she referred to as \"one of the most vile, bogus conspiracy theories.\"\n      \n    \n                    \n                          \n                                  \n      \n        \n    \n          If you forgot ... Pizzagate is a conspiracy theory that originated during the 2016 presidential campaign which alleged high-ranking Democrats were running a child sex-trafficking ring out of a local shop in D.C. It was debunked by the FBI, but it created another distraction for Hillary during her presidential campaign.\n      \n    \n          So is this a cruel joke by Republicans or an honest to goodness effort to get some grub ... you tell us!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jeffrey Epstein\n              \n                          \n                Bill Clinton\n              \n                          \n                Hillary Clinton\n              \n                          \n                Epstein Files\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Culture\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

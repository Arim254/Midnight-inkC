    "body": "\n\tSony Music Taiwan has boarded India-Taiwan co-production “Demon Hunters” as global music distributor, marking a significant commercial partnership as the action-fantasy feature prepares for its international rollout.\n\n\tThe film is directed by Chen Mei-Juin (“The Gangster’s Daughter”) and produced by Light House Productions (Taiwan) and Kleos Entertainment Group (India).\n\n\tThe plot follows an unconventional partnership between a Taiwanese paranormal YouTuber and an Indian tech engineer who must join forces to combat a supernatural threat endangering both their worlds.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast is headlined by India’s Arjan Bajwa (Prime Video series “Bestseller”) and Taiwan’s J.C. Lin (“Breaking and Re-entering”) and also includes Regina Lei (“Antikalpa”), Jack Kao (“Seven Killings”) and Harry Chan (“A Boy and a Girl”). The DoP is Hong Kong veteran Tony Cheung (“Hidden Strike”).\n\n\tThe deal grants Sony Music Taiwan worldwide distribution rights for the film’s original soundtrack, encompassing score, theme music and promotional tracks across major global and regional digital platforms. The partnership integrates the project into Sony Music’s international distribution network, extending its reach throughout Asia and global markets.\n\n\tProduced by Taiwan’s Light House Productions in collaboration with India’s Kleos Entertainment Group, “Demon Hunters” represents a rare India-Taiwan feature film partnership. \n\n\tThe multilingual soundtrack incorporates Taiwanese and Hindi musical elements alongside original score compositions crafted for cross-market appeal.\n\t\n\n\t“Music is a central narrative and commercial component of ‘Demon Hunters.’ Partnering with Sony Music Taiwan gives the project a strong global platform and the distribution scale needed to support its international ambitions,” said Cindy Shyu, producer at Light House Productions.\n\n\tGayathiri Guliani, producer at Kleos Entertainment Group, added: “As an India-Taiwan collaboration, it was important for us to align with a partner that understands both regional nuance and global market dynamics. Sony Music Taiwan brings that capability and reach to the film’s music strategy.”\n\n\tThe soundtrack will be available across platforms including Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, KKBOX and JOOX.\n\n\tVieshow Pictures will distribute “Demon Hunters” theatrically in Taiwan on Dec. 31, followed by a wider international release.\n\n\tSony Music Taiwan operates as part of Sony Music Entertainment, the global recorded music company with operations spanning artist development, catalog management and international distribution.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlan Cumming is to host the 2026 EE BAFTA Film Awards, a move that’ll likely see the star bring some of his flamboyant tartan outfits from “The Traitors” to London’s Royal Festival Hall on Feb. 22. \n\n\tCumming — an actor, writer and producer whose career has spanned stage, film and television on both sides of the Atlantic, earning him Emmy, Golden Globe, Olivier and Tony awards (plus a BAFTA Scotland honor for outstanding contribution) — takes over from fellow Scot David Tennant, who was on hosting duties in both 2024 and 2025. \n\t\n\n\tEarlier this year, Cumming hosted the BAFTA TV Awards and he has overseen numerous awards shows in the U.S.. But this marks his first time hosting the U.K.’s biggest night in film.\n\n\n\t“How exciting to be back in the BAFTA fold, this time hosting the EE BAFTA Film Awards, a night like no other when we celebrate and honour creativity and craftsmanship — and also hopefully have a laugh and create some mischief as we do so!,” said Cumming in a statement. \n\n\tCumming’s selection continues BAFTA’s recent tradition of choosing hosts who can balance irreverence with reverence, as the ceremony seeks to maintain its prestige while remaining accessible to a global audience. Last year’s broadcast of the awads on BBC One attracted an average of 3 million viewers alongside more than 64 million video views across BAFTA’s social platforms.\n\n\t“With his sharp wit, warmth and vibrant energy, we are beyond excited that Alan Cumming will be hosting this year’s EE BAFTA Film Awards,” said BAFTA’s executive director of awards and content, Emma Baehr. “As we honour the outstanding talent in film that brings stories to life on screen, we know that Alan will give us an unforgettable night full of laughter, magic and plenty of surprises, and maybe some extraordinary outfits!”\n\t\n\n\tAcross a career spanning 40 years, Cumming’s own film credits include the likes of “GoldenEye,” “X2: X-Men United,” “Eyes Wide Shut” and “Emma,” while he’ll soon appear in “Avengers Doomsday.” On TV, he won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for “The Good Wife,” while he’s recently been enjoying a renewed moment of pop-culture prominence following the success of the U.S. edition of “The Traitors.” As host and executive producer of the hit reality show, he’s won four Emmys and two Critics’ Choice awards.\n\n\tRound one of voting for the BAFTA film awards opened on Dec. 5, with the longlists due to be unveiled Jan 9. and nominations to follow on Jan. 27. \n",

    "body": "\n\tNepal‘s inaugural science fiction feature film is headed to theaters, with “Eklo I” securing distribution in both its home country and North America.\n\n\tApple Entertainment has acquired the film for release in Nepal on Jan. 1, with a limited theatrical rollout in the U.S. and U.K. following on Jan. 9. The film will world premiere Dec. 28 at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image.\n\n\tJamie Bacon, whose recent credits include “Mr. Loverman” and “Dreamers,” stars opposite Nepali actor Pradeep Khadka, known for local hits “Kabaddi 4,” “Prem Geet 3” and “Prakash.” Bacon is next set to appear in Dan Fogelman’s upcoming NFL drama series for Hulu.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Pradeep Shahi, “Eklo I” represents a significant milestone for Nepali cinema as the country’s first science fiction feature. The production filmed at elevations reaching 5,400 meters in the Himalayas – approximately 500 meters below Everest Base Camp – capturing previously unfilmed regions of the mountain range.\n\n\n\tSet in 2090 in the aftermath of a 2030 global pandemic, the story follows astronauts returning to Earth who discover a lone survivor and mysterious guardians concealed in Himalayan caves. The Nepali word ‘eklo’ translates as ‘alone’ in English.\n\n\t“This film pushed us to the limit,” Bacon said. “The locations, the altitude – nothing compares. What the Nepali crew achieved was extraordinary.”\n\n\tThe cast also features Kabita Nepali and Vijay Lama, known for “Everest.”\n\n\tDirector Shahi described the project as blending Western and Nepali storytelling influences, marking new territory for the country’s film industry.\n\t\n\n\tApple Entertainment has been expanding its international distribution slate, recently handling releases including “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” \n\n\tBacon is represented by Link Entertainment and United Agents.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDanish Khan, business head of streaming platform SonyLIV and production unit Studio NXT, will depart Sony Pictures Networks India at the end of March 2026 after a decade in his current tenure with the company.\n\n\tKhan will remain in his role through March 31 to ensure business continuity, SPNI revealed Thursday. His departure marks the end of a 20-year relationship with the company across two separate stints.\n\n\n\tDuring his five-year tenure leading SonyLIV since 2019, Khan oversaw the platform’s comprehensive relaunch as SonyLIV 2.0 and drove significant expansion of the digital business. Under his leadership, the streaming service achieved more than five-fold revenue growth and quadrupled its monthly active user base, while contributing nearly 25% of SPNI’s overall revenue. The platform delivered series including “Scam,” “Maharani,” “Rocket Boys,” “Freedom at Midnight,” “Tabbar” and “Shark Tank.”\n\t\n\n\tKhan previously served as business head for Sony Entertainment Television, where he oversaw the creation of non-fiction properties including “The Kapil Sharma Show,” “Kaun Banega Crorepati,” “Super Dancer” and “Superstar Singer,” as well as fiction series such as “Yeh Un Dinon Ki Baat Hai,” “Ek Duje Ke Vaaste,” “Kuch Rang Pyaar Ke Aise Bhi,” “Beyhadh” and “Patiala Babes.”\n\n\tHe also established Studio NXT, which produced “Shark Tank,” “Freedom at Midnight” and “Kaun Banega Crorepati.”\n\n\t“Danish has been a key part of SPNI’s growth journey over the years, contributing across television, studio and digital businesses,” said Gaurav Banerjee, MD and CEO of Sony Pictures Networks India. “We thank him for his leadership and the strong foundation he leaves behind, and wish him the very best for the future.”\n\t\n\n\tKhan said in a statement: “Sony Pictures Networks India has been an incredibly important part of my professional journey. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work with some exceptional teams and leaders, and to be part of building businesses and brands that truly matter. As I transition to the next chapter, I remain deeply grateful for the trust, support and shared ambition that defined my time here, and I wish the teams at SonyLIV and Studio NXT continued success in the years ahead.”\n\n\tSPNI said it will announce succession plans at a later date.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe trailer for “Supporting Role,” the second feature from Georgian writer-director Ana Urushadze, has debuted ahead of the film’s world premiere in the Tiger Competition of International Film Festival Rotterdam next month.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe film follows on from the success of Urushadze’s 2017 debut “Scary Mother,” which premiered and won best first feature at Locarno Film Festival before going on to pick up the top prize in Sarajevo. It was nominated for the European Film Academy’s Discovery Award and was Georgia’s entry for the 90th Academy Awards.\n\t\n\n\tThe story of “Supporting Role” follows a once-famous star of Georgian cinema, who – triggered by a casting session with a young female director – embarks on a bizarre and fatalistic odyssey of self-transformation. Accustomed to playing charming heroic protagonists, he is insulted by the offer of a supporting role. But gradually, without realizing it himself, he starts getting into character and seemingly unconsciously accepts the role he has been offered to play.\n\n\n\tThe film stars Dato Bakhtadze, alongside Nata Murvanidze, who led “Scary Mother,” winning best performance at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Davit Tsintsadze of Georgia’s Zazafilms, Ivo Felt of Allfilm in Estonia, Zeynep Atakan of Zeyno Film in Turkey, Andrey Epifanov of Cinetrain in Switzerland, Eleonora Granata Jenkinson of Melograno Films in U.S., and Sophio Bedenashvili and Bacho Meburishvili of Enkeny Films and Bakhtadze in Georgia. \n\n\tThe film was shot on location in Georgia by Estonian cinematographer Rein Kotov. Funding came from the Georgian National Film Center, Estonian Film Institute, Estonian Cultural Endowment, MEDIA Programme of Creative Europe, Eurimages and Cinetrain.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Wednesday, December 17 finale of “Survivor” Season 49.\n\n\tIt’s officially “Survivor” 50 season! The first trailer for “In the Hands of the Fans,” the upcoming season featuring some of the best to ever play the game, debuted on Wednesday night following the end of Season 49.\n\n\tThe trailer begins in slow motion, showing some of the best players of all time from “Survivor” boarding a private plane for the epic 50th season. Some are quite recognizable even without showing their faces — like Ozzy Lusth and Jonathan Young. The first face shown is Colby Donaldson.\n\t\n\n\tProbst tells the former players, “We chose you to represent 25 years of the greatest adventure on televison. It’s a big honor, and the only thing we want in exchange for giving you the spot… is everything.”\n\n\n\tMike White has the best teaser (of course!), adding, “It feels a little like a high school reunion meets massacre.”\n\n\tThere’s also some surprise guests — Zac Brown and Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson pop up in the trailer, with Beast carrying his famous briefcase. Plus, his coin, encrusted with “Beast Games” and “Survivor,” can be seen earlier in the video. There’s also “a Billie Eilish boomerang idol” mixed in, Rick Devens reveals, and Christian Hubicki adds, “Jimmy Fallon may decide my fate in this game.” The two Season 49 players are revealed to be finalists Savannah Louie and Rizo Velovic. \n\n\tAlthough the most exciting part may be the fact that Probst is shown seemingly competing in the trailer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBefore the trailer aired, Season 49 came to a dramatic end; first Savannah became the fifth woman to win four individual immunity challenges in one season, beating the finalists Sage Ahrens-Nichols, Sophi Balerdi, Kristina Mills and Rizo in the second-to-last immunity challenge. She chose to bring Sophi with her to the sanctuary.\n\t\n\n\tSophi took home the last (and her first!) necklace next and, despite having a final three deal with Rizo and Savannah, she didn’t want to have any discussions with anyone and told everyone to practice fire. Savannah was upset; and Rizo said he wanted Savannah if he was making fire. Ultimately, Sophi chose to bring Sage to the end. Ultimately, Savannah beat Rizo in the fire-making challenge, then beat both Sophi and Sage and was awarded the $1 million prize.\n\n\tIt’s important to note that this marked only the third time the show has had a final three made up of only women — and it’s been 20 seasons since it last happened. \n\n\t“Survivor” 50 debuts on CBS Wednesday, Feb. 25, at 8 p.m. ET. To celebrate the season, CBS will air past epsiodes from across the series’ history, Monday through Friday, beginning Feb. 9.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the future of the studio hangs in the balance, Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix leaders put on a show of force Wednesday afternoon when Netflix brass paid a visit to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, where WBD chief executive David Zaslav gave them a guided tour.\n\n\tWBD released photos to media outlets late Wednesday that show Zaslav strolling the famed studio lot with Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, who are co-CEOs of the streaming giant. \n\t\n\n\t“Today, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav welcomed Netflix Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters to the historic Warner Bros. Studio lot in Burbank to meet with leaders across the company,” according to the caption that accompanied the photos.\n\n\n\tSarandos and Peters held a conversation on stage with Zaslav at the studio’s Steven J. Ross Theater in front of about 400 Warner Bros. employees. They fielded some questions from staffers.\n\n\tThe Netflix pair’s trek to Burbank came on the same day the WBD board reaffirmed its decision to sell Warner Bros. and HBO to Netflix and once again rejected the latest offer from Paramount Skydance. The fight over the fate of Warner Bros. blew wide open earlier this month when Paramount went public with its effort to amass control of the company through a tender offer to shareholders. WBD, meanwhile, clinched an agreement on Dec. 5 with Netflix that values the company’s key assets — Warner Bros. and HBO — at $82.7 billion.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNetflix’s Ted Sarandos, center, and Greg Peters, second from right, meet with Warner Bros. employees at the studio’s Steven J. Ross Theater.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tParamount’s aggressive overtures in September and October put Warner Bros. Discovery in play. Netflix swooped in with a cash-and-stock bid that has won over the WBD board of directors. Paramount is offering all cash for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including the company’s linear cable channels, while Netflix is only buying WB and HBO. Paramount asserts that its offer is better for WBD shareholders because it is for the company in total. Paramount has warned that Netflix will struggle to secure regulatory approval for such a big transaction because of its dominant position in subscription streaming.\n\t\n\n\tWBD has countered that it has concerns about the source of the funds behind Paramount’s bid. It also makes the case that Netflix is in a better financial position to support Warner Bros. and HBO operations.\n",

Levine will develop and produce scripted television series across broadcast, streaming and emerging digital storytelling platforms for the studio under the agreement. \n\n\tLevine’s first projects will be adaptations of literary IP, including the forthcoming thriller “Rifle Season” by Pat Kelly and historical noir novel “Darktown” by Thomas Mullen, released in 2016.\n\t\n\n\t“Jeffrey is a proven creative talent with exceptional taste, extensive industry relationships and a producer’s instinct for finding stories audiences want to see,” said Hannah Pillemer, head of scripted at Fox Entertainment Studios, in a statement. “He’s already identified his first two adaptations based on incredible literary IP and we’re thrilled to collaborate with him as he builds a bold, talent-driven slate under his Bronson Canyon banner.”\n\n\n\tBefore launching Bronson Canyon Pictures, Levin served as Senior Vice President of Scripted Development at Fremantle, working on projects including “American Gods,” “Little Bird” and the upcoming Amazon U.K. series “Kill Jackie.” He also worked at Paula Weinstein’s Spring Creek Productions as a producer, where he developed and executive produced “Too Big to Fail,” HBO’s Emmy-nominated and WGA Award-winning film, and produced Warner Bros.’ “This Is Where I Leave You.” \n\n\t“It’s an exciting moment to be part of Fox Entertainment Studios’ growth and vision for scripted storytelling,” said Levine in a statement. “Hannah and the entire team have been incredibly supportive and collaborative as we begin to acquire, develop and package projects for the streaming and global marketplace and build distinctive, high-quality content together.”\n\t\n\n\tPreviously, Levine held executive positions at Castle Rock Entertainment, TNT and The Zanuck Company, and began his career at The Goldwyn Company. Levine is represented by Seth Michael at Myman Greenspan Fineman Fox Rosenberg & Light.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump used his Wednesday night address to largely blame former President Joe Biden for most of the Nation’s shortcomings while attempting to highlight his accomplishments through the first 11 months of his second term in office.\n\n\tTrump’s address opened with a direct attack on his predecessor, saying he “inherited a mess” before sounding off on several political hot points like border control, inflation, transgender athletes and crime. Trump then attempted to contrast the perceived failures of the former administration with the success of his own. This was a recurring tactic throughout the roughly 19-minute speech.\n\t\n\n\t“Our country was laughed at from all over the world, but they’re not laughing anymore,” Trump said. “Over the past 11 months, we have brought more positive change to Washington than any administration in American history. There has never been anything like it, and I think most would agree.”\n\n\n\tDespite Trump’s claims about widespread enthusiasm for his second term, he currently sits at a 39% approval rating, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. The most contentious issues for Trump are the economy, which he ran strongly on in the 2024 election, and healthcare, which has remained a sticking point for lawmakers as premiums for millions of Americans threaten to spike if the subsidies from the Affordable Care Act are allowed to expire.\n\n\tTrump promised that positive change is coming to Americans’ “wallets and bank accounts in the New Year.” He said much of the coming economic growth is thanks to “tariffs, his “favorite word.” In the last legs of his speech, he claimed, “Inflation has stopped, wages are up, prices are down.”\n\t\n\n\tInflation is currently around 3%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While lower than peaks during the Biden era, inflation is higher than the tail end of 2024. Trump reassured Americans that “prices on electricity and everything else will fall dramatically.”\n\n\tOn the topic of insurance, Trump pushed all the blame on the Left. He claimed that Democrats are “controlled by the health care companies” and have “demanded” increases in premiums. On the contrary, Democrats have been trying for months to renew the Affordable Care Act subsidies and stop premiums from rising.\n\n\tTrump was light on actual news, outside of a promise to give 1,450,000 military service members a “warrior dividend” of $1,776 in honor of America’s founding year. The president said these will be granted before Christmas.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner has been showered with accolades for his work in film and TV in the days since he and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found brutally slain in their Brentwood home.\n\n\tRob Reiner had a knack for intersecting with cutting-edge comedy forces just as they were on the cusp of breaking big. Reiner was born into a pedigreed showbiz family as the son of Carl Reiner, a pioneering star of “Your Show of Shows,” and singer Estelle Reiner. Rob Reiner grew up around Mel Brooks, Sid Caesar, Neil Simon and a slew of comedy legends who were close to his father.\n\t\n\n\tBut as he came of age in the late 1960s, Rob Reiner also had a good eye for talent and collaborators. He became involved with the out-there San Francisco improv troupe the Committee, whose members  included future “The Bob Newhart Show” co-star Peter Bonerz and “Jaws” screenwriter Carl Gottlieb. Reiner and friends that included Richard Dreyfuss, writer Larry Bishop and writer-actor David Arkin would often drive up to San Francisco from Los Angeles to catch the Committee’s Sunday night shows.\n\n\n\tReiner and a handful of others eventually created an Los Angeles-based offshoot troupe that was dubbed the Session. The Committee had a residency in 1968 at the Tiffany Theater on the Sunset Strip that was a formative experience for all involved.\n\n\tAs an actor in improv, Reiner was “fearless,” Gottlieb recalls. “He would attempt any sketch. It didn’t matter what the content was. If it had the potential for humor, he’d try it.”\n\n\tEven as a young man, Reiner had a presence and a charisma that drew people to him. “Rob was always kind of a spark plug. He’d do everything bigger and louder than everybody else. Not in furtherance of his ego. Always for the material, which made all the difference,” Gottlieb recalls. In those days, the Committee members were committed to social justice and anti-war protests. “For us it was an opportunity to find some deeper meaning in the improv work,” he says. \n\t\n\n\t“We’d do a couple of anti-war pieces to provoke the audience. We had some arguments a couple of times. In San Francisco after we’d provoked the audience we’d bring the house lights up and have a teach-in session,” Gottlieb says.\n\n\tAfter his time with the Committee and the Session, Reiner eventually found his way onto the writing staff of “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.” That show became the stuff of TV legend as the stars famously battled CBS over content and censorship concerns. Reiner joined a murderer’s row of comedy talent in the “Smothers Brothers” writers room, which included Steve Martin, Mason Williams, Pat Paulson, Bob Einstein (aka Super Dave Osborne) and musician John Hartford. \n\n\t“Smothers Brothers” was famously canceled in 1969 — and it went on to win the Emmy for best variety series two months later. The show was so respected in the creative community that all the writers went on to promising new projects. Within months of “Smothers Brothers” demise, Reiner had been cast as an actor on another edgy CBS series, Norman Lear’s “All in the Family.” That series made Reiner a household name — even if that name was “Meathead.”\n\n\tReiner was squarely at the center of Lear’s universe of shows. And through his marriage in the 1970s to Penny Marshall, Reiner was adjacent to the Garry Marshall universe of shows that included ABC’s “Happy Days” and “Laverne & Shirley” (which starred Penny Marshall). All of those connections would come into play in Reiner’s post-“All in the Family” years as he pursued his desire to make his mark as a writer and director. His first effort was a film that remains a landmark, oft-quoted comedy, 1984’s “This Is Spinal Tap.” And that was followed by smashes that include 1986’s “Stand by Me,” 1987’s “The Princess Bride” and 1989’s “When Harry Met Sally.”\n\n\tReiner’s close friends often marveled at how well he wore his success, especially when he made such a triumphant segue into helming.\n\n\t“He was very cool about it. Having grown up as Carl Reiner’s son, he was no stranger to celebrity. His extended family was the ‘Laughter on the 23rd Floor’ crowd,” Gottlieb says, referring to Neil Simon’s play about his time writing for “Your Show of Shows.”\n\n\tGottlieb believes the spartan ethos of improv made a big mark on his former housemate.\n\t\n\n\t“One of the key lessons of improvisation is that you never said ‘No but’ you always said ‘Yes and.’ Rob was really good at that. When he was doing a sketch, he would always stay in character. He took the work very seriously,” Gottlieb says. “And then he applied all the lessons he learned on stage and at his father’s knee to practical every day use.”\n\n\t(Pictured: Top row: Mason Williams, Rob Reiner, Bob Einstein, Steve Martin, Glen Campbell and John Hartford at the 1988 “Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” reunion.

It would have also incentivized or required doctors who have more than 25 percent women under 65 as patients to complete medical education coursework on menopause care.\n      \n    \n          After Berry finished her speech, it just so happened Newsom was the next guest to appear onstage with host Andrew Ross Sorkin, who interviewed the governor about what changes the democratic party needs to make after losing the 2024 presidential election.\n      \n    \n          During the Q&A, Newsom never addressed Halle's critique of him. But, his spokesperson, Izzy Gardon, later issued a statement to TMZ, saying the governor deeply admires Halle's advocacy and looks forward to working with her on this \"critical issue\" because he shares her goal of expanding access to menopause care.\n      \n    \n          Gardon also said Newsom vetoed the bill because it would have \"unintentionally raised health care costs for millions of working women and working families already stretched thin.\"\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Halle Berry\n              \n                          \n                Gavin Newsom\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Public Health\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Colbert had been riffing on \"problematic\" Christmas TV movies and the fantasy of bumping into a prince at work.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Enter Prince Harry ... who jokes he wants to star in these films because Americans are \"obsessed\" with Christmas movies -- and royalty.\n      \n\n          Colbert pushes back, saying, \"I wouldn't say we're obsessed with Royalty,\" but Harry shoots back, \"Really? I heard you elected a king.\"\n      \n    \n          The quip triggered audible gasps -- and a few boos -- but Colbert quickly stepped in to back him up.\n      \n    \n          You'll recall ... in February, Trump referred to himself as a king in a Truth Social post about NYC congestion pricing -- ultimately leading to the \"No Kings\" protests nationwide.\n      \n    \n          The bit kept rolling ... with Harry saying he'll do anything to get into a Hallmark movie, saying, \"I’ll record a self-tape, I’ll fly myself to an audition, settle a baseless lawsuit with the White House. All the things you people on TV do.\"\n      \n    \n          Colbert replies he's never done any of that ... and Harry quips \"Maybe that's why you're canceled\" -- a clear reference to CBS' $16M settlement with Trump that Colbert heavily criticized, which was followed by CBS pulling Colbert's plug. The network claimed the cancellation was over financial reasons, BTW ... something Colbert called BS.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to the White House ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Stephen Colbert\n              \n                          \n                Prince Harry\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Late Show\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\t“Conclave” producer Juliette Howell has been named CEO of Lookout Point, the BBC Studios label behind “Happy Valley” and “Gentleman Jack.”\n\n\tLookout Point’s previous co-CEOs Laura Lankester and Will Johnston departed to A24 last year.\n\n\tHowell, who co-founded and co-led House Productions alongside Tessa Ross, will bring her own development slate from House to merge with Lookout Point’s pipeline, creating what BBC Studios describes as a “super-charged drama label.” She has built a track record navigating both local U.K. and international markets through her work at House.\n\t\n\n\tRoss will continue as sole CEO of House Productions, which BBC Studios added to its label roster in 2021 after supporting the company since its 2016 launch. House has produced acclaimed projects including “The Iron Claw,” “Bird” and 2024’s Oscar and BAFTA-winning “Conclave,” as well as the BAFTA-winning series “Sherwood,” Emmy-nominated “Brexit: The Uncivil War,” “The Good Mothers,” “Life After Life” and the upcoming “Mint.”\n\n\n\tLookout Point’s slate includes “Happy Valley,” “Gentleman Jack,” “A Suitable Boy” and “Pride and Prejudice” for Netflix. Louise Mutter will continue as managing director of Lookout Point, working alongside Howell.\n\n\t“Juliette’s appointment reflects not just the creative strength of the shows we make, but the people who make them,” said Zai Bennett, CEO and chief creative officer of BBC Studios Productions. “By placing one of our most dynamic leaders into this role, we’re ensuring Lookout Point remains fearless and creatively charged for the future. I’m also delighted that Tessa will continue to lead House Productions as she’s a true force in an intensely competitive scripted market.”\n\t\n\n\tHowell said: “I’m thrilled to be bringing my exciting slate of projects from House to join Lookout Point’s impressive production slate. I can’t wait to collaborate with the brilliant team shaping the next generation of hits and to continue championing the bold distinctive storytelling that has always excited me. Lookout Point has a remarkable legacy and an appetite for ideas that resonate with audiences. Stepping into this role is an incredible opportunity, and I’m so excited about this next chapter.”\n\n\tRoss added: “I’m very proud of the work that Juliette, the team and I have done together over these last 10 years at House. I’ve no doubt she’ll be a big success at Lookout Point and wish her great good luck and happiness.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de La Patellière, the screenwriting-filmmaking duo behind the smash hit “The Count of Monte Cristo,” are making their first series with Pathé and Netflix. \n\n\tTitled “Les brumes,” the suspense thriller series is based on Olivier Norek’s book “Dans les brumes de Capelans.” \n\n\tCreated and written by Delaporte, de La Patellière and Sylvain Caron, the six-part series unfolds after an elusive killer disappears in the wake of a string of murders. “Anna, a mute young woman and the solesurvivor, is urgently extracted to a windswept Atlantic island. There lives Victor Coste, a police officerwho has exiled himself to the other side of the world. Cut off from everything, he accepts one lastmission: to get Anna to talk, identify the killer, and prevent him from striking again. But when the world’sdensest fog rolls in, a race against time begins, as the island itself turns into a trap,” reads the synopsis. \n\t\n\n\tThe cast is set to start shooting on Jan. 13 in France and Ireland with a topnotch French cast, including Pio Marmaï (“The Three Musketeers”), Alice Da Luz (“Carême”), Bouli Lanners (“The night of the 12th”), Stéphane Caillard (“Ad Vitam”), Zineb Triki (“Eagles of the Republic”), Patrick Mille (“The Count of Monte Cristo”), Florence Loiret-Caille (“The Bureau”), Léonie Dahan-Lamort (“Nudes”) and Paul Beaurepaire (“The Richest Woman in the World”). Delaporte and de La Patellière will be directing with Thierry Poiraud.\n\n\n\tAude Albano at Pathé is producing with Fargo Films, Delaporte and de La Patellière’s vehicle. The show reteams the filmmakers with Pathé, which co-produced, distributed in France and sold around the world “The Count of Monte Cristo.” The epic movie, produced by Dimitri Rassam’s Chapter 2, sold more than 9 million admissions in France after world premiering at Cannes, and turned out to be the second highest grossing French film of 2024. Delaporte and de La Patellière also penned Pathé’s two-part saga “The Three Musketeers.” The duo will next be making their English language feature debut with “The Iron King,” the first movie adapted from Maurice Druon’s Les Rois Maudits (“The Accursed Kings”) book series.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfrican streamer Showmax has unveiled the first trailer for ‘Die Kantoor,’ the Afrikaans-language adaptation of the globally successful format ‘The Office,’ licensed by BBC Studios.\n\n\tTV channel kykNET will preview the opening episode at on African broadcaster DStv on Jan. 18, ahead of the Showmax double-bill premiere on Jan. 20. Subsequent episodes will roll out weekly on both platforms.\n\n\n\tThe trailer provides a first glimpse of Albert Pretorius stepping into the legendary manager role that previously earned both Ricky Gervais and Steve Carell Golden Globe awards — as David Brent in the British original and Michael Scott in the U.S. version, respectively. The 2025 Fleur du Cap and Woordfees winner, known for “Niggies” and “Nêrens, Noord-Kaap,” portrays Flip, the manager at polony distributors Deluxe Processed Meats.\n\t\n\n\t“Flip thinks of himself as the Rassie Erasmus of polony; in his mind, the documentary crew is making his ‘Chasing the Sun,’ about how he’s taking this team to the next level,” Pretorius explains.\n\n\n\tFor international audiences unfamiliar with South African culture, polony refers to a highly processed sausage, while Rassie Erasmus serves as the visionary coach of the Springbok rugby team. “Chasing the Sun” is the International Emmy-nominated documentary series chronicling South Africa’s two most recent World Cup rugby victories.\n\n\t“He’s grappling with what it means to be a man – an Afrikaans man – but he doesn’t realise that a lot of the qualities he aspires to are archaic. Or that he actually has very few of them. That’s where the comedy lies, because he tries so bloody hard just to be liked,” Pretorius says. “Isn’t that what cringe is? People trying their best by being the absolute worst.”\n\t\n\n\tMore than two decades have passed since Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant introduced audiences to the brilliantly bleak mockumentary universe of ‘The Office.’ The original British version is considered one of the best comedy series of all time, while the American adaptation claimed five Emmys, including Outstanding Comedy Series, and became the most streamed show globally in 2020.\n\n\tThis widespread appeal has spawned remakes for audiences worldwide. The South African edition marks the format’s 14th international adaptation.\n\n\tRapid Blue, part of BBC Studios, is producing the Showmax Original, with SAFTA and Silwerskerm winner Bennie Fourie (“Hotel”) serving as head writer and director. BBC Studios is managing global sales.\n\n\tBeyond Pretorius, the ensemble includes SAFTA winner Schalk Bezuidenhout (“Kanarie,” “Hotel”), Silwerskerm winner Ilse Oppelt (“Oh Schuks I’m Gatvol,” “Fishy Fêshuns”), Carl Beukes (“Jozi,” “The Shakedown”), Daniah de Villiers (“Mia and the White Lion”), Mehboob Bawa (“Bhai’s Cafe”), former KFM radio presenter Sipumziwe Lucwaba, veteran Lida Botha (“Die Kwiksilvers”) and newcomer Gert du Plessis.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBritain’s media regulator Ofcom launched a formal investigation into Elon Musk‘s X on Monday to determine whether the social media platform has complied with its duties to protect U.K. users from illegal content, as Malaysia and Indonesia blocked access to the Grok AI chatbot over deepfake concerns.\n\n\tThe U.K. probe centers on “deeply concerning” reports that X’s Grok AI chatbot has been used to create and share non-consensual intimate images and sexualized images of children that may constitute child sexual abuse material (CSAM), according to Ofcom.\n\t\n\n\tMalaysia and Indonesia announced over the weekend they had blocked access to Grok over its ability to produce sexually explicit deepfakes, with both countries’ communications ministries citing concerns the tool could be used to create pornographic and non-consensual images involving women and children, per BBC News.\n\n\n\tThe British investigation follows swift government pressure after widespread condemnation over Grok’s use in creating non-consensual sexual deepfakes. Last week, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the practice “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” telling Greatest Hits Radio that the creation of explicit imagery depicting both adults and minors is “unlawful” and “not to be tolerated,” according to BBC News.\n\n\t“I’ve asked for all options to be on the table,” Starmer said, emphasizing that Ofcom has received the government’s “full support” for enforcement action.\n\n\tIn response to the backlash, X moved Grok’s image editing features behind a paywall on Friday, limiting the functionality to paid subscribers who provide identification and payment information. The restriction means only verified blue checkmark account holders can edit images on the platform, though free users can still access the features through Grok’s separate application and website.\n\t\n\n\tOfcom contacted X on Jan. 5 and set a Jan. 9 deadline for the company to explain its compliance measures under the U.K.’s Online Safety Act. After receiving X’s response and conducting an expedited assessment, the regulator announced Monday it had determined a formal investigation was warranted.\n\n\tThe investigation will examine whether X failed to meet several legal obligations, including assessing risks of illegal content exposure for U.K. users, implementing appropriate measures to prevent users from encountering non-consensual intimate images and CSAM, and swiftly removing illegal content upon discovery.\n\n\tOfcom will also scrutinize whether X adequately assessed risks to children and employed “highly effective age assurance” to prevent minors from accessing pornographic material.\n\n\t“Reports of Grok being used to create and share illegal non-consensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material on X have been deeply concerning,” an Ofcom spokesperson said. “Platforms must protect people in the U.K. from content that’s illegal in the U.K., and we won’t hesitate to investigate where we suspect companies are failing in their duties, especially where there’s a risk of harm to children.”\n\n\tThe regulator emphasized it will progress the investigation “as a matter of the highest priority” while following due process to ensure the probe is “legally robust and fairly decided.”\n\n\tIf the investigation finds X violated the law, Ofcom can impose fines up to £18 million ($24.2 million) or 10% of the company’s qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. In severe cases of ongoing non-compliance, the regulator can seek court orders for “business disruption measures,” including requiring internet service providers to block U.K. access to the platform or cutting off X’s advertising income and user payments.\n\n\tWhile such intervention typically follows a lengthy investigative process, the law permits expedited action when situations involve severe threats to public welfare, endangerment of children, or documented patterns of regulatory defiance. \n\n\tOfcom also received a response from xAI, the company behind Grok, on Jan. 9 and is assessing whether separate compliance issues warrant investigation.\n\n\tBritish law prohibits distribution of deepfake imagery depicting adults. \n\t\n\n\tSince the Online Safety Act’s duties took effect less than a year ago, Ofcom has launched investigations into more than 90 platforms and issued six fines for non-compliance.\n\n\tThe Online Safety Act has drawn attention from the Trump administration over its potential impact on American technology companies. Ofcom is currently recruiting a new chair who will be tasked with adopting more forceful oversight strategies as concerns mount over emerging technologies and platform ownership structures.\n\n\tVariety has reached out to X for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChina’s theatrical market cooled further in the Jan. 9–11 frame, with Disney’s “Zootopia 2” holding on to the No. 1 spot for a second consecutive weekend after it reclaimed pole position last week.\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” added RMB49.1 million ($6.9 million), according to Artisan Gateway, lifting its cumulative total to RMB4.31 billion ($607.2 million). \n\n\tMaoyan Movie’s crime thriller “The Fire Raven” stayed close behind in second place, earning $6.8 million. The film continued to show solid traction, pushing its running total to $42.3 million after less than two weeks in release. Directed and written by Sam Quah, the film stars Peng Yuchang, Alan Aruna and Chang Ning and follows the reopening of a long-dormant murder case that exposes a wider network of corruption and revenge.\n\t\n\n\tJames Cameron’s sci-fi epic “Avatar: Fire and Ash” moved to third, grossing $6.5 million over the weekend. The 20th Century Studios release has now reached $146.6 million in China.\n\n\n\tHuace Film & TV’s “Back to the Past” placed fourth with $4.9 million, taking its cumulative haul to $33.7 million. The feature film adaptation of Hong Kong broadcaster TVB’s 2001 historical sci-fi series “A Step Into the Past” is produced by Louis Koo‘s One Cool Film Production, with Koo serving as producer. The project reunites the principal cast from the original television series 24 years after it first aired. Koo stars alongside Raymond Lam, Jessica Hsuan, Sonija Kwok, Joyce Tang and Michelle Saram, all reprising their original roles. New cast members include Bai Baihe, Michael Miu and Louis Cheung. The film marks the final screen appearance of the late Dick Liu Kai-chi.\n\t\n\n\tRounding out the top five was Chuanqiren Media’s family drama “Unexpected Family,” which collected $900,000 million and stands at $5.5 million to date. The comedy-drama is co-written and directed by Li Taiyan and centers on a young man who leaves his small town for Beijing and ends up entangled with an elderly man with Alzheimer’s who mistakes him for his son. The film stars Jackie Chan, Peng Yuchang, Zhang Jianing and Pan Binlong.\n\n\tOverall, the China box office generated $31.6 million for the weekend. Year-to-date takings for 2026 have reached $162.4 million, running 9.9% ahead of the same period last year, though the market is clearly settling into a quieter post-festive rhythm with an eye on the Lunar New Year holiday next month when several big ticket releases are expected to bow. \n",

    "body": "\n\tLocal romantic drama “Once We Were Us” and James Cameron’s sci-fi juggernaut “Avatar: Fire and Ash” split the honors at the South Korean box office this weekend, with the former claiming the most ticket sales and the latter securing the highest revenue.\n\n\t“Once We Were Us” ascended to the No. 1 spot in terms of admissions, ending the three-week reign of the “Avatar” threequel. The film earned $2.3 million from 340,267 admissions between Friday and Sunday. Since its release on Dec. 31, the film has accumulated a total of $6.9 million from 1,046,417 admissions, according to data from KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council. \n\t\n\n\tDirected by Kim Do-young, “Once We Were Us” is a Korean remake of the 2018 Chinese hit “Us and Them.” Starring Koo Kyo-hwan and Moon Ga-young, the film follows two former lovers who unexpectedly cross paths years after their breakup, confronting unresolved emotions and the lives they have built apart.\n\n\n\tWhile “Once We Were Us” sold more tickets, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” retained the revenue crown. The film grossed $2.6 million over the weekend from 316,262 admissions. The film has now amassed $48.1 million from 6,079,644 admissions since its mid-December debut.\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” remained the solitary animated blockbuster holding firm in the upper ranks, retaining third place. The sequel earned $887,595 over the weekend from 133,639 admissions, lifting its cumulative total to $54.8 million from 8,313,926 admissions.\n\n\tKorean release “Choir of God” debuted in fourth place.

Directed by Kim Hye-young, the film is a bittersweet high-school romance centered on a girl with anterograde amnesia whose memories reset each morning. It added $441,507 over the weekend from 65,744 admissions for a cumulative total of $5.1 million from 779,299 admissions.\n\n\tJapanese animation “Crayon Shinchan the movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers” took sixth place with $180,668 from 27,869 admissions for a cume of $2.9 million. It was followed by Paramount’s “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,” which earned $66,903 from 11,120 admissions and a cumulative total of $488,136. \n\n\tFurther down the charts, the Aziz Ansari-directed comedy “Good Fortune” – starring Ansari alongside Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves – landed in eighth with $60,466 from 9,816 admissions and now has a cume of $122,891. New entry “Arctic Dogs: In Search of Arctic Idol” opened in ninth with $34,810 from 7,146 admissions, while “Pororo the Movie: Sweet Castle Adventure” completed the top ten with $41,322 from 6,818 admissions and a cume of $1.4 million. \n\n\tThe overall market saw a significant cooling off following the holiday surge.

    "body": "\n\tFresh off its Golden Globe win for best comedy or musical TV series, Apple TV’s “The Studio” is heading back behind the cameras next week. That’s the word from series star and executive producer Seth Rogen, who told press backstage at Sunday’s kudocast.\n\n\tEpisode 8 of the Lionsgate-produced series’ Season 1 took place at the Golden Globes, so Sunday night’s actual show made things a bit surreal for Rogen and company as the show picked up multiple awards. Rogen also hinted that Season.2 might even make a return trip to the Globes, noting that some things that happened during the evening at the Beverly Hilton might even inspire events that transpire in Season 2.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve literally written some things that happened leading up to this award show into episodes as we’ve been writing the show. We start shooting in a week,” he said. “So yes, several things have happened, both today and leading up to this event that we have written directly into the show, and you’ll probably know what they are when you see them.”\n\n\n\tRogen said that could include cameos by people who came up to him during the Globes, pitching themselves to make appearances in Season 2.\n\n\t“A lot of people literally just come up to us and were like, ‘Put me on your show. I’ll do anything. I’ll walk by!'” Rogen said. “It’s very lovely. The head of Sony, Tom [Rothman, the chairman and CEO of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group]. I love that real studio heads want to be on the show.”\n\n\tThe execs were perhaps inspired by the appearance of Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in Season 1. “Ted kind of ruined it for everyone. But yeah, there’s a few people we roped in tonight. This is good poaching ground for us.” \n\t\n\n\tBesides the win for best comedy/musical series, Rogen also won for best actor in a TV comedy. That came months after “The Studio” Globes episode, which recruited actors like Jean Smart and Adam Scott in addition to Sarandos to play sent-up versions of themselves. \n\n\t“This is so weird! We just pretended to do this. And now it is happening!” Rogen said as he clutched his Golden Globe award. “I thought the only way I would get to hold one is to create a show to give myself a fake one.”\n\n\tThe Globes wins come after “The Studio” also cleaned up at last September’s Emmy Awards, where the show made Emmys history by winning 13 Emmys, breaking the all-time record for most wins for a comedy series. Also, Rogen tied the record for most Emmys won by a single individual in one night.\n\n\t“The Studio” filmed its first season in Los Angeles — and snagged $13.2 million in California tax credits to do the same for Season 2. Reports had previously suggested that production might get underway in December; with the January start date, it’s still unclear when “The Studio” might return to Apple TV for Season 2. (Season 1 aired from March to May 2025.)\n\n\t“The Studio” stars Rogen, Catherine O’Hara, Kathryn Hahn, Ike Barinholtz and Chase Sui Wonders. Executive Producers include Rogen, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver, Alex McAtee, Josh Fagen, Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck.\n\n\t“The Studio” was nominated for three Golden Globes this year. Besides Rogen’s win best performance by a male actor in a television series — musical or comedy and the series win for best TV musical or comedy, O’Hara was nominated for supporting TV actress.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSweden’s Göteborg Film Festival, the biggest film-TV event in the Nordic countries, is introducing  a lie detector test, to point up the event’s central 2026 debating point: Truth.\n\n\tInside an interrogation room built for the occasion, members of the public will undergo a polygraph examination conducted by a real-life specialist, Ørjan Hesjedal, the festival announced Monday. \n\n\n\tThe “high-pressure scenario inspired by investigative environments – complete with cameras, lighting and physiological monitoring” – is voluntary, though likely to prove very popular. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s also in the vein of other live-event simulations which are weirdly of the moment and turn on high human-stake issues. Most memorably, in 2021, as the pandemic still raged in parts of the world, Swedish emergency nurse Lisa Enroth was selected from thousands of applicants to spend seven days at the Pater Noster Lighthouse, now a luxury boutique hotel on the isolated island of Hamneskär, off the coast of western Sweden. She had no computer nor mobile but the ability to binge 60 films from the Göteborg Festival’s program. \n\n\n\n\n\n\tThat initiative reflected on social distancing and the increasingly sole experience of film and TV consumption. The lie detector test will launch as the Festival asks what it calls a “simple but radical question: What is truth worth today?”\n\n\tIn a real life departure, cynics would say, truth is rewarded in the tests. Audience members who tell the truth and are found to do so will receive a Truth Ticket, granting access to a festival screening. \n\t\n\n\t“Truth has become strangely negotiable in our time. By turning truth into a currency, we assign it a tangible value that is rarely emphasised. We want to create an experiment where lying has consequences,” said Göteborg Artistic Director Pia Lundberg.“By turning truth into something you can earn – and spend – the festival assigns it a tangible value rarely acknowledged in the real world. In a time when personal narratives often overshadow factual truth, Truth Tickets reframes honesty as something with substance, consequence and worth,” the festival added Monday.\n\n\tIn another stunt, the Festival released on Monday a YouTube black comedy clip in which Alexander Karim (“The Swarm”) plays a lollipop-licking interrogator who reflects in a grimy torturer’s basement on how to measure truth. As his assistant, another Swedish star, David Dencik (“Pressure Point”), demonstrates on himself with a slightly deranged over-readiness two torture techniques. \n\n\tAs another part of its Truth Focus, the Göteborg Festival will screen a showcase of films exploring the issue. These include Kaouther Ben Hania’s high-profile Oscar-shortlisted docudrama “The Voice of Hind Rajab,”; political spin satire “No Comment,” from Norway’s Petter Næss; Kirill Serebrennikov’s Cannes Premiere title “The Disappearance of Josef Mengele” and Jim Sheridan and David Merriman “Re-Creation,” hailed by Variety as a “terrific” juror room drama, reviving the spirit of Sidney Lumet’s 1957 classic “12 Angry Men.”    \n\n\tThe 49th edition of the Göteborg Film Festival runs Jan. 23 to Feb. 1.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGöteborg Film Festival Truth Tickets (L-R) David Dencik, Alexander Karim as two interrogators\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of the Göteborg Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOver the last few years, the Golden Globes has made a concerted effort to improve its reputation. Once somewhat infamous for a small voting body easily influenced by star power, a setup that culminated in a controversy over its membership in 2021 that led to a temporary suspension of the telecast. Five years later, the Globes are under new ownership — now sharing a parent company with Variety — that’s implemented structural changes like overhauling the roster and, as of this year, no longer paying a salary to legacy voters. There have been both stumbles, like a disastrous hosting performance by standup comedian Jo Koy in 2024, and successful course corrections, like hiring Nikki Glaser as MC last year and rightfully asking her back.\n\t\n\n\tBut even as the Globes has worked to clean up its act, the awards show also tried to expand its reach and profitability in often clumsy and confusing ways. At the ceremony’s 83rd iteration on Sunday night, the tension between those two goals was on full display.\n\n\n\tFirst, the positives. Glaser continued to confidently strut the thin and delicate line between landing punches while seeming infectiously excited to be in the Beverly Hilton ballroom. While the repeated professions of love for various celebrities were a little much, they succeeded in getting the in-person audience to laugh along as she called Sean Penn a “sexy leather handbag” who does cocaine around the globe and labeled Jon M. Chu’s blockbuster sequel “Wicked: For Money.” Frequent self-deprecation — “just like Frankenstein, I’ve been pieced together by an unlicensed European surgeon” — created the sense Glaser was happy to take as well as dish. Callbacks to popular bits from last year, like an Adam Sandler impression and the musical spoof “Pope-ular” (now reborn as “KPong,” a mashup of “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Marty Supreme”) felt earned rather than self-indulgent.\n\t\n\n\tThe actual winners, too, offered plenty to feel good about. Teyana Taylor’s joyful tears started the night on a strong note; Wagner Moura’s victory for “The Secret Agent” bookended the show by demonstrating the benefits of the Globes’ international roots. If anything, the selections were rather staid, with incumbent Emmy winners “The Pitt” and “The Studio” taking home the TV series trophies and Oscar frontrunner “One Battle After Another” leading the film categories. The Globes would like no longer to be known as the type of organization that nominates “Emily in Paris” alongside “Schitt’s Creek,” seemingly leading to a new conservative streak. But the show can still anoint breakout talents like Rhea Seehorn in “Pluribus,” reaping the reward of a giddy, delightful speech that spanned beta blockers and the former chicken chain Koo Koo Roo.\n\n\tYet viewers experienced these demonstrations of seriousness amid a slew of distracting stunts. Announcers Kevin Frazier and Marc Malkin didn’t just banter about nominees’ biographies and past nomination histories; they peppered in statistics about projected winners from the online betting platform Polymarket, complete with screen-swallowing graphics. (Disclosure: Malkin is a Variety colleague.) Actual awards like best original score, which went to Ludwig Goransson of “Sinners,” were shunted to commercial break to make room for awkward non-jokes like having UFC fighters strut across the stage as “extra security” for the stars of “Heated Rivalry.” At least have them accompany the guys onstage for pretense’s sake! A soundtrack of bland Top 40 hits led to dissonant juxtapositions like Stellan Skarsgard taking the stage to Usher’s “Yeah!”, or the team behind “The Secret Agent” walking up to Rihanna’s “Pon de Replay.” While a banger, the 2005 hit didn’t really set the tone for discussing a political thriller about life under fascism.\n\n\tThis clunkily commercial-minded tendency applied not just to the production, but to the honors themselves. The best podcast category, a nonsensical and new inclusion that pitted celebrity chat show “Smartless” against the NPR news digest “Up First,” was presented with lengthy clips for each nominee, while the more established acting ones had to go without. (For some reason, best screenplay also came with clips, a decision that was less cynically promotional and more bafflingly inconsistent.) Winner Amy Poehler, herself a four-time Globes host, was almost bashful in her acceptance, acknowledging her recent arrival to the medium. With no disrespect to the delightful “Good Hang,” the show makes for a more intuitive bridge between a Hollywood-centric event and a new source of attention and advertising than the likes of “Up First,” which could contextualize its triumph. \n\t\n\n\tThe idea of honoring “box office achievement” got practically laughed out of the Oscars when it was briefly floated a few years ago. Its inclusion in the Globes thus reinforces the very reputation as the Academy Awards’ less serious little cousin that the show is trying to move away from. Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” which exceeded all financial expectations, is about as worthy a winner as the Globes could find, but the film was nonetheless nominated alongside releases that had no box office (“KPop Demon Hunters”) or weren’t even released at the time of nomination (“Avatar: Fire and Ash”). As with podcasting, the fuzziness of criteria only hurt the end product, putting the inclusion of popular work above any consistent rationale for doing so.\n\n\tGrowth can mean a couple of things: maturation, or just the simple act of getting bigger. The Globes is trying to do both at the same time, but the latter threatens to come at the expense of the former. Tame yet respectable choices are at odds with sponsored content for legalized gambling, or an unending ramble by Judd Apatow. Chasing too many contradictory aims at once ends up frustrating all of them. \n\n\tVariety parent company PMC owns Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\t“One Battle After Another,” a blistering satire about radical politics, and “Hamnet,” a look at William Shakespeare’s complicated domestic life, took top prizes at the 83rd Golden Globe Awards. “The Studio,” a send-up of Hollywood, was named best TV series (musical or comedy) and “The Pitt,” which takes place in an over-stretched hospital, won best TV series (drama). Best limited or anthology series went to “Adolescence,” the story of a murder investigation that unfolds in one, continuous shot.\n\n\tThe Globes, unlike the Oscars, delineates films by genre. That meant “One Battle After Another” won best picture (musical or comedy), while “Hamnet” was crowned best picture (drama). It was a big night for Warner Bros. Discovery, which produced “One Battle After Another,” as well as “The Pitt.” “One Battle After Another” scored a leading four prizes, with writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson nabbing trophies for the film’s screenplay and his direction. “Hamnet” won two statues, including best actress for Jessie Buckley’s portrayal of a grieving mother. Focus Features produced the movie.\n\n\t“Adolescence,” which was backed by Netflix, won four prizes in total, the most of any TV show. Its creator Stephen Graham won best actor in a limited series, while Erin Doherty was named best supporting actress in a TV drama for the show. Owen Cooper, their 16-year-old co-star, won best supporting actor in a TV drama, becoming the youngest ever winner in the category.\n\n\tNikki Glaser returned as emcee for the second year in a row. In her opening monologue she poked fun at everything from Bari Weiss (“CBS news: America’s newest place to ‘See B.S. News.'”) to the Epstein files (“The Golden Globe for best editing goes to… the Justice Department!”) to Warner Bros.’s pending sale to Netflix. She also lampooned Hollywood’s self-obsession, calling the Globes, “without a doubt the most important thing that’s happening in the world right now.”\n\n\tThere were more somber reminders of politics on display. Celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Wanda Sykes wore pins to the ceremony with the messages “Ice Out” and “Be Good” to honor the memory of Renée Macklin Good, who was killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this week. Several winners also used their time on stage to urge viewers to exhibit compassion and understanding, an apparent nod to the country’s polarization. \n\n\tTop acting honors went to Rose Byrne, named best actress in a musical or comedy for her work as the mother of a child with a pediatric feeding disorder in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” and Timothée Chalamet, who picked up best actor in a musical or comedy prize for playing a ping-pong player in “Marty Supreme.” Chalamet had previously been nominated four times without ever winning.\n\n\t“My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up,” Chalamet said. “Always be grateful for what you have. It’s allowed me to leave the ceremony in the past empty-handed with my head held high. I’d be lying if I said those moments didn’t make this moment that much sweeter.”\n\n\tWagner Moura won best actor in a drama for playing a political refugee in “The Secret Agent.” “If trauma can be passed along through generations, values can too,” Moura said. \n\n\tNoah Wyle earned best actor in a TV drama for playing a hard-charging doctor in “The Pitt,” while Rhea Seehorn won best actress in a TV drama for her performance as a novelist confronting an alien virus in “Pluribus.” “I meant to get a prescription for beta blockers but I did not,” a flustered Seehorn confessed. “Sorry!”\n\n\t“The Studio’s” Seth Rogen was named best actor in a TV comedy for his performance as a blundering movie executive in the Apple TV series. Jean Smart won best actress in a TV comedy for her work as a stand-up comic in “Hacks,” marking her third Golden Globe victory. “What can I say, I’m a greedy bitch,” Smart joked. \n\n\tMichelle Williams won her third Golden Globe, this one in the best actress in a limited series category, for her performance as a terminally ill woman in “Dying for Sex.” \n\n\tTeyana Taylor was named best supporting actress for playing a revolutionary in “One Battle After Another,” and Stellan Skarsgård won best supporting actor for his turn as an emotionally remote filmmaker in “Sentimental Value.” Taylor gave one of the night’s most emotional speeches. “To my Brown sisters and little brown girls watching tonight, our softness is not a liability,” Taylor said. “Our depth is not too much. Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space.”\n\n\tIn addition to honoring film and television, the Globes recognized podcasts for the first time, handing out the top prize to “Good Hang With Amy Poehler.” “I don’t know about awards shows, but when they get it right, it makes sense,” Poehler joked.\n\n\tStreaming sensation “KPop Demon Hunters” won two honors, including best animated feature and best original song for its anthem, “Golden.” And Brazil’s “The Secret Agent” was named best international feature.\n\n\tSykes, presenting the award for best standup special, trolled Ricky Gervais for his past trans jokes and atheism. The comic wasn’t in the ballroom when he won the Globe for his latest show, “Mortality,” so Sykes accepted his statue while “thanking God and the trans community.” It was Gervais’ second consecutive win in the category.\n\n\t“Sinners,” a vampire film set in the segregated South, won the prize for best cinematic and box office achievement. \n\n\tVariety parent company PMC owns Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge.\n\n\tSee the full list of winners below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFRANKENSTEIN (Netflix)\n\n\tHAMNET (Focus Features) (WINNER)\n\n\tIT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT (NEON)\n\n\tTHE SECRET AGENT (NEON)\n\n\tSENTIMENTAL VALUE (NEON)\n\n\tSINNERS (Warner Bros.

He's been productive in this postseason before, too -- he has five touchdowns and 451 yards in four playoff games.\n      \n      ",

    "body": "\n\tCharli xcx said she’s ready for a new era at the Berlin Film Festival premiere of “The Moment” – but she’s still figuring out just what that is.\n\n\tFollowing the screening at Zoo Palast, which was filled to the brim with her fans, the pop star appeared on stage alongside the mockumentary’s director, Aidan Zamiri. Asked what’s next for her career, Charli – who just put out a “Wuthering Heights” concept album and is set to star in a handful of films – confirmed that “Brat” is over, “full stop.”\n\t\n\n\t“It feels like a sort of long overdue full stop in the world of ‘Brat,’ and I think we knew that going into it and that was part of the interest in making it,” she said. “So for me, yes, I do feel ready to embark on a new journey. But I don’t know what that is, so yeah. I’m kind of open to ideas.”\n\n\n\t“But not really!” she quickly added.\n\n\t“The Moment” Berlinale premiere was packed and filled with energy, with fans screaming at her arrival on the red carpet. Upon taking their seats, guests were greeted with their own Howard Stirling “Brat” bank cards, an inside joke from the film.\n\n\tThere were big laughs for Alexander Skarsgard’s sinister concert film director and raucous cheers as the film ended, signaling that no matter what, “Brat” may never die.\n\n\tAfter debuting at Sundance last month, followed by a U.S. theatrical release, it’s finally time for Europe’s moment, with the Berlin bow marking the film’s international debut. “The Moment” stars Charli as an alternate-reality version of herself grappling with whether to stay true to her art or cross over to the commercial dark side. When a director, played by Skarsgard, is hired to make a concert film about her upcoming “Brat” tour, Charli faces the ultimate test.\n\t\n\n\tAlongside Charli and Skarsgard, “The Moment” also stars Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou, Hailey Benton Gates, Isaac Powell, Rish Shah, Kylie Jenner and Rachel Sennott. However, just Charli and Zamiri were on hand at the Berlin premiere.\n\n\tAt a press conference earlier on Saturday, Charli was asked about bringing the film to the Berlinale, saying she applauds the festival for “not shying away from political films, from films that have a real social angle, films by directors who really are visionary and have something to say.”\n\n\t“Those are the kinds of films that we love and want to champion ourselves,” she said, adding: “I’m only just starting out in this industry, but I feel passionate about working within those spaces.”\n\n\tBut it does seem that after this, “Brat” will be over for good. “For me, it’s over,” she said. “And you can’t dread the end when it’s over.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent appearance on Brian Tyler Cohen’s podcast, Barack Obama gave his reaction after an AI video was posted to Donald Trump‘s Truth Social account that depicted the former president and his first lady, Michelle, as apes. Obama opened his thoughts by calmly stating that it’s “important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.”\n\n\t“You know, it is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction. But, you know, as I’m traveling around the country, as you’re traveling around the country, you meet people. They still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness. And there’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television,” he said. “And what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum. And a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? So that’s been lost.”\n\t\n\n\tWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt at first tried to defend the Feb. 6 post as an “internet meme” and urged the press to “report on something today that actually matters to the American public.” However, the backlash from both sides of the political spectrum was too great, and the video was taken down after nearly 12 hours.\n\n\tAfter the racist video was deleted, the White House attempted to shift the blame to an unnamed staff member who “erroneously” shared it on Trump’s account. The president seemed to contradict that claim hours later, telling the Associated Press that he “didn’t make a mistake” and, instead, passed along the video for an aide to post.\n\t\n\n\t“I liked the beginning. I saw it and just passed it on, and I guess probably nobody reviewed the end of it,” Trump said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Van Der Beek’s younger brother, Jared Van Der Beek, took to Instagram on Friday to thank those who have reached out following James’ death on Wednesday.\n\n\t“There’s a special bond that exists between brothers and two days ago, that physical bond was broken,” he wrote. “I now know why people call it heartbreak when you lose someone close to you. There is a feeling of devastation and pain that runs so deep in the heart, I didn’t know it would hurt so badly. He was my person, the one I went to for any and all things. I’ve looked up to him since I was born. He has never failed to be there for me whenever I needed him.”\n\t\n\n\t“It has been wonderful reading and seeing how he touched so many lives not because of something he did, but because of who he was,” he added. “He shared with an open heart and with his wise soul. As painful as this pain deep in the heart is, the healing has already begun with all the outpouring of love, prayers, and support. I truly thank all of you have taken the time to reach out, letting me know that you’re there. The community of people who were intimately involved in his passing were nothing short of amazing. Thank you to everyone known and unknown who helped his transition be as beautiful as possible.”\n\n\n\tJames Van Der Beek died on Feb. 11 after a battle with colorectal cancer. He was 48 years old.\n\n\tThe Van Der Beek family announced James’ death in a statement posted on Instagram: “Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMotherhood can be… a lot, as both Mary Bronstein’s “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” and Lynne Ramsay’s “Die My Love” reminded us last year. Now, here comes a riposte in the horror genre: Hanna Bergholm‘s Berlinale competition entry “Nightborn,” which brings a Finnish sensibility to a taut and accessible chiller in which babies really can be little monsters. \n\tSeidi Haarla and Rupert Grint play Saga and Jon, a couple moving into a sprawling fixer-upper in the Finnish forest to start the large family of their dreams. There’s economic heft to the otherwise questionable motivations behind this move: As Jon says, “Fuck London,” and it’s true that even if the isolated rural reno project hadn’t belonged to a relative, it could probably be secured for less than the price of a dingy one-bed apartment on the outskirts of the U.K.’s over-priced capital.When the couple’s baby arrives, it quickly becomes apparent that something isn’t quite right with the little one — at least in his mother’s eyes. Bergholm holds back on showing the audience the infant’s face until the very last moments of the film, a decision designed to tease fans of “Rosemary’s Baby,” and one that resolves with a very sly sense of wit. Played by more than ten babies at various ages, young Kuula is an unusual child, hairy and large for his age, with an early appetite for meat and a curiously harsh quality to his bawling. Bergholm employs some very effective sound design here, giving just a hint of animalistic growling to the kid’s lusty cries.Throughout its modest runtime, “Nightborn” enjoys skipping across the boundary between metaphor and literalism, and then back again. One sequence sees Saga attempting to breastfeed, only to pull the child away from her chest in a spasm of toe-curling agony. Uh oh: blood. In reality, pain and blood is quite a common experience for new mothers. But you’d never know that from widespread breastfeeding propaganda that seeks to maximize the benefits and minimise the difficulties — and it plays very nicely indeed here as a straightforwardly grotesque horror-movie moment, while also simply reflecting a part of the real world rarely shown onscreen.Grint is a fine choice for the role of Jon, as his screen persona works well with the character’s schlubby, well-meaning passivity: Isn’t the “Harry Potter” star exactly the right fit for the sort of man who (possibly) gets cucked by an ancient and malevolent spirit of the forest? A scene with Grint doing traditional “here comes the aeroplane” baby-feeding is a highlight, capitalizing on the actor’s ability to play the blindest of blind optimism.Not to oversell him, however: This is, by some distance, Haarla’s show. That her character is called Saga is a pretty apt bit of nominative determinism: Saga by name, saga by nature. Baby-related trials are heaped upon her with agonizing regularity, and the inadequacy of the other characters’ responses contributes to a sense of gaslighting that almost succeeds in infecting the viewer. Even though you can see it’s not all in her head, it’s disorienting to see everybody else refuse so rigidly to consider that something could really be wrong. But not even a severed finger can jolt Saga’s relatives out of their perception that she’s the problem, not little Kuula.Contributing to this air of unreality is Kari Kankaanpää’s production design, in which everything feels a little heightened and stylized. Where Rosemary in “Rosemary’s Baby” was trapped by the very normality of her bourgeois Upper West Side surroundings, making it impossible to believe in the devil, here Saga’s entire world seems slightly fantastical. How, then, can you tell the difference between fantasy and reality? When was the last time you saw a barely populated hospital, with nobody in a rush and a new mother given a whole ward to herself? And when was the last time you saw someone actually pushing a traditional Silver Cross Balmoral-style pram, outside of a movie?Truly bloodthirsty gorehounds may find the ratio of horror to drama to be skewed a little too much toward the latter: Unlike Samantha Eggar’s anger-babies in David Cronenberg’s “The Brood,” this little guy isn’t racking up much in the way of a bodycount, and he’s more cute than scary. Meanwhile, audiences who savoured the gnarly but still very much arthouse world of “Die My Love” may find the more supernatural elements here to be a bridge too far. Still, that leaves a substantial audience who will find much to enjoy in this grisly yet sensitive take on the old maxim that every baby is different.\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tDua Lipa made a surprise appearance at Berlin Film Festival on Saturday night to accompany her fiancé, Callum Turner, at the world premiere of his new film “Rosebush Pruning.” \n\n\tThe couple celebrated Valentine’s Day on the red carpet, looking so in love as they posed for photographers. Lipa wore a romantic see-through lace gown, while Turner sported a chic brown suit. There were plenty of smiles, laughs and cheek-kisses exchanged before Lipa squeezed Turner’s hands and stepped away, letting him take the spotlight. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCallum Turner and Dua Lipa attend the “Rosebush Pruning” premiere during the 76th Berlinale International Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTurner stars in “Rosebush Pruning,” a biting satire from “Motel Destino” director Karim Aïnouz, alongside Riley Keough, Jamie Bell, Elle Fanning, Lukas Gage, Tracy Letts and Pamela Anderson. All were on hand at the premiere besides Keough and Fanning. \n\n\n\t“Rosebush Pruning” follows four American siblings as they “wallow in isolation and their inherited fortune, eschewing the demands of their blind father and seeking love and validation through each other and their latest designer clothes,” according to the film’s synopsis. “When Jack, the eldest brother and linchpin of this family, announces that he is moving in with his girlfriend Martha, blood ties are severed and Ed is forced to uncover the truth surrounding their mother’s death. Generational lies begin to unravel, and the fabric of this family slowly begins to disintegrate.”\n\n\tEarlier on Saturday at the film’s press conference, Turner was immediately asked about rumors that he may be the next James Bond. “It’s very early for that question,” he said with a slight smirk. “I’m not going to comment on it.”\n\t\n\n\tLetts then took the heat off him by joking, “I’m sorry, I’m the next James Bond!” A relieved Turner replied: “Tracy, I thought you weren’t going to say anything.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCallum Turner and Dua Lipa attend the “Rosebush Pruning” premiere during the 76th Berlinale International Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wuthering Heights” production designer Suzie Davies was excited to get a call from Emerald Fennell, since she’d worked on period dramas from this era before — not to mention on Fennell’s lavish “Saltburn.”\n\n\t“I thought it’d be fun,” Davies says. But Fennell had a different vision for adapting the Emily Bronte classic. Not only did she want the world built on sound stages, this was a story told through the lens how Fennell’s experienced the story as a 14-year-old. “That opened the treasure trove for me, and we could go in all different directions,” Davies says.\n\t\n\n\tFrom building Wuthering Heights to Thrushcross Grange, and even a doll’s house, Davies was in heaven.\n\n\n\tHere she breaks down the film’s key sets and why surfaces needed to be moist, reflective and sweaty.\n\n\tWuthering Heights\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t–\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWuthering Heights, which is in Yorkshire, needed a stable, an upstairs and a kitchen. Even though Davies built it on a soundstage, nature still needed to be ever-present.\n\n\t“That’s why we have a courtyard of rock around the house,” Davies explains. In addition, the arch leading to the house was inspired by Gothic architecture.\n\n\tDavies raised the set by two feet so she could build a drainage system. “We wanted practical effects. So there are rain rigs punched through the ceiling and there’s a tank underneath.”\n\n\tShe kept the colors of the Wuthering Heights interiors muted and almost bruise-like.\n\n\tThe idea of Wuthering Heights was for it to feel bruised and heavy with a brutalist vibe. \n\n\tDuring her research, Davies found the Trefor granite quarry in Northern Wales, which was abandoned and near a “big brutal structure on top of a hill.” Davies says, “It’s got nothing to do with Yorkshire, but it has the essence that Emerald wanted. Once we found that, then we started sort of layering on elements of the Yorkshire vernacular, of those big tiles.” The tiles were wet and shiny. She goes on to say, “There are a lots of modern materials used in traditional ways, and traditional materials used in unconventional ways. Everything’s flipped on its side, just to make the audience feel more uncomfortable.”\n\t\n\n\tThrushcross Grange\n\n\tThis was the Linton family’s estate, and excessive in every way. It also presents itself as this grand luxurious place, but metaphorically is a prison for Cathy.\n\n\tThe Skin Room\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen Cathy is introduced to her bedroom, it’s boasted that the walls are like her skin.\n\n\tAgain, it’s an uncomfortable moment for the character.\n\n\tDavies had swatches and fabrics around her desk. She happened to have a piece of latex. “I think we used it on ‘Saltburn,'” she recalls. It was skin-toned and Davies felt there was something there. \n\n\tOnce she knew she was onto something, Davies asked Robbie to “send high res images of her arms and veins. We printed it. We’ve slightly accentuated her veins.” Davies adds, “We had a go at doing her belly button as well above the fireplace, but that looked a little bit too weird, believe it or not.” The images of her skin were then printed onto the fabric that’s used for the padded wall panels of the bedroom.\n\n\tDavies adds that at the end, as there’s an overhead shot of Cathy on the bed as she is dying, her veins are prominent. “We printed her veins and everything into the carpet as well, just for that top shot, which is even more weird and uncomfortable.”\n\n\tThe Hands\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTake a careful look at “Wuthering Heights” and hands are everywhere, whether it’s shots of the actors, or as part of the decor. “There’s something really sexy about what they’re up to and what’s going on,” Davies says.\n\n\tFor the hands above the fireplace, Davies says she took casts of the art department’s hands to make the ceiling roses in the fireplace and in the panels of the library. “We’ve got the shadow puppets that play another subconscious little story going along in on the top of the library. So they’re sort of placed everywhere in the hope that they’re  little subconscious things. Some people will see them. Others won’t.”\n\n\tThe Dollhouse\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe dollhouse was created by the Mattes and Miniatures crew. They built a 1/12th scale version of the Grange. Davies had the model built first, before building and designing the lifesize Thrushcross Grange, flipping her typical design process.\n\n\tFennell also had the idea that she wanted the Grange to reflect how Edgar liked collecting things.\n\n\tIn designing the Grange, Davies had a rule that everything needed to be ordered and symmetrical. “The windows are far too big. The doorways are far too big. The ceilings are really high. The ceilings are polished plaster. The floors are polished.”\n\t\n\n\tDavies went to town on the garden. “We had real trees and real flowers,” so it smelled like a real garden.\n\n\tSweat\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t–\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf the film looks moist and the surfaces looks reflective, that’s exactly the look Fennell and Davies were going for. “We always wet down those city streets on night shoots to make them look lovely, and we just wanted everything possible to look like it’s sweating.”\n\n\tIn “Wuthering Heights,” Davies and her team rigged water to drip down the rock face and into the house.\n\n\tAt Thrushcross Grange, Davies says, “The skin starts to sweat when she gets ill in the dining room.” She adds, “The baubles are contemporary, plastic spheres that we stuck on the wall in a Regency pattern, but they look like they’re dribbling and falling down the paneling and onto the floor.”\n\n\tWIne Bottle Tower\n\n\tAs Cathy’s father Mr. Earnshaw continues to drink himself to death, Wuthering Heights starts to show cracks. Two wine towers feature in the kitchen to reflect Earnshaw’s state of mind.\n\n\tDavies says, “Emerald said, ‘I want a mound of bottles to show, obviously, that Earnshaw is this wreck and ruin, and is drinking himself to death.'” With that directive, Davies built a tower of wine bottles that were five feet high. “She said, ‘No, ten feet high. I just want to see a wave of bottles.'” Davies and her team built in in a way that cinematographer Linus Sandgren could light through it. “The power of that scene when Martin Clunes is on the floor with those two massive green piles of mountains of booze – Everything with Emerald is ‘keep going and maximalist.'”\n",

    "description": "\n\tJust 24 hours after Sean Baker arrived in Penang, Malaysia, to shoot “Sandiwara” — the Oscar-winning director’s new short film starring Michelle Yeo",
    "body": "\n\tJust 24 hours after Sean Baker arrived in Penang, Malaysia, to shoot “Sandiwara” — the Oscar-winning director’s new short film starring Michelle Yeoh — he threw his initial script out the window.\n\n\t“It was ridiculous,” Baker tells Variety in a quiet corner of the Ritz Carlton in Berlin, where the short premiered on Friday. “It was like exactly what someone from the outside would be writing from their couch in West Hollywood.”\n\n\n\tBaker’s original idea for the short, which is in collaboration with fashion house Self-Portrait’s Residency program — an initiative aimed at bringing together artists from all disciplines to create without boundaries — was a “caper” that saw Yeoh “running from some gangsters,” he says. But once he spent some time in Penang, the director found new inspiration. “It was immediately apparent that this is one of the major foodie destinations in the world,” he says, adding that the city is also “very physically different than what I imagined.”\n\t\n\n\tSelf-Portrait founder Han Chong, who grew up in Penang, wanted to make a film celebrating his roots. “It’s much deeper than just fashion,” he says. “Especially when we have Michelle and Sean, I didn’t want to restrict them with a fashion film. The whole idea is tell a story of my hometown — the culture, the emotion.” \n\n\tShot on an iPhone, “Sandiwara” follows Yeoh as she embodies five different characters — an influencer, food critic, chef, restaurant server and singer (all wearing Self-Portrait clothes) — as their stories intertwine at a Penang food court. For Chong, it was a dream come true to get Yeoh on board, who he sees as “Miss Malaysia.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHan Chong, Michelle Yeoh and Sean Baker at Berlin Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“In Asia, she represents possibility, so everyone looks up to her,” he says. “And I didn’t just want to do a campaign. I wanted her to represent something for our Asian culture on a global stage and also her talents.” \n\n\tEnticed by the lack of creative constraints and the chance to get to work with Yeoh, Baker signed on to the project not long after. “Their energy together was so incredible,” Chong adds. “Both of them just wanted to make this work really well. The amount of time they put in, how generous they were, I was like, ‘No way.'” \n\n\tBelow, Baker tells Variety more about “Sandiwara,” working with Yeoh, life post-Oscars glory — and reveals the premise of his next film.\n\t\n\t\tHow did the idea for “Sandiwara” come to be and what drew you to the project? \t\n\n\tIt was just before I started getting very busy with “Left-Handed Girl,” which takes place in night markets in Taiwan and it was shot on the iPhone as well. So I was like, I can do that, I just came from that. But I quickly learned that I was being a little naive — [Chong] was mentioning night markets and food courts, so I just naturally assumed, ‘Oh, it will be very similar.’ But it’s not, it’s its own thing. And so that discovery was wonderful too, because I was able to spend nine days over there prepping for two days of shooting.\n\t\n\t\tYou met Michelle Yeoh for the first time on set. What was it like working with her? Obviously, you two got along since you presented her with an honorary Golden Bear this week at the festival.\t\n\n\tYou know, it was an instantaneous connection. I did not feel intimidated — I normally do with big stars, so it has to be her personality. She’s just very open. Ever since the shoot, which was late September, we’re text buddies. It quickly became a friendship and I think it’s just because she’s really down to earth. There’s no diva quality whatsoever. So much so that we went two hours over on both nights, and she didn’t even blink. She’s like, “I don’t care, let’s just make this happen. We only have this time, let’s do it.” She was very dedicated to it — she wasn’t phoning it in in any way, shape or form.\n\t\n\t\tThis film sees you return to your roots of shooting on an iPhone, and part of it has you shooting on a bike through the streets of Penang. What was that like?\t\n\n\tWe knew she was on a bike, so I was on a bike too. That’s how we shot a lot of “Tangerine,” going up and down Santa Monica. And we crashed on the first take, and I was like, “Oh, this is not going to go well.” But then we got it. \n\t\n\n\tWe did some of this in “Anora,” but this was almost fully not controlled. We of course had permission to shoot in that big food court, but 95% of the people in the background are real people, those are not hired extras. So to throw Michelle Yeoh, who is an A-lister, in the middle of that was really exciting for me. Because in the past, yeah my actors were known, but they were blending in to a certain degree. Now, the challenge was to be able to get stuff in the same conditions with an A-lister. And I think it’s a testament to just how much she took on these characters, that of course there would be some double takes — like, “Wait a minute, is that Michelle Yeoh there?” — but it wasn’t like, “That’s Michelle Yeoh!” It was questionable. \n\t\n\t\tWhat interests you about the intersection of film and fashion?\t\n\n\t[Fashion] always inspires me because in all of my films, my characters’ wardrobe choices are very intentional and important. But also, I like to be experimenting with style and so this is my way of doing it. Television is such a machine and commercial spots are obviously not yours whatsoever as the director — this fashion world is the only place where it feels like I’m making one of my films. And Han gave me full creative control. The only thing I was questioning the entire time was, “Is this the most G-rated thing I’ve ever done? Are people going to expect her to suddenly strip?” That was the only thing that I was kind of asking myself, like where is the edge? But I feel that because we’re shooting with the iPhone under florescent lights and stuff like that, there’s still a grunge and a grit.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichelle Yeoh in “Sandiwara.”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDo you feel like things have finally calmed down for you since the craziness of “Anora’s” awards run?\t\n\n\tI went right from “Anora” into “Left-Handed Girl” into this, and so there really hasn’t been a lot of breathing room. But it did take a while to process, I have to tell you. And it didn’t help that I was having to suddenly campaign with “Left-Handed Girl.” I was very happy and proud of that movie, but I also don’t know if I could have gone through all of that again. It’s a lot. So to answer your question, Samantha [Quan, his producer and wife] and I can finally take a deep breath and we don’t have the pressure anymore. A lot of the weight of expectations and stuff has been kind of lifted because winning the Palme d’Or was like my dream come true. And that’s not embellishment — that was my one goal in life. So it happened, and then everything else, including the Oscars and the BAFTAs, it was all gravy. And then it was just like, OK cool, so now there’s no reason to fret anymore. We have to stay grounded and we are — I’m not jumping into an $150 million movie, I’m just simply not doing that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave there been offers from studios?\t\n\n\tI was offered development deals, but I very much want to make my films independently. I mean, it would be amazing if Neon in the States would distribute my film again. I’d love to work with them again so much. But we are making our film independently so that I can retain full control in terms of everything from casting to content, and not even have to take one note. Because that drives me up the wall. It’s like, why?  \n\t\n\t\tSo what is your next film? I’ve heard rumors of it being set in Italy and starring Vera Gemma…\t\n\n\tOh, yeah. It’s my love letter to the Italian sex comedies of the ’60s and ’70s, so I’m leaning into that. We want to shoot this year. \n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for “Wuthering Heights,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\t“Wuthering Heights” director Emerald Fennell gave he",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for “Wuthering Heights,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\t“Wuthering Heights” director Emerald Fennell gave her hair and makeup department head, Sian Miller, a mood board of imagery featuring architecture, landscape, fashion, film, photography, food and kids with grass-stained knees. The vision board gave Miller a good idea of the vibe the filmmaker was going for as she brought her longtime obsession with Emily Brontë’s classic 1847 novel, “Wuthering Heights,” to life.\n\t\n\n\tFennell cast Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff and Margot Robbie plays Cathy in this tale of childhood friends turned tortured lovers, kept apart by heartbreaking misunderstandings and their own destructive decisions. When Cathy breaks her ankle while spying on their new neighbor, Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif), and his ward, Isabella (Alison Oliver), she ends up staying at Thrushcross Grange, and Edgar becomes besotted with her. Cathy, who’s gotten a taste of the luxurious life, decides to marry Edgar, although her heart really belongs to Heathcliff. When Heathcliff overhears Cathy telling her maid Nelly (Hong Chau) “it would degrade me to marry Heathcliff,” he  He doesn’t hear the rest of the conversation about how much she loves him, so he leaves town, and Cathy finds herself in a loveless marriage. That is, until Heathcliff returns to stir things up.\n\n\n\tFennell’s script was detail-laden, which helped Miller create the looks that would tell a story of jealousy, vengeance and lust. Robbie had more than 35 hairstyles for Cathy alone — and, in true Fennell style, “Vagina braids” and “Jesus Elordi” were some nicknames for some of those creations. Miller breaks down how the film’s hair and makeup told its own story, and why Robbie didn’t wash her hair for one key scene.\n\t\n\n\t“Jesus Elordi”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen Heathcliff (Owen Cooper) is brought to Wuthering Heights as a boy, he’s a scruffy and dirty orphan. As he grows older, and Elordi’s version of the character is introduced, Miller rubbed the actor in dirt and even added fake blood to make him look bedraggled. “He’s grown up in the stables, and he should be unkempt. He’s going to hide slightly behind his hair,” Miller explains.\n\n\tOver the course of the movie, she had two looks for the actor: “It was ‘Jesus Elordi’ and ‘Darcy Elordi’ as Emerald and I mockingly called it,” she says about Heathcliff’s eventual transformation into a clean-shaven gentleman. “Reading the script, [the long-haired look] really rang out. I had the pleasure of knowing Jacob before [from ‘Saltburn’]; I asked him, ‘Can you just grow everything?” \n\n\tAnd he did. “He comes back a couple of months later and he’s grown this amazing beard,” Miller recalls. “We went, ‘Wow! This is phenomenal! We’ve got to try and keep the beard.'”\n\n\tBut it wasn’t going to be so simple as letting Elordi rock his natural scruff. Why? As is typical of moviemaking, Heathcliff’s arc wouldn’t be shot in order. Nevertheless, Miller persisted. “I was really, really keen to make that work. So I had to convince Emerald that I could recreate the beard in the Moors.”\n\n\tFortunately, she had recently trained with makeup and prosthetics artist Roberto Pastore to learn how to recreate Elordi’s real beard by laying on every individual hair by hand. But, the fake facial hair had to be strong enough to withstand the strong wind and rain planned for the production, so Fennell tested Miller’s handiwork before filming began.\n\n\t“It was a very kind of nail-biting [experience], and Emerald, outside the studio at Elstree, got the effects guys to hose him with, I likened it to a water cannon with a Rolls-Royce engine,” Miller says. “I said, ‘Please stay on. Please stay on. Please stay on.'”\n\n\t“Darcy Elordi”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs mentioned, when Heathcliff finally returns after a five-year absence, he is no longer scruffy and unkempt. He has suddenly come into money and has a new suave look, nicknamed “Darcy Elordi.”\n\n\t“I thought I can just create that style for the Darcy look with him,” Miller says, referencing the iconic character from Jane Austin’s “Pride and Prejudice.” “[Jacob] has great hair to work with and the sideburns. We just knew it was going to suit him, and he would look amazing.”\n\t\n\n\tYoung Heathcliff is missing a tooth, so when Heathcliff returns, Miller worked with prosthetic dental appliance creator Chris Lyons from Fangs Effects in the UK to fill the gap. “He made an overlay, an 18-karat gold tooth, and just slotted it over Jacob’s tooth. When he sat around the table in the dining room, and he’s smoking the pipe and smiles, you just see that little sparkle.”\n\n\tThe Vagina Braid\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs detailed as Fennell’s script was, the “Vagina hair” was not written in. But having worked with Fennell on “Saltburn,” Miller says, “There were talks of vagina early on,” so she wasn’t shocked when the conversation came up.\n\n\tMiller worked closely with production designer Suzie Davies, who said, “‘When we get back to Wuthering Heights, there’s going to be this big fissure in the wall where the house is falling apart, and it’s a vagina.'” In another scene, Isabella is given a gift for Christmas, and it’s a pop-up book; metaphorically, it resembles a vagina. \n\n\tMiller followed suit: “I’d seen something reminiscent of this style in my search — this plait at the back of the head. I thought, ‘If I make it smaller and we dress the hair around it.’ We just called it a ‘Vagina plait.’ That’s what’s great about working with Emerald, you show her things, ‘Oh, vagina plait. Yes, I love that.’ And we gave the hairstyles names. We really spur each other on.”\n\n\tDoll Braids\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen Cathy moves into Thrushcross Grange after her injury, Miller needed to demonstrate a passage of time so that when she returns to Wuthering Heights, there’s a visible transformation.\n\n\t“It’s the softest, and it’s the most subtle,” Miller says of Cathy’s new look. “There are ribbons in there, and they match the ribbons on the rose dress.”\n\n\tWhen she returns to the Grange after marrying Edgar, Isabella’s ribbon room has become Cathy’s dressing room, where she’s told all the dresses are made to her measurement. Then, she’s shown her bedroom where the wallpaper matches her skin — freckles, moles and veins all included.” Isabella also tells her, “There’s hair that I’ve taken from your hair brush that actually is around the top of the bed, and underneath the pedestal tables.”\n\n\tIsabella, who has led a sheltered, almost naïve life, shows Cathy to her dollhouse to present her with a doll, with braids from Cathy’s hair. “It’s a corset braid,” Miller says of the hairstyle, because of the way the ribbons tie at the bottom together like a corset. “The look on Cathy’s face is disturbing, and so begins this endless round of dress up.”\n\t\n\n\tIsabella has a doll version of herself, too, of course, which captured the way her style compared and contrasted with Cathy’s. “The brief there was that she’s childlike, she’s naive, and Emerald wanted her to have this long, fabulous hair, but it had to be kind of frizzy. It had to be kind of wild,” Miller says. “It had to be adorned with these wonderful headdresses, but sort of in contrast to Cathy, who has the silky, straighter, long hair. she wanted to show [Isbaella] as this very doll-like kind of innocent girl, and quite kooky with the little glasses.”\n\n\tAt this point, Cathy and Isabella are both bored. “We can see that when [Cathy’s] sticking the finger in the fish in aspic. It’s all very wonderful, but it’s not where she wants to be. And so it was the hairstyles had to show that,” Miller says. “It’s really about trying to show as many emotions and as many stages of the story arc as possible, and hair really sings out, and says so much about people and where they’re at and what’s going on.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlison Oliver’s wild, frizzy locks contrast Cathy’s sleek braids.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFreckles and Horns\n\n\tThe Yorkshire Moors are Cathy and Heathcliff’s playground as young children, and, as adults, a place where they can be alone, so Miller added a subtle detail: freckles. \n\n\t“They’re exposed to the elements, so they’ve got flushed cheeks,” Miller explains. “Little Cathy (Charlotte Mellington) has freckles, which we then see on the older Cathy.”Miller worked with prosthetic designer Waldo Mason, who scanned both Mellington and Robbie to produce a vacuum-form mask. “I mapped out freckles onto both Charlotte and Margot, and I was able to translate those,” Miller says, noting that she used a bespoke mixture of durable makeup by Skin Illustrator so she could recreate the freckles in the same way every day and do it quickly.\n\n\tMiller says, “No matter what I was doing in this, apart from the freedom to come up with a lot of looks, I knew that what I had to do was also do it quickly, because it was a 51-day shoot, it’s not an infinite amount of time. It was a hell of a lot to do. So the pressure was to come up with as much as possible.”\n\n\tHowever, as Cathy finds herself indoors more often at Thrushcross Grange, the freckles become less prominent.\n\n\tWhat does change is her hair. Heathcliff’s return prompts Cathy to have a more severe look, so Miller put the character in victory rolls, which she nicknamed “horns. The horns allude to the cat-and-mouse game she and Heathcliff play, almost as if she’s taunting him. Miller was inspired by Vivien Leigh’s “Gone with the Wind” look, as that character, like Cathy takes a twisted turn.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCathy’s Death Look\n\t\n\n\tIn Fennell’s adaptation, Cathy dies of sepsis poisoning. She’d been pregnant with Edgar’s child amid her affair with Heathcliff, but after breaking things off with her lover, Cathy one day declares the baby has died inside her, and her health begins to deteriorate.\n\n\t“Emerald said that she wanted the skin to look like wet concrete and to have that tone about it,” Miller says of Cathy’s bedridden look.\n\n\tWhen audiences first see the sepsis on her legs, Miller says, “Emerald was keen that we should try and portray that as accurately as possible.” She adds, “Emerald and I had a meeting with medical advisor, and I’ve done a lot of research into how that can look, and so that was taken from real reference.”\n\n\tMason, who had made the freckles, also made a decal for that look. “I punched it up a bit, and then it was a case of a couple of us just placing them together, sort of bit like a jigsaw down the legs, and then free-handing in between to kind of match it all up,” Miller says. “Margot wouldn’t wash her hair for us, just letting it go in great contrast to everything that we’ve had before.”\n\n\tIn an effort to save Cathy, doctors place leeches over her body in hopes of removing the bad blood. Those were created by the art department. “There was an army of us spticking them in place,” Miller says.\n\n\tIt’s an impactful shot when Heathcliff arrives at Thrushcross Grange and learns she has died. When he gets into the bedroom, Cathy is lying on the bed, covered by a sheet.\n\n\t“Heathcliff comes in and pulls the sheet back, and the contrast between his very livid face — because you can see the exasperation and the flush on his face, cheeks and the sheer desperation that upset everybody,” Miller says. “He’s so alive. He’s never been more alive, and there she is, and it’s the polar opposite.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Animation is no longer the very interesting but a bit eccentric cousin you don’t want to invite at a filmmaker’s wedding. Not only are we now invited to the wedding, we’re setting the guest list.” \n\n\tWith this opening punchline, Kaboom Artistic Director and Berlin EFM Animation Days opening speaker Aneta Ozorek earned cheers from the international crowd of animation professionals gathered under the Mirror Tent before giving the floor to scriptwriter, animation expert and MIFA Pitching sessions’ host Dennis Alme de Visscher for the first Canadian Animation Spotlight at EFM, co-hosted by Telefilm Canada.  \n\t\n\n\tCanada has a long lasting relationship with the animated medium, on both commercial and independent levels. According to numbers shared by Telefilm Canada, Canadian animated films have appeared 10 times in the annual Top 15 Canadian box office performers over the past seven years.\n\n\n\t“We’re seeing explosive growth in animation with funding requests doubling in the last seven years,” added Joyce Richards, advisor & strategic communications. “Since 2017, animation projects generated over $270 million in production volume, and more than 60% of that investment came from Canadian sources.”\n\n\tAnimation is also one of Canada’s most export-driven screen sectors, with 83% of gross sales coming from international markets. “A number far higher than live action films”, underlines Richards.  \n\n\tGoing beyond these numbers, Dennis Alme de Visscher added that co-production agreements and audiovisual treaties were key in developing the Canadian animation landscape. “As of now, Telefilm Canada has collaborations with over 60 countries. And 35 of those treaties grant a special certification, which makes your project eligible as national production in both countries, not just one.” A powerful incentive, especially for animation which often boasts higher production costs. \n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday, Canadian animation was represented by three projects in various development stages, ranging from family-friendly adventure and adult animation to Medieval fantasy with a vintage twist. Producers pitched their projects in front of a supportive and captivated audience, as is always the case with animation crowds. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFifteen Dogs\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFifteen Dogs\n\n\tFrom producers Steven Hoban and Mark Smith (Copperheart Entertainment) comes an adaptation of André Alexis’s Giller Prize–winning novel “Fifteen Dogs,” helmed by Hoban’s long-term collaborator and Academy-Award winning director Chris Landreth (“Ryan”, “Jeu de l’inconscient”). A story that begins with a wager between Greek gods, experimenting on human nature by granting a group of Toronto dogs human intelligence. Shortly after they realise their newfound consciousness, the dogs escape into the city where they navigate shifting loyalties, new language, and emerging identities. Their evolving relationships (especially the bond between Majnoun and Nira) explore sentience, companionship and whether self awareness ultimately brings joy or suffering.\n\n\tAfter several attempts, Hoban managed to put André Alexis’ novel into Landreth’s hands back in 2018. From then on, the two have been building this project as a fully animated cinematic experience. One that, according to the duo, could only be accomplished through animation. “It’s not a family film”, underlined Landreth. “‘Fifteen Dogs’ is a deep, darkly funny story, emotionally powerful and sometimes tragic. We want to turn this absurd premise of gods wagering on dogs, into something that is intensely real.” Throughout his career, Landreth has played with real world physics and proportions to bring forth a form of psychological realism and truth. An artistic shift from CG animation that earned him the Academy Award in 2005 for “Ryan,” a homage to Ryan Larkin, a gifted Canadian animator of the late 1960s and the early 1970s. \n\n\t“‘Fifteen Dogs,’ even though its told through the eyes of canine protagonists, will tackle what human life is really all about,” added Hoban. “We’re working with studio L’Atelier to craft compelling settings and relatable characters, and from what we’ve seen so far, they’ve done an amazing job. Chris is crafting a visually spectacular, devastating film.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEliak\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEliak and the End of the World\n\n\tPresented by Galilé Marion-Gauvin, producer at L’Unité Centrale (which worked on both Jean-François Laguinoie’s “Louise en Hiver” and Pierre Földes’ “Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman”), “Eliak and the End of the World” follows young Eliak in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by the spirits of nature, as she learns to survive this harsh environment. When Tata, her adoptive mother and guardian of the seeds, dies, she becomes the last human on Earth. Consumed by grief, she plunges into the ocean to retrieve her soul. She must choose: stay with her mother or become the oasis they sought. \n\n\tWith “Eliak”, Melanie S. Dubois is set to make her feature directorial debut. “Mélanie is a young and promising director from Montréal,” added Marion-Gauvin, “and I’m happy to share that we’ve secured development funding, and that we are working on a second draft script right now, taking our time to refine and develop the project as best as we can. We’re also looking for different creative partners to collaborate with Mélanie, such as artistic director or co-director.” \n\n\tFor this animation family-friendly project, L’Unité Centrale is also looking for distributors, investors and potential partners. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBeshader\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBeshader\n\n\tFrom director-screenwriter Seth Smith and Nancy Urich comes “Beshader,” a dark medieval fantasy aimed at young adults and teenagers not afraid of a little scare. In a valley lost to permanent night, in a land overtaken by vampiric overlords, an orphaned boy joins a band of rebels to reclaim their homeland and restore the light. \n\n\t“Seth and I have been working on feature film projects for 15 years”, added Urich. “At CUT/OFF/TAIL Pictures, we normally produce live-action, but we’ve also been looking for the thrills from 1980s classics such as ‘Labyrinth,’ ‘Return to Oz’ or even ‘Dark Crystal.’ imaginative projects with a dark edge that aren’t that common nowadays.” \n\n\tThis was the starting point for “Beshader,” a project that Urich and Smith want to build with rotoscope animation. “We are now consulting leaders in the field such as Minnow Mountain, who worked recently with Netflix on ‘Apollo 10 ½’ and with Amazon Prime on ‘Undone’. We’re now at a second draft of the script, and we will soon ask Telefilm Canada for 33% of our budget, and apply to other digital animation tax credits in our province to complete our budget, which is around $5 million. Overall, Canada will provide for 60% of the total budget, and we are looking for sales agents and equity investors to complete the remaining 40%.”\n\t\n\n\tUrich and Smith are also looking for co-producers with expertise in animation.\n\n\tFrom Berlin to Bordeaux\n\n\tBeyond EFM, Québec-Canada have already been announced as the guest countries for Cartoon Movie, the biggest European co-production for animated features. Six projects will be presented to buyers, sales agents, investors and producers alike at this top-tier event, starting March 3 in Bordeaux. \n\n\tFinally, Dennis Alme de Visscher underlined the perks of investing in Canada. “There are some serious tax incentives for international co-producers. From Canada, you can get up to 16% tax incentive. But, as you know, Canada has a lot of different provinces, so you could stack those incentives. British Columbia offers 16%, Ontario 18%, and Québec offers 40%, which is why Montréal has become one of the largest animation hubs in North America.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen the time came for Karim Aïnouz to direct his first English-language feature a few years ago, few would have bet on it being “Firebrand.” A historical drama based on the life of Henry VIII survivor Catherine Parr, it was handsome, well-acted and directed with complete proficiency by the Brazilian arthouse sensualist, but so far from his usual taste for saturated melodrama and eroticism, you’d think he’d been assigned the gig by lottery. After a brief trip home for the hyper-carnal thriller “Motel Destino,” Aïnouz returns to Europe with “Rosebush Pruning,” which on the face of it looks a snugger fit for his sensibilities: a sweating, absurdist family saga of outsize gestures and out-of-bounds desires, rendered in hues so hot and drenched, you half-expect a “wet paint” sign on the screen.\n\t\n\n\tThe more — and more outrageously — it unfolds, however, the less “Rosebush Pruning” feels like it’s in Aïnouz’s wheelhouse. Or, indeed, anyone else’s, given its alluring but thoroughly peculiar jumble of comic, dramatic and generally antic tones, or the increasingly indeterminate target of its hollow social satire. Even the film’s creative DNA is all over the shop: Screenwriter Efthimis Filippou, a regular collaborator of Yorgos Lanthimos, was loosely inspired by Marco Bellocchio’s 1965 debut feature “Fists in the Pocket,” but where you can see that stark, startling anti-bourgeois fable playing out in the deadpan language of the Greek weird wave, Aïnouz’s ripe maximalist touch makes for a different animal entirely, even before you factor in the high-low contrasts of its all-star cast.\n\t\n\n\tAll these clashing elements and impulses, not to mention some droolworthy design contributions, land the film somewhere in the region of a Europudding “Saltburn” — not an unenjoyable proposition, but not a substantial one, and likely to be every bit as divisive with audiences as that sounds. For leading man Callum Turner, it’s a commendably strange, kinky vehicle to drive directly into a storm of James Bond casting rumors. Not that “Rosebush Pruning” turns out to be business as usual for any of his collaborators — including his gifted director, drifting ever farther from the warm romanticism of “Futuro Beach” or “Invisible Life.” \n\n\tThe odd, misleadingly prim title stems from a clumsy proverb made up by Edward (Turner), the neglected, semi-literate middle son of an exceedingly wealthy American family that relocated some years ago to the verdant northeastern coast of Spain. “People are roses, families are rosebushes,” he says in his surly running voiceover. “Rosebushes need pruning.” \n\n\tAs for who he thinks his family could shed, take your pick from its variously louche, dysfunctional fashion-plate members, headed by Tracy Letts’ blind, unfiltered patriarch, usually clad in a scarlet satin bathrobe. Edward’s younger brother Robert (Lukas Gage) spends his days doing little but pining most inappropriately for the attentions of eldest sibling Jack (Jamie Bell), while the stunted, oversexed energy of lone sister Anna (Riley Keough) spits in all directions.\n\n\tWhen we’re told that the children’s mother (Pamela Anderson, surprisingly cast in a small role that more obviously calls for Christine Baranski-style hauteur) died two years ago, we’re inclined to think she’s better off out of it — though perhaps less so on hearing that she was torn apart by wolves in the local Catalonian woods. There’s an air of perverse adult fairytale to this setup, underlined by the lack of explanation as to why four adult siblings in their thirties haven’t managed to break out of the modernist family palace: Extreme wealth, it seems, makes comfortably numb prisoners of those born into it. \n\n\tBut Jack, the most sensible and straitlaced of the lot, may finally be making his escape, thanks to the normalizing influence of his merely quite privileged girlfriend Martha (Elle Fanning). As Jack and Martha look into finding a home of their own, the terse, stolidly watchful Edward — an oddly opaque character to carry the film’s point of view, played with aloof melancholy by Turner — is tacitly envious, having recently made his own fleeting connection with a citizen of the real world. Anna and Robert, however, despair over the imminent disruption of the family unit, and drastic, escalatingly calamitous steps are taken toward maintaining the status quo. \n\t\n\n\tThe fallout brings nasty surprises and broken taboos aplenty, though Filippou’s script actually shocks most effectively when dramatizing more everyday acts of cruelty and elitism. In the film’s most effectively discomfiting scene, when Martha meets the family for a strained lunch, she is ruthlessly sized up and dressed down by Anna for the visible price gap between her self-bought Zara dress and her gifted Bottega handbag. (And that’s before Dad, with calm entitlement, asks Anna to describe their guest’s cleavage.) \n\n\tThat Martha emerges as the most sympathetic figure here is saying something, considering her own spoilt retort to Jack’s hesitancy when they view a multimillion-dollar oceanside mansion: “I refuse to keep begging for the simple things.” “Rosebush Pruning” makes its anti-capitalist points tartly enough in such moments, but the twistier things get, the sillier they get too — while any social commentary begins to feel like a thin cover for so much luridly gross, glossy spectacle. \n\n\tStill, there’s pleasure in the film’s excesses, mainly because Aïnouz and his team present them with such febrile, iridescent beauty. DP Hélène Louvart drowns frame after frame in sticky candy-apple reds, angelica greens and eye-searing ultramarines, the brightness turned way, way up — not that the rolling Spanish landscapes and Rodrigo Martirena’s magazine-dream production design demand the extra help. There’s nary a crease to be seen in Bina Daigeler’s costumes, all covetable, unapproachable and tailored to the gods; Matthew Herbert’s score may be among the lushest ever slathered over such horrible goings-on. Does it all need to be this lustrous? Does “Rosebush Pruning” lose some perspective in all this dazzle? Perhaps. But if you’re going to eat the rich, the film reasons, they may as well be delicious.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe InterContinental Maldives Maamunagau Resort is trading tinsel for tridents this December, unveiling an ambitious holiday program inspired by the myth of “Atlantis: The Lost Kingdom.” The Indian Ocean property, already known for its overwater villas and cinematic sunsets, is transforming into an immersive “Celebration for the Oceans” —  a series of performances, residencies, and dining events designed to blend fantasy with environmental reverence.\n\n\n\tThe resort’s programming, running from Dec. 22 through early January, includes large-scale productions like “Poseidon’s Banquet,”  where guests dine over a reef illuminated to resemble a submerged palace, and nightly mermaid ballets staged in the infinity pool. The season’s finale, on New Year’s Eve, culminates in the dramatic “Trident of Light,” a rising ocean sculpture that ignites a fireworks display across Maamunagau’s lagoon.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMichelin-starred chef Tom Aikens headlines the culinary slate, with a 12-day residency featuring tasting dinners at The Lighthouse, cooking classes and a private yacht journey complete with caviar, champagne  and a stargazing session led by the island’s resident astronomer. UK artist Florence Super will host ocean-themed art workshops and exhibit sustainable works made from recycled materials during her residency, part of the resort’s ongoing emphasis on marine awareness and conservation.\n\n\tProgramming extends beyond fine dining and art: Santa’s island arrival, a kid-focused Pirate Cruise, and interactive experiences with British children’s entertainers Sharky & George round out the family offerings. Wellness guests can opt for Maldivian-inspired spa treatments, ocean detox rituals or sound healing sessions under the stars.\n\n\n\tOver the past few years, the Maldives has quietly become Hollywood’s favorite hideaway — a discreet but ultra-luxury alternative to the usual Aspen or St. Barts circuit. A-listers from Zendaya and Tom Holland to Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have been spotted on the archipelago’s private islands, often sharing sun-drenched glimpses of overwater breakfasts and bioluminescent lagoons. It’s easy to see the appeal: just a seaplane ride from Malé, the InterContinental Maldives Maamunagau Resort has positioned itself at the high end of this cinematic escape market, catering to those who prize privacy, design, and curated experience over overt opulence. The property, built across a 35-acre coral reef atoll, has earned a reputation for its immersive programming — from astronomy sessions and sustainability workshops to chef residencies and private yacht dining.\n\n\tThe destination’s rise coincides with a broader shift in celebrity travel, where the emphasis has moved from visibility to retreat. In the Maldives, anonymity becomes luxury’s final frontier — a place where global names can go offline without losing access to world-class cuisine or cinematic settings. The InterContinental’s “Atlantis: The Lost Kingdom” concept plays directly into that fantasy: a self-contained world that’s both exclusive and experiential.\n\n\tCheck out a full teaser of their festive programming below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile AI has been dividing Hollywood, Michael Mann is agnostic when it comes to it. In fact, he will likely be experimenting with it in “Heat 2.”\n\n\t“I don’t I experiment with technology gratuitously,” Mann said at a press conference hosted at the Lumiere Film Festival in Lyon, where he received the 2025 Lumiere Award from the hands of French actor Isabelle Huppert last night. “When I have a dramatic need or esthetic need for it, then I go deep into what I need.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “Aging and de-aging may be very important in the next film,” Mann said, referring to the long-anticipated sequel to “Heat” which he said on Friday during a wide-ranging masterclass that will hopefully start filming next summer. \n\n\n\tMann also addressed the fact that “Heat 2” has moved from Warner Bros. to Amazon MGM-owned United Artists and producer Scott Stuber.\n\n\t“Heat 2” is an “expensive movie to make, but I believe it should be made at the proper size and scale,” Mann said. “It’s going to shoot in Chicago, Los Angeles, Paraguay, and possibly some parts in Singapore.”\n\n\t“People make dramas at a certain budget level, because of the costs, not because of anybody being greedy. If it was at a lower price, I could have made it anywhere. But it’s complex. I can’t get into all the politics of it.”\n\n\tUnlike “Ferrari,” his movie starring Adam Driver which was sold to Amazon after being produced independently and didn’t get released theatrically in several international territories, “Heat 2” will have a different fate. \n\n\t“We moved from Warner Bros. to Amazon and United Artists, but it will be absolutely released theatrically, in the United States, probably in about 4,000 cinemas and for at least 45 days,” Mann said. \n\t\n\nMichael Mann on #Heat2 moving from Warner bros to Amazon MGM:“Heat 2” is an “expensive movie to make, but I believe it should be made at the proper size and scale.

People make dramas at… pic.twitter.com/rPdlUjiIw9— Elsa Keslassy (@ElsaKeslassy) October 18, 2025\n\n\n\tRegarding the plot of “Heat 2,” Mann said it would move back and forth in time, before and after the events of the original film. The story will pick up one day after the movie ends, “only Val Kilmer’s alive, and he has to flee the United States.”\n\n\t“The characters of ‘Heat’ are so alive to me. An idea occurred to me, based on the rapport between two lethal adversaries, Pacino’s Hannah and De Niro’s McCauley, about how to do both before the events of ‘Heat’ and after.” He pointed out that Hannah and McCauley were changed by events that occurred in 1988, when Hannah was a cop in Chicago and McCauley had “a wife, he has a stepdaughter, he has a nuclear family that he’s very attached to.”\n\n\tMann also gave an update on his following project set against the backdrop of the 1968 Battle of Hué, during the Vietnam War, which he’ll do after “Heat 2.” The film will be based on a book by Mark Bowden, the helmer of “Black Hawk Down.” “It’s a very human, a very powerful piece, and I spent a lot of time and talked with a lot of survivors of that battle,” Mann said, adding that the book had also inspired Al Pacino’s character from “Heat” — “Al Pacino’s history, that he was a Marine who was in the Battle of Hue in 1968 and that in 1988 he’s still suffering from PTSD.”\n\n\tThat movie will be “like “Rashōmon” with several perspectives, several points of both the American side and on the Vietnamese side,” Mann teased. \n\n\tMann also said during yesterday’s masterclass that he’ll produce a Western titled “Comanche” which will be directed by Scott Cooper, whose latest film “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” played this week at Lumiere Festival.\n\n\tLater on Saturday, Mann concluded his visit to Lyon with a Lumiere Festival tradition. Following every other Lumiere Award honoree, Mann set off to reimagine “Workers Leaving The Lumière Factory in Lyon.”  The 1895 French short written and directed by Louis Lumière is believed to be the first motion picture ever made. \n\nWatch Michael Mann in action as he remakes \"Workers Leaving The Lumière Factory in Lyon,\" the 1895 French short by Louis Lumière.

A number of famous French actors, including Isabelle Huppert, Laurent Lafitte, Marina Fois and Michelle Laroque, took part in the experiment. The Lumiere Festival wraps Oct. 19. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 2025 Lumière Film Festival reached its climax Friday night with the presentation of its top honor, the Lumière Award, to Michael Mann, celebrating the filmmaker of “Ali,” “Heat” and “The Insider.”\n\n\tThe ceremony kicked off with a surprise message from Quentin Tarantino, projected on the Amphithéâtre’s giant screen. “It seems we have a message from someone,” said Lumière festival director and Cannes chief Thierry Frémaux, introducing an email from Tarantino – one of the first Lumière Award laureates, honored back in 2013 – welcoming Mann “into the club.”\n\t\n\n\tAs he took to the stage to receive his award from the hands of 2024 laureate Isabelle Huppert, Mann was visibly moved. “Now I know why so many directors like Clint Eastwood and Tim Burton are speechless when they come up here. This is fantastic. Thank you so much.”\n\n\n\tHe went on to recall the moment he decided to become a filmmaker: “The idea to make films entered my life when I was 19 or 20, on a cold and brilliantly clear winter night in Wisconsin after screening a silent film. I was walking downhill from the campus buildings and it was as if the skies parted, then a giant hand came down and said, you should direct films.”\n\n\tHe said it was “one of those rare moments in all of our lives when profound truth takes you over and there’s no negotiation, no second thinking, this is what you’ve got to do. And I’m profoundly fortunate to have found artistic work I feel so impelled to do throughout my lifetime.”\n\n\tMann closed his speech with gratitude: “I receive this wonderful honor with gratitude on behalf of the spirit we all share to make dramatic cinema – and also on behalf of that same imaginative spirit residing within every person here, to be impacted upon, transported by, and aroused by all that cinema does. Tonight will be an enduring memory for me. I am totally, profoundly grateful for this honor. Thank you very much.” Wiping away tears as he stood next to Huppert with his Lumiere Award, he thought of his father. He “was here in WW2 and fought the Battle of the Bulge. He loved France and everything French. If he could be here tonight it would be amazing,” Mann said. \n\t\n\nMichael Mann was visibly moved last night as he received the #Lumiere2025 Award at Thierry Fremaux’s festival in Lyon. Standing next to Isabelle Huppert, he said \"My father was here in WW2 and fought the Battle of the Bulge. He loved France and everything French. If he could be… pic.twitter.com/FJTLc8SA0l— Elsa Keslassy (@ElsaKeslassy) October 18, 2025\n\n\n\tBefore handing over the award to Mann, Isabelle Huppert, last year’s laureate, paid homage to Mann, calling him “a filmmaker who listens to his actors, looks at them with curiosity, and offers them roles that both challenge and reveal them.”\n\n\t“To receive the Prix Lumière here in Lyon is not only a reward, it’s a return to the source — to that original light of which you have become one of the great heirs,” she said. “Thank you, Michael Mann, for continuing to surprise us, to unsettle us, to share our obsessions, and for making cinema a place of tireless exploration, always renewed. Thank you for your demanding, lyrical, and sensual body of work, and for your fidelity to the light itself. May that light continue to be with you. And long live cinema.”\n\nIsabelle Huppert never disappoints. She delivered a beautiful and thoughtful speech to present Michael Mann with the #Lumiere2025 tribute: \"Thank you, Michael Mann, for continuing to surprise us, to unsettle us, to share our obsessions, and for making cinema a place of tireless… pic.twitter.com/9fpqiEsfh0— Elsa Keslassy (@ElsaKeslassy) October 18, 2025\n\n\n\tThe celebration also showcased a richly layered montage of clips from Mann’s movies, a short film delving into the making of “Heat,” as well as a clip retrospective of cult classics and contemporary films that have marked 130 years of cinema history. Robert Redford and Diane Keaton, who passed away this year, were also remembered during the ceremony. A festival regular, French singer Camelia Jordana performed “We Shall Overcome” a capella and a song from Charles Aznavour.\n\n\tMann is the latest in a long list of American filmmakers honored at the Lumiere Festival, alongside Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton and Clint Eastwood. Introducing him on stage earlier today, Fremaux said Mann may not have won an Oscar, but “he’s here. He is in our lives. His films are here and we’ve been living with them for a number of years now. He’s one of those completely unpredictable filmmakers whose work is a series of bravura pieces.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDick Van Dyke‘s record as oldest performer to win a Daytime Emmy didn’t last long. At this year’s ceremony, legendary British broadcaster, writer and naturalist Sir David Attenborough has made history, winning the 2024 Daytime Emmy award for outstanding daytime personality – Non-Daily — for Netflix’s “Secret Lives of Orangutans” at the age of 99. (He turns 100 next May.)\n\n\tThat makes him a hair older than Van Dyke, who previously set the record last year at 98 when won the guest performer in a daytime drama series Daytime Emmy last year via his spot on Peacock’s “Days of Our Lives.” \n\t\n\n\tAttenborough’s win was one of three for Netflix’s “Secret Lives of Orangutans,” which also won directing team for a single camera daytime non-fiction program.\n\n\n\tAttenborough won over Brad Bestelink, “Living with Leopards” (Netflix); Andi Sweeney Blanco, Courtney Dober, Rob North & Kirin Stone, “The Fixers” (BYUtv); Anthony Mackie, “Shark Beach with Anthony Mackie: Gulf Coast” (National Geographic); and Martha Stewart, “Martha Gardens” (Roku).\n\n\tAttenborough is known as one of the world’s most famous natural sciences broadcasters, starting with 1954’s “Zoo Quest.” As a narrator, his more recent successes include include “Planet Earth” and its sequels, “Blue Planet” and its sequels, “The Green Planet,” “Wild Isles,” “Dinosaurs: The Final Day With David Attenborough,” “Life In Colour,” “Frozen Planet” and more. \n\n\tHere’s the logline for “Secret Lives of Orangtutans”: “Orangutans are not just one of our closest relatives, they’re perhaps more relatable to us than any other great ape. Narrated by David Attenborough, this film follows a remarkable group of orangutans in the pristine jungles of Sumatra. At the centre of this story is 8 year old Eden, who’s about to embark on the most challenging moment of her life.”\n\t\n\n\tThe 52nt annual Daytime Emmy Awards took place on Friday, Oct. 17, at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Faith and Family,” the series premiere of CBS’ “Boston Blue.”\n\n\tWhen “Blue Bloods” came to an end ",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Faith and Family,” the series premiere of CBS’ “Boston Blue.”\n\n\tWhen “Blue Bloods” came to an end last year after 14 seasons, there were multiple questions viewers still had about what happened to the Reagan clan. Luckily, with spinoff “Boston Blue,” led by Donnie Wahlberg’s Dannie Reagan, they got one big answer in the first moments of the Oct. 17 premiere.\n\n\n\tIn the finale, Danny finally asked his longtime partner, Maria Baez (Marisa Ramirez) to get pizza. And in the first minutes of the premiere, he was shown in bed with Baez; their banter returned, this time with a romantic twist.\n\t\n\n\t“Once we realized we were getting a chance to continue Danny Reagan’s story, Brandon and I looked at what the dangling threads were from the finale, and what was owed. Obviously, the big one was what happened when they went out for pizza,” co-showrunner Brandon Margolis tells Variety. “We really did want to feel like this show is continuing that story in fairly real time. It’s going to be about a year since the finale was off the air, so if Danny and Baez were together, where are they at, and what would that look like? How could that potentially complicate a journey going from New York to Boston? It was important to us we pay service to that and continue to establish that relationship.”\n\n\tWhile Ramirez hasn’t yet signed on to more episodes, the relationship will continue, Sonnier confirms. “Long-distance relationships are a thing. I think we can expect to play that relationship through and really get a sense of where they are in the progression of this relationship that we’ve been watching for a decade,” he says. “It’s a four-hour drive!”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMika Amonsen as Sean Reagan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCBS\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the premiere, Danny pairs up with Detective Lena Silver (Sonequa Martin-Green), the eldest daughter of a prominent law enforcement family — something he knows a thing or two about — in Boston. He’s taking on a new role with the Boston Police Department in order to stay close to his son, Sean (Mika Amonsen), after he suffers an injury while on the job as a police officer.\n\n\tOne big difference from “Blue Bloods” is that Sean has been recast; while Andrew Terraciano played the character for 292 episodes of “Blue Bloods,” Mika Amonsen has taken over the role for the spinoff.\n\n\tWe love Andrew and the work he did over the years on ‘Blue Bloods.’ Really, it came down to we’re telling a new chapter in both of their lives. It’s not just Sean who has joined the family business as it were and is turning over this new leaf, but it’s also now Danny Reagan is the father to a cop, which he’s never been before,” explains Margolis. “So there are all these new storytelling lanes to explore. It felt like there was an organic opportunity to bring in a new performance with a new energy, to help dramatize that change. It is the same character, it’s the same relationship, but it’s also completely different. We love what Mika has brought to Sean, this vulnerability, yet this desire to prove himself. It’s just been great to watch it come to life.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSonequa Martin-Green as Lena Silver, Bridget Moynahan as Erin Reagan Boyle, and Donnie Wahlberg as Danny Reagan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCBS\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe show will have a similar tone to “Blue Bloods” and will likely include more familiar faces. Bridget Moynahan’s Erin Raegan appeared in the premiere, arriving in Boston to make sure Danny was okay, which seems to be just the start.\n\n\t“Can we expect some family members? Can we expect some visits and some trips? Yes, we can,” co-showrunner Brandon Sonnier adds. “We truly mean that we are an expansion of the universe. It’s not just a run-of-the-mill spinoff. It is a different look at a different dynastic law enforcement family through the eyes of the Reagans. But the Reagans exist. They are still out there in the world, living those lives that we watched for so long.”\n\n\tPlus, every episode will feature a family dinner — the Silver family’s Shabbat dinner, which was part of the premiere, which Danny and Erin excitedly joined.\n\t\n\n\t“We will have Shabbat dinner every episode. We hope to honor the original show and their Sunday dinners were so much a fabric of what that show was about, what that family was about,” says Sonnier. “One of the things Donnie would always tell us about was how many real-life law enforcement people he would meet over the course of working on ‘Blue Bloods’ would express how much they appreciated that the Reagan family reminded them of their family. They would sit down and they would have dinner. This is an organic way to continue that universe. It’s something we do. I sit down to dinner as often as possible with my family. I have four young children. Everyone’s got baseball and dance and all the things that people have. But as often as we can, we sit down and we do celebrate Shabbat, so Friday is our time that we get to connect as a family.”\n\n\t“Boston Blue” airs at 10 p.m. ET on CBS and streams on Paramount+ the next day.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBlumhouse‘s horror sequel “Black Phone 2” dialed into $10.7 million across Friday and preview screenings, heading for a No. 1 opening. Meanwhile, Aziz Ansari’s comedy “Good Fortune” isn’t seeing much luck in a third place debut, as a sleepy October box office trudges towards the end of the month.\n\n\tUniversal has “Black Phone 2” in 3,411 North American locations for opening weekend, projecting a three-day total of $24.4 million. That’d be within pre-weekend tracking estimates and a hair ahead of the original “Black Phone,” which debuted to $23.6 million in 2022. The sequel, which sees Ethan Hawke return as a serial killer known as the Grabber, also gets a grosses boost from nabbing some premium large format auditoriums — which carry higher ticket prices — from “Tron: Ares.”\n\t\n\n\tBlumhouse is looking for a box office bounce-back to end the year after fielding a disappointing 2025 slate of “Wolf Man,” “The Woman in the Yard,” “Drop” and “M3GAN 2.0” — each of which carried a modest price tag, but ultimately failed to break out in theaters. The R-rated “Black Phone 2” will easily notch the Blumhouse’s biggest opening of the calendar, but the Scott Derrickson-directed sequel is also one of its costlier productions at a $30 million production budget.\n\n\n\tAfter this start, “Black Phone 2” will have to show staying power to end up a theatrical success. Critics and audiences are both positive, though slightly chillier than returns for the first entry. Audience survey firm Cinema Score polled a “B” grade among ticketbuyers, a tick down from the “B+” grade for the 2022 original. The first “Black Phone” was a sleeper hit, putting up a nearly 4x multiplier on its debut to finish with $90 million domestic. “Black Phone 2” will aim for a similarly long tail, positioned as the premier horror release through the rest of Halloween season. As for Blumhouse, the banner still has one more sequel, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” coming in December from Universal.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Lionsgate’s release of “Good Fortune” is headed for the lower side of projections, forecasting an opening of $5.9 million from 2,985 locations. The Aziz Ansari feature, which the comedian wrote, directed and stars in, earned just $2.4 million across Friday and preview screenings.\n\n\tThat’s a muted kick-off for the $30 million production, which comes despite a starry cast of Keanu Reeves, Seth Rogen, Sandra Oh and Keke Palmer, plus solid reviews and positive buzz among audiences (Cinema Score turned in a “B+” grade). It speaks to the difficulty of opening an original R-rated comedy in the current theatrical landscape, though there was a feel-good story to start the year with Sony’s “One of Them Days” ($50 million domestic total).\n\n\tIn second, Disney’s “Tron: Ares” earned $3 million on Friday and is expecting a sophomore outing of $11 million for a 65% drop. North American total looks to hit $54 million through its first 10 days. After a disappointing domestic debut and meagre turnout overseas, the sci-fi sequel is fading too fast to have any hope of recouping its $180 million production budget in theaters.\n\n\tIn a tight race for fourth, Warner Bros.’ awards favorite “One Battle After Another” is currently expected ahead after earning another $1.1 million on Friday, down 45% from its daily total last week. Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio’s very contemporary epic has shown good week-to-week holds, but the film has only earned $59 million in North America through 22 days of release. At a production budget north of $130 million, it’s estimated to lose around $100 million theatrically. \n\n\tParamount’s “Roofman” is falling to fifth place, earning $1.1 million on its second Friday. The Channing Tatum caper is looking at a $3.6 million sophomore outing, which would mark a 55% drop from its opening. Domestic gross is expected to hit $15.4 million through Sunday — a muted run, even against a slim $19 million production budget.\n\n\tAlso opening this weekend, Angel Studios has the World War II thriller “Truth & Treason” in 2,106 venues. The PG-13-rated drama earned $1.1 million on Friday and looks headed to a $2.8 million opening weekend to land in sixth on domestic charts. Cinema Score turned in a glowing “A” grade — par for the course for an Angel release.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Amazon MGM is expanding its R-rated campus drama “After the Hunt” to 1,238 locations after opening in New York and Los Angeles last weekend. The film earned about $650,000 on Friday and is headed for seventh place. Directed by Luca Guadagnino, “After the Hunt” sports a high-profile cast of Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri and Amazon gave it a presence at the industry gathering Cinema Con back in April. But negative reviews out of a Venice Film Festival premiere in August seem to have hobbled the film. Audiences don’t like it much at all, with Cinema Score turning in a “C-” grade.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNewcomers triumphed at the 23rd Morelia Film Festival (FICM) on Oct. 17 where a good number of first features took home the top prizes at this edition. Environmental thriller “The Reserve” (“La reserva”) by Pablo Pérez Lombardini scooped Best Feature, Director and Actress (Carolina Guzmán).\n\n\tPérez Lombardini’s debut feature first caught people’s attention at Ventana Sur last year. He not only takes home Ojo statuettes but also receives awards in cash and kind. \n\t\n\n\tBased on real-life testimonies from environmental defenders, “The Reserve” follows a forest ranger’s unwavering fight to protect the forest encircling her remote village. Filmed with non-pros in a rural community in Chiapas, the pic captures the urgent, ongoing struggle faced by conservationists throughout Latin America.\n\n\n\tMore than 100 films made up the competition this edition. Hailed by Alfonso Cuarón as “a cultural landmark, not only for Morelia but for all of Mexico” and by Guillermo del Toro as “an essential platform for Mexico and global cinema… and one of the most important cultural events in the world,” the festival was founded and is still led by Daniela Michel.\n\n\tThe festival, which began Oct. 10 and wraps on Oct. 19, featured a constellation of international guests presenting their films throughout the week.

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance employees are facing a broad across-the-board culling under David Ellison’s new management regime the week of Oct. 27, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\tMajor job cuts have been expected even before the Skydance Media-Paramount Global deal closed, as part of Ellison and his team’s goal of slashing upwards of $2 billion in costs. Previously, the company had been targeting layoffs by early November. The new round of cuts is expected to eliminate around 2,000 jobs in the U.S., with additional layoffs internationally.\n\t\n\n\tAt an Aug. 7 press conference in New York, just hours after the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount merger officially closed, Jeff Shell, the ex-CEO of NBCUniversal who is now president of Paramount Skydance, told reporters that the company would make cost cuts and layoffs as swiftly as possible and be disclosed by the company’s third-quarter 2025 earnings report to investors in November. On Friday, Paramount Skydance announced it will report Q3 financial results on Nov. 10 after the market closes.\n\n\n\tLike other traditional media companies, Paramount — parent of CBS, Paramount Pictures, Paramount+ and Pluto TV, MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and BET — has seen longer-term downturns in traditional advertising and distribution revenue as pay-TV subscribers shift toward streaming. \n\n\tAs of Dec. 31, 2024, according to Paramount’s most recent 10-K annual filing with the SEC, the company had about 18,600 full- and part-time employees in 32 countries worldwide. (Two years earlier, Paramount’s headcount was 24,500.) Prior to the closing of the Skydance deal, Paramount made additional layoffs, including a 3.5% reduction of its domestic staff in June. Meanwhile, Skydance’s website says it has “more than 500” employees.Even as Paramount Skydance is gearing up to slash jobs, it has inked new deals investing more heavily in content. A week after Skydance took over, Paramount announced a $7.7 billion seven-year deal for exclusive UFC rights, a deal with Activision to make a movie based on “Call of Duty,” and the acquisition of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press for a reported $150 million. The company also recently lured the Duffer Brothers, creators of “Stranger Things,” over from Netflix with a new four-year exclusive pact to make movies, shows and streaming programming.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Ellison — chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance — is angling to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in what would be a much larger M&A action than the takeover of Paramount Global. WBD reportedly rejected Paramount’s $20-per-share offer as too low. The Ellison family has 100% voting control over Paramount Skydance; the Paramount-Skydance deal was largely bankrolled by Oracle founder Larry Ellison (David’s father).\n\n\tEllison has made a series of C-level hires since the deal closed, including Makan Delrahim, who advised Skydance on its acquisition of Paramount Global, as chief legal officer; former Meta exec Dane Glasgow as chief product officer; and Roku’s Jay Askinasi as chief revenue officer. Other appointments include Cindy Holland, Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, who play key roles at Paramount’s streaming and film divisions. George Cheeks, who oversaw CBS before the deal, has remained at the company with the new title of “Chair of TV Media.”\n\n\tIn a July 2024 presentation to investors after the Skydance deal with Paramount and Shari Redstone’s National Amusements Inc. was announced, Shell said the Skydance team, working with consulting firm Bain & Co., had identified at least $2 billion in potential annualized cost savings at the combined company. At the time, Shell indicated much of those cost cuts will come from its linear TV business.\n\n\tParamount’s plans to commence layoffs the week of Oct. 27 were reported previously by Deadline.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBased on a true story of German resistance to the Third Reich during World War 2, “Truth and Treason” plays it conventionally straight. The familiar elements of a historic film telling an epic story are all there: the righteous hero, the conflicted villain, the systemic violence. There are fiery speeches, chase scenes and tense moments. But Matthew Whitaker’s film never surprises at any point during its running time, failing to add any singular artistic flair. While telling a compelling story, it plays like so many other films about that dark time in not-so-distant European history. \n\t\n\n\tHelmuth Hübener (Ewan Horrocks) is a religious 17-year-old living an ordinary life with his family in Hamburg — as ordinary as can be during the troubled time the film takes place. He goes to school, plays with his friends and even gets a job at a local government office. Then he starts questioning what was happening around him. The bishop in his church begins to pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler before his sermons. His inclusive Mormon church bans Jews from entering its premises. One day, he discovers that one of closest friends, Solomon Schwarz (Nye Occomore), has been abducted by the state for being Jewish. When his older brother brings home a radio that plays stations from outside Germany, especially the BBC, he starts to realize that what he’s being told is all lies and propaganda. \n\n\n\tAs a studious and smart young man, Hübener has a knack for oratory and writing influenced by his love of reading. He uses those skills and what he learns listening to the news on the radio to write pamphlets about the truth of the war. He enlists two of his friends, Karl-Heinz Schnibbe (Ferdinand McKay) and Rudi Wobbe (Daf Thomas) to distribute them all over Hamburg. There’s a propulsive energy to those early scenes. Whitaker, working from a screenplay he wrote with Ethan Vincent, manages to create some tension-filled moments. What happens to Schwaz is not overtly shown. The audience is only privy to his fear in the moments leading up to his abduction — and to Hübener’s devastating discovery in the aftermath — although there’s plenty of violence, with many fist fights and beatings resulting in blood-soaked faces as Hübener deals with the wrath of Nazi sympathizers in his community, including his own stepfather (Sean Mahon). \n\t\n\n\tTrue to the facts, the courageous teenager is eventually caught by the Gestapo. The second half of the film dissolves in a dreary interrogation and torture narrative. As the investigator, Rupert Evans takes a larger role in the narrative. At first, he can’t fathom that this teenager is working alone, yet as he gets to know him, a sense of admiration creeps in. This part of the film is much more obvious and less energetic than what precedes it. Still, Horrocks and Evans match each other well as the relationship between captive and jailer is explored. \n\n\tDespite these mostly persuasive elements, “Truth and Treason” is ultimately an old-fashioned period piece with epic aspirations. The characters and narrative are accompanied by sweeping, intrusive music that tries hard to dictate to the audience exactly how to feel at every beat of the story. The actors speak in clipped English accents that seem jarring to the German story. The script does not allow for shading to the characters, with the exception of Evans’: They are presented either as good-hearted and supportive of Hübener or outright odious fascists out to get him. \n\n\t“Truth and Treason” is a well-intentioned, competently made film that never transcends the safety of its own conventions. Whitaker makes a sincere film full of admiration for Hübener’s courage and idealism. However, sincerity cannot make up for stereotypical storytelling. This is a dutiful attempt at re-creating the life of a noble man that nonetheless does not offer its audience much in the way of art or entertainment. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” star Michael Che is speaking out against the suspension of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which began on Saturday as a result of the now month-long government shutdown.\n\n\t“This SNAP freeze is really fucked up,” Che wrote in an Instagram post Saturday. “And I keep seeing a lotta racist videos celebrating (mostly black) families not being able to buy groceries. There’s this weird idea that since some people have taken advantage of welfare benefits in the hood, NOBODY should receive help, at all? This country is built on greedy motherfuckers taking shortcuts and gaming the system to their benefit, but for some reason, when poor people find a way to turn a nickel into a dime, they’re judged more severely, especially Blacks.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “I [know] the hustle is to hate each other here so we can fight in the comments and up our engagements, but let’s draw the line at feeding the poor. I grew up on free cheese and powdered milk and waiting for your friends to leave the store so they won’t see me pay with stamps. That shit ain’t as glamorous as it sounds. I promise.”\n\n\n\tThe government shut down on Oct. 1 after Republicans and Democrats failed to pass a funding bill for government services as the previous federal budget expired. In the Senate, Republicans are short 60 votes to pass the proposed bill, which gives Democrats a chance to fight back on key issues.\n\n\tThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, sent out a memo on Oct. 26 stating that benefits would be halted on Nov. 1. However, two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island both ruled on Friday that the Trump administration, by law, is required to use contingency funds to pay out for at least a portion of SNAP benefits. The Trump administration has until Monday to respond to the ruling.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Blue Book of China TV Series 2025, launched at the Tokyo International Film Festival’s TIFFCOM market by Peking University’s Chen Xuguang and Zhejiang University’s Fan Zhizhong, outlines an industry undergoing structural reinvention and creative renewal.\n\n\tDespite global economic uncertainty and fierce competition from short-video and gaming platforms, drama registrations rose in 2024, signaling that investor confidence in long-form television remains resilient. The report identifies a quality-driven transformation as the sector’s defining direction, anchored by stronger storytelling, diversified IP, and improved production standards.\n\t\n\n\tIP adaptation continues to dominate, accounting for about 60% of new scripted series. Literary and online fiction have become vital sources of material, driving character-focused, high-craft dramas such as “The Tale of Rose,” “War of Faith” and “The Misplaced.” Warm realism remains a key creative force, reflected in “She and Her Girls,” “Romance in the Alley” and “A Common Person’s Song,” which blend social commentary with emotional optimism.\n\n\n\tCostume dramas are adapting faster pacing and modular storytelling inspired by online short-form content. The Blue Book reports that China’s mini-series market grew from RMB36.86 billion ($5.1 billion) in 2021 to RMB373.9 billion ($51.5 billion) in 2023 and could surpass RMB1 trillion ($137 billion) by 2027. This growth has pushed traditional producers to experiment with condensed narrative structures while retaining cinematic depth.\n\n\tConcluding, Fan highlighted Wong Kar-wai’s “Blossoms Shanghai” as emblematic of the medium’s artistic resurgence and industrial maturity. “Quality is king,” he said, summing up the Blue Book’s message that Chinese television’s future depends on fusing disciplined storytelling with the agility demanded by a rapidly evolving screen economy.\n\t\n\n\tIn the Q&A session, Fan described the microdrama sector as “production without barriers,” a creative democratization and an economic shock that forces established studios to rethink audience engagement and monetization models.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the Tokyo International Film Festival’s TIFFCOM market, the launch of the Blue Book of China Film 2025 – jointly edited by Peking University’s Chen Xuguang and Zhejiang University’s Fan Zhizhong – framed Chinese cinema at a crossroads between crisis and renewal.\n\n\tAccording to the report, annual box office revenue in 2024 fell 22.6% year-on-year to RMB42.5 billion ($5.75 billion), with admissions down 28.6% despite 91,000 active screens. Audiences have fragmented across short-form video, gaming and streaming, while the average viewer age continues to rise. Yet mid- to low-budget realist dramas, family-themed films and comedies have helped sustain theatrical momentum.\n\t\n\n\tThe 2025 edition identifies several dominant trends. Female-directed and family-ethics dramas have reshaped mainstream storytelling through films such as “YOLO,” “Something Wonderful” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” Comedy accounted for 36% of box-office revenue in 2024, driven by titles like “Successor” and “Johnny Keep Walking.” Documentaries such as “Caught by the Tides,” “The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru” and “Ms. Hu’s Garden” signaled a revival of cultural and social nonfiction. AI-driven production and film-game convergence have emerged as new growth engines, exemplified by “Black Myth: Wukong” and “Ne Zha 2,” which blend cinematic storytelling with interactive structures.\n\n\n\tThe Blue Book concludes that while record-breaking grosses like “Ne Zha 2” demonstrate commercial potential, the future depends on diversified financing, balanced scale and greater integration of AI and animation into industrialized production. Chen closed by asking whether China can maintain its box-office peaks, globalize its myths, and ultimately build its own large-scale creative ecosystem – its own Disney.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the post-presentation Q&A, Chen addressed the industry’s financial volatility, noting that rising budgets have sharply increased risk and spoke about the imbalance between investment and returns. He urged studios to move toward sustainable “serial operation,” diversifying revenue through licensing, merchandising and cultural-tourism tie-ins, while supporting a stable ecosystem of medium- and low-budget films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Vitaly Mansky’s arresting portrait of life during wartime, “Time to the Target,” he allows audiences to breathe, to absorb the smallest details and even, somehow, to laugh as his camera focuses on Lviv, in western Ukraine, a place once thought of as relatively safe.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe advent of Russian cruise missiles and Shahed drones have ended that illusion at this point in the three-year war on Ukraine, of course. But Mansky still presents daily life much as it’s always been – a military band practicing for a memorial, a wedding, a theater performance hastily ended for an air raid, a new mother whose baby was born just as the sirens died down.\n\t\n\n\t“This film doesn’t aim to convince or change anyone’s mind,” Mansky says. “It offers the opportunity to experience the war as it has become part of the fabric of civilian life.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Time to the Target”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Hypermarket Film\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor that reason, he adds, he’s comfortable with a film that runs three hours and won’t be for everyone.\n\n\t“I’m counting on audiences in the cinema who have consciously come to see this film. And most importantly, on viewers 30-50 years of age who (hopefully) have never had such an experience in their lives.”\n\n\tYet the daily rituals in “Time to the Target” are universal, while also being uniquely Ukrainian.\n\n\tGrieving families gather to honor a fallen father or son. But the gravediggers complain they have no more space at Lviv’s military cemetery, which contains the remains of soldiers from centuries of wars.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Time to the Target”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Hypermarket Film\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne digger worries that, if bode are really laid to rest until the Second Coming, as priests proclaim during burial, then how is that to be squared with this business of exhuming so many to make space for new burials?\n\t\n\n\t“This field has always been a military cemetery,” says Mansky of his home city. “During World War I, Austrian soldiers were buried there, and during the Second World War, Soviet soldiers. Now they’re being exhumed and, as far as I know, reburied.”\n\n\tLviv stands roughly 1,000 kilometers from the front line of the Russian invasion but that doesn’t allow much space for psychological relief from the war, as Mansky shows.\n\n\tSure, children play, go to school – “Our front it here,” a teacher tells ninth graders – couples fall in love and lives begin. But there are also the daily moments of silence at 9 a.m., when all stand still to honor the heroes.\n\n\tAnd commemorations fill the churches and the streets with processions. A day at the park is broken up by paint gun target practice at a portrait of Putin. And everyone in the military band has a story about a son burned in combat or about returning to service despite being retired.\n\n\t“No one believes that we would hold out for so long,” says one musician. Someone else bemoans the speed of military aid: “They give us weapons one teaspoon at a time. So as not to lose and not to win.”\n\n\tThe city has been irreversibly changed, somehow, even if daily life goes on as close to normally as possible.\n\n\t“I thought Lviv was an eternal city and that I knew it very well,” Mansky has said. “However, with the start of the first war in 2014, and later on, the full-scale war, when I was passing through Lviv, going somewhere else, I started to notice the gradual changes.”\n\n\tMansky, whose films have chronicled life in today’s Ukraine and the former Soviet Union, has taken on everything from Russian gas pipelines to Putin’s grip on power in his past films before directing “Time to the Target,” this time teaming with Czech documentarians and producers Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda.\n\n\t“Many films about Ukraine today are created as manifestos,” says Mansky. “This is understandable and important. Yevhen Titarenko and I also made such a film, ‘Eastern Front,’ in 2023. But these manifestos don’t allow the viewer into this tragedy. The viewer remains a spectator, even if the film shows them military clashes captured on GoPro cameras.”\n\n\tWhat Mansky was after with “Time to the Target” is a different shade of understanding. “Our film creates a space in which the viewers can live their own lives, feeling part of this catastrophe.”\n\t\n\n\tThus, the band practices, players share funny phone videos on the bus, the bass drum carrier feels the strain on his back, and there’s time to glimpse a little boy holding his dad’s military beret as the grave diggers shovel and shovel in the dirt.\n\n\tMansky’s frame is often broad, with locked down camera, long takes and deep focus, allowing people to continuously enter and exit the shot on many planes.\n\n\t“For me, the inspiration for working on the film was Bruegel’s paintings, where there is a larger foreground, for example, with hunters, and with musicians, and a very detailed background with everyday life from birth to death.”\n\n\tAnd through it all runs the constant strains of music – as often a pop ballad in the background or a religious chorus as a somber brass band recital. This, in “Time to the Target,” seems as eternal and death-defying as all the rest of it.\n\n\t“I met with the musicians almost every day,” Mansky says. “It wasn’t just a shoot anymore, but a kind of shared life. At least they no longer treated me like a stranger. For that, I’m very grateful.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeet Paddington the Bear, the West End’s newest star.\n\n\tAs previews begin in London, “Paddington the Musical” has revealed a short teaser and first-look images showing a glimpse at how the iconic bear will come to life on stage. The life-like puppet is played by two people: James Hameed, who is an off-stage remote puppeteer, and Arti Shah, an on-stage performer. To know exactly how the bear works, “Paddington” fans will have to go to the show and see it for themselves.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJay Brooks\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe team behind the bear includes Tahra Zafar, Paddington Bear designer; Audrey Brisson, bear physicality associate director; Phill Woodfine, remote puppetry coach; and Annabelle Davis, Paddington Bear casting director. Alternate Paddington on-stage performers are Abbie Purvis and Ali Sarebani.\n\n\t“After many years of exploration and development, we are thrilled, alongside Studiocanal, to finally bring Paddington to life on stage,” producers Sonia Friedman and Eliza Lumley said in a statement. “It takes an extraordinary team to share this very special bear with the world — our amazing performers James and Arti, our brilliant alternates Abbie and Ali, and the incredible group of artists led by designer Tahra, alongside Audrey, Phill and Annabelle. Their collective creativity and vision are at the heart of our production, and it has been a true collaboration, helmed by Luke Sheppard, our creative, associate, stage management, production and development teams involved in supporting us in bringing Paddington to life in a truly beautiful and unique way. What we as producers always hoped to achieve was, quite simply, Paddington on stage — and thanks to the immensely talented artists, both on and off stage, we believe we’ve realized that.”\n\t\n\n\t“Paddington the Musical” is now in previews and opens on Nov. 30. Its run has already been extended to Oct. 25, 2026. \n\n\tWatch the teaser for “Paddington the Musical” below.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilmmaker Peter Chan Ho-sun returned to the Tokyo International Film Festival nearly three decades after his UFO (United Filmmakers Organization) films packed the city’s theaters, reflecting on a career shaped by market forces from Hong Kong’s golden age through Hollywood detours to his current work in mainland China.\n\n\tSpeaking at the festival where his 1993 film “He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Father” and 1994’s “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man” once drew overflow crowds to Shibuya venues, Chan traced his journey from independent-minded Hong Kong filmmaker to major Chinese productions, explaining how economic realities have dictated every creative turn.\n\t\n\n\t“Those were the best days of my life. No matter what I went on to do in the future, I remember those days where they were the best days,” Chan said of his UFO period, when he received a gift of videotaped footage from the 1994 festival showing him with fellow UFO directors Jacob Cheung, Tony Leung Ka-fai and Carina Lau at the old venue.\n\n\n\tChan co-founded UFO in 1992 with like-minded directors who felt out of place in Hong Kong’s action-comedy dominated industry. “Necessity is the mother of invention. We started UFO because we don’t know how to make comedies. We don’t know how to make big action movies, gangster movies, martial arts movies, special effects movies, so we really don’t fit in to the Hong Kong industry,” he explained. “Individually, on our own, we could never make the kind of films we want to make, which is films about ordinary people, because we are ordinary people.”\n\n\tThe inspiration came from United Artists, the filmmaker-driven studio started by Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbank and Mary Pickford. “It was like a dream come true, where young people could make the film, kind of films they want to make, where the studio won’t realize,” Chan said. The company gave Chan and his collaborators a few years of creative freedom before all the principals departed.\n\t\n\n\tBut that independence came during Hong Kong cinema’s actual decline, not just the prolonged discussion of its demise. “We’ve been talking about the decline of the Hong Kong film industry till today, but the real decline really started in 1991 and 92,” Chan noted. The collapse of the Taiwan market proved catastrophic.\n\n\tTaiwan distributors, who had been crucial financiers for Hong Kong films, began dictating content rather than simply acquiring finished products. “They always order the same kind of movie with the same actor,” Chan explained. “Distribution is a very cutthroat business, and they’re also closest to the audience. So it’s like today talking about big data… they can see only as far as their nose, because they’re looking at what the audience like today or yesterday, and then they keep wanting you to make [those] movies. It’s like driving looking at the rearview mirror.”\n\n\tWhen Taiwanese distributors collectively capped prices in 1994 to stop bidding wars that had inflated Hong Kong film costs, the entire ecosystem collapsed overnight. “Hong Kong movies could not survive overnight. Hong Kong movies were completely taken over the market in Taiwan by the Hollywood majors, because that when they cut that price, the government started opening up the Taiwan market for U.S. distributors,” Chan said.\n\n\tThe damage was swift and total. “Overnight, like in a year or two, the percentage of Chinese language films versus English language films, it was 50-50, or 60-40, and it became by the time 2000 it was 98% English language, and 2% not just Chinese, Japanese or any foreign language, 2% in Taiwan, and 98% English language,” Chan said. “And by that time, the whole industry changed, and that started the demise of Hong Kong film industry.”\n\n\tAfter UFO’s dissolution, Chan took multiple detours before settling into mainland Chinese production. He went to Los Angeles, signed with an agent, and directed a Hollywood studio film, “The Love Letter,” but found the corporate system incompatible with Hong Kong’s independent filmmaking spirit. “We were working on a very independent filmmaking way, even though Hong Kong films were very commercial, but the spirit, the way we make it, was very independent. Because the director really does call the shots, but not in the corporate studio world. And also not today in China, because China has become, like Hollywood, very corporate.”\n\t\n\n\tHe contrasted that with Hong Kong’s freewheeling methods: “Back then in Hong Kong, those were the best days of our lives, because if we come up with that idea, we go write the treatment, basically, we start making a movie. And we would be done in five weeks, six weeks, like ‘He’s a Woman, She’s a Man’ was done in five weeks, and it wrapped five days before the showing, the release date. It’s crazy, but that’s how we work, how we used to work.”\n\n\tReturning to Asia, Chan pioneered pan-Asian co-productions through his company Applause Pictures, leveraging his Thai-Chinese-Hong Kong heritage. He produced films with Thai director Nonzee Nimibutr, Korean filmmaker Hur Jin-ho, and collaborated with Kim Jee-woon and Nimibutr on the horror anthology “Three.” “We did the ultimate co-production back then,” Chan said of the 2002 project.\n\n\tHe directed his own segment for “Three,” making what he calls “a love story with a scary film massage in disguise” since he didn’t know how to make horror films. “The things that actually cross borders and would work business wise, were always horror. So I said, you know, I can’t make a career for the rest of my life out of making or producing horror movies I want to direct, and I can’t keep directing horror film.”\n\n\tThat realization led Chan to make his first mainland Chinese film, the 2005 musical “Perhaps Love” starring Takeshi Kaneshiro, Jacky Cheung and Zhou Xun with Bollywood choreographer Farah Khan.\n\n\tFrom there, Chan moved into large-scale Chinese productions, always adapting to market demands. “I make movies that the market needs. Because if the market don’t need that movie, you can’t get funding, you can’t get investment, and you can’t get to make the movie. So I make whatever movie that the market needs at the moment,” he explained.\n\n\t“The Warlords” followed because period epics were what Chinese audiences wanted in 2007, though Chan’s version featured minimal action despite starring Jet Li. “Out of two hours and 15 minutes, it was about 15 or 20 minutes of action. And they’re not Jet Li’s kind of action. They’re like war action, which is not really kung fu action and it’s really a drama. It’s really not a real action movie.” He followed that with “Wu Xia” featuring Donnie Yen, crediting Yen and action director Kenji Tanigaki for the fight choreography while he focused on character and drama.\n\t\n\n\tThe success of 2013’s “American Dreams in China” gave Chan the confidence to make 2014’s structurally unconventional “Dearest,” about child abduction told from opposing perspectives. “Many people say ‘Dearest’ feels disjointed, structurally inconsistent. But that was intentional. The first half follows one perspective; the second half switches to its opposite. It might be the least ‘commercial’ film I’ve ever made. But again, that confidence came from the previous success.”\n\n\tWorking in China has made it financially impossible to return to Hong Kong production. “The budget has become higher and bigger in China, and it also pumped up the price of your crew, because a lot of big movies in China back then, they were all Hong Kong. And the Hong Kong cruise, the big market in China has pumped up the price of cruise in Hong Kong who worked in China. And when you want to go back to work in Hong Kong, Hong Kong can’t afford that. So it’s very difficult to go back to work in Hong Kong.”\n\n\tChan’s latest film “She Has No Name,” which premiered at Cannes 2024 and opened the Shanghai International Film Festival this year, screened at Tokyo as part one of a two-part story about a 1945 Shanghai murder case. Based on one of China’s most famous unsolved murder cases, the film centers on Zhan-Zhou (Zhang Ziyi), a wife charged with the bloody dismemberment of her husband during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai in the 1940s – a killing that seems impossible for her to have committed alone. \n\n\tThe second part, expected to release next year, contains extensive backstory about the marriage’s deterioration. “There’s a whole chunk about the relationship between the husband and her, and how the marriage turned sour, and how it became violent, how he became a violent wife beater, and how she finally decided that she had to kill him.”\n\n\tReflecting on which of his films endures most with audiences, Chan noted that “Comrades: Almost a Love Story” remains the one 80% of people mention, though it’s “not the most difficult movie to me, and that’s not the most pleasant experience either, and that’s not even the most personal movie for me.” He attributes its lasting impact to timing. “For some movies, just everything just was just right at the time or at the moment.”\n\t\n\n\tChan was in conversation with TIFF programming director Ichiyama Shozo.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThree Japanese female producers who have achieved international critical and commercial success —Miyagawa Eriko, Eiko Mizuno Gray and Murata Chieko – participated in a Tokyo International Film Festival event as part of its Women’s Empowerment section. With section curator Andrijana Cvetkovikj serving as moderator, the trio began by tracing their paths to their current profession.\n\n\tCo-winner of an Emmy for her work on the hit streaming series “Shogun,” Miyagawa said she got her start as an interpreter on the set of Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill: Vol. 1” “I couldn’t believe how much work it was to create each shot and the chaos of it,” she said. “I fell in love with the process.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added that working with Tarantino was both a “gift and curse because he’s a genius.” “Maybe I could have been a director, but working for him I knew that there was no way I could ever do that,” she explained. “But I love to facilitate things and I want to be part of everything and I want to know everything so producing felt natural.”\n\n\n\tMizuno Gray began as a volunteer for the Toronto Film Festival and segued into publicity work. She then became curious about producing, “I thought if I can see the whole filmmaking process from that, from the beginning to the end, then that must be what I should try,” she said.\n\n\tSetting up a company, Loaded Films, with husband Jason Gray, she launched into film production. Credits include her award-winning collaborations with Chie Hayakawa, director of the 2022 Cannes Golden Camera nominee “Plan 75” and 2025 Cannes competition entry “Renoir.” \n\t\n\n\tMurata reminisced about studying directing, acting and cinematography at a film school in the States and realizing that “I was not good at any of it.” “So the job that left was to me was producing,” she added.\n\n\tReturning to Japan, she landed a job with as an executive producer’s assistant and began climbing the corporate ladder. After working as director of local production for Fox International Production and serving as Sony Pictures Entertainment’s senior vice president for production in Japan and Southeast Asia, in 2020 she became senior vice president of Aniplex, producer of the smash hit “Demon Slayer” animations. She was also a producer on this year’s live-action sensation “Kokuho.”\n\n\tAsked what makes a person a valuable asset as a producer, Miyagawa mentioned “an ability to listen and be flexible. “I think empathy goes a long way,” she added “Really try to put yourself in another person’s shoes and know where their priorities are coming from. Also, have clarity in terms of what your goal is and what story you want to tell.”\n\n\tQueried about her part in the record-breaking success of “Kokuho,” the Lee Sang-il drama set in the world of Kabuki, Murata modestly said she couldn’t take credit. “It’s all up to the directors and the crew members, the scriptwriter and our great actors,” she said. “But my experience helped me a lot in meeting with international film festival programmers and international filmmakers and producers. They gave me a lot of input.”\n\n\tWhat they told her was they missed the great masterpieces of Ozu, Kurosawa and other titans of Japanese cinema’s Golden Age. “They asked me why there were no films like that in Japan now” she said. “And my answer was okay, let’s try to make that kind of grand studio film.” In other words, “Kokuho,” with its lavish sets and costumes, decades-spanning story and three-hour running time.In contrast to Murata’s corporate trajectory, Mizuno Gray has always been an independent producer, who has had to choose projects on her own instead of having them assigned to her. “You have to be very selective,” she said. And for her a big part of the selection process is “understanding the creator’s vision and reasoning and storytelling.”\n\n\t“So first I will try to get know filmmakers not just for their creative ability, but also as a person,” she added. “And if we can align our vision I will try to make it happen as a producer.”\n\t\n\n\tFor Miyagawa, packaging is “very important.” By that she means not only the director, scriptwriter and cast, but also the story: “It’s really the balance of all of that,” she explains.\n\n\tMurata said that what sets her apart from the other two producers is that “I’m a company employee in Japan, so I will make a film or TV show that makes money for my company.”\n\n\tEarning $109 million since its June release, the third-highest total ever for a live-action Japanese film, “Kokuho” ticked that particular box emphatically. “Talent is also very, very important,” Murata added. “Because this business is all about bringing money into talent.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFamke Janssen says Marvel has never invited her back to play Jean Grey.\n\n\tIn a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, the “X-Men” star discussed her Fox-era Marvel role, or rather, discussed how she is constantly asked to discuss it. She explained that “every time” she does an interview, Jean Grey is brought up.\n\n\t“It’s interesting,” Janssen said. “I didn’t realize that was such a big part. Every interview I do, that will come up, and of everything I say, that is going to be the only thing that’s gonna be printed.”\n\t\n\n\tJanssen first appeared as Jean Grey, aka Phoenix, in 2000’s “X-Men,” and then reprised the role in 2003’s “X2: X-Men United” and 2006’s “X-Men: The Last Stand.” She also briefly appeared in the role in 2013’s “The Wolverine” and 2014’s “X-Men: Days of Future Past.”\n\n\t“I should be flattered, I suppose, that this character has resonated with people,” she added. “It’s been so long, but it’s nice that people are still talking about her. I’m sure every single time there’s a new movie that they’re doing, like [is it] ‘Doomsday?’ … it’ll come up again.”\n\n\tAn “X-Men” reboot from the Marvel camp is currently in development with “Thunderbolts*” director Jake Schreier at the helm. In an interview with The Playlist, Schreier said that the new “X-Men” film will be “recognizably different from what came before.”\n\n\t“But to be able to explore all of the ideas that are inherent to that rich source material, but also at the scale inherent to the source material, that’s like a very rare and fortunate opportunity,” he continued. “That’s very exciting.”\n",

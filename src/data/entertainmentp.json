    "body": "\n\tThe producers of S.S. Rajamouli‘s action-adventure epic “Varanasi” have revealed the strategic thinking behind the film’s April 7, 2027 release date and its marketing campaign, which began with a cryptic installation in the titular Indian city.\n\n\tThe project is being produced under the banner of Sri Durga Arts and Showing Business. Producers include K.L. Narayana and S.S. Karthikeya. \n\n\n\t“Varanasi lies at the heart of this film, so beginning the release conversation from the city itself felt instinctive,” producer Karthikeya tells Variety. “The cryptic on-ground installation was intended to spark curiosity, and audiences connected the dots organically.”\n\t\n\n\tThe release date was carefully selected to maximize the film’s theatrical window by aligning with major Indian festivals and holidays.\n\n\t“April 7, 2027, sits within the festive period of Ugadi and Gudi Padwa, flows into the weekend, and is followed by Ambedkar Jayanti and Rama Navami, creating a strong extended theatrical window,” Karthikeya says. “It’s a date that perfectly aligns with us and all our stakeholders.”\n\n\tThe film’s story spans thousands of years and traverses multiple continents, with locations ranging from Antarctica to Africa to the titular Indian city. One of the key sequences in the film is inspired by a chapter from Indian epic “Ramayana,” the protagonist of which is Hindu God Rama. The Rama Navami festival celebrates his birth. \n\n\tTelugu-language cinema superstar cinema Mahesh Babu leads the cast of “Varanasi” alongside Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Prithviraj Sukumaran.\n\n\tRajamouli’s “RRR” became a global phenomenon following its 2022 release, earning widespread critical acclaim and audience enthusiasm that extended well beyond traditional Indian cinema markets, with the film’s Academy Awards success marking a milestone for Indian cinema on the international stage. It is the fifth-highest grossing film in the history of Indian cinema. \n\t\n\n\t“Varanasi” reunites the “RRR” helmer with Oscar-winning composer MM Keeravani, who took home the Academy Award for best original song for “Naatu Naatu” from “RRR.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBayView Entertainment has secured North American distribution rights to a catalog of vertical video titles from FlareFlow, the microdrama platform operated by COL Group International, marking the first time the mobile-first content will be available beyond its native app.\n\n\tThe Los Angeles and Vancouver-based distributor plans to roll out the titles across VOD and TVOD platforms during the second quarter of 2026 using its DotstudioPRO distribution technology. BayView president Peter Castro and FlareFlow CEO James Wang unveiled the deal.\n\t\n\n\tTitles in the slate include “Who’s the Real Bride?,” “My Christmas Lover,” “My Werewolf Husband,” “Mistress With a Secret,” “The Blind Heiress Strikes Back” and “Naked Truth at Crazy Beach.”\n\n\n\tFlareFlow, which debuted in April 2025 on iOS and Android, has emerged as a major player in the expanding microdrama sector. The platform specializes in short-form serialized narratives produced specifically for vertical viewing, reporting more than 25 million subscribers worldwide. Parent company COL Group International has operated as a category leader in microdrama storytelling for several years.\n\n\tThe acquisition represents BayView’s first significant move into vertical-format scripted programming. The distributor has spent two decades building a catalog of more than 3,500 titles spanning multiple genres, including award-winning films that have premiered at Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca and the Toronto Film Festival.\n\n\tFlareFlow’s content delivers narrative stories in episodes running under 90 seconds, with cliffhanger endings designed to keep viewers advancing through episodes. The productions are professionally shot specifically for vertical screens rather than repurposed from traditional formats.\n\t\n\n\t“Traditional TV made you wait a week. Streaming makes you click through credits. FlareFlow’s hook is immediate, the payoff is instant, and before you know it, you’ve watched an entire series during your commute – essentially binge-watching for people who don’t have time to binge-watch,” Wang said. “We’re introducing North American audiences to rapid-fire storytelling that’s refreshingly different. And thanks to our strategic new partnership with BayView Entertainment, we’re looking forward to building our international audience as they discover this new genre beyond the mobile app ecosystem.”\n\n\tCastro said the deal fits into broader industry trends around short-form scripted content. “Vertical, short-form scripted content continues to gain traction globally,” he said. “FlareFlow has built a substantial audience around the world eager for short-form entertainment, and this deal, bolstering our already successful offerings, allows us to test that demand across traditional digital retail and VOD platforms.”\n\n\tBayView merged with DotstudioPRO in summer 2025, combining the latter’s content management system, API tools and metadata automation capabilities with BayView’s distribution operations. The combined entity now maintains a library of more than 7,500 titles.\n\n\tCOL Group International operates across more than 170 territories and continues expanding partnerships with writers, studios and distributors for its microdrama platforms.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s a pun that never gets old: Hilary Duff‘s mini-tour is what dreams are made of. The singer performed the final set of her four-stop “Small Rooms, Big Nerves” mini-tour — her first headlining show in over a decade — on Thursday night, but announced that much more is on the way.\n\n\tDuring “With Love,” Duff continued a tradition, bringing fans onstage to reenact the viral dance that she once did on “The Today Show.” Mitchell Gerrard Johnson was one of the three fans pulled on stage at The Wiltern in Los Angeles, all of whom were gifted t-shirts after the dance. They then turned around, revealing that the t-shirts read, “WORLD TOUR LOADING…”\n\t\n\n\n\tWhile no announcement has been made just yet, the night wrapped with an encore of “What Dreams Are Made Of,” and attendees were given a flyer featuring the message “more to come” and a link to her website.\n\n\n\tThe sold-out concert blended fan favorites, including “So Yesterday,” “Wake Up,” “Someone’s Watching Over Me,” and “Come Clean,” and new material like “Mature” and “Roommates,” as well as unreleased songs from her album “luck… or something,” which will be released February 20.\n\n\tDuring the event, which was also attended by Mandy Moore, Olivia Holt and Duff’s family, the singer got emotional, thanking the fans.\n\n\t“I want to say that there’s been an overarching happiness and sunshine that you all have brought to these shows,” she said. “The world is super hard to process right now and so bleak. I want you all to know that each and every one of you here, I love you and love that we can take a pause.”\n\t\n\n\tNext, Duff will perform six shows in Las Vegas — three in February and three in May, all of which are sold out.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney+ has confirmed that “Made In Korea” has become the streamer’s most-viewed Korean original premiere of 2025 across Asia-Pacific markets, based on viewership figures recorded 28 days after its Dec. 24 debut.\n\n\tThe crime noir series, set in 1970s Korea, stars Hyun Bin as Baek Kitae, a Korean Central Intelligence Agency operative leading a double existence as both government agent and smuggler. The character leverages his illicit operations to advance within the agency while generating substantial funds and protecting his brother. His ascent faces opposition from an incorruptible prosecutor, portrayed by Jung Woosung, setting up a high-stakes confrontation between the two men.\n\t\n\n\tThe series also features Woo Dohwan as Kitae’s brother Baek Kihyun. Park Eunkyo and Park Joonseok wrote the series, with Woo Minho directing. Hive Media Corp serves as production company.\n\n\n\tDisney+ has already greenlit and begun production on a second season. The renewal was first confirmed at Disney+’s originals preview event at Hong Kong Disneyland in 2025.\n\n\tThe success of “Made In Korea” caps a strong year for Disney+ in the region, which saw the platform release more than a dozen APAC series including “Hyper Knife,” “Tempest,” “The Manipulated,” “Nine Puzzles” and “Gannibal” Season 2.\n\n\tHyun Bin previously starred in “Crash Landing On You” and “Confidential Assignment,” while Jung Woosung’s credits include “12.12: The Day” and “Hunt.” Woo Dohwan appeared in “Bloodhounds” and “Mr. Plankton.”\n\n\tDirector Woo Minho’s previous work includes “The Man Standing Next” and “Inside Men,” while Hive Media Corp produced both those films along with “12.12: The Day.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapanese sales and distribution company Bitters End has acquired international rights to “All the Lovers in the Night,” Yukiko Sode’s feature adaptation of Mieko Kawakami’s celebrated novel starring Golden Globe winner Tadanobu Asano (“Shōgun”) in a key supporting role.\n\n\tJapan Academy Prize winner Yukino Kishii (“Small, Slow But Steady,” Berlinale 2022) leads the cast in the project, which marks the first full-length film adaptation of a work by Kawakami. The author’s novel gained international recognition as the first Japanese title shortlisted for the U.S. National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\t\n\n\tThe literary sensation tells a love story centered on Fuyuko, a freelance proofreader living in solitude whose carefully ordered life begins to transform after meeting Mitsutsuka, a quiet high school physics teacher.\n\n\n\tThe film is currently in post-production with a Japanese theatrical release scheduled for later this year.\n\n\tSode’s sophomore feature “Aristocrats” (2021) bowed at the International Film Festival Rotterdam before achieving substantial commercial success in France, drawing over 71,000 admissions and cementing the director’s appeal to international audiences.\n\n\tBitters End will present the title at Berlin’s European Film Market alongside Riju Go’s screwball romance “Rhapsody, Rhapsody,” starring Issey Takahashi, and Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s upcoming feature “All of a Sudden,” which the company is co-repping with Cinefrance International for the Asian market.\n\n\tThe Tokyo-based company has operated for more than three decades as a major independent player in theatrical distribution, production, and international partnerships. Its distribution portfolio includes titles from Hamaguchi, Bong Joon Ho, the Dardenne brothers, Jia Zhangke, Roy Andersson, and Gianfranco Rosi, with recent releases including “Anora,” “Young Mothers,” “Sex/Love/Dreams,” and “Caught by the Tide.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the production side, Bitters End’s credits include the Oscar-winning “Drive My Car” and Sho Miyake’s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” which took the Golden Leopard at Locarno.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Oscars only have time for two songs.\n\n\tThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has confirmed that only two of this year’s best original song nominees will be performed live during the 98th Academy Awards on March 15, citing time constraints and broader structural changes to the telecast.\n\n\tIn a letter sent to all music nominees and obtained exclusively by Variety, the Academy emphasized that the best original song category will remain fully integrated into the broadcast, even as live performances are limited to “Golden” from the animated musical “KPop Demon Hunters” and “I Lied to You” from the vampire drama “Sinners.”\n\t\n\n\tThe remaining nominees in the category will not have their honored songs performed live. Those include 17-time nominee Diane Warren’s “Dear Me” from her documentary “Diane Warren: Relentless,” Nick Cave and Bryce Dessner’s title song from “Train Dreams” and “Sweet Dreams of Joy” by Nicholas Pike from “Viva Verdi!”\n\n\n\tThe letter was signed by executive producers Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan, along with producer Taryn Hurd. \n\n\tThe Academy declined to comment.\n\n\t“This year, the best original song nominees are being treated with the same care, storytelling focus and intention as the other awards categories — all of which will be included on the show,” the letter reads.\n\n\tAccording to the Academy, each nominated song will be introduced through a custom-produced segment built from footage of the film it was written for, with the goal of grounding each song in its cinematic context. Where appropriate, those packages may also incorporate behind-the-scenes material offering insight into the songwriting process and creative intent.\n\t\n\n\tThe producing team also noted that nominees will receive additional promotional support across its official social media platforms, pointing to recent Spotify collaborations and the nominations announcement as examples of that outreach.\n\n\tAccording to sources familiar with the planning, staging live performances for all five best original song nominees would add approximately 25 minutes to the telecast — a significant chunk of time for a show that is contractually set to run three hours and 30 minutes. With 24 competitive categories to present, including the newly added casting Oscar, mounting five full musical numbers would inevitably come at the expense of other major moments already planned for the broadcast. This kind of runtime constraint will be eased once the Oscars transition off broadcast television and on YouTube beginning in 2029.\n\n\t“Given the limited time within the broadcast, the addition of our casting Oscar and a desire to create a fast-paced, entertaining and cohesive show, the live performance focus will be concentrated on two musical moments this year, ‘Sinners’ and ‘KPop Demon Hunters,'” the letter states.\n\n\tThe performances will be framed as segments designed to honor how music helped those stories resonate worldwide. The remaining nominees will be recognized through the bespoke film-based packages rather than live musical numbers.\n\n\tThe letter closes by underscoring the Academy’s intent to honor all nominees on the broadcast. “Your work is an integral part of our cinematic ecosystem, and we so look forward to honoring it on the show.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSinners\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe 98th Academy Awards will air live March 15 and will be hosted by Conan O’Brien.\n\n\tA copy of the letter is below.\n\n\tThis year, the Best Original Song nominees are being treated with the same care, storytelling focus and intention as the other awards categories — all of which will be included on the show.\n\n\tEach nominated song will be introduced through a bespoke package built from footage of the film it was written for, grounding the song firmly in its cinematic purpose. Where appropriate, these packages may also include select behind-the-scenes elements that offer insight into the songwriting process and creative intent.\n\n\tWe will be in touch with you soon to discuss how we would like to work with you on this. In addition, we will be promoting your nomination on our social channels — as we recently did with our Spotify post and our nominations announcement.The show will also feature musical moments that celebrate two films whose songs played a defining role in their global cultural impact and audience connection this year. Given the limited time within the broadcast, the addition of our Casting Oscar, and a desire to create a fast-paced, entertaining and cohesive show, the live performance focus will be concentrated on two musical moments this year, Sinners and KPop Demon Hunters, with segments designed to honor how music helped these stories resonate worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tYour work is an integral part of our cinematic ecosystem, and we look forward to honoring it on the show. This year’s Oscars is going to be incredible, and we are thrilled that you are a key part of it. These are complex decisions, so please feel free to call with any questions.\n\n\tBest regards,\n\n\tRaj Kapoor Executive Producer\n\n\tKaty Mullan Executive Producer\n\n\tTaryn Hurd Producer\n",

    "body": "\n\tStand-up comedy is best live — and often lived. Judd Apatow and comedy appreciator Neil Berkeley know this. In their admiring, at times achingly funny documentary “Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story” premiering at the Sundance Film Festival, the co-directors celebrate a comedian especially good at mining her life — including her struggles with mental health.\n\n\tThe film builds the arc of Bamford’s life and career by utilizing clips from decades of her stand-up. Augmenting that spine are family photos and home movies, copious insights and praise from fellow comedians, anchored with interviews — awkward and endearing — with the comic herself, as well as her parents and older sister, Sarah Bamford Seidelmann.\n\t\n\n\tBorn and raised in Duluth, she’s the second daughter of a doctor and a formidable mother. Around the time Bamford was 8 years old, she began experiencing a form of OCD that is marked by dark, intrusive thoughts that can be violent and or sexual. She also began having suicidal thoughts.\n\n\n\tEven so, Bamford might be an exemplar of Minnesota nice. She’s got a whispery, high-register delivery, seemingly sped up by anxieties 1.5 times. She’s modest, even mousy, but her self-deprecating revelations have a kind of muscular courage behind them. After sharing that she has a mild tremor from a medication, someone suggest she take another drug to counteract whichever one is causing the tremor. To which she responds, holding up her mildly quivering hand “Weakness is the brand.” That retort was also the title of her 2020 comedy special.\n\t\n\n\tIf you don’t know Bamford’s work, then “Paralyzed by Hope” serves as an affectionate introduction. If you’re familiar with her stand-up, then it’s fun to listen to the parade of comics and friends try to get at what makes her such a great comedian in their estimation. In that sense, this is something of a comic’s comic appraisal. \n\n\tPatton Oswalt, Brian Posehn and Zach Galifianakis along with Bamford made up the nerdly-hip comedy tour called The Comedians of Comedy, which was a Comedy Channel special and then series in 2005. Oswalt confesses being bewildered by Bamford at first. “I didn’t get it,” he says. He has since called her “the greatest living comedian.” And there are times in the clips from her stand-up when you might get why he didn’t. Singing ever-so-familiarly the Old MacDonald tune Bamford swaps “Pterodactyl” for “farm” and why not? “Old MacDonald had a Pterodactyl E-I-E-I-O. With a…” she sings. Then she lets out an unexpected and ungodly screech. Maybe you had to be there. Apatow and Berkeley make sure we are.\n\n\tNetflix’s Ted Sarandos counts himself a fan. He greenlit the first season of her series, “Lady Dynamite,” and then doubled down for a second season. That he’s proud of doing the first and stumped by his impulse to do a second season, is amusing and perhaps says something about the well of fondness Bamford taps.\n\n\tTig Notaro, Ron Funches and Sarah Silverman also offer thoughts, sometimes smiling with a kind of incredulity as they do. Apatow tells Stephen Colbert and a few others that to test out new material, Bamford invited strangers to sit across a table from her at a café and listen to her work her material. She then — wait for it — paid them.\n\n\tWhile the film leans on other comics to celebrate Bamford’s unique delivery, deft timing and exquisite plying of vulnerability, it’s the time with her family — her parents and her sister — that grounds the documentary. Her husband, painter Scott Marvel Cassidy, also makes an appearance.\n\n\tThose moments give voice —their own — to the people who figure mightily into Bamford’s comedy. She also wrote about more deeply about them in 2023’s “Sure, I’ll Join Your Cult: A Memoir of Mental Illness and the Quest to Belong Anywhere.” (The book is an intentional tribute to the self-help genre and 12-step programs.)\n\t\n\n\tBamford helped raise the profile of a micro-comedy club in Altadena, Calif., where she lives, called PDA (Public Displays of Altadena) by staging a morning set. It burned in the Eaton Fire last year. It’s not the only loss she faces in “Paralyzed by Hope” — a phrase that comes from Bamford. But toward the end of Apatow and Berkeley’s documentary, we know two things: She’s a comic’s comic; kindness keeps her moving.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has greenlit “Don’t Be Shy,” an original romantic comedy produced by Alia Bhatt and Shaheen Bhatt through their Eternal Sunshine Productions banner, with Grishma Shah and Vikesh Bhutani serving as co-producers.\n\n\tWritten and directed by Sreeti Mukerji, the coming-of-age film centers on Shyamili “Shy” Das, a 20-year-old whose meticulously organized life begins to unravel when an unexpected turn of events sends things spiraling beyond her control. Mukerji previously worked on the direction teams of Bollywood hits “Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani,” “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil” and “Brahmastra Part One: Shiva.” \n\t\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to collaborate with Alia Bhatt and Shaheen Bhatt on this extremely fun yet warm romantic comedy, with a remarkable character like Shy Das at its heart,” said Nikhil Madhok, director and head of originals at Prime Video India. “Alia’s innate instinct for stories that are emotionally rich, deeply relatable, and immensely entertaining shines through in this young adult story about friendship, love, and growing up.”\n\n\n\tMadhok highlighted the project’s female-forward narrative, describing the writing as fresh, relatable and humorous with earnest characters. The film features an original score by composer Ram Sampath.\n\n\t“At Eternal Sunshine, we’ve always wanted to back stories that feel honest and voices that feel their own,” said Alia Bhatt, co-founder of Eternal Sunshine Productions. “This film immediately spoke to us because of its sincerity and coming-of-age lens and Sreeti’s passion and energy naturally fed into the spirit of the story.”\n\t\n\n\tBhatt described the project as particularly meaningful for both herself and Eternal Sunshine Productions, praising Prime Video as a partner that consistently takes bold creative calls and supports distinctive storytelling.\n\n\tEternal Sunshine Productions was founded in 2021 by Bhatt, one of India’s most prominent actors, and her sister Shaheen Bhatt, author of the bestselling mental health memoir “I’ve Never Been (Un)Happier.” The production house’s debut feature, “Darlings,” co-produced with Red Chillies, premiered on Netflix in 2022 and marked director Jasmeet K. Reen’s first film. The company subsequently produced the Prime Video series “Poacher,” directed by Emmy winner Richie Mehta, and “Jigra,” an action-adventure helmed by Vasan Bala and co-produced with Dharma Productions.\n\n\tPrime Video’s Indian original content includes series “Paatal Lok,” “Mirzapur,” “The Family Man,” “Panchayat,” “Made in Heaven” and “Citadel: Honey Bunny,” along with original films such as “Shershaah,” “Sardar Udham” and “Maja Ma.”\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This interview contains spoilers from “Strip That Down,” the 10th episode of Season  22 of ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy,” streaming on Hulu",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This interview contains spoilers from “Strip That Down,” the 10th episode of Season  22 of ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy,” streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tKate Walsh will always make time to return to “Grey’s Anatomy.”\n\n\tFrom the moment Addison Montgomery first strutted into the lobby of Seattle Grace Hospital and famously introduced herself to Ellen Pompeo’s protagonist Meredith Grey as the wife of the man Meredith was “screwing,” Walsh cemented herself as an enduring fan favorite. Addison’s impact on Shonda Rhimes’ venerable medical drama was so significant that, after two seasons of being a series regular, the world-class neonatal surgeon and OB/GYN left to lead her own six-season spinoff, “Private Practice,” which aired from 2007 to 2013.\n\n\tEight years after the end of “Private Practice,” Walsh made a surprise return to “Grey’s” in Season 18. In between performing the first successful uterine transplant and training a new class of residents at what’s now called Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, Addison reconnected with her old colleagues, including her former sister-in-law, Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone). Having not visited the hospital since the tragic death of their shared ex Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) in Season 11, Addison had an emotional heart-to-heart with Meredith in an elevator after operating on a patient together. As an olive branch of sorts, Meredith then offered to let Addison meet the three children that she had with Derek.\n\n\tSince that two-episode arc, Addison has appeared in six episodes as a reminder of the crisis facing women’s healthcare. After her practice in Los Angeles became overrun with out-of-state patients seeking abortions, she returned to Seattle to seek the help of Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) and Grey Sloan’s new interns to make sexual education videos. At the insistence of Bailey, Addison took over the hospital’s decommissioned mobile surgery unit, which she used to perform abortions in hostile states. Once news of her operations came to light, Addison became the target of pro-life activists — who stalked and doxxed her, threw a brick into Grey Sloan’s clinic, and even tried to run her over with a car. Despite these threats, Addison vowed to continue doing everything she could medically to protect her vulnerable patients.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tHaving played Addison now for nearly 180 episodes across “Grey’s” and “Practice Practice,” reprising the character feels “like putting on an old dress, but very sparkly still. It’s got a little sparkle, literally and figuratively,” Walsh tells Variety with a glint in her eye. “But, yeah, there’s a part of my psyche that will always be reserved space for Addison. It’s just in me. It’s so nice. It’s more like putting on a worn but comfortable glove that I could just go right into. All the metaphors are just so cheesy, but it’s like going home.”\n\n\t“It’s such a delight not just to work with Caterina, but to work with the entire crew that have been there, many of them since the very beginning,” she adds. “The last couple of times I’ve been back, I worked with Kim Raver as a director, and now we had Kevin McKidd again. I’ve worked with him a couple times, and he’s such a delight. It’s so fun just to work with friends.”\n\n\n\tIn the Jan. 29 episode, Addison returns to Seattle to convince Amelia — who has been on a sabbatical since the death of her colleague and friend, Monica Beltran (Natalie Morales) — to consult on a pregnant mother with neurological issues. But Addison’s return turns out to be as personal as it is professional. Following years of running the mobile clinic, Addison needs to confide in someone about the strain her work has put on her marriage to Jake Reilly (played by Benjamin Bratt on “Private Practice”), who is now threatening to leave her for not being a present partner and parent to their child, Henry.\n\n\n\t“Jake used to be in it with me. He used to call me every morning when I was on the road, and give me these pep talks — tell me how brave I was for doing work no one else would do. He’d send me these care packages with birth control pills and talk through difficult cases with me. He was on my side,” Addison tells Amelia, shortly after apologizing to her for pressuring her into taking their case of the week. “But now he hardly calls. And when he does, he complains about traffic on the 405, or Henry’s school, or me.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Walsh quietly moved to Australia for a project, and stayed there. And while she still travels to North America and Europe for work, she logged on to our video call from her home in Perth, where she now lives with her Australian farmer fiancé, Andrew Nixon. “I’m about to go back to New York for a big fat stint in April. I’ve always kept my apartment, so I’ve gone back and forth. The Northern Hemisphere is my office, and then I just come home here, so it’s a little half and half. I’m very lucky,” she says, adding that she remains “hopeful” that the political climate in the U.S. will change in the near future.\n\n\tIn her only interview about her highly anticipated return to “Grey’s,” Walsh opens up below about the new but not entirely unsurprising development in Addison’s personal life; how she wanted to explore the emotional cost of laws and policies restricting abortion access on physicians; and whether she has been in touch with her former co-star Eric Dane, who played Addison’s late ex Mark Sloan, as he battles ALS. Walsh also confirms that the door is “always” open for her to reprise Addison, and she even has an idea for her next appearance.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou made your long-awaited return to Grey Sloan in Season 18, but you haven’t been back to visit since Season 19. What kinds of conversations did you have with showrunner Meg Marinis about what you wanted to accomplish with Addison’s return this time around?\t\n\n\tWe had been chatting, and I really wanted to have Addison come back a little shaken too, and she had pitched this idea. Amelia and Addison are always confidants, and Addison’s always obviously been there for Amelia, historically, whenever she’s in trouble — whether it’s with her addiction struggles or what have you — in the past. And I was like, “Yeah, but I think it would be cool to see Addison kind of messed up from everything that’s happening in the world, and how it’s affecting her.” So the last time we saw Addison, she was with Bailey and doing the mobile clinic for women. I was like, “I want to see some kind of wear and tear on her, or some kind of stress.” We hadn’t really seen Addison vulnerable in a while, like freaking out. So I thought that might be a little more interesting, a bit of a role reversal, and I think you see that in this episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou and Caterina have worked together for so long as Addison and Amelia, who are obviously family members — but your roles were a bit reversed this time, as you just described, since it’s Addison who’s the “dumpster fire” for once in that dynamic. Can you talk about what your dynamic is like now as scene partners?\t\n\n\tThis was her first episode back, so I think it was really fun just to be back for her on set. She and I always just jive so well and have great chemistry. She does feel like family to me. I just love going back. I put on my little scrubs or a fabulous pair of shoes and clothes, as the scene requires, and I’m Addison again. So it was really comforting, in a way. I kind of felt like a homing pigeon being called in, or like a spy coming in from the cold. I’m always happy to go work with her and everyone on the show, but it was really special to have just scenes with her in a way. It was very intimate.\n\t\n\t\tI’m personally curious about how you actually arrange these special guest-star appearances on “Grey’s,” given that you now live halfway across the world in Australia and the show still shoots in Los Angeles. Do you get personally approached about returning to “Grey’s,” or does your agent field that call? Does the creative team pitch you storylines for Addison and tell you where they see the character now, or is it more of a collaboration between all of you?\t\n\n\tWell, in recent years, whether it was Meg or [former showrunner] Krista Vernoff, we just reach out directly to each other because for Addison to come back, it’s always a creative beginning. And then it’s like, “OK, how can we do our schedules?” And then the agents usually get involved with just scheduling and all the minutiae of contract stuff, and travel, obviously. But it always starts creatively. So after all these years, that’s one of the nice things. It’s not always that way, but I am very fortunate that happens with most of the stuff that I work on.\n\n\tI just did a comedy [called “What the F*ck Is My Password?”] with Steve Pink, Alexander Ludwig, Stephen Dorff and all these people. That was a creative conversation, too, that started with my agent and manager, and they’re like, “Hey, there is this really fun, crazy thing that I think you’ll love.” We just shot that, but that started with them. I read it, and I was like, “Really? I don’t know.” And they’re like, “Just have a conversation with Steve,” who I’d known for years and years. He did “Hot Tub Time Machine” and “Grosse Pointe Blank,” and we came up together in Chicago. And then you’re like, “OK, let’s talk about it and see what we can do, what I can do.” So it’s always been creative for me.\n\t\n\t\tBut how exactly do you navigate those conversations about how Addison will come back and in what capacity? Does it always come down to your schedule, or do you have to be excited creatively about what the character is up to now?\t\n\n\tIt’s both. It’s scheduling and it’s also like, “Well, let’s just make this something that’s interesting and viable and relevant.” Obviously, it has to work within the context of not just my schedule, but the show and their storylines that they have going on already. But I always want it to be of value, and that it’s not just like, “Oh, hi! I’m here!” I want it to be important and meaningful.\n\t\n\n\tI think one of the things that “Grey’s” has always done — and Meg, of course, continues that, and she’s been there since the very beginning; she’s an OG “Grey’s” writer. They’ve always been able to deal with what’s happening in culture and in the world and run it through the filter of Grey Sloan or Seattle Grace, as it were back in the day, or Oceanside Wellness [on “Private Practice”], or whatever they’ve got. That’s how they sort of take the macro and bring it into the micro of that container, and I love it. The writing is so strong, and the relationships are so great. I think it’s very, very special not only that “Grey’s” is in its 22nd season — it’s like baseball at this point — but people have grown up and come along with these characters for all these 20-odd years. It’s really meaningful and special and intimate in a way that we don’t really have in any other aspect of storytelling.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThere are some “Private Practice” fans who will have a lot of feelings about the “Grey’s” writers choosing to put Addison and Jake’s marriage in jeopardy — that union was supposed to be her happy ending, after all! — and the way this week’s episode ends suggests that they could be headed toward a divorce. Do you think there is any hope left for Addison and Jake?\t\n\n\tThere’s always hope! But I think, look, what she’s doing is so radically different, and everything’s changed so much. I think it’d be really interesting to actually see that transpire or see what comes of it. But I really loved [the storyline]. I was like, “She should be in jeopardy.” My thing is, I love that she’s doing all these things and coming back. There’s this sort of desperation, but how does that manifest in her life for real? How does it manifest at work? What does the clinic look like? Is Oceanside still [around]? What’s happening? So [I want] to have a little catch up and to actually see the ramifications of the choices she’s making and the sacrifices she’s making. I think a lot of people can relate to that.\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned checking in with Addison, and now I can’t help but imagine seeing Jake appear onscreen again, but this time on “Grey’s” for the first time. Someone needs to give Benjamin Bratt a call and ask him to join Addison in Seattle next time.\t\n\n\tThat would be great. I would love that too. He’s such a delight.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn this week’s episode, Addison tells Amelia, “I don’t even recognize science anymore. All I know is that I can’t stomach sitting on the sidelines and watching people die, so I’m gonna choose work.” The helplessness that Addison feels as a world-class neonatal surgeon and OB/GYN in the current sociopolitical climate, following the fall of Roe v. Wade, is obvious, but what do you think is the long-term emotional cost of the work she is doing?\t\n\n\tI don’t think that she knows. Again, what’s so great about “Grey’s” is everyone’s kind of forced to take things a day at a time. But one of the things that Meg and the writers and everyone feels really passionately about — and I do too — is not just, of course, women’s health, but really the challenges in the macro with medicine. The episode, as you said, gets into what’s happening and how quickly things have changed for doctors and nurses and the whole medical community, and, of course, for patients as well — and access to good healthcare. It has just kind of all turned upside down beyond women’s health. I mean, it’s everybody. So I think that they do a great job of addressing it and dealing with it.\n\n\tAgain, I was interested in the personal aspect of it for the character of Addison and how it feels for her as an expert doctor with all these degrees and adjectives behind her name — how it feels to be an expert in your field and have it all turned upside down and shaken around like a snow globe. That’s what we were really interested in trying to embody. Like anybody, I think that you can hyperfocus on one thing — or one case in this episode — of, “I just have to try to help this person.” I think that for Addison, her emotions and her frustration and anxieties always get filtered through her cases and her patients, and that’s the same in this episode.\n\t\n\t\tA lot has been said and written about Addison’s evolution in the last two decades, but how have you personally seen her growth over the years?\t\n\n\tWell, [she went] from being the bitch in black — albeit in Fendi! But I think one of the things that Shonda is so great about is she would give you one character, and it’s such an archetype and you think, “Oh, this is the villain.” But she always would turn every character kind of like a bug on their back and show you the tender underbelly, or show you the humanity. I think for Addison, you saw her become more and more vulnerable and human and fallible, but still funny and all those things that define the multifaceted characters of Shondaland. But I think the thing I’m interested in, like anybody as we age, is just the vulnerability that comes through and the fragility a little more. There’s so many different places to go, still, with her.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tA lot of other “Grey’s” actors — both past and present — have mentioned being in contact with Eric Dane ever since he disclosed his battle with ALS last year. Have you been in touch with him at all? What has it been like for you to watch someone with whom you worked so closely battle this devastating disease?\t\n\n\t[Her face drops a little bit.] It’s so painful. It’s really sad. I haven’t been in touch with him, but I’ve reached out and sent my love and support and strength. It’s so heartbreaking. He’s such a beautiful person and such an incredible man, and I’ve had other friends that have battled with this disease, and it’s just horrific. So my heart goes out to him. I keep him, his family, his girls, in my prayers.\n\t\n\t\tYour characters, Addison and Mark, will forever be intertwined not only in the “Grey’s” universe, but in TV history.\t\n\n\tI know. That’s why it’s so heartbreaking to me, so emotional.\n\t\n\t\tLooking back, is there a particular storyline of Addison’s that you still find people wanting to talk to you about when they meet you, or on the street?\t\n\n\tWhat I’m always struck by is the people who tell me their personal stories, like, “Oh my God, I went to med school,” or “I became a nurse,” or “I watched this when I was in med school,” or “My mom and I watched this every week growing up.” And that’s really meaningful to me that this is a part of their life, and the power of storytelling and art is that it connects and unites people. But I’m trying to think… I mean, there’s always the very first moment of her entrance, which is like, “Oh my God!” That was the cliffhanger. Those 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds, whatever it was, on television — I got probably the most notice for that than anything I’d done, ever. Talk about entrances. That was an iconic entrance.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

An arrest warrant was issued on 4 counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile.\n      \n\n          TMZ obtained the warrant, which says Dixon continued messaging the teen even after confirming she was in high school. Dixon also made remarks about her sexual orientation and complimented her by saying she was \"cutting up to be so pretty\" with a fire emoji, according to the warrant.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          A rep for the East Baton Rouge Parish School System released a statement ... telling us Dixon was placed on leave due to the allegations. The rep also sent condolences to the entire school community and offered counseling and support for traumatized students and employees.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

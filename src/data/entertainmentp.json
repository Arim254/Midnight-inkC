    "body": "\n\t“RRR” director S.S. Rajamouli has unveiled what is being billed as India’s most advanced motion capture facility, unveiling the A&M MoCap Lab at Hyderabad’s Annapurna Studios.\n\n\tThe facility is a joint venture between Akkineni Nagarjuna‘s Annapurna Studios and “Baahubali” producer Shobu Yarlagadda‘s Mihira Visual Labs, with Hollywood’s Animatrik Film Design – whose credits include “Avengers: Endgame,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and “RRR” – serving as the technology partner. During the unveiling, Rajamouli shared the first glimpse of the lab and confirmed that key sequences of “Varanasi,” which stars Mahesh Babu, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Prithviraj Sukumaran were captured there.\n\t\n\n\tFor Rajamouli, the facility closes a long-standing gap in Indian filmmaking infrastructure. “India has always had some of the world’s best technicians contributing to major global productions, but what we lacked was an advanced facility right here at home,” he said. “When I look back at some of my previous films like ‘Baahubali’ and ‘Eega,’ I reminisce how I could have made them even better if I had access to motion capture technology back then in India. With the introduction of A&M’s motion capture technology, that gap has finally been bridged. We utilized this facility in the making of crucial sequences in ‘Varanasi,’ and the results were simply fantastic.”\n\n\n\tNagarjuna framed the launch as a milestone for Indian cinema at large. “For decades, Indian filmmakers have aspired to tell large-scale stories that match global standards, but access to high-end technology was often a limitation,” he said. “With A&M, filmmakers can now bring everything from epic adventures to intricate science fiction dramas to life right here in Hyderabad.”\n\t\n\n\tYarlagadda, whose Mihira Visual Labs co-developed the facility, described it as part of a broader infrastructure-building effort. “For Indian cinema to truly compete on a global stage, it is essential to create advanced technology ecosystems within the country,” he said. “Seeing a filmmaker like S.S. Rajamouli utilize our A&M MoCap facility for ‘Varanasi’ reinforces our belief that the future of Indian storytelling will be driven by innovation built at home.”\n\n\tBrett Ineson, president and CTO of Animatrik Film Design, added: “We’re incredibly proud to see Animatrik’s motion capture technology powering this landmark facility at Annapurna Studios. Annapurna has long been a beacon of cinematic excellence, and partnering with them and Mihira Visual Labs to bring world-class performance capture capabilities to India is truly exciting. This collaboration represents a significant step in enabling filmmakers and creators to tell more immersive, emotionally rich stories with the highest global standards.”\n\n\tThe lab features a 60-by-40-by-30-foot capture volume equipped with Vicon Valkyrie VK26 cameras offering sub-millimeter optical tracking precision and real-time data streaming via Vicon Live. The setup integrates Unreal Engine for live virtual production previsualization and includes Stereo Head-Mounted Camera units for high-resolution facial performance capture. Notably, the facility is modular and expandable, allowing it to be disassembled and reassembled on location as productions require.\n\n\tC.V. Rao, CTO of Annapurna Studios, emphasized the facility’s utility as a pre-production tool. “Directors and cinematographers can experiment with camera blocking, lens choices, camera movements, and frame rates in a dynamic virtual environment, allowing critical creative decisions to be finalized during the motion capture stage, prior to principal photography,” he said, adding that the approach is designed to minimize costly trial-and-error during live shoots.\n\n\tThe launch comes as Annapurna Studios marks its 50th anniversary. The studio said it intends to open the facility to Indian and international filmmakers, game developers, and animation studios seeking a production partner in Asia. It is also not the first time Rajamouli has partnered with Annapurna on a technological milestone – he previously launched India’s first Dolby cinema processing facility at the same studio.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tS.S.

    "body": "\n\tPresident Trump touted his economic achievements and attacked immigrants and Democrats in a divisive State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\n\tTrump also criticized the Supreme Court, which struck down his emergency tariffs last week, and repeatedly castigated the Democratic side of the aisle for not applauding him.\n\n\t“These people are crazy,” he said. “Democrats are destroying our country, but we’ve stopped it in the nick of time.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump is facing the lowest approval ratings of his term, around 40%, with nearly 60% expressing disapproval. The White House has tried to move on from setbacks like the months-long Epstein controversy and pivot attention to affordability.\n\n\n\t“A short while ago, we were a dead country,” Trump said. “Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world. The hottest.”\n\n\tTrump also promoted his record of stopping illegal immigration and accused Somali immigrants of defrauding the government. At one point, he told the Democratic members of Congress that they should be “ashamed” for refusing to stand when he said that the government’s first duty “is to protect American citizens, not illegal immigrants.”\n\n\tRep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali immigrant from Minneapolis, shouted back at him: “You should be ashamed.”\n\n\tTrump said the Supreme Court’s tariff ruling was “very unfortunate” and “disappointing.” Four justices of the court — John Roberts, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — sat impassively with their hands folded while Trump rebuked the ruling.\n\n\tDavid Ellison, the CEO of Paramount Skydance, was among those in the audience, appearing as a guest of Sen. Lindsey Graham. The government is reviewing Netflix’s deal to acquire Warner Bros., while Paramount is angling to break up the deal with a competing bid.\n\t\n\n\tTrump also took several minutes of the speech to honor the U.S. men’s hockey team, which won gold at the Winter Olympics on Sunday, and to talk up the 2028 games in Los Angeles.\n\n\t“We’re going to do a good job in Los Angeles,” he said. “Los Angeles is going to be safe, just like Washington, D.C., is now one of the safest cities in the country.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Brazilian film “Gugu’s World” starts quite literally true to its title by showing the audience its lead character’s room, full of everything he loves. Director Allan Deberton crams much story and characterization in those opening frames. From Gugu’s soccer trophies to his colorful wardrobe to the glitter on his face, this 11-year-old is revealed fully and economically. A complete portrait in mere minutes. He’s shown dancing around and even wearing a cape. An endearing character to fall in love with instantly, thus setting up this charming film.\n\t\n\n\t“Gugu’s World,” which won the jury prize for the Generation section at the Berlinale, is a generous character study of a queer pre-teen. Gugu (Yuri Gomes)  lives with his grandmother Dilma (Teca Pereira), in a small house near the Araújo Lima reservoir. Their bond is strong as he lost his mother, Dilma’s daughter, when he was very young. She accepts him unconditionally and their time together is filled with playful joy. At school, he’s doing well and has two supportive girlfriends. He is also a star soccer player. Of course he has a nemesis: a boy named Francisco who’s not as good at soccer, and who keeps calling Gugu “a sissy” while goading him into confrontations. His father Batista (Lázaro Ramos) eyes him with disappointment and euphemistically calls him “a clown.”\n\n\n\tAndré Araújo’s screenplay manages to flesh out all these interrelationships with sensitivity and nuance. The film finds space to tell the story of Gugu and Dilma’s special bond in scenes that feel natural. A highlight is their love of Cyndi Lauper’s “Time After Time,” which was a favorite of Gugu’s mother. When Dilma starts becoming frail, Gugu goes to great lengths to take care of her while keeping others from invading their space. Though different, the same tenderness shows in the father and son relationship. There’s hurt and shame standing between them, but also love that might lead to genuine appreciation of each other at any point. \n\t\n\n\tHowever, above all Araújo splendidly comes up with an unforgettable cinema hero. In crafting Gugu he writes a wholly original character who also immediately feels familiar. The audience gets to know Gugu so well and fall in love with his courage, singularity and determination to protect his grandmother and their oasis of a life together. In Gomes, the filmmakers hit the jackpot. The young actor brings grit, grief and much exuberance to his performance. He is in almost every frame and holds the film together with a grounded and spontaneous performance that has none of the precociousness that mars many a young actor’s performance. Pereira matches him in warmth and their duet is a pleasure to watch. \n\n\tVisually the film is as colorful as Gugu’s personality. Deberton, working with production designer Dayse Barreto and costume designer Gabriella Marra, fills the frame with vibrant colors — deep pink and blue, purple and yellow, to show the beauty and vivaciousness of Gugu’s world. He might be worried about his grandmother, frustrated with his dad, sometimes uncomfortable among his peers, but it’s clear he likes himself and knows he will persevere. \n\n\tTherein lies the strength of this film. Not everything goes well, there’s tragedy and sadness but also a sense of infinite hope that permeates the proceedings. The first sentence the character utters at the beginning of the film is that “he’s going to save the world.” By the end of the film that seems entirely plausible, even believable. If Gugu doesn’t save the world, he will at least protect himself and his grandmother and make their life together as wonderful as can be. The film seems destined to play at many festivals, especially queer ones. However “Gugu’s World” is such a crowd pleaser that it deserves to be seen widely by audiences. They’ll be in for a real treat.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSamuel L. Jackson‘s long-gestating “Tulsa King” spinoff is finally moving forward — but with a new title and setting. Paramount+ announced Tuesday that “Frisco King” — formerly titled “NOLA King” — will start production next month in Ft. Worth, Texas.\n\n\t“Tulsa King” creator Taylor Sheridan is now set to write all eight episodes of “Frisco King” Season 1, which comes from Paramount Television Studios and 101 Studios. News that Sheridan would write all of “Frisco King” comes seven months after Variety first broke the news that original “NOLA King” showrunner Dave Erickson had exited the spinoff.\n\t\n\n\t“We are honored to have Taylor Sheridan write the first season of ‘Frisco King’ and bring to life Samuel L. Jackson’s iconic character,” said Paramount Television Studios prexy Matt Thunell. “Having him pen all episodes of the season with his singular voice will be a treat for fans of ‘Tulsa King’ and audiences around the world.”\n\n\n\tBack when it was called “NOLA King,” the spinoff was to have been set in New Orleans. But with the title change also comes a setting change: “Frisco King” will mostly be set in Frisco, Texas. (According to insiders, the show will still briefly visit New Orleans, but the bulk of the story now takes place in Frisco.)\n\n\tJackson was introduced to “Tulsa King” viewers in Season 3 as Russell Lee Washington Jr., “who, after befriending Dwight Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone) during a ten-year stint in federal prison, is sent to Tulsa by New York’s Renzetti crime family to take Dwight out once and for all.” Instead, per the original logline,  he’s “inspired by what Dwight created in Tulsa and impressed with the possibilities of second chances.”\n\t\n\n\tSaid Paramount+ head of originals Jane Wiseman: “Taylor Sheridan continues to build worlds that attract some of the most iconic talent working today, and ‘Frisco King’ is no exception. Having Samuel L. Jackson step into this universe is a testament to the scale and ambition of the storytelling Taylor is crafting. We’re thrilled to expand this storyline with such a powerhouse creative team and cast on Paramount+.”\n\n\tProduction was previously announced to begin in early 2026; now, the word is cameras will start rolling late March in Fort Worth.\n\n\tSheridan, Stallone and Jackson are all EPs on “Frisco King.” David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Christina Alexandra Voros, Michael Friedman, LaTanya Richardson Jackson and Keith Cox also executive produce.\n\n\tParamount+ noted that “Tulsa King” hit Nielsen’s top 10 streaming originals chart for eleven consecutive weeks in Fall 2025. \n\n\tJackson’s recent TV output includes the Apple TV limited series “The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,”  the Marvel-Disney+ show “Secret Invasion,” and Peacock’s “Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist.” He also previously voiced the title character in the animated series “Afro Samurai.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance boss David Ellison will be in attendance at Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The news comes hours after his studio upped its bid for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery to $31 per share.\n\n\tSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina posted on X Tuesday afternoon that Ellison will be his guest at Trump’s address.\n\n\tReps for Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. \n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery said in a press release on Tuesday that the WBD board “had not made a determination” whether or not Paramount’s offer is “superior” to the deal currently in place with Netflix. If Paramount’s new bid is preferable, Netflix will “have four business days after such determination to negotiate with WBD and to propose any revisions to the Netflix transaction.”\n\n\tNetflix’s deal is around $83 billion for just Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max. Paramount wants all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its linear assets, for $112 billion. Since Netflix’s agreement is still in effect, the WBD board will continue to recommend the deal with the streaming giant, which will go to a shareholder vote on March 20.\n\n\tAlong with the increased purchasing power of $31 per share, Paramount’s latest offer also includes a ticking fee of 25 cents per quarter starting after Sept. 30, as well as a $7 billion breakup fee if the deal doesn’t clear regulatory scrutiny. Paramount also offered to pay the $2.8 billion fee for Warner Bros. if it terminates its merger with Netflix.\n\n\tNews of the new deal came at the end of a seven day negotiating window, during which Netflix allowed WBD to “seek clarity” on Paramount’s “best and final offer.”\n\t\n\n\tSome have interpreted Paramount as having the upper hand in the regulatory battle for Warner Bros. since Larry Ellison, David’s mega-billionaire father, is a longtime Trump supporter. However, in a Truth Social post in Dec. 2025, the president deflected this theory, saying of the Ellisons, “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\n\t“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that ’60 Minutes’ has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before,” Trump wrote. \n\n\tWhile Trump told NBC in early February that he thought he “shouldn’t be involved” with regulating the Warner Bros. deal, he appeared to backtrack on this stance on Feb. 21, when he demanded Netflix “immediately” fire board member Susan Rice or “pay the consequences.” \n\n\t“Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences,” Trump wrote. “She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNeve Campbell recently told CBS Mornings that she “didn’t think I could live with myself” if she accepted the offer return for “Scream 6.”\n\n\t“When I made that decision, I just didn’t think I could live with myself walking on set,” Campbell said. “I just didn’t feel right. I just knew that my value to this franchise was bigger than what had been offered. For me, I needed to make that choice.”\n\n\n\tShe added, “When I said goodbye to it, I thought that was it. I knew that there was a good chance that would be it.”\n\t\n\n\tCampbell explained that although it was tough knowing that the “Scream 6” production team was “having their first day of shooting and I wasn’t there,” she ultimately knew she made the “right” decision to bow out of the film.\n\n\tShe added, “And when I spoke out about it, it wasn’t really to sort of rally everybody. It was really just my truth at the time, and the fact the people got behind me, I got lovely support, and that was nice. And I do feel that other people need to make those choices.”\n\n\tCampbell, the longtime face of the “Scream” franchise, told Variety in 2022 that she would not be returning for the sixth installment because she felt “the offer that was presented to me did not equate to the value I have brought to the franchise.”\n\n\t“Sadly, I won’t be making the next ‘Scream’ film,” Campbell said in a statement to Variety. “As a woman I have had to work extremely hard in my career to establish my value, especially when it comes to ‘Scream.’ I felt the offer that was presented to me did not equate to the value I have brought to the franchise. It’s been a very difficult decision to move on. To all my ‘Scream’ fans, I love you. You’ve always been so incredibly supportive to me. I’m forever grateful to you and to what this franchise has given me over the past 25 years.”\n\t\n\n\tCampbell will return for “Scream 7” after her salary dispute, joining fellow original cast members David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and Courteney Cox. Kevin Williamson, who wrote the first “Scream,” serves as director.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLesley Manville and Ciarán Hinds are such terrific actors that a lot of us would follow them anywhere. But in the wee drama “Midwinter Break,” these two pour their skills into playing a couple of fuddy-duddies — a homepsun Northern Irish married couple, Stella and Gerry, who have reached their early seventies and are so set in their dainty, placid ways that they’ve become like two old pieces of cozy matching furniture. They sit, they read, they have a drink, they have a meal, they exchange comforting pleasantries…and then another day is behind them. And another, much the same, lies ahead.\n\t\n\n\tThe whole design of the movie is to take these two out of their comfort zone, to dip beneath the stodgy surface contentment of their well-worn habits and touch the explosive emotions that the couple — or, at least, one of them — has been covering up.\n\n\n\tAt Christmastime, they’re at home, Gerry seated in the living room nursing an evening cocktail, when Stella asks if she can still tempt him; we wonder if she means something erotic, and when he turns her down, we really wonder. (Is the threadbare dimension of their marriage that the fire has gone out in the bedroom?) But no, she’s just talking about going to church. Stella and Gerry exist in a state that looks halfway between retirement heaven and a coma. The two have a son, who is grown, who they don’t see very much. They are also exiles: residents of Glasgow, Scotland, even though the film presents them as Irish to the core. There’s a reason they left their homeland behind.    \n\n\tIn the middle of the night, Stella gets up and goes over to the computer, acting on a sudden inspiration. A bit later, after exchanging Christmas presents, she hands Gerry an envelope with a surprise gift inside: two plane tickets to Amsterdam, where she has arranged for them to have a four-day getaway. She wants to shake up their routine. But as soon as they arrive in that elegant Dutch city of bridges and hidden corners, it’s clear that it’s going to take more than a change of locale to do it.\n\t\n\n\tThe movie opens with a jarring flashback. We see the young Stella (Julie Lamberton), very pregnant, being rushed to a hospital after some kind of accident (she has blood on her arm). A cataclysm took place, but we’re not sure what, and our first thought is: Did she lose the baby? Is their son not their actual son?\n\n\tAs Stella and Gerry settle into their Amsterdam vacation, having breakfast at the hotel, visiting a fabled art museum, always lubricating the day with a pint, a glass of wine, a tumbler of Scotch (Gerry brings a bottle along with him in case he needs a quick refill), we register the depth of their connection. (In the bedroom, it turns out, the fire is still alive.) These two fit into each other’s lives as snugly as nesting dolls, to the point that they may have no surprises left, nothing new to discover.\n\n\tExcept that they do. Stella wants to visit a women’s housing facility that’s also a stately convent: a Catholic retreat nestled right in the middle of Amsterdam. A devout Catholic herself, she’s intensely interested in the women who live there. She tells Gerry, who has always been a secular man, that she wants to find a way to be more devout in her own life. And the reason for that is that she wants…more. More than what the two of them already have. This leaves Gerry flabbergasted. What’s the “more” that she could be talking about? He has no concept of it. He thinks their lives are perfect.\n\n\tIt all connects, of course, to that opening flashback. But what happened there is not, perhaps, what we suspect. Was it a miracle? Stella thinks it was. But the real point may not be about what did or didn’t happen. It’s about how two people in a marriage this close could be so cut from the same cloth and, at the same time, so different. Not because there’s some deep dark secret, but because people are…different. Gerry, we can see, drinks too much (he’s the definition of a happy “functional” alcoholic), and Stella has a problem with that, but the real problem isn’t the drinking. It’s the void Gerry is covering up. And Stella now wants to fill her own void with faith.\n\n\tThe director, Polly Findlay, presents all of this in a fluid and fastidious prestige-teleplay-of-the-week way. Adapting a 2017 novel by Bernard MacLaverty (the script is by MacLaverty and Nick Payne), she creates a generous space for her actors, who turn what might have been a rather staid movie — and still, at times, is — into a meticulous duet.\n\t\n\n\tManville has often played characters of magnetic will (just think of her domineering snob of a sister in “Phantom Thread,” her lusciously obnoxious tippling receptionist in “Another Year”), but in “Midwinter Break” she throws us for a while because her Stella, at first, seems the picture of dowdy devotion. But it turns out that she’s devoted to something deeper, a mystery she can no longer repress. Manville, in a nifty feat of acting, lets that unruly spirit poke through, even as she persists in trying to keep a polite lid on it. She shows us the spirituality of an ordinary woman. And Hinds, dolefully bearded, makes Gerry as comfy and trusting as an old sheepdog: a genuinely benevolent man, yet one who is starting to drown in his quiet complacency. “Midwinter Break” does nothing earth-shattering (it remains wee), but the movie touchingly colors in how it might be possible for two people to know each other too well and also not well enough.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom the trifecta of prizes “Happy Birthday” earned during its Tribeca world premiere in 2025 to the multiple audience awards and other kudos it collected on the international festival circuit, plus, its selection as Egypt’s Oscar submission, the poignant drama is surely one of the best and most awarded foreign features still seeking U.S. distribution. Helmed and co-written by Sarah Goher, the first-ever Egyptian chosen as one of Variety’s 10 Directors to Watch, it illuminates disparities of wealth and class in contemporary Cairo through the affecting story of a resourceful 8-year-old maid whose devoted friendship with the daughter of the household she works for is frowned upon by her employers.\n\t\n\n\tGoher, a screenwriter and producer making her feature debut, proves herself to be a director-writer of uncommon sensitivity. She draws a performance of astonishing depth from Doha Ramadan as Toha, the illiterate but street-smart young domestic who doesn’t yet understand her position in Egypt’s complex social hierarchy.\n\n\n\tSmart, capable and quick-witted, Toha’s current joy comes from her relationship with Nelly (Khadija Ahmed), the spoiled granddaughter of her employer (Hanan Youssef), a tetchy, elderly diabetic. Toha helps to hide Nelly’s bed-wetting from her soon-to-be divorced mother Laila (Nelly Karim) and covers for her when she’s late or binging on ice cream. Meanwhile, Nelly enjoys having a friend of a similar age right in her own home and ignores her grandmother’s snide comments about Toha being a potential source of lice.\n\n\tNow that Nelly’s father has left, financial worries cause the women to prepare to leave their modern home in an affluent gated community. Nelly’s ninth birthday celebration looks to be a casualty of the situation until Toha comes up with a clever plan to get Nelly the party of her dreams. But as the day progresses, Toha, who has no idea of when she was born and has never heard of birthday wishes, finds herself learning some hard lessons that leave the audience quietly devastated.\n\t\n\n\tGoher’s carefully calibrated visuals in partnership with Seif El Din Khaled’s intimate cinematography perfectly establish the painful paradox of money and class. In the film’s opening moments, the two young girls in their pajamas and wildly curly hair play happily in a pink tent on the early morning of Nelly’s birthday. Sure, one has slightly darker skin and the other more delicate features, but they seem like equals. Then, after the adults come into the frame and Toha dresses in shapeless clothes and a headscarf, their social position and economic circumstances become much clearer. Nelly goes to school while Toha fetches and carries for the “Madames.”\n\n\tDespite her menial work, Toha feels lucky. She hates the subsistence fishing that she would have to do if she lived with her family. Although she might not have her own bedroom at Nelly’s house, merely a couch in a living room, at least she has drawers in which to store her things, many of them Nelly’s castoffs. In contrast, at her mother’s ramshackle house the kids sleep where they can and must share all their clothes. No wonder, in her innocence, Toha tells Laila that she hopes she can stay with Laila and Nelly forever.\n\n\t(Over)-confident in her ability to make things happen, Toha isn’t conscious of the class-prejudice her mismatched designer cast-offs and headscarf incite at the fancy boutique where she accompanies Laila. But the social boundaries she encounters there are also present in her employer’s household as well as at its very gates.\n\n\tUnbeknownst to Toha, her employer arranges for Toha’s sister (Jomana Ibrahim) to pick her up so that she can’t participate in Nelly’s party, even though Toha believes that Nelly wants her there. As the sisters leave the complex, the gate guard insists on rummaging through the bags of food and clothing Laila has given them, even calling the house to make sure they had the right to take them. Fatme feels humiliated, but Toha is too busy plotting how to return from her rundown village near the Nile.\n\n\tEver enterprising, Toha does eventually make her way back to the party, but there, the ultimate dawning of her place outside of Nelly’s circle is heartbreaking. The sheer joy Goher has captured Ramadan experiencing earlier is replaced by confusion, pain and tears. Goher and her charismatic young star understand how to use cinema as a powerful empathy generator. \n",

Addi's father, Bradley Smith, called the cops to check on his 11-year-old daughter and ex-wife, Tawnia McGeehan, at the Rio Hotel & Casino February 15 after he hadn't heard from Addi in a while.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Once arriving at the scene, officers initially knocked on the door of the hotel room and called into the room several times without success. When they called Bradley back to see if he thought Addi could be in danger, Bradley told them he didn't believe that was the case and that she \"should be safe with her mom,\" according to the report.\n      \n\n          Then, police say officers left ... but hotel security continued their search. After friends and coaches alerted security that Tawnia and Addi never showed up for the cheerleading competition they were in town for, security made entry into their room and discovered their bodies lying lifeless on the bed.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported ... police believe Tawnia shot Addi late Saturday, February 14, while they were in Vegas for a cheerleading competition, with what appeared to be a suicide note left behind.\n      \n    \n          Tawnia and Bradley were awarded joint legal and physical custody of Addi with one week on and one week off in 2024 after a lengthy custody battle.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

Benny has an overall score of 3/5.\n      \n    \n          Benny Blanco's not exactly putting his best foot forward for his wife Selena Gomez ... and we mean that literally.\n      \n    \n          The record producer was on his \"Friends Keep Secrets\" podcast Tuesday ... and while the vibes were chill, his feet were doing the absolute most. At one point, he kicked back, threw those bare dogs up on the couch and ... let’s just say the soles told a very dusty story.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Completely oblivious, Benny was rubbing his feet together for peak coziness … meanwhile, fans were spiraling, clutching their pearls and reaching for disinfectant through the screen.\n      \n    \n          Now, maybe this is just how things roll in the Blanco-Gomez household -- or maybe we caught him on the worst possible day -- but it’s hard to believe Selena’s just sweeping this one under the rug.\n      \n    \n          Perhaps she’s never had the full, unfiltered bottom-view experience. Either way, we’ve done the dirty work and brought the situation to light.\n      \n    \n          So now we have to ask -- is this still her sole-mate ... or does she need to walk away?

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tBlack Fridays of years past might have had avid shoppers waiting in line for hours or getting into department store brawls as they scoped out the best post-Thanksgiving deals. Now, some of the best deals can be found online and are usually available for at longer than 24 hours, which is something we can all feel thankful for as we fill up our virtual shopping carts.\n\n\tThis year, streaming platforms in particular have been rolling out competitive Black Friday deals that bring down monthly costs to lower than we’ve ever seen them. The popular Hulu Disney+ bundle is down to $4.99/month, Paramount+ is down to $2.99/month and Prime Video has unveiled dozens of channel add-on promos this week.\n\n\n\tBelow, check out the best Black Friday streaming deals to snag right now:\n\t\n\t\tHulu\t\n\n\tHulu is down to an unbeatable $4.99/month for 12 months with this limited-time Black Friday bundle deal.\n\n\tThe deal, which runs through Monday, Dec. 1, gets you instant access to Hulu and Disney+ for less than the price of a single subscription. To put it into context, both Hulu and Disney+ normally cost $11.99/month individually, so the Black Friday bundle deal offers a 79% savings.\n\n\tOther Hulu Black Friday deals include: a Starz add-on for $2.99/month for 12 months and an HBO Max add-on for $2.99/month for 12 months.\n\t\n\t\tParamount+\t\n\n\tFrom Nov. 25 through Dec. 2, new and returning subscribers can get the first 2 months of any monthly subscription plan (Essential or Premium) for $2.99/month. No code is needed for the deal – subscribers can simply sign up via www.paramountplus.com. \n\n\t\n\t\tDisney+\t\n\n\tDisney+’s Black Friday deals span across its two most popular bundles. The Disney-Hulu-ESPN bundle is down to $29.99/month (typically $35.99/month) and the Disney-Hulu  bundle is down to $4.99/month (typically $12.99/month) – a 77% discount.\n\t\n\t\tApple TV\t\n\n\tApple on Friday introduced a new limited-time offer: New and returning Apple TV subscribers can sign up to get six months of the streaming service for just $5.99 per month — 54% off the regular price.\n\n\tThe special Black Friday offer is available Nov. 21 through Dec. 1 at tv.apple.com. After the six-month promo period is over, the price will go up to $12.99/‍month. The deal is not available to customers who are eligible for three free months of Apple TV with the purchase of an Apple device, as well as to those whose subscriptions are billed through a third party.\n\t\n\t\tPeacock\t\n\n\tWhile not technically a Black Friday deal, Walmart+ has its own streaming deals that are well worth considering. The retailer is expanding its five-year-old membership program with a new entertainment twist: members can now choose between Peacock Premium or Paramount+ Essential, included at no additional cost with their annual or monthly membership. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Boogie Nights” is stepping back into the disco haze — this time in pin-sharp 4K. Paul Thomas Anderson‘s 1997 opus is getting its first-ever 4K Ultra HD release on Dec. 16. The newly remastered edition arrives both digitally and on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray and is available to pre-order here.\n\n\tFirst released in 1997, “Boogie Nights” earned three Oscar nominations,  including supporting turns for Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore and a screenwriting nod for Anderson. The movie’s sprawling cast, from Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly and Heather Graham to Philip Seymour Hoffman and William H. Macy, helped set the template for the director’s signature ensemble style later seen in “Magnolia” and “There Will Be Blood.”\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2001 SNOWBOUND, ALL RIGHTS RESER\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe 4K package is loaded with archival and newly unearthed bonus features, including two new American Cinematheque panel conversations — one featuring Anderson and Reilly, another with Anderson solo — alongside the film’s original director and cast commentaries, extended scenes, deep-cut character material (“The John C. Reilly Files” clocks in at 34 minutes), and the rare Michael Penn “Try” music video. Previously released extras like the Buck and Amber van scene, Rollergirl footage and “Mixing ‘Feel the Heat’” also make the cut, rounding out one of the most expansive special-features slates for a New Line library title in years.\n\n\t“Darkly comic, vastly entertaining and utterly original, ‘Boogie Nights’ is one of the most ambitious films to have come out of Hollywood in some time,” Emanuel Levy wrote in a Variety review upon the film’s release. “Spanning the height of the disco era, 1977-84, pic offers a visually stunning exploration of the adult entertainment industry, centering on a hard-core movie outfit whose members form a close-knit extended family.”\n\n\n\tThe title will be available through major digital platforms including Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV, as well as on disc at retailers nationwide. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” is off to the box office races.\n\n\tDisney’s animated sequel about anthropomorphic animals has earned $10.2 million in preview screenings on Tuesday. Those ticket sales are the second-highest ever preview start for Walt Disney Animation Studios, behind “Moana 2” ($13.8 million) and ahead of “Frozen II” ($8.5 million). “Zootopia 2” officially opens on Wednesday and looks to collect $125 million to $150 million over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.\n\t\n\n\tThough “Zootopia 2” will rank among the best debuts ever for a Thanksgiving release, the buddy cop comedy will need to shatter expectations to overtake the record set by 2024’s “Moana 2” with $139 million over the traditional weekend and $225 million over the five days. Other top hauls for the holiday include Disney’s 2019 sequel “Frozen II” ($125 million over the five days) and 2013’s “Hunger Games: Catching Fire” ($109 million over the five days). \n\n\n\tThe second “Zootopia” is poised to dominate at the international box office with projections of $135 million to $145 million over the weekend. \n\n\t“Zootopia 2” will benefit from several factors, including great reviews and word-of-mouth and pent-up demand for kid-friendly entertainment. (There hasn’t been a family-centric animated film since “The Bad Guys 2” in August). Based on projections, “Zootopia 2” will score the biggest debut for an animated film since last November’s “Moana 2.” The original “Zootopia,” which opened in March 2016, launched to $75 million domestically before achieving juggernaut status with $341 million in North America and $1.02 billion worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, “Zootopia 2” returns to the world that’s inhibited with anthropomorphic animals and follows a rabbit police officer and con artist fox as they re-team to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident. Variety’s chief film critic Peter Debruge called “Zootopia 2” a “worthy successor,” adding that the “tertiary value as social commentary that makes the franchise so indispensable.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Van Der Beek suited up in his “Varsity Blues” football jersey to help raise money for his cancer treatment and other families going through the same battle.\n\n\t“By popular demand! My favorite jersey. Maybe it was all fun plays we got run in the football sequences for the away games… but I always loved putting on the varsity whites,” he wrote on Instagram about his 1999 sports movie. “Last year when I released the ‘Blues’ jersey, I was blown away by the love and support I received from all of you. It has meant more than I can ever express. I hope you enjoy this one as much as the original. For me, every jersey I sign is a magical full-circle moment.”\n\t\n\n\n\tVan Der Beek is selling unsigned jerseys for $40 and signed ones for $80 to raise money for his colorectal cancer treatment and for other “families walking the same path.” Earlier this month, the 48-year-old star began auctioning off his “Dawson’s Creek” memorabilia for fundraising. One year ago, he publicly revealed his stage 3 diagnosis.\n\n\n\tIn September, the “Dawson’s Creek” cast reunited for the first time since the show ended in 2003. Van Der Beek was originally slated to attend, but had to drop out due to a stomach virus. In his place, Lin-Manuel Miranda took up the role of Dawson. The event raised money for Van Der Beek’s treatment and the F Cancer organization.\n\n\t“Thank you — for the love, the prayers, the support, and for making this jersey mean something far bigger than a movie,” he wrote on Instagram. “Endlessly grateful for all of you.”\n",

The free Social Agent app went live on Apple’s App Store in September after nine months of beta testing.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJeff Tobler, Lisa Jammal and Brooke Levy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexa Jade\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe service plans to tap into the pool of experienced audio and video producers and techs who in are in the market for freelance work given the wide layoffs across the industry and the slowdown in TV and film production.\n\t\n\n\tThe company also offers a service for editing and packaging raw footage uploaded by users. It’s dubbed “You Upload, We Edit.”\n\n\tSocial Agent is the brainchild of Lisa Jammal, Brooke Levy and Jeff Tobler. Jammal is CEO. She has a long resume of developing content for the Grammy Awards, Emmy Awards and more. Levy has worked in corporate law and strategy. Tobler was formerly a top communications and PR executive for Warner Bros. Television, Expedia and Ava DuVernay’s Array Filmworks.\n\n\t“Social Agent was created for the way people live, celebrate, and share content today,” co-founders Jammal, Levy and Tobler said in a statement. “Seeing no true middle ground between DIY and hiring a full-scale crew, we fill the void by offering a fast and affordable solution with on-demand content creators. This allows people, for personal or business moments, to put their phones down, be present and focus on what matters most. Early traction in L.A. confirms the demand, and this is only the beginning. See you soon, New York.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWill Daws, the joint managing director of Plum Pictures who was a key fixture in the U.K. television community and created shows with James May and George Clarke, died suddenly in London on Monday. He was 57.\n\n\tDaws started his career as a stand-up comedian before picking up a camera and setting off to Liberia to document the war there. He sold his footage to Channel 4 and went on to work in current affairs at the BBC, where he created docuseries like “Holidays in the Axis of Evil” and “Places That Don’t Exist” as well as the “mischief” show “A Dirty Weekend in Hospital” and “The Zimmers,” which followed an elderly rock band.\n\t\n\n\tThroughout his career, Daws fostered relationships with big names in the industry including George Clarke, James May, Simon Reeve, Stefan Gates, Peter Snow, Hannah Fry, Johnny Vegas and Ronnie Corbett.\n\n\n\tThe BBC is where Daws met his Plum Pictures co-founder Stuart Cabb. In 2007, the two left the broadcaster to go out on their own, launching Plum under the Hat-Trick banner. Director of production Victoria Moss joined soon after, and together they created a raft international formats including the long-running “George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces,” “James May’s Toy Stories,” “James May….Our Man In,” “Trainspotting Live” and lots of property content for Channel 4. \n\n\t“Will Daws was more like the leader of a big, happy gang than someone who fitted the cliched mould of a television executive (a title he loathed anyway). He worked under a simple mantra that said television should be enjoyable to make, otherwise it wouldn’t be enjoyable to watch,” May said in a statement. “We discussed this when we met, 18 years ago, and as a result, almost everything I’ve done outside of car programming has been made with Will and Plum Pictures. He was an unrelenting geyser of ideas equally sparkling and idiotic, a motivator, a notorious charmer of commissioners and a terrible driver … I loved this man as did everyone around him. I am profoundly happy to have known him.”\n\t\n\n\tClarke shared that he alway called him “Lord Daws… and for good reason.”\n\n\t“He built the most beautiful ocean liner called HMS PLUM. The ultimate amazing space,” he continued. “We all traveled with him aboard his wonderful ship visiting some of the most magical places on earth. Whatever storms we faced on those journeys, Lord Daws always protected us, managing to navigate us to calmer, safer waters. We always laughed with him. We were always in awe of him. We always loved him.”\n\n\tCabb added: “Will was like a brother to me. I’m still in denial that this has happened. He was a wonderful friend and extraordinary business partner. Life will be so much less fun without him.”\n\n\tDaws is survived by his wife Shula, son Ethan, daughter Noa, mom Dilys and brothers Sam and Joe.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWith COVID lockdowns now five years in the rear view, indie distributors have teamed up to deliver theatrical screenings for 2020 and 2021 releases that had their big-screen runs impeded or nixed by pandemic restrictions. Organized by ticketing platform Filmbot, “Lost Films of COVID” is coming to select locations in December, looking to celebrate the resilience of independent theaters and the draw of repertory film programming among moviegoers.\n\t\n\n\tThe series features seven titles from five indie banners. A24 will showcase “Red Rocket,” Sean Baker‘s porn star comedy that he directed and wrote before his Oscar best picture winner “Anora,” as well as Kelly Reichardt‘s Western “First Cow,” which had begun a limited release in March 2020 before it was pulled from theaters as venues began to temporarily shutter. “Red Rocket” will be shown in 35mm in some locations.\n\n\n\t“We made ‘Red Rocket’ specifically for the big screen and it makes me so happy to know that audiences who didn’t have the chance to see it that way, finally will,” Baker said.\n\n\n\t“Boy, oh boy, how great that ‘First Cow’ is going to play at the lovely Nitehawk Cinema and other independent theaters in the good company of so many other films that got socked away during COVID,” Reichardt said. “I’m sitting here now listening to the music of the late-great John Prine. Maybe this series can be an ode to all the folks we lost during the pandemic.”\n\n\tPlanning for the “Lost Films of COVID” began when Filmbot CEO Max Friend shared his idea for the series with Baker and his producer and wife, Samantha Quan, at Art House Convergence’s biennial industry gathering for independent theaters in July. Baker and Quan were keynote speakers for the event.\n\t\n\n\tAlong with A24, Neon is participating with two titles: the Nicolas Cage drama “Pig,” writer-director Michael Sarnoski’s breakout feature, and the Norwegian documentary “The Painter and the Thief” from Benjamin Ree, about the friendship between an artist and the convicted criminal who stole her work. The series also includes GKids’ “Wolfwalkers,” the Oscar-nominated Irish animated feature from Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart; IFC’s “Relic,” a horror film that was the feature debut for director Natalie Erika James; and Film Movement’s “The Wild Goose Lake,” a neo-noir from Chinese filmmaker Diao Yinan.\n\n\tThe full “Lost Films of COVID” series is currently scheduled to come to the Frida Cinema in Santa Ana, Calif. from Dec. 12 to Dec. 14. Other participating venues for December include Nitehawk Cinemas in Brooklyn, N.Y.; the Gateway Film Center in Columbus, Ohio; and the Harris Theater in Pittsburgh, Penn.\n\n\t“When Filmbot approached us with the idea to honor some of the ‘lost’ films released during COVID that didn’t quite get their due at movie theaters, we jumped at the opportunity!” said Matthew Viragh, executive director and founder of Nitehawk. “We’ve only scratched the surface and there are many more films that could be included, so maybe this series can live on annually and build a larger and larger line up in the future.”\n\n\t“The Frida Cinema is proud to stand side by side with other leading independent theaters to present this very important group of films,” said Frida programmer Trevor Dillon. “Our entire staff and community of cinema-goers holds one belief above all else: the communal experience of seeing a movie on the big screen is something that can never be replaced.”\n\n\t“Independent films are the heartbeat of cinema — fearless, human and essential to keeping the art form alive and connected to the world it reflects,” said Gateway Film Foundation CEO Chris Hamel. “The ‘Lost Films of COVID’ program arrives at exactly the right moment, honoring the creativity that nearly disappeared and reaffirming why independent voices must always have a place on the big screen.”\n\n\tA 2025 study by the AHC, surveying 31,500 moviegoers between 50 local film organizations, found a majority of those polled cited programming of previously released features as a reason to “see a film on the big screen.” The only two reasons that polled higher were “cinematography and sound will be much better” and “the movie is going to theaters only with no plan for streaming.”\n\t\n\n\t“There’s a kind of alchemy that happens when we experience movies together in theaters on the big screen, especially at independent cinemas that have a special intuition for curating new releases and repertory titles around what their audiences are seeking most,” said Friend for Filmbot. “Some of the most stunning movies in recent years were robbed of that theatrical spotlight during COVID and we’ve been proud to work on this collective effort with distributors and theaters, so audiences can enjoy these films as they were originally intended to be seen. At its heart, this series is a testament to the timeless nature of visionary filmmaking and the resilience of the independent cinema teams who elevate these stories.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTelevisaUnivision and Google have finally clinched a deal renewal that restores Univision and other Spanish-language networks to YouTube TV, ending a 56-day blackout. It was the longest programming outage ever for YouTube TV, which first launched in 2017.\n\n\tThe multiyear agreement includes distribution of TelevisaUnivision’s Univision, UniMás, Galavisión and TUDN sports on YouTube TV’s Base Plan and Spanish Plan. Subscribers should see Univision appear on the YouTube TV lineup Wednesday (Nov. 26).\n\t\n\n\tIn addition, under the deal, TelevisaUnivision’s ViX premium streaming service will be available to purchase in the U.S. through YouTube’s Primetime Channels subscription hub. And in 2026, YouTube will offer ViX in more countries, beginning with Mexico, as it launches YouTube Primetime Channels in Mexico for the first time.\n\n\n\tUnivision and TelevisaUnivision’s other networks were pulled off YouTube TV on Sept. 30, after their previous agreement expired and the two sides couldn’t come to an agreement. Google had claimed the media company sought price increases that were drastically out of line with viewership. Univision is the biggest Spanish-language broadcaster in the U.S., with 59 owned and/or operated stations.\n\n\tThe resolution of the lengthy standoff between YouTube and TelevisaUnivision comes amid a turbulent year of deal-renewal talks for YouTube TV. Google has been aggressive in negotiating new content pacts for YouTube TV, which has grown to be the U.S.’s No. 1 internet-TV service with an estimated subscriber base of over 10 million. Most recently, ESPN, ABC and other Disney networks went dark on YouTube TV for almost two weeks before Google and Disney found common ground. Other programmers that sparred publicly over YouTube TV deal renewals were Paramount Global (now Paramount Skydance), Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal, although each of those was resolved without a blackout.\n\t\n\n\tThe Univision blackout on YouTube TV had attracted the attention of President Donald Trump, who wrote in an Oct. 4 social media post that the removal of the Spanish-language network from the service “is VERY BAD for Republicans in the upcoming Midterms… Google, for the purpose of FAIRNESS, please let Univision back!”\n\n\tTelevisaUnivision CEO Daniel Alegre said in a statement Wednesday, “We are pleased to have reached an agreement that restores Univision to YouTube TV, ensuring millions of Hispanics can access the news, sports and entertainment they care about and have relied on for over 70 years. This agreement recognizes the essential role that our content plays in the daily lives of our viewers, as we fulfill our mission of reflecting the voice of Hispanics. We look forward to serving YouTube TV subscribers again.”\n\n\tA YouTube spokesperson said the video platform is “excited to partner with TelevisaUnivision to grow their presence across YouTube by bringing more content to YouTube’s global audiences and new bundled offers to the marketplace.”\n\n\tAccording to YouTube, Spanish-language content remains very popular on the main YouTube platform, where it is available to watch for free. On average, there were over 9 billion views per day of Spanish-language videos worldwide on the main YouTube app in June 2025.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“RuPaul’s Drag Race” judge and Drew Barrymore’s talk show co-host Ross Mathews has joined the film short “Poreless” as executive producer.\n\n\t“Poreless,” directed by Harris Doran, who co-wrote the script with Fawzia Mirza, stars Akbar Hamid as Akram, a fabulous, queer Muslim beauty entrepreneur who must figure out how to compete in a “Shark Tank”-like product pitch contest after suffering an untimely allergic reaction. “At its heart, ‘Poreles’ is about the tension between how the world demands we appear and the liberation of being authentically ourselves,” the movie’s official summary reads. “Through comedy, the film reframes the queer Muslim experience as both deeply personal and profoundly universal.”\n\t\n\n\tFollowing its Tribeca Festival premiere, “Poreless” has screened at more than 20 festivals, including Frameline, Inside Out, Bentonville, Woodstock, NewFest, Indy Shorts and Aspen Shortsfest. The film was acquired by Switchboard Magazine and is currently available to screen via their YouTube Channel.\n\n\n\t“When I was growing up, our community didn’t have many mirrors in society — very few LGBTQ+ stories, and almost none that reflected the full spectrum of who we are,” Mathews said in a statement Wednesday. “Today we’re fortunate to have more, but we still need to tell stories that peel back the layers and show every part of our community in all its complexity. ‘Poreless’ does that. It’s bold, joyful, hilarious, and deeply human, and I’m honored to help champion a film that expands what representation can look like.”\n\t\n\n\tHamid, who also serves as the project’s producer, said, “I’ve followed Ross’s journey for years, and his joy, visibility, and authenticity have been such an inspiration — especially for someone like me, navigating what it means to be both gay and Muslim. ‘Poreless’ was a reclamation of my identity, a reminder that I don’t have to choose between the different parts of who I am. Having Ross join us feels like an affirmation of that truth and a celebration of the many stories our community holds.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tLooking for a great streaming deal? The Disney+ and Hulu Bundle is down to its lowest price since the streamer’s price hikes last October.\n\n\tHulu is down to an unbeatable $2.99/month for 12 months with this limited-time Black Friday bundle deal. The deal, which runs through Monday, Dec. 1, gets you instant access to Hulu and Disney+ for less than the price of a single subscription. To put it into context, both Hulu and Disney+ normally cost $11.99/month individually, so the Black Friday bundle deal offers a 79% savings.\n\n\n\tOther Hulu Black Friday deals include: a Starz add-on for $2.99/month for 12 months and an HBO Max add-on for $2.99/month for 12 months.\n\n\tThis limited-time promo comes ahead of anticipated releases, including , Season 3 of “Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures” (Dec. 8) Season 2 of “Percy Jackson and the Olympians (Dec. 10), Taylor Swift’s new six-part Eras Tour docuseries (Dec. 12) and a wide-spanning slate of holiday programming across both Disney and Hulu. On Dec. 1, Hulu will add multiple seasonal throwbacks including all titles from the  “Home Alone” franchise and the “The Santa Clause” trilogy.\n\n\tFirst launched in 2019, Disney+ is the dedicated streaming home for movies and shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic, along with “The Simpsons” and more.\n\n\tThis promo is one of the first major bundle deals we’ve seen from the streamer since their price hike last fall, which saw a Basic Disney+ subscription rise from $7.99/month to $9.99/month. Before the new price increase took effect, they released a “blockbuster” $1.99/month deal for the ad-supported Disney+ Basic plan, in addition to a new suite of limited-time subscribers perks in the U.S.\n\n\n\tBut this Disney+ Hulu Bundle deal hits that blockbuster deal out of the park, giving you not only access to Disney+, but the entire Hulu library, for only $2.99/month — the lowest we’ve seen for the comprehensive package. This is a 77% off discount.\n\n\tSign up for the limited-time Disney+ Hulu bundle below:\n",

    "body": "\n\tHans Zimmer and his music company, Bleeding Fingers Music, are set to compose the score for HBO‘s upcoming “Harry Potter” series.\n\n\tThe series, set to debut in 2027, is based on the books by author J.K Rowling. The books, “Sorcerer’s Stone,” “Chamber of Secrets,” “Prisoner of Azkaban,” “Goblet of Fire,” “Order of the Phoenix,” “Half-Blood Prince” and “Deathly Hallows,” will each be adapted into a season of TV.\n\t\n\n\t“The musical legacy of ‘Harry Potter’ is a touch point for composers everywhere and we are humbled to join such a remarkable team on a project of this magnitude,” said Zimmer and Bleeding Fingers Music composers Kara Talve and Anže Rozman. “The responsibility is something that myself, Kara Talve and Anže Rozman do not take lightly. Magic is all around us, often just beyond reach, but as in the world of Harry Potter, you simply must look for it. With this score we hope to bring audiences that little bit closer to it whilst honoring what has come before.”\n\n\n\tThe new score will honor the legacy of “Harry Potter” while reimagining its sound for a long-form, prestige television format. The films were originally scored by John Williams (“Sorcerer’s Stone,” “Chamber of Secrets,” “Prisoner of Azkaban”), Patrick Doyle (“Goblet of Fire”), Nicholas Hooper (“Order of the Phoenix,” “Half-Blood Prince”) and Alexandre Desplat (“Deathly Hallows”).\n\n\tBleeding Fingers is a collective founded over a decade ago by Zimmer. Later this year, it will open a new London office as it continues to expand it’s global presence.\n\t\n\n\tZimmer is currently Oscar shortlisted for his work on “F1.” Later this year, his work will be heard on the HBO series “Euphoria” as well as “Dune: Part Three.”\n\n\tAs previously announced, Dominic McLaughlin will play the role of Harry Potter, Arabella Stanton will play Hermione Granger and Alastair Stout will play Ron Weasley. The three are largely newcomers with few prior acting credits. McLaughlin acted in “Grow,” a comedy on Sky with Nick Frost and Golda Rosheuvel, Stanton starred as Matilda in the musical of the same name in the West End, and Stout had no prior acting credits. John Lithgow will play Albus Dumbledore, “I May Destroy You” star Paapa Essiedu is Severus Snape and “Tumbleweeds” Oscar nominee Janet McTeer will play Professor McGonagall.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs HBO Max completes its rollout in Europe, the streaming service’s head honchos seem undeterred by the contentious sale of parent company Warner Bros. Discovery in the U.S.\n\n\tInstead, they are focused on getting the message to customers in eight new countries, including Germany and Italy, that the quality of their content is unbeatable.\n\n\t“This is one of the most exciting times in the four years plus that we’ve been trying to slowly roll out HBO Max,” said JB Perrette, its CEO and president of global streaming and games, speaking to Variety at the Rome HBO Max launch. He noted that they have “the strongest slate in the history of HBO and HBO Max in 2026 and building into 2027.”\n\t\n\n\tRegarding the potential impact of the sale, Casey Bloys — chairman and CEO of HBO and Max content — said: “It’s just one of those things where the reality is the only thing you can control is the job. And the best thing you can do, whoever ends up winning in this auction, is continue to have great shows. So that’s the right move for any outcome.”\n\n\n\tAnother reason the timing is right for this HBO Max European rollout, according to Perrette, is that “we’ve seen what everybody else is offering” he said. “In the four years that we’ve been on this journey, we’ve been able to refine our proposition, to finally realize we don’t want to actually try and merely compete with what they have.”\n\n\tWhat other big streamers are offering is “something for everybody and a lot of volume,” he said, whereas HBO Max has a “much more defined and tighter proposition.”\n\n\tHBO Max, which first launched in the U.S. in 2020, has since expanded across Latin America, Europe and Asia. For Q3 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery reported 128 million global streaming subscribers. In March, they will bow in the U.K. and Ireland completing, all of Europe and its Western world rollout. In Asia, Perrette noted that “there are still some key markets that we’re not rolled out in yet” and that “we will evaluate going forward.”\n\t\n\n\tIn terms of content, it’s hard to argue that HBO Max is merely boasting. The current HBO Max rollout in Germany, Italy, Austria, Greece and Israel will bring subscribers a rapid fire onslaught of the streamer’s latest buzzy shows, starting with “Game of Thrones” prequel “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” which launches in Europe on Jan. 19, almost day-and-date with the U.S. That will be followed by steamy ice hockey romance show “Heated Rivalry,” which will release on Feb. 13 amid Italy’s Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina, which will broadcast live on HBO Max from Feb. 6 to 22.  HBO Max is the primary streaming hub in Europe for the Winter Olympics, and Perrette is expecting “great numbers” in terms of viewership.\n\n\tThat’s on top of the streamer’s other popular shows such as “The Pitt,” “It: Welcome to Derry,” “House of the Dragon,” “The Last of Us,” “The White Lotus” and “Euphoria,” while movie offerings include “Superman,” “The Batman,” “Dune” and the “Harry Potter” franchise.\n\n\tAs for Italian originals, the first HBO Max Italy show — out on Feb. 20 — is revered auteur Marco Bellocchio’s “Portobello,” which reconstructs one of the country’s most clamorous travesties of justice and premiered to positive reviews in September at the Venice Film Festival. Other standout HBO Max Italian originals in the pipeline include “In Utero,” a series set in a Barcelona fertility clinic starring Sergio Castellitto (“Conclave”), directed by Maria Sole Tognazzi (“Petra”) and produced by ITV-owned Cattleya in association with Paramount Television International Studio.\n\n\tIn terms of HBO Max’s level of investment in Italy, Perrette said it will be “strong and growing,” but also strictly focused on driving local audiences.\n\n\t“Generally speaking, the goal of the local programming is to aspire to make the best version of an Italian show or a German show,” Bloys pointed out.\n\n\t“If it appeals elsewhere, that’s great,” he added. “But I always tell the programmers, I don’t want them to think about, ‘Will this show that we are committed to in Italy work anywhere else?’ You can’t think about shows like that. You just have to think of the best Italian show possible. And if it’s a good show, it has a better chance of working elsewhere.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance said “time is of the essence” in its lawsuit seeking to force Warner Bros. Discovery to divulge more financial info about its deal with Netflix. But a judge disagreed with that assessment.\n\n\tOn Thursday, Delaware Chancery Court judge Morgan T. Zurn dismissed Paramount’s motion to expedite the lawsuit against WBD, which seeks details on how WBD valued the overall Netflix transaction as well as the proposed Discovery Global networks spin-off. David Ellison, Paramount Skydance’s CEO and chairman, is waging a hostile takeover bid aimed at persuading Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders that his company’s all-cash $30/share offer for WBD in its entirety is superior to Netflix’s agreement to buy Warner Bros.’s studios and streaming businesses for $27.75/share.\n\t\n\n\tIn the ruling, Zurn said Paramount had failed to show it would “suffer irreparable harm” because of Warner Bros. Discovery’s allegedly deficient disclosures. That’s because, as a shareholder, Paramount cannot be harmed directly by WBD’s purported lack of disclosures since Paramount is not making any decision on its own tender offer, according to the judge.\n\n\n\tIn a statement, Warner Bros. Discovery said: “Today’s lawsuit by Paramount Skydance was yet another unserious attempt to distract and the Judge saw right through it. We are pleased a Delaware Court agreed with our belief and rejected the notion that this lawsuit needed special treatment and may have other serious flaws. Despite its multiple opportunities, Paramount Skydance continues to propose a transaction that our board unanimously concluded is not superior to the merger agreement with Netflix.”\n\t\n\n\tParamount Skydance said in a statement to Variety, “Today’s ruling (by the Honorable Morgan T. Zurn) was based on Paramount’s standing and does not pertain to the merits of Paramount’s claim. WBD shareholders need the information on the WBD Board’s evaluation of the Global Networks stub equity and the ‘risk adjustments’ performed on Paramount’s offer to make an informed decision. WBD shareholders should ask why their Board is working so hard to hide this information. Paramount continues to urge WBD to make these disclosures so that WBD shareholders can make an informed decision.”\n\n\tParamount had said in its motion for an expedited trial in the WBD case that, “There is a live investment recommendation, and stockholders are being asked to tender their shares now,” noting that Paramount’s tender offer currently expires on Jan. 21, 2026, “and cannot be extended indefinitely.” \n\n\t“Full and complete disclosure allows stockholders to leave the sidelines and make fully informed decisions about tendering their shares and exercising their rights,” Paramount said in the motion.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery, in a court filing Wednesday opposing Paramount’s motion for an expedited trial, dismissed the move as “an exercise in urgency theatre — ringing a fire alarm in the absence of any flames or even smoke.” WBD noted that Paramount “set its own expiration date” of Jan. 21 for the hostile takeover offer and that Paramount “has the unilateral and unfettered ability to extend that expiration, and it admits that this offer is neither its ‘best and final’ nor even possible of closing any time this year. No other urgency is identified, and none exists.”\n\n\tAlso Monday, Paramount said it plans to launch a proxy battle by nominating a slate of directors for election at Warner Bros. Discovery’s 2026 shareholder meeting — who would be willing to “engage on Paramount’s offer and enter into a transaction with Paramount.” In addition, Paramount said it will propose changing WBD bylaws to require shareholder approval to for the Discovery Global spin-off.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery has called Paramount’s lawsuit “meritless” and said the company “has yet to raise the price” of its offer to acquire WBD in its entirety.\n\n\tParamount’s Jan. 12 lawsuit, which names Zaslav and WBD’s other board members as defendants, seeks to force the media company to disclose how it is valuing Discovery Global in the context of the value of the overall Netflix transaction, including how much debt WBD will be offloading to Discovery Global.\n\t\n\n\tThe details Paramount is seeking are crucial for shareholders to evaluate the total value of Netflix’s deal vs. Paramount’s offer, according to Paramount. According to Paramount’s Jan. 8 analysis, the total value of the Netflix transaction to WBD shareholders is $27.42/share, given the decline in Netflix’s share price since that deal was announced. And, according to Paramount’s parsing of the numbers, shares in Discovery Global have zero value under the Netflix deal (although it allowed that Discovery Global had a theoretical M&A value of 50 cents/share).\n\n\tMeanwhile, amid Paramount’s pressure campaign, Netflix reportedly is prepping a revised, all-cash offer to buy the WBD assets. That transaction would be completed after WBD’s spin-off in the third quarter of 2026 of Discovery Global, which is set to include CNN, TBS, HGTV, Food Network and Discovery+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPopular mobile game “Subway Surfers” has announced the upcoming launch of its sequel, “Subway Surfers City.” \n\n\tDebuting globally on Feb. 26, “Subway Surfers City” reimagines the original 2012 game’s train-track chase with an upgraded art style, new gameplay mechanics and modes, and an expansive unseen environment. \n\n\tCreated by SYBO, the same mobile game studio as its predecessor, “Subway Surfers City” brings players into the heart of the animated universe, Subway City. The fictional metropolis will feature four distinct districts for players to unlock and race through, including “The Docks, Southline, Sunrise Blvd, and Delorean Park.” \n\t\n\n\tAs of 2025, “Subway Surfers” has racked up over 4.5 billion lifetime downloads and over 30 million engaged followers across various social media platforms in its nearly 15-year run.\n\n\n\tPer the developers, sequel “Subway Surfers City” will introduce fresh content each season, including additional neighborhoods of the city, characters, outfits, and hoverboards.\n\n\t“Subway Surfers City” will also include new gameplay mechanics, including speed pads to boost progress, a stomp move to uncover hidden advantages, and a bouncy shield to improve jump abilities, among others.\n\n\tAdditionally, the game will offer players the ability to play the game in three different modes: Classic Endless (the popular fast-paced runner experience where players chase high scores and discover new paths), City Tour (a new finite mode where players progress through levels with distinct goals, exploring districts to find hidden stars and complete missions), and Events (a rotation of finite runs and trials designed to challenge players).\n\t\n\n\t“Subway Surfers City” will be free to download on iOS, Android, and Google Play with in-app purchases. Pre-registration for the game opens Wednesday.\n\n\t“At its core, ‘Subway Surfers City’ is the next chapter of Subway Surfers’ nearly 15-year-long legacy,” SYBO CEO Mathias Gredal Nørvig said. “’Subway Surfers’ continues to experience remarkable success year after year, and we’re thrilled to now provide players with an entirely new way to interact with the IP. ‘Subway Surfers City’ stars reimagined fan-favorite characters, while simultaneously introducing never-before-seen content and mechanics. It’s a balance of the classic game our players know and love, with a fresh vibrancy that brings the crew’s universe to life in a whole new way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAh, Perry the Platypus, you’re just in time… for a new “Phineas and Ferb” movie! Variety has learned that Disney Branded Television just greenlit a third “Phineas and Ferb” film, set to begin production later this year to eventually run on Disney+ and the linear Disney Channel.\n\n\tFor their third “Phineas and Ferb” movie, series co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff “Swampy” Marsh have come up with a time-warp-themed adventure story in which the very existence of Phineas and Ferb as brothers is threatened to be erased.\n\t\n\n\tHere’s the logline: “Dr. Doofenshmirtz’s latest time‑travel experiment backfires, erasing the moment Phineas’ mom meets Ferb’s dad — meaning the boys never become brothers and every day is merely adequate. As reality unravels and the future hangs in the balance, Phineas and Ferb must restore the timeline before it’s too late.”\n\n\n\t“Phineas and Ferb” voice actors who will also participate in the new film include Vincent Martella as Phineas Flynn, David Errigo Jr. as Ferb Fletcher, Ashley Tisdale as Candace Flynn, Caroline Rhea as Linda Flynn-Fletcher, Alyson Stoner as Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, Maulik Pancholy as Baljeet, Bobby Gaylor as Buford, Dee Bradley Baker as Perry the Platypus, Povenmire as Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, and Marsh as Major Francis Monogram.\n\n\t“‘Phineas and Ferb’ is built on imagination, heart and humor, where the unexpected is always part of the fun,” said Ayo Davis, president of Disney Branded Television. “This movie gives Dan and Swampy the chance to stretch that world even further and play with what happens when everything gets turned on its head.”\n\t\n\n\tBesides co-creators and exec producers Povenmire and Marsh, the movie’s auspieces include writers Kate Kondell and Jeff Howard, director Bob Bowen and producer Brandi Young.\n\n\t“We’ve always wanted to explore a story centered on family and unconditional love, preferably in a way that’s bold and sentimental yet classically funny,” Povenmire and Marsh said in a joint statement. “We’re grateful to Ayo and her team for giving us the runway to expand Danville and take these characters to a whole new level.”\n\n\t“Phineas and Ferb” previously spawned the 2011 TV movie “Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension,” ranked as one of TV’s top 2 movies that year. In 2020, the show debuted its second movie, “Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe,” which also was an early success story for Disney+.\n\n\tNews of a new movie comes following last year’s big return of “Phineas and Ferb,” which was given a 40-episode revival pickup in 2023. The show returned last year to critical acclaim and strong ratings for the launch of Season 5 last summer, ranking on Nielsen’s Streaming Top 10, drawing nearly 600 million minutes viewed.\n\n\tNew “Phineas and Ferb” content gets underway this weekend, starting on Friday, Jan. 16, with “Agent P Under C.” That series of eight new shorts debuts on Disney+, with episodes also rolling out on Disney Channel and Disney Channel Animation YouTube. The digital series “follows Perry the Platypus as Agent P on a new undercover mission to stop animal adversaries from rival spy organization A.N.A.T.H.E.M.A. (the Alliance of Nefarious Animals That Have an Exceptionally Memorable Acronym).” Here’s a first look:\n\n\n\n\n\tThen, on Saturday, Jan. 17, new episodes of “Phineas and Ferb” drop on Disney+.

    "body": "\n\tThe espionage term “Ponies,” explains the title card to the Peacock spy drama of the same name, derives from the acronym for “persons of no interest.” In the winter of 1977, that’s exactly who Bea (Emilia Clarke) and Twila (Haley Lu Richardson) are: Americans in Moscow by virtue of their husbands’ jobs with the CIA, the women are plus-one invitees to the heart of the Cold War. But when said husbands die in a mysterious plane crash, Bea and Twila enter the arena themselves in search of answers and, whether or not they’re aware of it, a sense of purpose. \n\t\n\n\tThe idea that women won’t attract Soviet suspicion because they’re overlooked and underestimated, as bureau chief Dane (Adrian Lester) argues to his superiors as a rationale for taking them on, is both simplistic and swiftly belied by the show’s subsequent events. (Without spoiling: the KGB has no qualms about deploying the fairer sex for its own ends, so why would they assume their opponents would not?) But as a pretext for zippy capers and a dual character study that slowly acquires emotional depth, the premise of “Ponies” works just fine.\n\n\n\t“Ponies” is the first leading TV role for Clarke, also an executive producer, since the end of “Game of Thrones” over half a decade ago. Creators Susanna Fogel and David Iserson, the writing partners behind 2018 feature “The Spy Who Dumped Me,” reportedly offered the actor her choice of the two protagonists, and one can see what drew her to Bea. The daughter of a Belarussian Holocaust survivor who escaped to New England, Bea’s facility with the Russian language makes her a prime candidate for undercover work — and gives Clarke quite the challenge to prove her range extends far beyond Daenerys Targaryen. (Along with “Heated Rivalry,” it’s been quite the few months for performers flexing their Slavic dialogue skills.)\n\t\n\n\tClarke doesn’t really scan as a first-generation Ashkenazi American to those of us with family who meet the same description, but as a rule-following Wellesley grad, she fits the goodie-two-shoes vibe to a tee. Bea was patiently waiting her turn to put career first while her college sweetheart Chris (Louis Boyer) took a glamorous, high-stakes job half a world away from home. Chris’ death means bookish, polite Bea gets to step up to the plate quicker, and in a much different manner, than she thought. Her ability to blend in gets Bea sent into some incredibly high-stakes situations: liaising with Chris’ erstwhile asset Sasha (Petro Ninovskyi), a technologist with some personal motives for leaking trade secrets to the Americans, and flirting with KGB agent Andrei (Artjom Gilz), who proves implausibly easy to deceive given his day job.\n\n\tThis setup lends itself to plenty of comedy as Bea’s inexperience leads to stumbling and rookie mistakes. (One hasty escape route sends her straight into a dumpster.) But it also leads Bea to uncover the resolve she inherited from her grandmother Manya (the always excellent Harriet Walter), who bears a telltale tattoo from her time in the camps, and start to question the domestic idyll she shared with Chris. Both changes are facilitated by her budding friendship with Twila, who she initially bonds with when Twila teaches her how to strike a hard bargain at the outdoor black market. Twila’s preferred, successful strategy involves a lot of F-bombs.\n\n\tRichardson has previously played young women adrift in projects like “The White Lotus,” “Support the Girls” and “Columbus,” the first her highest-profile role to date. Brash, combative Twila is more outwardly confident than these prior parts, though it’s mostly a front she learned to put up over a rough childhood in Indiana, leaving her adult self resourceful but prickly. (“You have good instincts for field work,” a new mentor tells her. “Problem is, nobody likes you.”) Where Bea loved Chris and reluctantly signs on with the CIA to avenge him, Twila’s marriage to Tom (John Macmillan) was hasty and ultimately unhappy. Twila got hitched to get the hell out of Dodge, and she stays in Moscow because there’s not much to return to back home.\n\n\tAny actual intelligence work done in “Ponies” is in service to these women and their burgeoning friendship. This makes it easier to handwave oversights like multiple characters meant to be passing as Russian walking around Moscow loudly speaking English; we’re here to have fun and watch our heroines come into their own, not show off Le Carré-level expertise in tradecraft. Moral ambiguity is introduced later on, but this also isn’t “The Americans,” with its rigorous interrogation of ideology and what motivates both sides of the communist-capitalist tug of war. The platonic chemistry between Clarke and Richardson is the glue that binds the whole enterprise together.\n\t\n\n\tAfter all, “Ponies” was filmed in Budapest, never giving the transportive sense we’re truly going behind the Iron Curtain. The soundtrack is big on Fleetwood Mac and Boney M, the wardrobe on shag coats and other shorthand that spells out “it’s the ‘70s!” in flashing lights. But the backdrop to Bea and Twila’s adventures is just that: a backdrop. As the women work through their grief and start to get their sea legs, the plot starts to fall into place. A cliffhanger ending makes clear “Ponies” intends to have a Season 2 if Peacock will let it. Considering the eight episodes’s upward trajectory, I’d be more than willing to take the bet on one. \n\n\tAll episodes of “Ponies” Season 1 are now streaming on Peacock.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet’s “Marty Supreme” Oscar campaign got a significant boost during a Q&A for the film moderated by Robert Downey Jr., who won the supporting actor Oscar for Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” in 2024. Downey heaped praise on Chalamet, going so far as to call the 30-year-old actor “one of the greats” of his profession. \n\n\t“You’ve talked a lot lately about this,” Downey said about Chalamet’s pursuit of greatness. “I am literally twice your age. When I was 30, I was making a movie with Norman Jewison. It was called ‘Only You.’ Me and Marisa Tomei. We were on the Amalfi coast somewhere and I just go to Norman Jewison, you know ‘Moonstruck’ and all these great movies, I go, ‘Norman, I think I am one of the greats. I want you to tell me if you agree with that.’ He looked at me like I was nuts. He said, ‘Well, Mr. Downey, that remains to be seen.’ And I want to say in front of God and everyone in this audience here with you that as of ‘Marty Supreme,’ it no longer remains to be seen. Let’s hear it for, Timothée Chalamet.”\n\t\n\n\tChalamet openly told the industry about wanting to be a great actor during his acceptance speech at the 2025 SAG Awards, where he won best actor for playing Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.”\n\n\n\t“I can’t downplay the significance of this award, because it means the most to me,” Chalamet said in his speech. “I know we’re in a subjective business, but the truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don’t usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I am inspired by the greats. I’m as inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis, Marlon Brando and Viola Davis as I am Michael Jordan and Micheal Phelps. I want to be up there. This doesn’t signify that but it’s a little more fuel — a little more ammo to keep going.” \n\t\n\n\tChalamet is an Oscar frontrunner for best actor thanks to “Marty Supreme,” which has already won him honors from the Critics’ Choice Awards and Golden Globes. He picked up an Actor Award nomination from SAG as well and is also cited on the BAFTA longlist in the best actor category. \n\n\tDuring his “Marty” press tour, Chalamet raised eyebrows in Hollywood with his unconventional antics and divisive interviews that some thought veered far too much into cocky territory. In one interview that gained heat on social media, Chalamet told a reporter that “Marty Supreme” marked his best acting role yet after he gave “top-of-the-line performances” over the last “seven, eight years.” He added: “I don’t want people to take it for granted. I don’t want to take it for granted. This is really some top-level shit”\n\n\tChalamet later sat down with “Good Morning America” and made vague comments about the film’s potential success that many on social media interpreted as the actor predicting he’ll be receiving an Oscar for “Marty Supreme” in the new year.\n\n\t“I want the movie to succeed. I want everything to win,” Chalamet said. “The real truth is that ‘Marty Supreme,’ I feel confident to the degree that by next summer … I’m confident I know what it’s gonna be by next summer.”\n\n\tIt turns out Chalamet might not’ve been wrong. Plus, his press tour worked as “Marty Supreme” nears the $100 million mark at the worldwide box office and positions Chalamet as the one to beat for best actor at the Oscars in March.\n\n\tOnce Chalamet’s Oscar season for “Marty Supreme” winds down, he’ll be starting up an international press tour later this year for Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Three.” The sequel has a Dec. 18 release date, as does Downey’s “Avengers: Doomsday.”\n\n\t“We both have films opening on December 18, and we decided to coin it … We’re thinking Dunesday,” Downey told the audience during his Q&A with Chalamet. “We’ll see if we’re still friends by then.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tStrand Releasing has acquired the North American theatrical rights to writer-director Adam Sherman’s “Vampires of the Velvet Lounge.” The horror film will be released by the independent distributor in select markets, including New York and Los Angeles, exclusively in theaters on March 20. \n\n\t“Vampires of the Velvet Lounge” will follow a glamorous coven of vampires in the deep south who prey on lonely singles found through dating apps, seducing and slaughtering them to preserve their youth. But when they “swipe right on the wrong profiles—a cunning undercover vampire hunter and a band of emotionally stunted bros—the hunt spirals into hilariously horrifying chaos,” the official logline reads. “Blood flies, fangs pierce flesh and the bar erupts into a glitter-soaked, green fairy-winged, fang-filled fever dream of grindhouse gore, terrible decisions and fashionably fatal carnage.” \n\t\n\n\tMena Suvari, Dichen Lachman, Stephen Dorff, India Eisley, Tom Berenger, Rosa Salazar and Tyrese Gibson lead Sherman’s cast. The award-winning writer, director and producer is best known for his critically acclaimed films including “Wristcutters: A Love Story,” “She’s Just A Shadow” and “This Game’s Called Murder.” His films “Happiness Runs” and “Crazy Eyes” were previously released by Strand.  \n\n\n\t“Adam Sherman is exactly the kind of filmmaker we love to champion—bold, original and fearless,” said Marcus Hu, co-president of Strand Releasing, in a statement. “His ability to fuse horror, satire, black comedy, mystery, with propulsive style and action is truly distinctive. ‘Vampires of the Velvet Lounge’ is our third collaboration with Adam and we’re thrilled to unleash his fresh spin on vampire mythology for audiences to see in theaters.” \n\t\n\n\tProducers of the project include Marcus Englefield and George Lee for Storyoscopic Films and Noémi Santo, who is co-producing for Adam Sherman Film.\n\n\t“Reteaming with Marcus and Jon at Strand is like coming home and I’m grateful for their continued support of my films,” said Sherman in a statement. “This is a vampire story inspired by the chilling, lesser-known legend of Elizabeth Báthory, the 16th-century Hungarian countess rumored to bathe in the blood of virgins to stay young. I set out to make the kind of horror film I loved growing up, one that’s wild, disturbing, darkly funny and made for the big screen. It came alive thanks to my extraordinary cast and crew who were game to push every boundary and I’m thrilled to finally share it.”\n\n\tThe North American deal for “Vampires of the Velvet Lounge” was brokered by Brian O’Shea of The Exchange and Patrick Alach of Longo & Alach on behalf of Adam Sherman Film, in negotiation with Jon Gerrans, Co-President of Strand Releasing. The Exchange is handling all territories outside of North America.\n",

He says Pizzonia then struck him again -- and he says he was surprised by the altercation because he's 6'3\" and weighs over 300 pounds.\n      \n    \n          They were soon separated and Kotowski reported the incident to local law enforcement, which ultimately arrested Pizzonia for assault.\n      \n    \n          \"There are different ways of dealing with this, and luckily, I was able to control my emotions,\" Kotowski said.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As we previously reported, Pizzonia spoke out about his arrest on Instagram … saying he regrets his actions but was simply defending his son.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Cars\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Fights & Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Officers find no one at the crash..they track Taylor-Britt to his house, officers find him outside.“It is what it is.” Taylor-Britt then offers to go back to the scene. The officer asks, “Who was driving?”Watch @Local12 6 for more pic.twitter.com/OZXybBLfQT— meghan mongillo (@meghanmongillo) January 14, 2026\n              @meghanmongillo\n          \n  \n    \n          When speaking with cops, Taylor-Britt acknowledged his license was suspended at the time.\n      \n    \n          Ultimately, Booker stated he was the driver ... after initially blaming it on a drunk \"female\" who ran off after the crash.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          This incident happened the day before Taylor-Britt suffered a season-ending injury during the Bengals vs. Steelers game.\n      \n    \n          Earlier this month, Taylor-Britt pled guilty to reckless driving and driving with a restricted license ... and was sentenced to five days behind bars.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Cam Taylor-Britt\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Car Crashes\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Cincinnati Bengals\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

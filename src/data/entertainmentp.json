    "body": "\n\tWhen Ashley Walters started work on “Animol,” he had little idea what would be coming around the corner.\n\n\tThe film — a gritty and tense coming-of-age drama set in a British juvenile detention center and tackling themes such as identity, betrayal and sexuality — marks his feature directorial debut and the boldest move yet in what was, at the time, a decision by the “Top Boy” star to step away from acting after more than 30 years. Walters had fallen out of love with the profession that had made him something of a trailblazing name in the U.K. in the mid-2000s.\n\t\n\n\tWritten by Nick Love, “Animol” stars a couple of impressive young newcomers in Tut Nyuot (since seen in “Steve” and “The Long Walk”) and Vladyslav Baliuk. In a supporting role was Walters long-time friend and occasional collaborator Stephen Graham (a part Walters notes he would have reluctantly played himself had Graham not said yes — “I didn’t want to act and direct!”). It was a tough shoot for the first-time director, who had only previously gotten behind the camera for a short film and some TV work.\n\n\n\tBut not long after “Animol” wrapped, Netflix released its one-shot phenomenon “Adolescence.” \n\n\tLike all of the stars of the series, Walters — who would be Emmy-nominated for his turn as a detective inspector in two of the four episodes — saw his world turned upside down. Acting was suddenly back on the menu in a massive way and he was soon shooting alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in M. Night Shyamalan’s supernatural thriller “Remain” — his first major part in a U.S. movie — and then the HBO’s sci-fi series “Dune Prophecy.” But at the same time, he was also supposed to be deep in post on “Animol.”\n\t\n\n\tThe juggle was, as he notes, “nuts,” with editing done from planes and trains, between shoots and awards shows. Not only did he get it done, however, but now “Animol” is having it world premiere in Berlin  (where Bankside are selling it globally).\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety, Walters lifts the lid on a creative year like no other. \n\t\n\t\tHow was the experience of behind the camera for a full feature? Did it give you a newfound respect for directors and everything that they have to juggle at once?\t\n\n\tI think that actually started happening when I shot [2021 short)] “Boys.” Going into my next project as an actor I had a huge respect for the director. But a feature is completely different to everything I’ve done before. This really is a director’s medium, by which I mean I had to answer all the questions. I had to know what I was doing. There was no moment where I could just leave it. And that was tough. But I love a challenge and leaning into danger. And I think I’ve come out a better man.\n\t\n\t\tWhen it was first announced, “Animol” was described as being partially autobiographical. What element of your own story made into this.\t\n\n\tWhere it connects is that I did go to a young offenders institute as a kid — that’s where me and Nick [Love] connected on the story. But Nick wrote it and these are some of his real experiences. But it meant a lot for me to make this film, because I’ve grown up knowing that in the Black community there is a lot of homophobia. But it was only until I got into acting that I got to know the queer community and had to change some of the views I’ve been brought up with. This film is powerful for many reasons, but an important one for me is challenging taboo subjects and making people have conversations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVladyslav Baliuk and Tut Nyuot in ‘Animol’. Credit: Anthony Dickenson\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou previously said that you’d been making moves as a director because you wanted to shift away from acting and that you’d fallen out of love with it. And then, in the middle of making “Animol,” “Adolescence” happened. Did it force you to have a rethink?\t\n\n\tHa! Yeah. I can’t lie. But, to give myself some credit, there are roles coming in now that I’m much more interested in playing. I feel like I got caught up in doing back-to-back shows like “Top Boy” and “Bulletproof.” I was just bored. And then “Adolescence” came and the splash from that has been crazy. There’s been a lot of changes and I now feel like acting it back up there on my list.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou were actually supposed to be working on post-production in “Animol” when it all erupted but had to put it on hiatus, right?\t\n\n\tI don’t want to mess up future work so let me just say that I am dedicated and loyal! But yeah, it did get hairy. But I think everyone understood.\n\t\n\t\tI’m sure they did. So were you working on this while shooting with M. Night and then on “Dune Prophecy” and amid all the awards shows?\t\n\n\tYeah, that’s exactly what was happening. It was all at the same time and it was very difficult to juggle. But I got it done. It was tough, but I was working with some great people. But I was Zooming in from planes and watching cuts from the train. It was nuts, but it had to be done. I wouldn’t do it that way again.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAshley Walters on the set of ‘Animol’\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSo now acting is back in the mix, which do you prefer?\t\n\n\tThey both give different things. If I am to be brutally honest, it takes a lot more out of me to act than it does to direct. I’m a very shy person and quiet anxious. So it actually takes a lot for me to be in spaces and perform in front of people. But directing, I feel much more at peace. There’s some level of serenity that I get in that madness.\n\t\n\t\tCan you put into words the last not-even-a year since “Adolescence” came out?\t\n\n\tIn a nutshell, it feels like I’ve been in a queue for 30 odd years for this thing. And now I’m at the front of the queue.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHGTV has ended its long-running home restoration series “Rehab Addict” after star Nicole Curtis was caught using a racial slur during filming. \n\n\t“HGTV was recently made aware of an offensive racial comment made during the filming of ‘Rehab Addict,’” the network told Variety in a statement. “Not only is language like this hurtful and disappointing to our viewers, partners, and employees – it does not align with the values of HGTV. Accordingly, we have removed the series from all HGTV platforms.”\n\t\n\n\tThe statement continued, “We remain dedicated to fostering a culture of respect and inclusion across our content and our workplace.”\n\n\n\tThe first two episodes of “Rehab Addict” Season 9 aired in July 2025, but the run was cut short after Curtis made an “executive decision” to shelve the remaining episodes and recut them for a later release. The rest of the season was supposed to come back Feb. 12, but that plan has been scrapped.\n\n\tIn a statement to TMZ following the cancellation, Curtis said, “I want to be clear: the word in question is wrong and not part of my vocabulary and never has been, and I apologize to everyone.” She tells us she was unaware of HGTV’s decision to pull the plug on her show on the same day it was set to return to air after a hiatus.” She added, “I’m grateful for the 15-year journey we’ve shared. It’s been a meaningful chapter, but my focus isn’t on my career. My focus, at this moment is rightfully on my relationships, and my community — the people who truly know my character and where my heart is.”\n\n\t“Rehab Addict” debuted its first three seasons on the DIY Network before moving to HGTV in 2014. The show follows Curtis as she restores old homes.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWestEnd Films has acquired international sales rights to “The Last Day,” the feature debut written and directed by artist Rachel Rose, and is releasing an exclusive first picture.\n\n\tThe film stars Alicia Vikander, an Oscar winner with “The Danish Girl,” and Wagner Moura, who is Oscar nominated for “The Secret Agent,” alongside Victoria Pedretti, whose credits include “Enemy of the People,” “Ponyboi” and “The Haunting of Hill House.”\n\n\n\tInspired by Virginia Woolf’s “Mrs. Dalloway,” “The Last Day” unfolds over a single summer’s day in New York, where the lives of two mothers briefly intertwine. Julia, a writer and mother, is unsettled by creative stagnation, unprocessed grief and the approach of her daughter’s adolescence. An unexpected encounter with Taylor — a labor and delivery nurse in the midst of a postpartum crisis pushes Julia to reconsider the life she has built, and whether she can rediscover herself within it.\n\t\n\n\tThe film, currently in post-production, is produced by Academy Award nominees Christine Vachon and Pamela Koffler (“Past Lives,” “Materialists,” “May December”), and Mason Plotts (“May December,” “Late Fame”) for Killer Films; David Kaplan (“The Brutalist,” “It Comes at Night,” “It Follows”), Lucie Elwes and Rose. Maja Hoffmann and Lucas Hoffmann of Luma Projects serve as executive producers.\n\n\tHeads of department include director of photography Eric Yue (“I Saw the TV Glow,” “A Thousand and One”), editor Taylor Levy (“Bodies Bodies Bodies,” “A Different Man”), costume designer April Napier (“Lady Bird,” “May December,” “Booksmart”) and Emmy Award-winning music supervisor Susan Jacobs (“American Hustle,” “I, Tonya,” “Promising Young Woman”).\n\t\n\n\tRose is an internationally acclaimed artist whose work has been exhibited worldwide and is held in major public collections including LACMA, Tate Modern and the Whitney Museum of American Art. She has participated in leading international exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale and the Carnegie International, and is a recipient of the Frieze Artist Award.\n\n\tRose said: “Becoming a mother felt to me like a collision between a beginning and a threat, and I knew I needed to write from the existential tension of that contradiction. In ‘Mrs. Dalloway,’ I was struck by how Virginia Woolf reveals Clarissa’s self-erasure not through overt drama, but through the texture of a single, ordinary day — errands, chance encounters — until something immense has shifted inside her. That structure became my guide. This film follows two mothers over the course of one day, using its mundane rhythms to explore what it feels like to lose one’s bearings, to experience rudderlessness and to reckon with how far, and how subtly, motherhood can carry us away from ourselves.”\n\n\tMaya Amsellem, managing director of WestEnd Films, added: “’The Last Day’ is an intimate and powerful exploration of motherhood and identity, anchored by extraordinary performances from Alicia Vikander, Victoria Pedretti and Wagner Moura. Rachel brings a rare sensitivity and formal precision to the material, creating a film that feels both deeply personal and universally resonant. We are proud to be partnering on a project that speaks so eloquently to contemporary conversations around womanhood and creativity and we can’t wait to share it with buyers.”\n\n\tWestEnd Films is introducing “The Last Day” to international buyers at the European Film Market. The film has been acquired under WeLove, WestEnd’s label dedicated to developing and producing female-driven stories and championing female talent.\n\n\tCAA Media Finance and UTA Independent Film Group co-represent North American rights on the film.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark Valadez, who served as a writer-producer on “Queen of the South,” will lead “Those Little White Lines” as showrunner, a new series being developed by Brisbane’s Red Empire Productions and Organic Media Group, based in Taipei and Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe drama draws from an autobiographical novel by Kaz Piper, a former rock-era insider, centering on a woman navigating the music industry during the 1980s. The narrative employs a dual-timeline structure to chronicle her journey through a world marked by substance abuse, criminal networks and personal danger before ultimately breaking free.\n\t\n\n\t“What drew me to ‘Those Little White Lines’ is the same thing that drives all great crime stories — a protagonist who survives by learning the rules faster than the people trying to control her,” Valadez said. “Set inside the excess of the 1980s music world, this is a story about power, addiction, ambition, and reinvention. It’s visceral, dangerous, and deeply human — exactly the kind of character-first drama I love to make.”\n\n\n\tThe producers are preparing to bring the project to buyers as an Australia-U.S. co-production.\n\n\tExecutive producer Steve Chicorel noted the international nature of the collaboration. “Developing ‘Those Little White Lines’ from Australia, Taiwan and the U.S. reflects how global motion pictures now truly works — creative voices, production, and audiences moving fluidly across borders,” he said. “Australia and Asia are no longer just markets; they’re part of a global creative engine. This series speaks to that evolution while delivering a powerful, character-driven story with international reach.”\n\t\n\n\tProduction will be based in Wollongong, Australia, under the supervision of Red Empire’s Amie Casey, with filming locations serving both contemporary and period settings. The executive producer roster includes Shari Hamrick Grewal from Organic Media Group, handling U.S. production and Taiwan casting, along with author Piper.\n\n\t“This story comes from lived experience — the glamour, the danger, the cost of wanting too much freedom too young,” Piper said. “For years I was told this world was too wild, too female, too honest to adapt. Seeing it reimagined as a series with this creative team feels like reclaiming my voice and finally telling the truth behind the myth of the era.”\n\n\tOrganic Media Group, launched by actor-producer Kelly Mi Li and musician-producer Chicorel, develops scripted and unscripted programming for international buyers, with a particular emphasis on projects that bridge Asian and Western markets.\n\n\tRed Empire Productions, established by writer-producer-actor Amie Casey, focuses on internationally oriented premium drama, partnering with producers across territories to bring Australian-originated content to worldwide viewers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBig news for “Diablo II” fans: the Blizzard Entertainment game is getting its first major update in 25 years.\n\n\tTitled “Reign of the Warlock,” the DLC will feature actor Rahul Kohli (“The Haunting of Bly Manor,” “Midnight Mass,” “iZombie”) starring as the voice of the titular Warlock. Per Blizzard, “the Warlock is disciplined, ominous, and incredibly knowledgeable, lingering in the shadows for years and studying secrets mortals shouldn’t know.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to debuting in the new update for “Diablo II: Resurrected” (which is the remastered version of the original “Diablo II”), the Warlock class will arrive in the upcoming “Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred” update in April and the mobile title “Diablo Immortal” this summer.\n\n\n\tThese announcements were made by Blizzard Entertainment on Wednesday as part of a showcase teasing multiple ways the Microsoft-owned “Diablo” franchise will be marking its 30th anniversary this year leading up to more reveals at BlizzCon in September.\n\n\t“Reign of the Warlock” launches Wednesday in “Diablo II: Resurrected” across Battle.net, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch. “Diablo Immortal’s” Warlock-focused update, “Andariel Rises,” will debut this summer. \n\n\tThe “Diablo IV” update “Lord of Hatred” arrives April 28 on Battle.net, PlayStation, Xbox and Steam, and more information about how the Warlock will be worked into that DLC  will be revealed in a developer update event on March 5 at 11 a.m. PT.\n\n\t“This actually just came out of the blue,” Kohli told Variety in an interview ahead of the official announcement. “I received a text message from Rod Fergusson, who said, ‘Do you not want to do Diablo?’ And I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’ And he was like, ‘We haven’t heard back.’ I went to my team and I was like, ‘What’s going on? Diablo?’ And they basically forwarded this offer, and in the email heading it said ‘Diablo II,’ which I thought was a typo, an error. It’s probably ‘Diablo IV’ they mean.”\n\t\n\n\tKohli continued: “Because I also had worked with Rod previously on ‘Gears of War,’ I sort of assumed at some point ‘Diablo IV’ would come knocking, and it never did. So I sort of resented him for that. And then when that came through, and it was ‘Diablo II,’ obviously, I thought it was a typo. But then once I looked through the character profile, I realized, ‘Oh, this is new content for a game that came out in the year 2000.’ Obviously, it’s for the remaster, but it’s still new content for a 26-year-old game. So I was very hyped.”\n\n\tWatch the “Diablo” franchise’s cinematic trailer introducing Kohli’s Warlock character in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJustin Baldoni and Blake Lively failed to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit on Wednesday, after a daylong mediation in federal court.\n\n\tThe co-stars of “It Ends With Us” entered the New York courthouse on Friday morning and spent much of the day in separate courtrooms on the 14th floor. At the end of the day, each exited the building, passed through a throng of media and said nothing.\n\n\n\tBryan Freedman, Baldoni’s attorney, confirmed to reporters that no deal had been reached. He acknowledged that a deal could still happen, but seemed to think it was unlikely. Asked if he believed the case will go to trial, he said, “I do. We’re looking forward to it.”\n\t\n\n\tThe mediation with Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave is a routine part of federal procedure. While both sides previously had in-person sessions with Cave, there was no outward indication that either side expected the talks to go anywhere.\n\n\n\tLively has accused Baldoni of harassing her on the set of “It Ends With Us,” and of working with his publicists to orchestrate a smear campaign against her after she complained. A trial is set for May 18.\n\n\tJudge Lewis Liman is considering whether to throw out or substantially pare back Lively’s complaint ahead of trial. Baldoni’s team has argued in a summary judgment motion that the suit amounts to little more than petty grievances that fall well below the standard for harassment. \n\n\tLively’s side, meanwhile, has noted that other actors also had complaints about Baldoni’s conduct on set, and that the allegations do rise to the level to be decided by a jury.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe community has come together in a big way following the death of James Van Der Beek.\n\n\tThe actor died at 48 on Feb. 11, following a battle with colorectal cancer. Shortly after the news broke, his friends started a GoFundMe account, asking for help for his wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek and their six children.\n\n\tOn Feb. 12, the account reached $1 million. The goal was originally set at $250,000 but increased throughout the day on Wednesday to $1.3 million. \n\t\n\n\t“In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James’s medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,” the message on the GoFundMe reads. “They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time. The support of friends, family, and the wider community will make a world of difference as they navigate the road ahead.”\n\n\tThe money raised “will help cover essential living expenses, pay bills, and support the children’s education,” the page continued. “Every donation, no matter the size, will help Kimberly and her family find hope and security as they rebuild their lives. Thank you for considering a gift to support them.”\n\n\tVan Der Beek shared six kids with his wife: Olivia, 15, Joshua, 13, Annabel, 12, Emilia, 9, and Gwendolyn, 7, and Jeremiah, 4. \n\n\tLast year, the actor began working with Propstore to sell memorabilia from “Dawson’s Creek,” including props, set pieces and wardrobe from his time on The WB hit, in order to help with the costs of cancer treatment. He was diagnosed in 2023 and shared the news the following year.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it’s clear that the time is now,” he told People at the time. “While I have some nostalgia tugging at me as I part with these items, it feels good to be able to offer them through Propstore’s auction to share with those who have supported my work over the years.”\n\n\tHe later also began selling jerseys from “Varsity Blues,” for both his own medical costs and to help other “families walking the same path.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 14, Episode 6  of “The Masked Singer,” “Twilight Night,” which aired Feb. 11 on Fox.\n\n\tThis week’s “The Masked Singer” reveal may have left Billy Ray Cyrus with an achy breaky heart. The country singer, who also hit No. 1 with Lil Nas X on “Old Town Road,” was the latest celebrity to be unmasked on Season 14 of the Fox singing reality competition.\n\n\n\tAmong the panelists, no one got it right. Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg named Ted Danson. Ken Jeong weirdly thought it was Danson as well, Rita Ora guessed Kurt Russell, and Robin Thicke went with Dennis Quaid.\n\t\n\n\tIn his first appearance, Cyrus referenced his 1992 claim to fame: “When I took flight, you couldn’t go anywhere without hearing my name. Folks even started following my look. Imagine that. But then there were also the comments. My biggest fear became people laughing at me, and not with me. Terrifying, right?  But I didn’t listen. Instead, I focused on me. On family. Eventually, life gave me the chance to do something so big, those haters were all eating their words. So, if folks are poking fun behind your back, just give them the bird and do your thing.”\n\n\tIn another clue package on the show, Cyrus — as Owl — alluded to his early career goals and his switch to singing: “I love America’s favorite pastime as much as anyone. But I’m no pro.  Back in the day, I was a scrappy, right-handed slugger. Then one day, my heart was telling me something. This was not my path. So I turned in my glove. I knew there were other fields for me to play in. And guess what? I soared to success. Now that’s a lesson I try to teach my kids. Follow your heart and no matter the field, you’ll always hit a grand slam.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tChristina Perri opened the show by singing “A Thousand Year,” her song from the “Twilight” saga. The episode featured scenes re-created from the film franchise, while simultaneously celebrating Valentine’s Day.\n\n\tOn this week’s episode, the bottom two were Owl and Stingray. They battled by both performing their own versions of “Love Is a Battlefield,” by Pat Benatar. Stingray was saved, leaving Owl to be unmasked as Cyrus.\n\n\tWith Owl gone, that leaves High Voltage, Pangolin, Eggplant, Galaxy Girl, Stingray, Cat Witch, Pugcasso, Snow Cone and Crane in the competition.\n\n\tBilly Ray Cyrus (Owl) joins Teddi Mellencamp (Calla Lily), Claudia Oshry (Queen Corgi), Taraji P. Henson (Scarab), Tone Loc (Handyman), Tiffany Haddish (Le Who Who), Todd and Julie Chrisley (Croissants) and David “Big Papi” Ortiz (Googly Eyes) as the celebrities unmasked so far on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\n\tBack for Season 14 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists McCarthy Wahlberg, Jeong, Ora and Thicke.\n\n\tNew this season is “America’s Insider,” in which singer, dancer and social media personality Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues for viewers. The twist: Cantrall is in costume as Cat Witch, but will only unmask for viewers — so the audience knows who she is, but the panelists don’t.\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\t\n\n\tHere were the performances on Wednesday’s episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCat Witch, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCat Witch\t\n\n\tSong: “It Will Rain,” by Bruno Mars\n\n\tPrevious songs: “Abracadabra,” by Lady Gaga; “Teenage Dream,” by Katy Perry\n\n\tValentine’s Clue: Chocolate turkey. “Over 30 million people watched me on one very special big day. And I was riding high.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Victoria Justice, Zendaya, Hailee Steinfeld\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Charli D’Amelio, Addison Rae, Lisa from Blackpink; Victoria Justice, Ashley Tisdale\n\n\tCat Witch voiceover: “OMG, I was dying to see if Bella would choose Edward or Jacob. I know what it’ like to be torn between two suitors. I had my eye on an Edward myself. A dreamer who was shiny and irresistible.But a Jacob appeared. He was pretty cool too, and he wanted me bad. I knew how rare the opportunity was. The proposal of a lifetime! But it didn’t feel right to me. So I walked away, Everyone was like, ‘girl, you’re crazy!’ And I started to believe them. A few months later, the phone rang. And it was the call I was waiting for. My Edward! And finally, everything felt right. I’m most proud of that moment, for trusting I’d find my soulmate. I said ‘I do,’ and the rest is sweet.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t14 Karat Carrot, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t14 Karat Carrot\t\n\n\tSong: “Tainted Love,” by Gloria Jones\n\n\tPrevious song: “Hold On, I’m Comin,” by Sam and Dave\n\n\tValentine’s Clue: Gold star on the Walk of Fame. “They told me to shoot for the stars and I landed on one in Hollywood.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Lionel Richie, Jermaine Jackson, Ron Isley\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Al Green, Otis Williams of the Temptations, Morgan Freeman, Verdine White\n\n\t14 Karat Carrot voiceover: “Edward and Bella had an epic love story. And that brings us to mine. I met my wife when we were 18. I saw her across campus, and my God, she was divine. But our first interaction was fiery. We did not see eye-to-eye. Finally, I realized the way to this woman’s heart was serenading her. And when she heard my buttery voice, that did the trick. We’ve been together ever since. Let’s say, we’ve kept the fire alive, if you know what I mean.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStingray, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tStingray\t\n\n\tSong: “Bad Habits,” by Ed Sheeran\n\t\n\n\tPrevious songs: “Stayin’ Alive,” by Bee Gees; “Momma Song,” by Benson Boone\n\n\tValentine’s Clue: Empty ring box. Phone ring from his valentine. “We support each other.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Jordan Fisher, Joey McIntyre, Jason Derulo\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Lenny Kravitz, Jaden Smith, Lil Romeo, Jaden Smith, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Donald Glover\n\n\tStingray voiceover: “Wolves? Vampires? And love? What a combination. And I get it. After years of running around, the girl of my dreams came into my life. I knew she was the one. So I bought the ring, hid it in my pocket and I practiced the proposal over and over. But when the time came, a tarantula the size of her head stares right at me. I screamed, ‘Look!’ I got down on one knee. And she said yes. We laugh about it now.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOwl, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSong: “White Wedding,” by Billy Idol\n\n\tPrevious songs: “Wild Thing,” by the Troggs; “Ain’t No Sunshine,” by Bill Withers\n\n\tValentine’s Clue: Phone call from a British valentine. “It’s great being with y’all.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Walton Goggins, Ted Danson, Woody Harrelson\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Matthew McConaughey, Billy Bob Thornton, Kurt Russell, Jeff Daniels\n\n\tOwl voiceover: “’Twilight’ was packed with chemistry. I know a thing or two about that. I was at my lowest point, getting dragged through the mud publicly. Suddenly, I get a text from a number I don’t recognize. It says, ‘the vultures are circling. And I’m in your corner.’ The thing is, I didn’t know who sent it. It turned out to be from someone I least expected. This girl was just as beautiful as her words. We went out for a date, and the chemistry was real. We’ve been together ever since. Ironically, we love bird watching together. Well tonight, baby, you get to watch your bird and know that I only have eyes for you.”\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\t\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tBerlin’s Teddy Awards have been celebrating queer films and artists since their inception 40 years ago, with past winners including Gus van Sant and Pedro Almodóvar. The initiative was not initially conceived as an award but rather a way of spotlighting LGBTQI+ films submitted across the festival. “For 10 years it was quite subcultural and we just organized it out of [Berlin strand] Panorama,” co-founder Wieland Speck says.\n\n\tWithin a few years, however, it had morphed into a bona fide awards event, complete with a cuddly teddy bear to take home (later replaced with a statue). The first award was handed out in 1987 to Almodóvar for Antonio Banderas-starrer “Law of Desire.” Back then, the LGBTQI+ landscape differed dramatically, particularly for filmmakers. “We had voices against us, but that’s normal: as a gay person, you’re used to that,” says Speck. “We were smart and arrogant enough to not care.”\n\t\n\n\tFour decades later, the Teddy Awards are no longer part of the festival’s subculture but “inscribed into the DNA” of Berlinale itself, says Michael Stütz, the festival’s co-director of film programming. But the award is still bestowed upon any submission to the festival that the Teddy Award jury deem worthy rather than, in Stütz’s words, a separate “ghetto within the program.” And it continues to be coveted by filmmakers, because as well as honoring a film, it has the benefit of creating buzz around a project — particularly helpful for less commercial fare that might otherwise struggle to break through. “It creates news, it creates awareness about its existence,” says Saagar Gupta, a producer and artistic director of India’s Kashish Pride Film Festival, who is on this year’s Teddy jury.\n\t\n\n\tThe award can also help spotlight filmmakers from more conservative parts of the world who might struggle to promote their cinematic efforts back home. “I remember filmmakers from China smuggling out their cinema prints because they didn’t give into censorship,” says Stütz, while Speck cites films from India and Iran that have fallen foul of homophobic censors. In 2014, “Stories of Our Lives,” made by a Nairobi-based arts collective, was banned in Kenya before going on to win a Teddy Award. Speck recalls being in Kenya a few years later when another queer film, “Rafiki,” by Wanuri Kahiu, was banned by the country’s film classification board due to its “homosexual theme.”\n\n\tWhich is why Stütz, who is also head of the Panorama strand, and his team feel a duty of care to prospective honorees and will sometimes even ask them if they (and everyone listed in the credits) are comfortable with receiving a Teddy Award. “We had to make sure that we don’t endanger the life of those filmmakers,” he explains. Sometimes a filmmaker will change the credits on the film to protect their cast and crew.\n\n\tEven in the West, Stütz says, there’s still a “huge need” for the spotlight of the Teddy Awards. “Especially in times like these, where globally we’re facing a backlash and spaces are becoming more narrow again.” Which is one of the reasons the festival is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the awards with a special program at the Zoo Palast and Deutschen Kinemathek (E Werk) at this year’s festival.\n\n\tFor Gupta, who says being on the jury is a “a big honor and responsibility,” the aim of the Teddy Awards is not just to celebrate LGBTQI+ films but highlight them for a wider audience. “Queer should not remain just as a category,” Gupta says. “It should become just one of many ways to read human stories in the years to come. That’s my hope.”\n\t\n\t\tThe Teddy Statue \t\n\n\tAt the inception of the Teddy Awards “we had real teddies to give away,” says co-founder Wieland Speck. As the award became more prominent, Speck & Co. decided winners should get a statue to put on their mantles. Cartoonist Ralf König designed the award, which was then cast in 3D. With its pear-shaped body and Yogi Bear-ish face, the statue resembles its more majestic counterpart, Berlinale’s Golden Bear, the highest prize awarded at the festival, but retains a counterculture sensibility. Why stick with a bear? “Because the teddy is, for most people on this planet, the first companion in bed. So everyone knows a teddy,” says Weiland.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Highguard” maker Wildlight Entertainment has laid off multiple members of its staff less than a month after the release of its debut video game.\n\n\t“Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game,” Wildlight said in a statement Wednesday. “We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.”\n\t\n\n\tThe number of staff impacted by the layoffs was not disclosed and a representative for Wildlight declined Variety‘s request for further comment.\n\n\n\tFounded by CEO Dusty Welch and game director Chad Grenier, Wildlight Entertainment is made up of roughly 100 employees, the majority of which previously worked with Grenier and Welch at Electronic Arts’ Respawn on “Apex Legends.” The indie studio was created amid the pandemic and all staffers at the company were exclusively working on PvP raid shooter “Highguard,” which launched Jan. 26 as a free-to-play title across PC, Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5.\n\n\t“Highguard” is described as having “a new competitive structure that blends siege warfare and territory control in an evolving match where power levels escalate until only one base is left standing.” \n\n\tThe game has been closely compared to Blizzard’s successful “Overwatch” franchise and the now-shuttered PlayStation title “Concord” (which was pulled two weeks after launch in September 2024). And while “Highguard” launched with a three-person-team structure, rather than the 5v5 model utilized by “Overwatch 2” and “Concord,” it quickly added the five-person-team option in response to fan demand.\n\t\n\n\t“I think we do have a very unique game that is unlike anything else out there on the market, and we’re really excited about it,” Grenier told Variety at a press preview event for “Highguard” on Jan. 22.\n\n\t“What we’re confident in is that we’re not going anywhere. We’re not going away,” Welch said at the time. “We as a team have a lot of experience in building franchises that have staying power. And this one, as Chad alluded to, we have a year’s worth of content that’s near completion that is going to engage an audience for quite a bit of time. So we’re excited to be able to bring that. We have the experience, but that said, we’re humbled, and we hope people love this — but we’re ready to engage with them.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis probably wasn’t the kickoff to a run on “CBS Evening News” that Tony Dokoupil — or his bosses — envisioned.\n\n\tThe anchor, a veteran of CBS News’ morning program, was to have launched his tenure Monday, but a stunning attack on Venezuela by U.S. forces followed by an extraction of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, made his appearance on the network’s evening news all the more necessary, particularly as top personnel at other networks, including Tom Llamas at NBC and Kaitlan Collins at CNN, unveiled their intention to show up for weekend duty on their networks’ evening schedules.\n\t\n\n\tSo here was Dokoupil, on Saturday evening, working to brief viewers on the latest developments, aided by correspondents like Charlie D’Agata and Scott MacFarlane — and a three-segment interview with U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n\n\n\tViewers may have expected to see Dokoupil out from behind the desk, taking the temperature of more average Americans. Earlier this week, after all, he appeared in a promo telling potential viewers that “on too many stories the press missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\n\tSaturday’s “CBS Evening News” had no direct input from average Americans, and Hegseth, who enjoys a level of power most people in the U.S. do not, could certainly be viewed as “elite.”\n\n\tDokoupil has many challenges ahead. “CBS Evening News” has run in third place, well behind ABC’s “World News Tonight” and NBC’s “NBC Nightly News,” for years, and its standing has been eroded more in recent months as CBS tested a two-anchor format with Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson that ended up shedding viewers. While NBC has relied on just four anchors for “Nightly News” in about 40 years, CBS keeps swapping them out, moving in Scott Pelley, then Jeff Glor and Norah O’Donnell in just the span of a few years. Such tinkering makes the task of connecting with loyal viewership a more difficult one.\n\t\n\n\tHe has been picked to try and foster new audience ties by Bari Weiss, the recently installed editor in chief of CBS News. She arrived at the Paramount Skydance-backed outlet after it spent a reported $150 million on her opinion site, The Free Press. Weiss has no experience running a mainstream TV-news organization, and in recent weeks, it has begun to show. There have been controversies over a fully-vetted “60 Minutes” report that she ordered held, and people familiar with the newsroom say staffers have grown frustrated that a continued focus on her managerial decisions has taken attention away from serious journalism produced by CBS News reporters. CBS News was early to break news of the Venezeula strikes in the week hours of Saturday morning, as well as key details about some of the planning for the operations.\n\n\tWeiss hasn’t exactly smoothed the way for her anchor. Dokoupil’s early-January start was unveiled just three weeks ago, giving CBS little time to seed the ground for his arrival. TV network usually spend longer periods of time touting the looming arrival of a new evening anchor, and often send that journalist to meet with executives and staffers at affiliates around the nation, where local anchors are asked to push viewers to the national telecast that follows. Three weeks leaves little time to use outdoor advertising or other promotional tactics to spur interest, and a digital video distributed this week showing Dokoupil striving to get attention from passers-by in Grand Central Terminal did not suggest he was well known.\n\n\tWith the new anchor’s arrival, CBS has tweaked the look of the venerable program, which has ties to the revered Walter Cronkite. The screen is less cluttered by graphics, distracting the viewer less from what the anchor has to say. Whether Dokoupil would have more detail to offer after a whole day of cable news and broadcast networks’ special reports on the subject, remained to be seen. In the end, CBS News ceded most of its time to Hegseth.\n\n\tSaturday’s broadcast shouldn’t be seen as “the way it is,” as Cronkite used to say. Dokoupil was supposed to start his run on the program by visiting various U.S. towns and cities. Indeed, he was holding forth at KPIX, CBS’ San Francisco station Saturday evening. He is slated to return to New York for his Monday broadcast, delaying plans that are slated to have him start traveling by the middle of next week.\n\t\n\n\tDokoupil signed off Saturday night with the phrase, “That’s another day in America and the world.” But it was probably not just another day for him, and definitely the start of a longer journey.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis year’s Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards Gala will be a touch less star-studded as Leonardo DiCaprio will miss Saturday night’s ceremony amid the developing geopolitical situation in Venezuela.\n\n\tDiCaprio was set to receive the Desert Palm Achievement Award for his performance in “One Battle After Another.” However, Variety has learned the Oscar winner was not able to leave St. Barts due to air restrictions in the area following the international conflict. DiCpario was photographed on vacation with family and friends, including Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, ahead of the New Year.\n\t\n\n\t“Leonardo DiCaprio is unable to join us in person tonight due to unexpected travel disruptions and restricted airspace,” said a spokesperson for the Palm Springs International Film Festival. “While we will miss celebrating with him in person, we are honored to recognize his exceptional work and lasting contributions to cinema. His talent and dedication to the craft continue to inspire, and we are delighted to celebrate him with the Desert Palm Achievement Award this evening.”\n\n\n\tPalm Springs International Airport released a statement on X announcing that departing flights are at a ground stop. The statement read: “An FAA air traffic control issue is impacting Southern California airspace today. Departing flights are currently under a ground stop. Aircraft have been able to arrive, though some inbound flights have diverted and delays are expected. This is not specific to PSP and is affecting multiple SoCal airports. Travelers should check directly with their airline for the latest flight information. PSP will share updates as needed.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Saturday morning, President Donald Trump announced that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cila Flores have been taken into U.S. custody following a military operation overnight.\n\n\tWith “One Battle After Another,” DiCaprio is in the running to win a second best actor Oscar thanks to his performance as an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into his old life in order to rescue his daughter. The film, from director Paul Thomas Anderson, has been an early awards season darling, including winning the best picture prize from the National Society of Film Critics earlier Saturday. DiCaprio is also nominated for best actor at the Critics Choice Awards on Sunday.\n\n\tEven without DiCaprio’s attendance, the Palm Springs awards gala will feature plenty of A-listers, with honorees including Timothée Chalamet (Spotlight Award), Rose Byrne (Breakthrough Performance Award), Kate Hudson (Icon Award), Michael B. Jordan (Icon Award), Ethan Hawke (Career Achievement Award), Adam Sandler (Chairman’s Award), “Hamnet” director Chloé Zhao as well as actors Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal (Vanguard Award), “Frankenstein” director Guillermo del Toro and actors Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi and Mia Goth (Visionary Award) and “Sentimental Value” cast members Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Elle Fanning (International Star Award).\n",

    "body": "\n\tBilly Joel proved that his performing days are not entirely behind him Friday night, taking the stage for two songs with a tribute band at an outdoor show in Florida’s Palm Beach County, his first time singing in front of a crowd since his touring was called off in May due to a brain disorder diagnosis affecting his balance.\n\n\tBundled up in a black cap and a winter vest, Joel got up on stage with the group Turnstiles to sing and play piano on a pair of his major hits, “Big Shot” and “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” He was joined on stage by his wife, Alexis Roderick, and introduced two young daughters, Della and Remy, who improvised dance routines throughout the crowd-rousing 12-minute cameo.\n\t\n\n\tJoel reportedly asked permission to come up to join the group that is named after one of his most popular 1970s albums. “I wasn’t planning on working tonight,” he told the crowd, laughing, before launching into the first number, as seen in fan-filmed video. \n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe occasion was a concert celebrating the 30th anniversary of the incorporation of the village of Wellington, Florida at the town’s amphitheater. Joel has a home in the area and owns nearby Middlesea Farms.\n\n\n\n\n\tJoel walked with the aid of a cane in taking the stage. “You want to sing it or am I gonna sing it?” the Turnstiles frontman asked as Joel sat at the keyboard.\n\n\t“What are we doing?” Joel asked, making it clear he was up for handling the vocals as well as piano.\n\n\t“A Billy Joel song, how about?” suggested the band member, playfully.\n\t\n\n\t“I can give it a try. I know the guy who wrote it,” Joel said with a laugh, as they launched into “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” At one point, the star needed a cue in remembering some of the legendarily voluminous lyrics, somewhere around the “Reagan… Palestine” part of the historical listmaking, but the band member obliged with a reminder, and Joel was able to continue with the tune from memory.\n\n\tAfter a huddle on stage about what to do as a followup, the performance continued with “Big Shot.”\n\n\t“I have to be dreaming this,” said the group’s usual singer, as Joel exited the stage with his family. “I’m gonna pinch myself. It had to happen sooner or later, right?… We wanna see you on stage soon.”\n\n\tJoel’s May exit from touring was tied to a buildup of fluid on his brain, with a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), for which he said he would be seeking physical therapy as well as canceling all shows indefinitely. In a July interview with Bill Maher, he affirmed that he felt fine apart from difficulty keeping his balance, something that had become apparent when he had a fall on stage in February.\n\n\tEven without fulfilling a planned run of arena shows, Joel had a big public profile in 2025, thanks to the release in the summer of an acclaimed two-part HBO documentary “Billy Joel: And So It Goes,” which managed to captivate a large audience of non-fans as well as the Joel faithful.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio is worried about the future of moviegoing. During a recent interview with The Times of London, the “Titanic” star questioned if “people still have the appetite” for movie theaters. He also pondered if cinemas would “become silos – like jazz bars?”\n\n\t“It’s changing at a lightning speed,” DiCaprio said of the film industry. “We’re looking at a huge transition. First, documentaries disappeared from cinemas. Now, dramas only get finite time and people wait to see it on streamers. I don’t know.”\n\t\n\n\tWhatever happens, DiCaprio said he hopes that filmmakers of the future get their work shown on the big screen.\n\n\n\t“I just hope enough people who are real visionaries get opportunities to do unique things in the future that are seen in the cinema,” he added. “But that remains to be seen.”\n\n\tThe Oscar winner is a staunch defender of cinematic integrity. During a recent sitdown with Time, DiCaprio slammed AI in film, saying the technology is incapable of humanity and thus can’t be “authentically” considered art.\n\n\t“It could be an enhancement tool for a young filmmaker to do something we’ve never seen before,” DiCaprio said of AI. “I think anything that is going to be authentically thought of as art has to come from the human being. Otherwise — haven’t you heard these songs that are mashups that are just absolutely brilliant and you go, ‘Oh my God, this is Michael Jackson doing the Weeknd,’ or ‘This is funk from the A Tribe Called Quest song “Bonita Applebum,” done in, you know, a sort of Al Green soul-song voice, and it’s brilliant.’ And you go, ‘Cool.’ But then it gets its 15 minutes of fame and it just dissipates into the ether of other internet junk. There’s no anchoring to it. There’s no humanity to it, as brilliant as it is.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe Palm Springs International Film Festival is all in on “Frankenstein”: director Guillermo del Toro and the film’s cast Jacob Elordi, Oscar Issac ",
    "body": "\n\tThe Palm Springs International Film Festival is all in on “Frankenstein”: director Guillermo del Toro and the film’s cast Jacob Elordi, Oscar Issac and Mia Goth are set to receive the 2026 Visionary Award  at the Palm Springs International Film Awards on Jan. 3. The Visionary Award, which honors boundary-breaking cinema. The award is being presented jointly to a director and cast for the first time in recognition of their exceptional collaboration.\n\t\n\n\tThe following day on Jan. 4, del Toro will receive the Creative Impact in Directing Award at a special brunch.\n\n\n\tBringing “Frankenstein” to the big screen has been a lifelong dream for the filmmaker, who has had a deep connection with the story ever since he read Mary Shelley’s classic at the age of 11.\n\n\tSpeaking recently in conversation with director Jason Reitman, del Toro said, “All my life, I’ve been aiming towards this movie. All 50 years of craft, thought, thematic pondering — everything. It is a fusion of the book, my life and what I know about the Romantic movement.”\n\n\tThe signs of his connection to “Frankenstein” are evident in his filmmaking, with elements of the story present in his films “Cronos” and “Pinocchio.” In his own words, the 2016 gothic romance “Crimson Peak” was a “dress rehearsal” for “Frankenstein.”\n\n\tWith his story, del Toro deconstructs the myth of “Frankenstein” and, rather than portraying the creature as a monster of horror, as other filmmakers have done before him, he creates a gentle, innocent and pure being played by Elordi. Isaac takes on the role of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the scientist who becomes obsessed with conquering death. In the film, Victor constructs a large lab and builds his creature using parts from dead soldiers.\n\t\n\n\tThroughout “Frankenstein,” del Toro employs various motifs. Religion plays a significant role in the film, asking the question: Can man play God? Visually, del Toro uses a circular design to symbolize the circular narrative. Color also plays a key role in the film, with red, white and blue being the dominant choices.\n\n\t“We follow Victor’s experiments in the lab, which have the language of red and reflect the brutality of Victor as an artist whose musical notes happen to be anatomical,” del Toro told Variety. “Victor and Elizabeth [Goth] are the only ones who will wear red because Elizabeth is the mother figure, in a sense, and Victor is on a quest for eternal life because his mother died,” he adds. “All these elements come into play with the color and art direction.”\n\n\tAs Victor constructs his lab and assembles the Creature, the various stages of its creation are meticulously portrayed.\n\n\tSeamless stitching and different coloration on the Creature’s body reflect how Victor has pieced it together from body parts found on the battlefield. “By the time the Creature is revealed, [the audience] will have already seen the things that make him unique,” del Toro says. “He looks like a newborn, not like an ICU victim. And that’s important.”\n\n\tdel Toro’s “Frankenstein” is anything but a horror story. It raises questions and ends on a note of forgiveness.\n\n\t“The question of the book is: What makes us human, and why are we here?” del Toro explains. Forgiveness and acceptance, he says, are values that we are losing everyday. “The movie hopes to provoke emotion from a text that is 200 years old because it’s telling us we should know better,” he adds.\n\n\tAs for the Creature’s poignant line, “I forgive you,” del Toro reflects: “It’s the one we don’t hear often enough.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIs the hero of “Marty Supreme” likable? I think he is, and for reasons that include the fact that he’s a scoundrel. (Has there ever been a likable scoundrel in movies? No! Not Once!) The number-one reason we like — or, at least, I like — Marty Mauser is, of course, that he’s played by Timothée Chalamet, the most charismatic movie star of his generation. Chalamet, like Dustin Hoffman or Julia Roberts or Brad Pitt, has the X factor, a quality that draws us to him regardless of what he does. (Just look at some of those outfits he wore on the red carpet when he was becoming a star. Without the X factor, those clothes would have looked postmodern gaudy ridiculous; with the X factor, they still sometimes did, but they became…defining. In sporting those clothes, he shifted the whole culture.)\n\t\n\n\tIn “Marty Supreme,” Chalamet’s Marty is a 23-year-old Ping-Pong wizard who’s a total selfish monomaniac, and not without good cause. The year is 1952, and Marty thinks he’s the greatest table-tennis player in the world. From what we can see, he may well be. The Ping-Pong matches in “Marty Supreme” are more exciting than the car races in “F1” or the fight scenes in 49 out of 50 boxing movies. They’re existential ballets of whirling spinning back-and-forth high-flying no-he-didn’t-just-do-that! action. The challenge that confronts Marty is this: How can he get the world to witness his skill? He keeps having to scrape up money to attend international tournaments, and since he has no money, that means that he has to lie, cheat, steal, gamble, hustle, seduce, manipulate, and at one point find the will to endure a heavy round of corporal-punishment-by-Ping-Pong-paddle. Through all of this, he treats everyone around him, including his pregnant girlfriend, like they don’t matter. He acts like a textbook sociopath, and maybe he is one.\n\t\n\n\tBut if that’s the case, he’s a sociopath with a dream. Marty doesn’t merely want to succeed; he doesn’t just want to win. He wants to change the karma of his life, which means building a castle in the air atop the rickety-to-nonexistent foundation of his background as a poor Jewish kid from the Lower East Side. The way Chalamet plays Marty, with a come-hither smirk, eyes that are clear and fun-loving and burningly alive, and a motormouth that won’t quit, he’s a kid who never stops hustling and deceiving, but all because he knows that his hustles are going to add up to something greater than the sum of their deceptions. They’re going to take him to the next level. They’re going to allow him to transcend.\n\n\tAnd here’s the point. Unless he does all this, he will not transcend. He will fail. So it’s not just that he’s a charming duplicitous hustler sociopath. It’s that life has called upon him to be a charming duplicitous hustler sociopath. He fulfills his destiny by making it up as he goes along, and by being utterly ruthless in the journey.\n\n\tMarty is what we used to call an antihero: a character we identify with and root for, even though he has many qualities that are less than heroic. You remember antiheroes, don’t you? They were at the center of so many of those movies from the 1970s that everyone says they love so much — the movies “you couldn’t make today.” But that morally ambiguous good-bad quality of Marty Mauser has ruffled some feathers in our age of holier-if-not-hipper-than-thou puritanical judgment, where everyone is so busy trying to righteously one-up everyone else. Marty has been declared, within a certain swath of social media, to be a poor role model. He’s too selfish, too aggro, too entitled, too toxic…too dislikable. Is this an organic expression of distaste, or is it part of the movie’s Oscar Take-Down Campaign? Maybe both. Either way, it’s enough to make you wonder if we’re witnessing a 21st-century revival of the Legion of Decency.\n\n\tOr maybe it’s a revival of that fabled Hollywood figure: the corrupt 1980s studio executive, the one who was so wired into test screenings that he couldn’t let a moment of bad behavior slide by without asking, “But will the audience like that?” Have we completely forgotten that movies — and movie heroes — aren’t always supposed to be likable or nice, that they’re supposed to have rough edges and sometimes look as flawed as most of us are? Or even more so?\n\t\n\n\tThat dynamic has always been an integral part of movies, and that’s why movies have always been controversial. They don’t just depict sin — they celebrate it. The gangster films of the early ’30s, like “The Public Enemy” and “Scarface,” asked people to identity with depraved killers, which was quite a radical stance for the early 20th century. But audiences were ready to embrace something radical, because they had been disillusioned by life (the Depression was all around them), and Hollywood, from the start, was about giving voice to the inner urges of the dispossessed. Was it “responsible” to ask viewers to identity with James Cagney, in “The Public Enemy,” smooshing a grapefruit into Mae Clarke’s face, or Paul Muni in “Scarface” shooting up the works with a Thompson submachine gun? The question answers itself. Of course it wasn’t. But it was liberating, precisely because it wasn’t responsible. That’s why movies are such a beautifully dangerous art form.\n\n\tSo here we are 100 years later, living in a culture that’s more liberated and unhinged than anything the citizens of the 1930s could have dreamed of. We’re now a nation of addicts and sensationalists; our mainstream entertainment (the extreme horror films, the TikTok fashion-porn videos) flirts, on a daily basis, with depravity. And here is Josh Safdie, the brilliant director of “Marty Supreme,” making a movie that’s linked in many ways to “Uncut Gems,” the landmark 2019 thriller he co-directed with his brother Benny, starring Adam Sandler as a degenerate gambler (a character all but ruled by his dislikable qualities). “Marty Supreme” is like “Uncut Gems” remade as a follow-your-dream crowd-pleaser. Yet this is a movie, and a movie hero, that the forces of performative virtue have somehow deemed…not moral and upstanding enough!\n\n\tIf you look closely, though, he really is. That’s the film’s — and Chalamet’s — extraordinary triumph. A movie star’s charisma is more than magnetism or sex appeal or “likability.” It’s a kind of spiritual-moral power, a force that bends those of us in the audience toward the actor who has it. Staring up at the big screen, we chime with that person, responding to their very being. We’re drawn into the flow of their action and motivation, into the essential trigger of why they do what they do. In “Marty Supreme,” Timothée Chalamet doesn’t just play a sociopathic scoundrel. He shows us what it looks like when you’ve steeled yourself to triumph over a life that’s going to throw you another stumbling block every minute, that’s going to make you jump through hoops to find your new self. And when Marty finally does, collapsing on the floor in exhilarated exhaustion after a table-tennis showdown because he has finally turned destiny around, you want to applaud how much this devotedly selfish, spectacularly flawed character has become all of us, because all he really wanted was to be happy. To be the supreme version of himself.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEddie Murphy famously left the 2007 Academy Awards after he lost the best supporting actor award for his role as James “Thunder” Early in “Dreamgirls.” However, the premature exit wasn’t out of spite. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, the “Trading Places” star said it was because several of his fellow attendees felt bad for him, and he didn’t want to be “the sympathy guy all night.”\n\n\t“What happened was I was at the Oscars, I had lost, and then people kept coming over to me and kept [patting] me on the shoulder,” Murphy said. “Clint Eastwood came and rubbed my shoulder. And I was like, ‘Oh, no, no, I’m not gonna be this guy all night. Let’s just leave.’ I didn’t storm out. I was like, ‘I’m not gonna be the sympathy guy all night.'”\n\t\n\n\tOther best supporting actor nominees that year included Mark Wahlberg for “The Departed,” Alan Arkin for “Little Miss Sunshine,” Jackie Earle Haley for “Little Children” and Djimon Hounsou for “Blood Diamond.” Arkin walked away with the win.\n\n\tMurphy recalled seeing an early screening of “Little Miss Sunshine.” He said he was extremely impressed with Arkin’s performance and predicted his Oscar win.\n\n\t“Jeff Katzenberg invited me over to see ‘Little Miss Sunshine’ six months before it came out in the theaters, and I literally watched the movie and I watched Alan — and I hadn’t been nominated or anything yet — and I watched the movie and I turned to Jeff afterwards and I said, ‘Now that performance right there is one of those performances that will steal somebody’s Oscar.’ I said those exact words,” Murphy said. “I was like, ‘He could steal somebody’s Oscar,’ then he stole mine.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added with a laugh, “No, I don’t feel like he stole mine.”\n\n\t“Dreamgirls” was nominated in eight categories at the 2007 Academy Awards. It won for best achievement and sound mixing, and best supporting actress for Jennifer Hudson.\n",

The first use of the word “television” came in our Jan. 12, 1927, edition.\nAs we explained back then, “Television is a process of making possible the viewing of a broadcasting artist in one’s own home no matter how far away the broadcasting station may be.” Even in this moment of radical, AI-fueled transformation, it’s still worth pausing to celebrate the miracle that inventors Philo T. Farsnworth, Vladimir Zworykin, John Logie Baird and others found the way to make pictures fly through the air — and land on a box in one’s own home.\nTo celebrate the business we love covering, as part of Variety‘s 120th anniversary retrospective, here’s a rich gallery of fabulous advertisements for great television shows, networks, studios and personalities that have graced our pages since 1949. For clarity, please note that the year cited in the headers for each entry reflect the year the ad ran in Variety.\nEnjoy. And with all due respect to the legendary radio comedian Fred Allen, he was wrong when he famously quipped that television is “a medium because it is neither rare nor well done.” It’s a great line, but the ensuing pages prove otherwise.\nRELATED CONTENT: Rare Movie Ads From 120 Years of Variety\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDu Mont (1949)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAs commercial television gained steam after the end of World War II, the Du Mont Company bragged about being early to recognize the power of television.

He played the irascible Sgt. Bilko, who was always getting in and out of scrapes with his men. \nWhen “The Phil Silvers Show” went into syndication, the title was changed to “Sgt.

Rightly or wrongly, it is remembered as an example of TV pablum. Barbara Billingsley would later parody her image as a picture-perfect TV mom with a memorable cameo in 1980’s “Airplane.”\nFrom the Sept. 6, 1960, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Dean Martin Show (1965)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEverybody loves somebody sometimes… but Dean Martin felt the love for all who helped him get his show on the air. “The Dean Martin Show” variety hour would run until 1974, albeit with some hiatuses.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRowan and Martin (1966)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDan Rowan and Dick Martin were comedy partners for years before they hit paydirt with NBC’s “Laugh-in” in 1967.

The Smothers Brothers collide with the world of Sid and Marty Krofft on the cusp of the Summer of Love.\nThis context of this ad isn’t entirely clear, but it would appear that the Krofft brothers crafted a big-head puppet costume for use on CBS’ “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.” Tom and Dick were eager to show their appreciation. \nFrom the April 18, 1967, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHere, the William Morris Agency tubthumps its clients as “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” wraps its first season.\nFrom the July 24, 1967, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tColumbo (1968)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIt’s hard to tell from this ad, but this is promoting the first installment of the beloved “Columbo” detective drama franchise.\nThe great Peter Falk played the brilliant, if disheveled, LAPD detective Lt. Columbo (the character never had a first name in the series), who was known for drawing a bead on perpretators with the innocent sounding query, “Just one more thing…”\n“Columbo” episodes ran as a semi-regular series on NBC from 1971 through the late 1980s.

With 1974’s “Free to Be … You and Me,” she created a sui generis TV special that was designed to punch through gender stereotypes for women and for men.\nWomen can be tough, men can cry, don’t hold your breath for Prince Charming and it’s ok if girls and boys want to play with dolls. Those were some of the radical messages that Thomas infused into the special that included music and stars such as Alan Alda, Harry Belafonte, Mel Brooks and Cicely Tyson.\nThank you, Marlo! \nFrom the March 11, 1874 edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBattle of the Network Stars (1976)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNo, this isn’t an AI hallucination.

Cohen hosted New Year's Eve coverage on CNN Wednesday night with Anderson Cooper -- as he usually does -- and many viewers took to social media to question if Andy had recently undergone cosmetic surgery.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Despite suggestions of a more extensive procedure online, Cohen took to Threads to clear up the speculation ... writing, \"Did the smallest amount of Botox and lost 20 pounds ! And had a lot of makeup on.\"\n      \n\n          Andy's comments made even more waves than his alleged plastic surgery on the New Year's Eve show ... especially when the star tore into former New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    CNN\n          \n    \n          ICYMI ... Cohen went on a rant about Adams' chaotic mayoral run -- including referencing the Department of Justice dismissing the federal fraud case against him. Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as the city's mayor hours after Andy's rant.\n      \n    \n          The former mayor fired back by telling Cohen he needed to go to Alcoholic Anonymous. AC was seemingly intoxicated while making his comments about Adams.\n      \n    \n          Bottom line ... Andy might look a little different -- but deep down he's the same old guy!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Andy Cohen\n              \n                          \n                Bravo\n              \n                          \n                You Might Want to Rethink\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Beauty\n              \n                          \n                Plastic Surgery\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          As you know, she was found deceased at Fairmont San Francisco early Thursday morning, with the dispatch audio indicating it may be related to an overdose. We also told you she had multiple run-ins with the law over the years ... with a recent drug-related arrest in April.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          And, according to court docs obtained by TMZ ... Victoria was offered a plea deal following the April incident, during which she was found to be in unlawful possession of cocaine -- and resisted arrest. The plea deal Napa County had offered would require her to plead guilty to resisting/obstructing arrest and possessing a controlled substance ... but would free her of the charge against her of being under the influence of a controlled substance. In return, she'd have to refrain from using drugs and submit to random testing.\n      \n\n          This deal would have required her to be on probation for a year ... as well as attend an alternative program such as counseling. She would have also been responsible for paying for the program as well as the fines associated with her charges.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Victoria's next court date was January 20, where she may have entered a plea for the case. However, she did not make it to the date.\n      \n    \n          TMZ reached out to Victoria's attorney and the Napa County prosecutor for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Broadcastify.com\n          \n    \n          As we told you, the charges resulted from a welfare check at Victoria's location after she accidentally dialed police in Napa. She told authorities she was fine, but while there, they noticed a white residue on her tongue and that she had rapid speech and was \"fighting with her body movements.\" She admitted to using cocaine that day, and police arrested her -- which she resisted.\n      \n    \n          Victoria's family broke their silence on her death Friday with a brief statement that read ... \"We appreciate all of the kind words, thoughts, and prayers.

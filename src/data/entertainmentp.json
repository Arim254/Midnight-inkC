    "description": "\n\tU.K.-based repertory powerhouse Park Circus has secured French distribution of Warner Bros.’ classic film library, CEO Doug Davis confirmed to Varie",
    "body": "\n\tU.K.-based repertory powerhouse Park Circus has secured French distribution of Warner Bros.’ classic film library, CEO Doug Davis confirmed to Variety ahead of the International Classic Film Market (MIFC) in Lyon.\n\n\t“We will be distributing the Warner Brothers classic film library theatrically in France – this is a brand new territory for us in our Warner Bros partnership. We’re very honored to be the custodian of these heritage libraries,” Davis said.\n\t\n\n\tThe arrangement brings the French market into alignment with Park Circus’ existing Warner partnerships in the U.K. and other territories and underlines the growing confidence major studios are placing in the company.\n\n\n\tWhile Park Circus has long worked with the Lumière Film Festival – an eight-day celebration of cinema old and new – and its MIFF, the world’s biggest market dedicated to heritage film, this edition marks the first time Park Circus is officially partnering with the market. \n\n\tFor Davis, the timing felt right. “I think it’s a combination of the festival and the Marché going from strength to strength – more delegates, more guests of honor. Our mission in life is to bring classic films back to the big screen, primarily where they belong,” he said.\n\n\tFor Lumière, Park Circus has unveiled a 24-title lineup, including Michael Mann titles “Heat” and “Thief,” tied to the director’s Lumière Prize tribute this year, along with Sean Penn’s “Into the Wild,” screening in connection with his appearance as guest of honor at the festival. \n\t\n\n\tMore than a dozen titles are films by Martin Ritt, ranging from  “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold” and “Paris Blues” to “Murphy’s Romance” and “Nuts,” as part of Lumière’s celebration of the iconic Hollywood director.\n\n\t“Heat,” which marks its 30th anniversary, will close the festival with a new 4K restoration. “Thief,” also presented in a 4K restored version, is the director’s cut of the film, supervised and approved by Mann. “Into the Wild,” though not a restoration, will be screened in a new copy with French subtitles financed by Park Circus, allowing it to circulate through French-speaking territories after the festival.   \n\n\tThe mix of prestige restorations from major studios and rediscovered titles illustrates the scale of opportunity in the heritage market, which extends well beyond festivals and repertory venues: during the pandemic, and later amid the Hollywood strikes, multiplexes turned to classic titles to fill screens, sparking a surge in demand that, according to Davis, has not faded.\n\n\t“I can happily report that it has not gone away. The multiplexes are quite delighted with the way the classics are performing,” he said, noting that the revival attracts not just older audiences but also younger viewers, thanks in part to savvy trailer-based promotion across social media platforms like Letterboxd.\n\n\tDavis also cited a recent 4K re-release of Stanley Kubrick’s “Barry Lyndon” as an example of how fan-generated content can go viral on platforms like TikTok:  “It’s kind of like vinyl records: There’s a social and cultural cachet now to watching old movies and being first to know.”\n\n\tAs heritage titles continue to find fresh audiences in multiplexes, Park Circus sees its mission as both cultural and commercial. “As a business, our mission [to grow the audience for the theatrical experience of classic films] is prudent, responsible growth. As a partner to exhibition, it’s helping them attract, retain and delight new audiences. Our growth will continue with existing partners, convincing new partners to try classics, and expanding globally,” said Davis.\n\n\tThe MIFC runs alongside the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon over Oct. 14-17.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s time to check in: “Hotel Costiera” has hit No. 1 on Amazon Prime Video in the U.S. \n\n\t“It’s a huge moment for us all,” said Jens Richter, CEO Commercial and International at Fremantle, which is selling “Hotel Costiera” to bullish results.\n\n\t“The appetite for this kind of bold, sky-blue drama is clear – it’s connecting with audiences globally and ticking all the right boxes for buyers. It’s a great example of premium storytelling with a truly global perspective and appeal.”\n\t\n\n\tThe show follows Daniel De Luca (“Grey’s Anatomy” alumnus Jesse Williams), a half Italian former U.S. Marine. Daniel returns to Italy, the land of his childhood, as a fixer in one of the world’s most luxurious hotels, located on the coastline of Positano. \n\n\n\tIn addition to dealing with the wealthy guests’ problems, Daniel is also on the trail of Alice, one of the owner’s daughters who disappeared a month earlier. He must do everything he can to bring her home, but facing those who kidnapped the girl will be more challenging than any problem Daniel has ever faced. \n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, Jesse Williams admitted he “really loved the [show’s] world.” \n\n\t“I think I really gravitated towards this guy who had fully committed himself to something in the military and finds himself having to start over. He’s also a character who’s from two worlds. I think there was a relatability factor there, as somebody who’s American but biracial in a polarized country and authentically of two worlds.”\n\n\tHe added: “I had been, at the time, wanting to think more about global creativity: thinking outside the borders of the U.S. I always found that interesting. I went to film school, and that’s the lens through which I see the world. You watch Fellini and you’re learning about other places, like also Korea and Japan, through their cinema. Americans aren’t always known for their ability to open up and process and absorb other cultures.”\n\t\n\n\tCo-produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Luca Bernabei for Lux Vide, a Fremantle company, “Hotel Costiera” is filmed in English and directed by Emmy Award winner Adam Bernstein and by Giacomo Martelli. Based on an idea by Bernabei, the series is written by Elena Bucaccio, Matthew Parkhill and Francesco Arlanch. \n\n\tMaria Chiara Giannetta, Jordan Alexandra, Antonio Gerardi, Sam Haygarth, Tommaso Ragno, Amanda Campana, Pierpaolo Spollon, Alejandra Onieva and Jean-Hugues Anglade also star.\n\n\t“We’d been looking for a story to set on the Amalfi Coast for a long time. It’s where everyone dreams of living: one of Italy’s most loved spots. Then came the idea of a former U.S. Marine who helps the guests of a luxury hotel solve their problems, and everything fell into place,” admitted Bucaccio, co-creator and Head of Drama at Lux Vide.\n\n\t“We suddenly had the genre, the perspective and a format we could build on, thanks to the unwavering support of our incredible partners at Amazon Prime Video. ‘Hotel Costiera’ is set in Italy, but it resonates perfectly internationally, and that’s its real strength. Hitting No.1 in the U.S. on Prime Video underlines this fact.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe cold open of this week’s “Saturday Night Live” brought in host Amy Poehler and her BFF Tina Fey to play Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem, respectively.\n\n\tThe sketch began by portraying part of Bondi’s controversial Senate hearing this week, where the United States Attorney General was grilled and cagey about topics such as the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n\tWhen asked if Trump directed her to indict James Comey, the AG was noncompliant.\n\n\n\t“I’m not going to discuss my private conversations with the president,” Poehler as Bondi said. “I’m not telling you who fell asleep in the middle of a sentence, or who kept calling me Ivanka while patting his lap.”\n\t\n\n\tShe also discussed the Jeffrey Epstein files, saying, “I tried reading the Epstein files, but I got really bored. It’s so repetitive. ‘Trump this, Trump that.’ Yawn.”\n\n\tSoon enough, Fey’s Noem entered, complete with an automatic weapon.\n\n\t“That’s right, it’s me, Kristi,” Noem said during her entrance. “I spell my name with an ‘I’ because that’s how I thought it was spelled.”\n\n\tAlso Noem gave some insight into the hiring process for ICE, as Fey revealed, “How did I find them? By running ads like this: Do you need a job now? Yeah. Are you a big tough guy? Yeah. Tough enough for the army or police? No. Do you take supplements that you bought at a gas station? Daily. Do you like to use zip ties because people in your life don’t trust you with keys? You know it. Suck on some of these big boy. Welcome to ICE.”\n\n\tNoem also spoke to her much-discussed dog-shooting scandal, saying, “That makes me laugh more than the end of ‘Old Yeller.'” and “Dogs don’t just get shot — a hero shoots them.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the cold open below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” has taken on the phenomenon of “The Hunting Wives” — and has designed the Netflix hit a second season.\n\n\tIn a taped piece, host Amy Poehler and guest Aubrey Plaza lampooned the streaming sensation, as well as the culture’s reaction to it. (As Poehler caressed Chloe Fineman, the narrator informed us that People magazine said that “The Hunting Wives” was “like ‘Call Me By Your Name’ for women who shop at Bass Pro Shop.”) What “SNL” described as “the straight but lesbian horny Republican murder drama” begins its hypothetical second season with Poehler (lampooning Malin Akerman’s role) dropping her top and declaring “Look what the cat dragged in.”\n\t\n\n\n\t“SNL” treated “The Hunting Wives” with love but some degree of scrutiny: The narrator notes the “wigs that are doing their best,” as Poehler’s hairpiece shifts around during a love scene with Fineman. A scene in which Fineman and Poehler, among others, draw guns on each other feels sharply drawn.\n\n\n\tPlaza, Poehler’s co-star on “Parks and Recreation,” joined the sketch as a newbie joining the hunting wives, moving in from California. Though the hunting wives flirt with her excessively, true to form, once they learn she identifies as a lesbian, they distance themselves, in the sketch’s final, stinging joke.\n\n\t“The Hunting Wives” is indeed returning for a second season, per a Netflix announcement in September.\n\n\tIn a statement about the renewal, creator Rebecca Cutter said, “I’m so excited to write these amazing characters again, and I can’t wait to take the audience on another sexy, twisted, batshit crazy ride through Maple Brook.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBanijay Kids & Family – behind hit shows “Totally Spies!” and “Mr Bean: The Animated Series” – has announced new distribution agreements for the latest installment of “Once Upon a Time…,” produced by Procidis.\n\n\tSeason 8, “Once Upon a Time… The Objects,” has been picked up by Puls 2’s Puls Kids in Poland, Turkuvaz Media Group’s children’s channel Minika GO in Turkey, TFO in Canada and Radio Television Hong Kong. \n\t\n\n\tThere’s more good news, however, as earlier seasons “continue to thrive” with AMC Networks International CNE acquiring Seasons 3 and 7 (“Life,” “Planet Earth”) for multiple Eastern European territories, and SF Studios picking up Season 3 (“Life”) for Norway and Sweden.\n\n\n\tDescribed as an “iconic edutainment franchise,” the “Once Upon a Time…” saga was originally created by Albert Barillé in 1978 and has broadcast continuously in France for nearly 50 years.\n\n\t“Its continued journey across borders, and into new territories, demonstrates its sustained relevance and appeal on a global scale,” noted Cécile Cau, SVP Sales, Co-productions and Acquisitions at Banijay Kids & Family. \n\n\t“The franchise has an enduring legacy and educational value which stays with viewers for life, sparking curiosity in childhood and continuing to resonate with fans well into adulthood.”\n\n\tBenoît Di Sabatino, CEO of Banijay Kids & Family and President of Procidis, told Variety: “At the time it was created, ‘Once Upon a Time…’ was revolutionary. Albert Barillé created a unique visual and narrative language that spoke to children and parents alike.”\n\t\n\n\tIts longevity is rooted in its ability to “blend storytelling with education in a way that’s both engaging and timeless,” he argued, “making knowledge accessible, playful and universal.” \n\n\t“The franchise has always sparked curiosity in children that leaves a lasting impression into adulthood. What’s kept it alive is its adaptability, with each new season tackling fresh themes that resonate with contemporary audiences. Every episode is driven by curiosity, pedagogy, and a genuine kindness toward the audience.”\n\n\tIt’s not the end of the decades-spanning story, however. \n\n\t“The continued success of ‘Once Upon a Time…’ across new territories and platforms shows there’s still a strong appetite for thoughtful, educational content. With Helene Barillé, we have bold plans to grow and evolve the brand for a new generation. We’re continuing to keep building on its legacy and introduce it to new generations around the world, both through content and beyond with a growing portfolio of experiences and products.”\n\n\tWhile every season has a different focus, “The Objects” takes a fresh look at the everyday items that shape our world. \n\n\t“It’s a clever way to teach children about science, history and culture through objects they encounter daily. Buyers have responded enthusiastically because the show is accessible and universal, and they value content that smartly combines education and entertainment,” assured Di Sabatino. Arguing that the magic of the franchise likes in its storytelling. \n\n\t“It doesn’t preach. It entertains. It invites understanding rather than memorization. Humor, poetry and iconic characters make knowledge come alive.”\n\n\tHe added: “It has always respected its audience’s intelligence and is a trusted source of knowledge, which captures children’s imaginations. That balance of emotion, narrative and scientific accuracy is what makes it such a timeless model of ‘edutainment,’ long before the term even existed.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Once Upon a Time…’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Banijay Kids & Family\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCult film outfit Spamflix will launch the Cinema of Desire at the Marché International du Film Classique (MIFC) in Lyon, an ambitious restoration project in collaboration with the Cinemateca Brasileira that reclaims a missing piece of Brazilian film history.\n\n\tThe Lisbon-based platform is presenting the 4K restoration of “The Magic Eye of Love” (“O Olho Mágico do Amor,” 1982), the first in a trilogy by Ícaro Martins and José Antonio Garcia, within the MIFC’s Re>Birth program – a showcase for heritage titles seeking restoration and distribution partners.  \n\t\n\n\t“This is the first market where we are showing the project, and it’s very special,” Spamflix co-founder Julia Duarte told Variety. “These films were part of a movement that was ahead of its time and emerged from the desire for freedom under the dictatorship in Brazil.”\n\n\n\tSet in São Paulo’s seedy Boca do Lixo district, “The Magic Eye of Love” follows Vera, a secretary who discovers a hole in her office wall leading to a neighboring hotel room occupied by a prostitute – a portal that awakens her fantasies and changes her life.\n\n\tThe film, which won several awards, marked the beginning of the so-called Trilogy of Desire, completed by “Onda Nova” (1983) and “Naked Star” (“Estrela Nua,” 1985), with plans to include a fourth film, “The Body” (1991), Garcia’s solo work. All four have been digitized by the Cinematica Brasileira.\n\n\tThe Cinema of Desire project revisits the New Cinema of São Paulo (Novo Cinema Paulista) movement, a short-lived but influential wave of independent filmmaking that emerged in the early 1980s. It grew out of the “pornochanchada” movies – a popular genre at the end of Brazil’s dictatorship blending eroticism and comedy – but rejected their sexist moralism, according to Duarte. “This was something more,” she said. “They gave a voice to women. While they are not that well known, even within Brazil, these films played an important role in Brazilian cinema,” she added, noting that her goal, after this project, is to continue highlighting the work of marginalized Brazilian directors.\n\t\n\n\tMade as Brazil’s dictatorship was losing its grip, these films confronted repression indirectly, turning sensuality into an act of defiance. Duarte sees their work as Brazil’s answer to early [Pedro] Almodóvar, combining the freedom, humor, and the emotional excess of Spain’s Movida Madrileña with Brazil’s own urban and political tensions.\n\n\tThe movement itself was short-lived as local exhibitors favored imported titles and commercial pornography. After the state distributor Embrafilme was dismantled in 1990, national production nearly collapsed, silencing a generation of filmmakers.\n\n\tThe project builds on the momentum of “Onda Nova,” a queer, erotic comedy about female football players challenging prejudice under Brazil’s dictatorship. The film’s 4K restoration premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in 2024 and went on to screen at festivals across Europe and Latin America. It was released theatrically in Brazil in March this year and has just signed a U.S. distribution deal with Brooklyn-based Muscle Distribution.\n\n\t“‘Onda Nova’ is exactly the kind of film that Muscle loves: approachable and fun, yet wickedly subversive and genuinely dangerous in its time,” Muscle founder Elizabeth Purchell told Variety. “We’re thrilled to be working with Spamflix to bring it to North American audiences for the first time ever.”\n\n\tDuarte and her partner Markus Duffner plan to premiere the Cinema of Desire films next year in Brazil, followed by screenings at festivals and cinematheques to coincide with the 20th anniversary of José Antonio Garcia’s death and what would have been his 70th birthday.\n\n\tFor Spamflix, best known as a former VOD platform with a strong focus on cult and avant-garde cinema, Cinema of Desire marks a significant step into the world of film heritage and rights management.\n\n\t“For us, it’s the same idea.” Duarte explained. “Through our work, we are now also taking care of film heritage, giving visibility to unique works that deserve to be seen again.”\n\n\t“The Magic Eye of Love” is one of nine films that will be presented as part of the MIFC’s ReBirth program on October 19.\n\n\tRunning alongside the Lumiere Film Festival in Lyon, the MICC takes place Oct. 14-Oct. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIntroducing “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” the curtain-raiser at this year’s Lumière Film Festival in Lyon where he is guest of honor, Sean Penn gave an emotional speech about his friend, the film’s lead actor Jack Nicholson. \n\n\t“I heard my name a lot tonight,” he said. “But I’ve been very comfortable with it in the sense that knowing “Cuckoo’s Nest” was going to play, there was no question I was going to be able to find great humility under the circumstances. One of the great, magic moments in my life in cinema was the first time I saw Jack Nicholson in Miloš Forman’s ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.’”\n\t\n\n\t “I was very privileged in so much as being able to have worked with Jack twice,” he continued. With both ‘The Pledge’ and ‘Crossing Guard,’ he was an angel on my shoulder and I still can’t quite get over, I still can’t quite imagine that McMurphy [Nicholson’s character in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”] has worked with me,” he smiled.   \n\n\n\tThe film has more than stood the test of time, Penn told the crowd, recalling the first time he saw it as a teenager in Los Angeles when it was released in 1975. \n\n\t“There was a little cinema out by the beach in Los Angeles where I would go. At the time, in the late ‘70s, it seemed that each film that came out was sort of an event. But still, today, I wouldn’t think twice about sharing this movie with a 16 or 17 year-old because it would hold up – even with those that get bored very quickly,” he quipped, drawing chuckles from the crowd gathered in Lyon’s 5,000-seat Tony Garnier show hall, one of the festival’s key venues.   \n\t\n\n\tAsked by Lumière director Thierry Frémaux, who also heads the Cannes festival, whether it is still possible to make films like that today, Penn replied: “I have been part of the culture of complaint about where cinema has been going for a long time. But then things happen: there are two films that I am sharing here at the festival – ‘Manas’ and ‘Sentimental Value’ – and [when] you see what an independently minded director still does, ignoring all the complaints, you see it’s all still possible.”   \n\n\tEarlier in the day, Penn attended the Lyon premiere of this year’s Cannes Grand Prix winner “Sentimental Value” together with director Joachim Trier. He will also present Marianna Brennand’s debut feature, “Manas,” which he executive produced. \n\n\tPenn has a packed schedule while in Lyon, where he will present a new subtitled copy of his 2007 hit “Into the Wild” and sit down for a masterclass with a Lumière audience. Taking the stage to introduce the opening film, the actor-director seemed momentarily lost for words in the vast, sold-out concert hall: “I didn’t expect… [Thierry] didn’t explain to me how big this situation is, I didn’t realise it was like this….” \n\n\tThe remark echoed the feeling of many first-timers at Lumiere, which draws several hundreds of thousands to see classics and contemporary films on big screens across some 30 venues. \n\n\tWalking the red carpet ahead of the opening ceremony, director Scott Cooper – who will premiere his new film “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” at Lumière – said: “It’s wonderful, I wish we had more [festivals like this] everywhere,” prompting a cry of: “Lyon, the birthplace of cinema!” from Jeremy Allen White, the two-time Emmy winner who stars as The Boss in Cooper’s film.\n\n\tFaithful to tradition, the festival’s 800 volunteers were feted with a walk-around the concert hall to the sound of a brass band, before guests were invited to the stage to officially open the festival by reading a sentence in unison – a joyous cacophony that drew complicit laughter from the crowd. \n\n\tAmong the celebrities crowding the stage alongside Penn, Cooper and White were Taiwanese actor and filmmaker Shu Qi, Travis Knight, the head of Laika Studios, Costa-Gavras, Valeria Golino, three-time César-winner Dominique Blanc, and one enfant terrible of French cinema Bertrand Bonello (“Saint Laurent,” “The Beast”).\n\t\n\n\tThe Lumière Film Festival runs in and around Lyon until Oct. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” Weekend update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che saw their desk crashed by former anchors Seth Meyers, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler for a “Joke Off.”\n\n\tThe trio stopped by to riff on a woman at a Tennessee hospital who broke a record by giving birth to a 13-pound baby. Some of the jokes included:\n\n\t*”The baby was so big he slapped the doctor on his ass.”\n\n\n\t*”Did she give birth or did the baby drive out?”\n\n\n\t*”She broke the hospital’s record and then she broke off her husband’s penis to make sure it never happens again.”\n\t\n\n\tPoehler was the episode’s host, and Fey also popped in during the night’s cold open playing Kristi Noem.\n\n\tThe returning trio spent plenty of time hosting Weekend Update, as Fey was behind the desk with Jimmy Fallon from 2000–2004, with Fey and Poehler taking over from 2004–2006, and Poehler and Meyers helming the segment from 2006–2008. Meyers then hosted the segment solo from 2008–2013.\n\n\tElsewhere in Update, Jost and Che took shots at Arby’s (“Arby’s announced that they’re adding a new item to their menu, Steak Nuggets. Although you can make your own Steak Nuggets by eating a bunch of Arby’s.”), Gen Z (“A growing number of Gen Z men are moving back in with their parents, taking over household chores and calling themselves ‘trad sons,’ replacing the old name, ‘failures.'”) and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (“RFK said this week that men who were circumcised are more likely to be autistic, which isn’t surprising coming from a man who looks like he’s made out of foreskin.”)\n\t\n\n\tWatch the Joke Off below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring a conversation at London Film Festival on Sunday, Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao got candid about Hollywood, the difficulty of financing films, how neurodivergence has impacted her storytelling and more. \n\n\tZhao’s devastating historical drama “Hamnet” — about the personal tragedy that led to the creation of William Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley — held its European premiere at the festival on Saturday night, where it was welcomed with plenty of emotion (and a surprise appearance from producer Steven Spielberg). Speaking about making the film, Zhao said that the experience made her “very passionate about rediscovering and remembering some older ways of storytelling that have been forgotten in our society.”\n\t\n\n\t“Before we made everything factual and reasonable, there was a time where we’d see stories in different ways — from our dreams, our vision quests, from going into nature and listening to the birds,” she said. “So the language of ambiguity is, to me, vital for the health of a society. And I think even in Hollywood, in the film industry, we are not very good at preserving the language of ambiguity. If logos and mystery are in harmony, we would be living in a much better world.”\n\n\n\tHowever, Zhao acknowledged that it’s oftentimes difficult to get stories like these financed for the big screen. Though profiting from a film is not her end goal, the filmmaker acknowledged that “money is really important.”\n\n\t“Maybe it’s because I’m Chinese, I don’t know what is it, but I’m so afraid of owing people money. I don’t like it. I don’t like being in debt. I want the people who put the money into my films to get the money back,” Zhao said. “I don’t believe that my vision and whatever importance of my film should make people lose money. It’s just not for me. I try really hard to get financiers or studios to say, how much are you comfortable giving me so that you can survive as a company, please. And then I’ll do it within that. So I think it’s really helpful because limitations, I promise, are your best friend.”\n\t\n\n\tAsked by an audience member at the end of the talk how being neurodivergent has impacted the creativity of her storytelling, Zhao said proudly: “I think it’s a superpower, I really do.”\n\n\t“I think we’re all on the spectrum of something. Everyone’s brain is so different, so unique — nature and nurture combined. And I find that I question sometimes, is it that I am the not typical one or has our world become a little too inhabitable? Is it too loud, is it too bright, is it too fast?” she continued. “So I try to not think of it as less or different, but think about if I tune into how I function, then I’m going to create a world, not just on camera, but also off camera that is going to be healthy for me. And those who gravitate towards me like that about me, so that’s probably what they enjoy as well.”\n\n\tShe concluded: “It’s really important and actually a good service to society for you to honor what you need first because that might be exactly what your environment might need as well.”\n\n\t“Hamnet” world premiered at the Telluride Film Festival last month, where it made a huge splash and sparked Oscar buzz, and went on to win the People’s Choice Award at TIFF. In Variety‘s review, chief film critic Peter Debruge wrote that the film is “so emotionally raw as to be almost excruciating at times.”\n\n\tZhao broke through with her 2020 drama “Nomadland,” starring Frances McDormand, which won the Oscars for best picture and director. With her directing win, Zhao became the first woman of color to win in the category. “Hamnet” is her latest film after directing the Marvel movie “Eternals’ in 2021. \n\n\t“Hamnet” will receive a limited theatrical release in the U.S. and Canada from Focus Features beginning Nov. 27 before expanding wide on Dec. 12. It will release in the U.K. on Jan. 9 via Universal Pictures.\n",

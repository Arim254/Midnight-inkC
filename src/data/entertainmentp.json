    "body": "\n\tThere are several key reasons why a movie about a school shooting feels right at home at the Sundance Film Festival. It’s not a subject a major studio is likely to touch, so it’s more or less up to independent filmmakers to tackle it. Given that these tragedies still happen all the time (there have been 400 school shootings in America over the last 10 years), the subject remains so loaded, and so wounding, that the handling of it requires extreme sensitivity and intelligence — qualities that Sundance stands for. But I’d be amiss if I didn’t mention a less noble reason. Audiences at Sundance have a way of going wild for a school-shooting movie more than audiences in the outside world do, and while that might be because they’re more open to it, it also hinges on a spark of self-congratulation, a way of thinking “Behold! We’re cool enough to have the courage to face this.”\n\t\n\n\tHaving seen “Run Amok” at its Sundance premiere today, I can testify that all those dynamics are in play. It’s not your typical school-shooter drama — but then, what is? (The best one I’ve seen, Mass, premiered at Sundance in 2021.) It’s the story of a 13-year-old high-school freshman, Meg (played by the remarkable newcomer Alyssa Marvin), whose mother, at art teacher, was killed in a school shooting 10 years before.\n\n\n\tMeg, who now lives with her Aunt Val and Uncle Dan (Molly Ringwald and Yul Vazquez) and her 17-year-old cousin, Penny (Sophia Torres), still goes to Lincoln High School. She was only three when the tragedy happened there, so she was too young to directly experience the horror. But the loss! It shadows her every day. Now that it’s been 10 years, the school has decided to do a “commemoration” ceremony, and Meg, having never truly confronted any of this before, decides to go out on a limb. She’s going to “commemorate” the event that took her mother’s life by making a musical about it.\n\t\n\n\tThis sounds, on the surface, very high camp meets wuh? But “Run Amok,” rest assured, is a serious movie. Meg, who plays the harp (which she literally wheels in a case back and forth to school), is musically inclined. She wants to create a musical, restaging the entire school shooting, not as some sort of sick joke, but because that’s the most instinctive way she knows to provoke a catharsis. Meg has to battle the school administrators, notably the scolding principal (Margaret Cho), who thinks it’s an outrageous idea; she’d prefer for the 10-year ceremony to be “uplifting.” But as we watch Meg, with her owlish pluck and nerd grin, begin to run through the paces of restaging the tragedy, what she’s doing starts to look uplifting. It seems like a good idea.\n\n\tI just wish that the movie had run with it more, and that its tone weren’t all over the place. There are a number of scenes in which “Run Amok,” the first feature written and directed by NB Mager (she based it on her 2023 Oscar-qualifying short), plays like the world’s most pious episode of “Glee” (at one point we see the kids rehearse school-shooting dance numbers set to the tune of Britney Spears’ “…Baby One More Time” and Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly”). At others, the film is completely low-key and dramatic in the doleful coming-of-age-movie tradition of “Eighth Grade.” The dinner-table scenes at home, where Meg faces off against Ringwald’s scowlingly proper aunt, conjure that familiar Sundance genre of glorified sitcom. And when a deranged teacher, played by the usually superb but in this case atrociously over-the-top Bill Camp, starts shooting rubber bullets as he tried to murder squirrels, we think: What is this character even doing here?   \n\n\tThen there are the scenes where Meg gets to know the mother of the shooter, a ghost of a woman named Nancy (Elizabeth Marvel), who tells her that her son “loved” Meg’s mother. This creates the tip of the iceberg of the film’s most audacious idea — that the musical, which is set to feature Meg’s cousin as the shooter, might actually want to explore what was going on inside him. As one of the students puts it, “How did we get to a place where this could happen?” My own prejudice is that this is the exact question that needs to be asked about school shootings, in a way that demands an answer beyond “Because we have terrible gun laws.” (Though we certainly do have terrible gun laws.) The trouble is, “Run Amok” raises the question…and then never takes two steps towards trying to answer it.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s another authority figure at school, a music teacher played by Patrick Wilson (the film’s executive producer), who starts off as a hero (he was the one who killed the shooter with a gun) and, early on, defends Meg’s musical. But he ends up being one of the oppressors. So do the teachers who bond together, with their own rubber-bullet guns, to form the PTAA (Parent Teacher Arms Association), in a demagogic response to the issue of school safety.\n\n\t“Run Amok” is far from a mess, but it’s just quilted together enough in style so that it fails to build in power. The movie, in the end, doesn’t have all that much to say about the culture of fear and violence that can live on at some schools, though it’s hard to shake the feeling that it wants a pat on the back for having engaged the issue. “Run Amok” is the story of one girl’s path from fear to acceptance, and Alyssa Marvin, who has the rare actor’s gift of wearing her feelings on the outside even when the character she’s playing is holding them on the inside, makes it a convincing journey.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBollywood star Ranbir Kapoor has praised fellow actor Rani Mukerji‘s three-decade legacy in Indian cinema as the industry rallies around the actor with the upcoming release of “Mardaani 3.”\n\n\t“It is really amazing to see the entire industry come forward to celebrate 30 years of her iconic legacy,” said Kapoor, who co-starred with Mukerji in his 2007 debut “Saawariya.” “I have always felt that Rani is one for the ages, one of the greatest ever actors in India and someone who has defined our industry through her work. Her choice of projects and roles have shaped how women are portrayed on the screen today.”\n\t\n\n\t“Mardaani 3,” where Mukerji returns in the lead role of police officer Shivani Shivaji Roy, will focus on the kidnapping of girls aged 8-9 from low-income communities across India. Directed by Abhiraj Minawala and produced by Aditya Chopra for Yash Raj Films, the film extends the franchise’s examination of crimes against women.\n\n\n\tThe franchise launched in 2014 with “Mardaani,” which centered on human trafficking. “Mardaani 2” followed in 2019, exploring a serial rapist who challenged law enforcement. Mukerji was last seen in critical and commercial success “Mrs. Chatterjee vs. Norway” (2023).\n\n\t“Rani is the co-star of my first film ‘Sawaariya’ and she is the first person who told me that if I worked hard, I would go a long way. I will never forget that interaction because it gave me so much confidence when I needed it the most,” Kapoor said. “I have seen her as a person closely, I have seen her work closely and have been bowled over by her grace, charm and brilliance.”\n\t\n\n\tKapoor added: “Thank you Rani for the movies, the memories, the nostalgia and the powerhouse performances. She is an entertainer who has dedicated her life to make people happy and I don’t have words to describe the impact her films have had on me.”\n\n\t“Mardaani 3” releases Jan. 30. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney snuck up to the Hollywood sign in the dead of night and covered it in bras without the permission of the proper authorities, the LA Times reports. The stunt was a promotion for a new brand of women’s undergarments.\n\n\tSweeney posted a video of the ordeal to her Instagram on Monday night. In the footage, she and a small team packed a van full of unmentionables before heading into the Hollywood Hills. Once at the Hollywood sign, Sweeney is shown stringing bras together and hanging them over the letters.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the LA Times, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the organization that owns the IP rights to the iconic landmark, said the late-night operation was not authorized. The Hollywood Sign Trust, the nonprofit responsible for managing the sign, also reportedly had no knowledge of the stunt.\n\n\n\t“Anyone intending to use and/or access the Hollywood Sign for commercial purposes must obtain a license or permission from the Hollywood Chamber to do so,” Steve Nissen, chief of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, told the LA Times in a statement. “The production involving Sydney Sweeney and the Hollywood Sign, as reported by TMZ, was not authorized by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce nor did we have prior knowledge of it.”\n\n\tThe LAPD told the Times that a police report for Sweeney’s trespassing had not yet been filed.\n\n\tThis is not the first time Sweeney found herself in trouble for an ad. In November of 2025, the “Euphoria” star was the face of an American Eagle jeans campaign that featured the tagline “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,” a pun on “great genes.” The campaign sparked a social media firestorm, in which critics said American Eagle was glorifying the actor’s white heritage. Sweeney told GQ in a cover story that she didn’t feel the need to explain her participation in the ad because “I’ve always believed that I’m not here to tell people what to think.”\n\t\n\n\t“I know who I am. I know what I value. I know that I’m a kind person,” she said. “I know that I love a lot, and I know that I’m just excited to see what happens next. And so I don’t really let other people define who I am.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA24 and Focus Features are locked in a heated bidding war for Olivia Wilde‘s new movie “The Invite,” which debuted to raves at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\tAfter Saturday night’s premiere at Park City’s Eccles Theater, several buyers including Neon, Netflix, Apple, Searchlight and new distributor Black Bear were interested in acquiring the film. However those companies backed out as offers started to heat up and eclipse $10 million, and it became clear that Wilde wanted a traditional theatrical release. Right now the offer is north of $12 million, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Wilde and written by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, “The Invite” takes place during a dinner party between a warring married couple and their upstairs neighbors, who turn out to be swingers. Wilde, Seth Rogen, Penelope Cruz and Edward Norton star in the film, an English language remake of the Spanish comedy “The People Upstairs.”\n\n\n\t“The Invite” is Wilde’s third directorial effort following 2019’s “Booksmart” and 2023’s “Don’t Worry Darling.” She was also at Sundance with director Gregg Araki’s “I Want Your Sex,” an erotic thriller in which she co-stars with Cooper Hoffman.\n\n\t“The Invite” was praised by Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman as a “bravura dinner-party dramedy that’s like ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’ redone as vintage Woody Allen.”\n\n\t“Two couples connect and collide in a movie that keeps you laughing and never stops surprising,” Gleiberman wrote in his review, adding that it’s “so original, so brimming with surprise, so fresh and up-to-the-minute in its perceptions of how relationships work (or don’t), that you watch it in a state of rapt immersion and delight.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tWhile presented as a trio of interconnected stories, “In the Blink of an Eye,” the latest film from “WALL-E” and “John Carter” director Andrew Stant",
    "body": "\n\tWhile presented as a trio of interconnected stories, “In the Blink of an Eye,” the latest film from “WALL-E” and “John Carter” director Andrew Stanton, plays more like three disparate TV series smushed into a single feature. Two of these tales — one set in the present, another in the far-flung future — are mawkish, malformed melodramas that circle the drain of hard sci-fi without getting their hands dirty. The third, set in prehistoric times, is dazzling in its simplicity and dramatic rigor, and could’ve easily done without the others. That the three appear in combination, crisscrossing until they cancel each other out, is incredibly frustrating.\n\t\n\n\tThe movie opens with the origins of life on Earth before fast-forwarding to a patch of seaside wilderness in 45,000 BC, an era marked “the end of the Neanderthal age” by accompanying text. Here, we meet a family of proto-humans who are, implicitly, the last of their kind. The patriarch, dubbed “Thorn” (Jorge Vargas), is gravely injured in a fall, and is cared for by his pregnant wife “Hera” (Tanaya Beatty), and their adolescent daughter “Lark” (Skywalker Hughes), while they also look after a newborn son.\n\n\n\tAfter a hard cut to the present, we’re introduced to driven anthropology researcher Claire as she begins an awkward, friends-with-benefits relationship with eager statistics student Greg (Daveed Diggs). Just as swiftly, the timeline jumps forward several centuries and boards an interstellar vessel, upon which an astronaut named Coakley (Kate McKinnon) shepherds human embryos bound for a nearby planet, with the help of her A.I. computer system, ROSCO (voiced by Rhona Rees).\n\t\n\n\tWithin its first few minutes, the film introduces and subsequently solves several mysteries about how these characters are related. A family heirloom — an acorn — shows up both in the Neanderthals’ moving story, and as a fossil in Claire’s research, which seeks to find a “missing link” in our DNA that might prolong human life. In the future, Coakley, it turns out, is hundreds of years old, her lifespan having been artificially lengthened so she can seed life on another planet. You can see where things are going, and while the screenplay by Colby Day (“Spaceman”) coyly tilt-shifts the eventual answers, the questions of how these stories are connected aren’t all that interesting to begin with.\n\n\tThis is primarily because the stories themselves (the present and future ones, anyway) are a bit of a drag. Claire and Greg develop a relationship, while Claire navigates her mother’s critical illness in a different city, a hurdle that mostly takes the form of phone calls and text messages that relay the drama logistically, instead of emotionally. “I’m sad,” says one message, which is not-so-subtly superimposed with Coakley making a frowny face. McKinnon, unfortunately, isn’t equipped to carry the drama of her space-faring section, in which the numerous plants on board begin to succumb to a mysterious pathogen. Although she makes an effort, she can’t quite shake the gesticulations and verbal emphases that have defined her comedy career, resulting in severely mixed tones.\n\n\tBoth of these sections suffer from flat filmmaking that relies on drama that’s largely told, rather than felt. They gesture toward technology as coping mechanisms for either a grief we rarely see or a sense of isolation the movie has no time to let us feel, as Coakley converses with her AI assistant before having to consider taking it offline. As she stares wistfully at a HAL 9000-like display, “In the Blink of an Eye” begins to verge on parody.\n\n\tEach time the movie cuts back to its prehistoric section is a welcome relief. The scenery is resplendent. Thomas Newman’s otherwise mechanical score takes on fluid, untamed qualities. The characters’ spoken language is unfamiliar, but passionate, and the performances are driven by pure intent that beams through their heavy prosthetics. It slowly amounts to a harrowing tale of love, loss, discovery, and perhaps even the primal origins of art and cultural rituals. It is, in a word, beautiful, and makes for a meaningful inquiry into life’s joys and its fleeting nature.\n\t\n\n\tHowever, each time this tale progresses, the movie cuts away once more, to one of two stories that try desperately to express these very same themes, but crash and burn in the process. The plots are connected by characters confronting death and mortality, but only in the most technical sense. For the Neanderthal family, the emotional stakes are at a constant peak. For Claire, however, the tale of her mother’s illness takes a backseat in a head-scratching ways, despite the movie affording Jones the fascinating conundrum of trying to conquer death itself. It isn’t long before her story stops being about this completely — in fact, it stops being about anything at all, until an out-of-nowhere third act turn that may as well belong to a different movie about the passage of time. Were it not for the fact that Day’s script was written before “This Is Us” began airing, it might have felt like an ill-considered copy.\n\n\tBy the time Coakley’s story similarly becomes about time, the film has no emotional fuel left in the tank, and no way to keep track of how time actually affects its characters in the present or future stories, reducing their experiences to mere montage. As for our ancestors in the past: they’re left at the mercy of their far less interesting descendants, whose verbose declarations of the movie’s themes supersede not only the Neanderthals’ riveting nonverbal saga, but the film’s own ethical non-dilemmas over its life-expanding concept. Both as drama and as science fiction, “In the Blink of an Eye” doesn’t probe these questions, but rather, drops definitive answers like anvils, leaving little room to ruminate, wrestle, or consider.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart attacked Republicans for deflecting blame from federal agents for the shooting of a 37-year-old man in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\n\tAt the top of Monday’s show, Stewart played clips of the United States Secretary of Homeland Security,Kristi Noem, at a press conference shortly after the shooting. She claimed the victim, Alex Pretti, “came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation” and “attacked” federal agents.\n\t\n\n\t“Those are the facts,” Stewart said. “And there’s really no reason to doubt them, no evidence exists to contradict their–hold on. I’m getting a…. really? I’m hearing there may be some grainy Zapruder footage from every angle imaginable that contradicts the government’s version of events!”\n\n\n\tThe show then cut to news clips covering civilian footage of the shooting. CNN reported that all Pretti had in his hand was “a cell phone, not a gun.” The outlet also reported that Pretti was “trying to help a woman” who’d been “pushed to the ground and pepper-sprayed” by ICE agents moments before he was killed. In a clip from NBC News, a reporter claims that one video appears to “show Pretti’s legal, registered firearm being removed from his person by an officer just seconds before those shots were fired.”\n\n\t“Well, looks like we’ve got a real case of: ‘He-said, video-totally-disproves-what-he- said,’” Stewart joked.\n\n\tLater in the show, Stewart played a clip from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s appearance on “Meet the Press.” He said during his interview that Pretti “was not protesting peacefully,” adding, “You shouldn’t gaslight the administration about what happened.”\n\t\n\n\t“We’re gaslighting you?” Stewart exclaimed. “Speaking of gaslighting, here is Todd Blanche, a day after accusing all of us of gaslighting the administration about what happened.”\n\n\tThe late-night pundit then cut to Fox News, where Blanche claimed, “I don’t think anybody thinks that they were comparing what happened on Saturday to the legal definition of domestic terrorism.”\n\n\t“Well, I mean, they were certainly insinuating it,” Stewart said. “I mean, it might be hard to find someone explicitly using those exact words, but — we found ’em.”\n\n\tStewart then cut back to Noem’s press conference, where she said, “Violence against a government because of ideological reasons and for reasons to resist and perpetuate violence, that is the definition of domestic terrorism.”\n\n\tStewart joked, “I think that actually might be the definition of gaslighting.”\n\n\tWatch the entire segment below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has unveiled details of its 2026 Japan slate, highlighting an expanded production footprint with Toho Studios and a strategic partnership with animation powerhouse MAPPA.\n\n\tThe streaming giant is marking its 10th anniversary in the Asia Pacific region with its most robust Japan slate to date, spanning live-action series, anime productions and unscripted content. The company will also livestream all 47 games of the 2026 World Baseball Classic in Japan from March 5-18, marking its first international live sports broadcast in the market.\n\t\n\n\t“Over 10 years in Japan, our local team has taken on bold challenges, working closely with creators to pursue stories that go beyond imagination,” said Sakamoto Kaata, VP of content for Japan. “At the heart of this growth lies our simple, unwavering belief: creative first.”\n\n\n\tJapanese title viewing hours reached an all-time high in the second half of 2025, driven by anime hits alongside popular live-action series including “Alice in Borderland” Season 3 and “Last Samurai Standing,” which has been confirmed for a second season.\n\n\tNetflix’s partnership with MAPPA, the acclaimed studio behind “Chainsaw Man” and “Jujutsu Kaisen,” will see the companies collaborate on new projects from the concept stage. Multiple projects are already underway, spanning story development through merchandise. Sakamoto described it as evolving relationships with Japan’s leading creators and studios “into deeper, more collaborative creative ventures.”\n\n\tThe expanded agreement with Toho Studios will double Netflix’s production footprint in Japan and introduce large-scale soundstages, allowing for more ambitious sets and expanded production capabilities. The partnership’s first project is “Human Vapor,” a reboot with an entirely original story that unites top creators from Japan and Korea.\n\t\n\n\t“By reimagining Toho Studios’ iconic tokusatsu [Japanese practical special effects] legacy and uniting top creators from Japan and Korea alongside advanced visual technology, we will present a groundbreaking series that opens a new chapter for Japanese sci-fi,” Sakamoto said.\n\n\tThe live-action slate includes “Quiztopia,” starring Yamada Takayuki from “The Naked Director” in an adaptation of a cult manga. The dystopian series explores desire, power and crowd psychology through a government-sanctioned quiz show where winners have any wish granted but losers face severe consequences. Based on “Kokumin Quiz” by Sugimoto Reiichi and illustrated by Kato Shinkichi, the series is directed by Yoshida Teruyuki.\n\n\t“Straight to Hell,” launching April 27, stars Toda Erika as Hosoki Kazuko, Japan’s most famous fortune-teller who swept the nation with her Six-Star Divination practice. The series spans 60 years and offers an unfiltered look into the struggles and desires of this enigmatic woman. Ito Sairi plays Uozumi Minori, a writer tasked with ghostwriting Hosoki’s autobiography. Directed by Takimoto Tomoyuki and Ohba Norichika, the series is written by Monaka Manaka.\n\n\t“Sins of Kujo,” launching April 2, is a live-action adaptation of Manabe Shohei’s manga about lawyer Kujo Taiza, who defends only society’s worst: thugs, yakuza and ex-convicts. Yagira Yuya stars as Kujo, with Matsumura Hokuto as elite lawyer Karasuma Shinji. The series is produced by TBS hit-maker Nasuda Atsushi, written by Nemoto Nonji and directed by Doi Nobuhiro, Yamamoto Takeyoshi and Adachi Hiroshi.\n\n\t“Soul Mate,” debuting May 14, is a tender romance between two young men unfolding over 10 years. After inadvertently destroying his best friend’s life, Narutaki Ryu abandons everything and leaves Japan, where he’s saved by Korean boxer Johan Hwang. Isomura Hayato plays Ryo, while Ok Taec-yeon of 2PM plays Johan. The series is written and directed by Hashizume Shunki.\n\n\t“Viral Hit,” launching May 28, stars Suzuka Ouji as Shimura Kota, a bullied high school student who discovers fighting can be profitable when a fight goes viral online. Based on the South Korean webtoon by Taejun Park and Kim Junghyun, the series marks the first Netflix collaboration from director Takeuchi Hideki and writer Tokunaga Yuichi. Mikami Ai plays Yashio Aki, while Sugou Araki appears as Kaneko Toru.\n\t\n\n\tOther scripted series include “S&X,” starring Nakajima Kento as sex therapist Shimotori Ichito, based on Tada Kisei’s manga; “Plastic Beauty,” starring Matsuoka Mayu and Naka Riisa, examining Japan’s cosmetic surgery industry; and “Did Someone Happen to Mention Me?,” starring Yakusho Koji as an actor suddenly forgotten by the entire world, written by Kudo Kankuro.\n\n\tThe anime slate features returning franchises including “Fire Force Season 3 Part II” (Jan. 10), “Baki-Dou: The Invincible Samurai” (Feb. 26), “Steel Ball Run JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure” (March 19) and “Beastars Final Season Part 2” (March). “One Piece: Into the Grand Line” (“One Piece” Season 2) launches globally March 10, continuing the live action adaptation of the beloved manga series. \n\n\tThe slate also includes “Love Through a Prism” (Jan. 15), created by “Boys Over Flowers” manga author Kamio Yoko and directed by Nakazawa Kazuto, set at a London art academy in the early 20th century. Tanezaki Atsumi voices Ichijoin Lili, with Uchiyama Koki as Kit Church.\n\n\t“Cosmic Princess Kaguya!” (Jan. 22) is the feature-length directorial debut from Yamashita Shingo, telling the tale of two girls who bond through song in the virtual realm of Tsukuyomi. Natsuyoshi Yuko voices Kaguya, with Nagase Anna as Sakayori Iroha.\n\n\t“The Ramparts of Ice” (April) is based on Agasawa Kocha’s manga about a socially withdrawn student drawn out of her shell by three other students. Nagase Anna voices Hikawa Koyuki, with Izumi Fuka as Azumi Miki.\n\n\t“Sparks of Tomorrow” (July), from Kyoto Animation, features impressionistic backgrounds bringing to life the dreams of a young boy and girl in an alternate early 20th century where technological progress evolved through steam power. Uchida Yuma voices Sakamoto Kihachi, with Amamiya Sora as Momokawa Inako.\n\n\t“Today, one in every two Netflix members globally watches Japanese anime, and the total viewing hours have tripled in the past five years,” Sakamoto noted.\n\n\tThe unscripted slate features Season 2 of “The Boyfriend” (Jan. 13), the dating reality series that debuted in 2024 as Japan’s first romance reality show featuring gay men. The new season moves to snowy Hokkaido and welcomes 10 men with diverse backgrounds. Megumi, Horan Chiaki, Aoyama Thelma, Durian Lollobrigida and Tokui Yoshimi all return as in-studio hosts.\n\t\n\n\t“Love Village” Season 3 shifts to a communal house at the foot of Mount Fuji, where singles aged 35 to 60 search for their “final love.” Tamura Atsushi and Becky return as in-studio hosts.\n\n\t“Badly in Love” Season 2 returns to Okinawa with a new lineup of participants gathered through auditions across Japan. The series features contestants from unconventional backgrounds living together in pursuit of love. Megumi serves as creator/producer.\n\n\t“Doors Closed, Bids Open,” Netflix’s first collaboration with Matsuko Deluxe, presents a secret members-only veiled auction show. Only select bidders are invited to this mysterious underground space.\n\n\t“This is I” (Feb. 10) brings to life the true story of Haruna Ai and Dr. Wada Koji. Eighteen-year-old Mochizuki Haruki stars in his first leading role as Onishi Kenji, who becomes Haruna Ai after gender-affirming surgery. Saitoh Takumi plays Dr. Wada Koji. The film is directed by Matsumoto Yusaku.\n\n\t“My Crazy Feminist Girlfriend,” based on Min Ji Hyoung’s Korean novel, stars Nagano Mei as a fiercely committed feminist ex-girlfriend who reunites with her former boyfriend after seven years. The film is written and directed by Kobayashi Keiichi.\n\n\t“One Year to Live, Buy a Man” stars Shibasaki Ko as Katakura Yui, a 40-year-old single woman diagnosed with cancer who “buys” pink-haired nightclub host Sena (Akaso Eiji) for JPY720,000. Directed by Kazama Hiroki and written by Okada Yoshikazu, the film is based on Yoshikawa Toriko’s novel.\n\n\tKim Minyoung, VP of content for APAC (ex-India), said: “Our teams in APAC know what the local creative community is capable of, and they are filled with passion to take local storytelling to the next level. As each country continues to expand their variety of stories and take bigger, bolder creative risks, APAC will continue to grow its place on the global entertainment stage.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tMedia Partners Asia hosted its first AETHER Summit in Singapore, convening senior executives from telecommunications, media, artificial intelligence, healthcare and investment sectors for discussions on how AI is transitioning from experimental technology to core infrastructure.\n\n\tThe closed-door forum ran at Marina Bay Sands, where industry leaders examined AI’s shift from pilot programs toward capital-intensive, system-level deployment across networks and platforms.\n\t\n\n\tA consensus emerged that the industry’s primary challenge has moved from technical capability to execution at scale. Competitive advantage now hinges on how effectively organizations integrate AI into real-world systems spanning compute infrastructure, connectivity, data management and governance.\n\n\n\t“AI is no longer a tool or a feature. It is a system-level economic force reshaping infrastructure, media, advertising, and experiences end to end,” said Vivek Couto, CEO and executive director of Media Partners Asia. “The defining challenge now is execution and how leaders invest, govern, and scale AI responsibly in environments that touch millions of users.”\n\n\tDiscussions centered on infrastructure’s evolving role in the AI era, with participants examining how global investment is flowing toward compute resources, data centers, networks and energy systems. Infrastructure is increasingly seen as the primary bottleneck shaping AI outcomes.\n\n\tTelecommunications operators are positioning themselves as AI-native platforms. As intelligence embeds across networks and customer service, telcos are moving beyond traditional connectivity to become delivery platforms for AI services including real-time inference, personalization and automation.Success in this transition depends less on accessing advanced models and more on capital allocation, platform architecture and organizational transformation, leaders said.\n\t\n\n\tThe summit tackled AI’s impact on media and entertainment economics. AI production tools are compressing timelines and cutting costs across animation, post-production, marketing and localization, challenging traditional studio and agency advantages.\n\n\tBut declining production costs are flooding the market with content, intensifying competition for attention. Authenticity, creative judgment and taste are emerging as differentiators in an oversaturated landscape.\n\n\tContent libraries are being repositioned as strategic training data for proprietary AI systems, reordering value chains from labor-intensive workflows toward capital-intensive technology infrastructure. The shift raises questions around intellectual property rights and cultural stewardship.\n\n\tParticipants emphasized AI’s expanding role in public services and national development. Leaders discussed population-scale deployments across fraud prevention, digital identity, healthcare, education and citizen engagement.\n\n\tTrust, accountability and governance emerged as critical unresolved constraints. As AI systems become more autonomous, participants stressed the importance of limiting scope, maintaining human oversight and designing for verifiable outcomes.\n\n\tThe summit framed governance as a design challenge requiring early attention rather than a regulatory afterthought.\n\n\tAETHER operated as a closed-door forum, with a CEO session under the Chatham House Rule. Insights have been compiled into the AETHER 2026 Summit Report analyzing AI’s deployment phase and implications for infrastructure and media.\n\n\tJioStar and BytePlus supported the inaugural summit, with research partnership from MPA subsidiary ampd.\n\n\tSpeakers included Uday Shankar, founder and CEO of Bodhi Tree Systems and vice chair of JioStar; Vikram Sinha, president director and CEO of Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison; Simon Fuller, founder of XIX Entertainment; and Vicki Dobbs Beck, VP of immersive content innovation at Lucasfilm/ILM.\n\n\tOther participants were Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at Nvidia; Sharad Devarajan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and co-founder and CEO of Graphic India; Anton Reynaldo Bonifacio, chief AI officer and chief information security officer at Globe Telecom; and Oscar winner Mark Sagar, chief AI officer at FaiBLE Media.\n\t\n\n\tTechnology and investment executives included Ken Xu, solutions architect director at Alibaba Cloud; Jawn Lim, regional head of solution architecture for GenAI at BytePlus; Dr. Wei Chu, chief scientist and co-founder of INF Tech; Pinn Lawjindakul, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners; Guy Piekarz, CEO of Panjaya; Josh Baillon, co-founder of Collective Imagination; Jed Weintrob, CEO and co-founder of 30 Ninjas; and Ulf Ewaldsson, AI-RAN advisor and former president of technology at T-Mobile.\n\n\tRonit Satchi-Fainaro, head of the Gray School of Medical Sciences at Tel Aviv University, also participated.\n\n\tMedia Partners Asia is an independent insights and advisory platform focused on connectivity, entertainment and technology sectors across Asia Pacific. Founded in 2001, MPA operates leadership forums including APOS and AETHER.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEvery Pokémon fan’s childhood dream has come true: PokéPark Kanto, a sprawling Pokémon world, has come to life in Tokyo’s Yomiuri Land amusement park, complete with hundreds of life-sized Pokémon, two rides and countless hidden secrets to discover.\n\n\tOpening Feb. 5, PokéPark Kanto is the world’s first permanent outdoor Pokémon facility. It leads visitors through the Pokémon Forest, crawling with realistic Pokémon you can touch, and into the fictional Sedge Town, home to several stalls with food, games and rides. The first of its kind, PokéPark Kanto puts fans into the video games they grew up with, and its attention to detail and variety of Pokémon would make any casual trainer want to catch ’em all.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter moving through the entrance, fans will instantly recognize Prof. Oak’s lab before setting foot into PokéPark Kanto. The lab is complete with a PC, healing station and three Poké Balls housing starter Pokémon, ripped straight from the original “Red” and “Blue” games. From there, you’re transported to the Pokémon world. After stepping through a giant wooden door, tall grass teems with wild Pokémon, adorable critters strike charming poses and battles break out between fierce opponents. Every tiny detail transports you into a fully realized Poké-universe.\n\n\n\tPikachu and Eevee take center stage in the first area that visitors can explore. Dozens of the fan-favorite Pokémon reside in the grassy habitat, and fans can go off the main path to touch and take photos of the cute creatures. A squad of Pikachus chase each other through the grass, while others stuff themselves with berries or balance them on their tails. One Eevee poses cheek-to-cheek with a Pikachu, another rolls on its back and others share a meal in a circle. There are so many picture-worthy moments in PokéPark Kanto that visitors will want to stroll through slowly and keep their eyes peeled for Pokémon hiding off the beaten path. In just this area, there is a Raticate and Gloom facing off in battle, Bellsprouts sunning their leaves, Starlys roosting in trees, Charjabugs spooking a Pikachu, Aipoms climbing on branches, and much, much more.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGround-type Pokémon take over the next area as the terrain grows a bit more rugged. Digletts pop their heads out of underground holes, as Drilburs and Excadrills burrow in the hillside. A single Cubone stands off on its own, ever the loner. Squirrel-like Skwovets and Greedents hoard their berries and jam their cheeks with food as a Fearow flaps its wings overhead. \n\n\tPast the Pokémon Forest, a pack of Bidoof and Bibarel turn the trees into their stomping — and chomping — grounds. They gnaw on branches and build dens for themselves, even crashing through the wooden path that visitors walk on at one point. After a short detour, visitors will find some cute photo ops with the beavers and even more Pokémon creeping onto the main trail. Slimey Goodras ooze across the route, with some Shroomishes and a Sudowoodo watching from the bushes.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA stampede of Rhyhorns invades the path next, causing visitors to walk around them — or hop on their spiny backs for photos. Rock types, like Geodude and Graveler, smash through next, and a dark tunnel filled with (of course) Zubats awaits. There’s also a Carkol, a minecart-like creature, and a Sableye hoarding some jewels, plus some Pokémon fossils for eagle-eyed explorers. With Sedge Town closing in, Pokémon like Sentret, Furret, Charmander, Charizard, Zorua, Bellossom, Roselia and Budew help bid you farewell to the forest.\n\n\tThe fun doesn’t stop in Sedge Town, though. Even more Pokémon call the town home, and it has two kid-friendly rides, a gym, Pokémon Center and Poké Mart waiting inside. A fountain with water-type starters, including Squirtle, Totodile, Mudkip, Piplup, Oshawott and Froakie, surrounding a Primarina, greets you as you enter. A Chansey is ready to heal wounded creatures inside the Pokémon Center, and a group of Psyducks look confused as Sprigatito and Litten climb their way on top of the Poké Mart. You’ll have to look high and low as Pokémon like Abra, Espurr and Altaria hang out on rooftops, and Shinx, Exeggcute and Vulpix stay close to the ground — there’s even a Kecleon blending into the fence.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere are two rides in PokéPark Kanto: Eevee’s Vee Vee Voyage carousel and Pikachu’s Pika Pika Paradise spinner. Guests can choose to ride their favorite of Eevee’s evolutions, plus Ponyta and Rapidash (and their Galarian forms), on the carousel, and every adorable electric-type powers Pikachu’s spinning ride. Pichu, Raichu, Plusle, Minun, Pachirisu, Emolga, Dedenne, Togedemaru, Morpeko and Pawmi lend their electricity and allow riders to move their cart up and down as they gently spin around.\n\t\n\n\tNext to Pika Pika Paradise is a colorful birthday cake filled with Alcremie, and a Kangaskhan and Dragonite battle as a Fidough chases Eevees nearby. There are plenty of scenes to discover, like Machops lifting beams with Applins on them, a Greninja striking an epic pose against graffiti painted by a Smeargle, a Snivy and Grookey playing on a rooftop, Jigglypuff smiling with a microphone, a Squirtle squad with a Wartortle and Blastoise and many more.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere are a couple more surprises at the end of Sedge Town, including a gym that houses a Pikachu dance show with performers dressed as the lovable mascot. There are 300 seats in the gym, and fans will recognize that each spot has the image of its corresponding Pokémon from the Pokédex. Outside the gym, there’s an epic double battle: a Gyarados and Raichu versus a Garchomp and Tyranitar. The four Pokémon square off against each other, cracking the pavement beneath their feet. Finally, a gift store with exclusive merchandise and hundreds of plushies lies at the very end.\n\n\tPokéPark Kanto is a Pokémon fan’s wildest dream come to life. It’s almost like playing “Pokémon Go” in real life, with hordes of new creatures to discover just a few steps away — and it’ll feel like “Pokémon Snap” with how many photos you’ll want to take. Tickets have dynamic pricing for different dates, ages and park access, ranging from ￥4,700 to￥16,500, once PokéPark Kanto opens on Feb. 5. Everyone from longtime Pokémon trainers who have caught ’em all to casual fans still learning the names of the 1,025 creatures will find something to love in PokéPark Kanto.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPatrick Nebout and Henrik Jansson-Schweizer, creators of the multi-prized “Whiskey on the Rocks” which smashed ratings records on Disney+/SVT, have unveiled two new premium projects from their boutique Stockholm-based production house Dramanation: Nordic Noir actioner “Becker & Kempe” and Cold War heist dramedy “Made in Sweden.”\n\n\tThey join the already announced English-language murder mystery series “To Catch A Murderer” (aka “The Studio”).\n\t\n\n\tEmbodying Dramanation’s mission to make what Nebout calls “splashy, high-profile TV-series and films with international resonance,” Nebout and Jansson-Schweizer will bring to market “Becker & Kempe” and “Made in Sweden” at this week’s    \n\n\n\tGöteborg’s TV Drama Vision, the Swedish festival’s TV conference forum and market which runs Jan. 27-26.\n\n\tA Nordic Noir crime and cop-actioner, “Becker & Kempe” (a working title), is set primarily in Göteborg, Sweden’s biggest port city, turning on police detectives Milla Becer and Simon Kempe as they battle international crime and corruption. Writing the screenplays are Morgan Jensen and Theo Gabay, authors of four bestselling novels, while Jensen’s screenwriting credits take in SVT-Arte’s “Thicker than Water” and five episodes of propulsive ZFG-TV4 spy actioner “Agent Hamilton.”\n\n\tThe project is in co-development with a streamer: Dramanation is now looking for an additional local partner, Nebout told Variety.\n\n\tBilled by Nebout as a “creative cousin” of Apple TV+’s  movie “Tetris,” “Made in Sweden” is also cast by Nebout as a Cold War political thriller/dramedy in the vein of “Whiskey on the Rocks” and reuniting much of that series’ creative talent: Screenwriter Jansson-Schweizer and director Björn Stein (“Midnight Sun”). \n\t\n\n\t“Made in Sweden” once more tells an extraordinary but true story of how the Swedish government spearheads the sale of 1,000 Volvo 144 sedans to North Korea, when it sees North Korea as an lucrative emerging market. \n\n\tIn “Made in Sweden,” the deal is led by an idealistic civil servant at Sweden’s Ministry of Trade, convinced that commerce could counteract Cold War and that Sweden’s position as a neutral power between the U.S. and the Soviet Union could further this goal. Yet North Korea dallies on payment, and “Made in Sweden” takes on the pulse of a car heist espionage thriller as the KGB and CIA move in, questioning what’s really behind the deal.\n\n\tNebout and Jansson-Schweizer calso o-created “To Catch a Murderer,” co-developed and co-produced with Germany’s Odeon Fiction as the lead studio and penned by U.K. writers Dan Gaster, Will Ing and Paul Powell (AMC-AcornTV’s “Art Detective”).\n\n\tOne of the duo’s career through lines has been their international ambition. At Nice Drama, they originated and produced “Midnight Sun” (2016) the high-concept and high-end murder–mystery thriller starring Leila Bekhti (“A Prophet”) as a French police officer dispatched to investigate a murder in Arctic Circle Sweden. Backed by Canal+ and SVT, it was billed as the first France-Sweden co-production.\n\n\tProduced by Nebout and Jansson-Schweizer, with multiple other partners, “The Hundred Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared,” Sweden’s biggest domestic hit grossing $22.9 million also broke out in Germany ($11.5 million) on its way to a $51.2 million worldwide trawl.\n\n\tAnother touchstone is their belief in premium entertainment. This remains despite – and because – of a plunge in Nordic scripted series orders, down from 129 in 2022 to 57 in 2025, according to Ampere Analysis.\n\n\t“We’ve gone from a market, especially talking about the streamers, where five plus years ago it was basically all about premium drama. Streaming services didn’t have much reality TV or light entertainment or any formats nor sport,” said Guy Bisson, who will deliver a state of the market analysis, From Rubble to Reinvention: Reengineering Entertainment, at Göteborg’s TV Drama Vision on Jan. 27. \n\t\n\n\t“We’re talking about market trends, however. Nothing is black and white. There is still room and a market demand for premium drama,” Bisson added. \n\n\tAs he prepared to shop Dramanation’s new projects at TV Drama Vision, Nebout talked about this, his bigger picture approach to local events, mixed financing models and a winning combo of top creative talent and IP.\n\n\tYour two new series reflect a belief there is still a demand for premium drama…..\n\n\tOur approach is basically to ignore the surrounding state of panic and maintain the philosophy we have followed for over 15 years: focusing on distinctive scripted entertainment with an authentic voice, regardless of format or budget, or distribution platform or media. We believe audiences are still seeking event drama; the record-breaking ratings for our recent Disney+/SVT miniseries, ‘Whiskey on the Rocks,’ certainly support this. The niche and the market for premium and compelling scripted entertainment has definitely not vanished. With all due respect to the vertical microdrama frenzy, we’re firmly sticking to horizontal, splashy drama.\n\n\t“Becker & Kempe” will explore, I believe, international crime and its ties in other countries, such as the Svalbards and Spain, among other backdrops. “Whiskey on the Rocks” and “Made in Sweden” picture Sweden in the middle of Cold War confrontation. Your series, while playing out in Swedish landscape such as the memorable Arctic vistas of “Midnight Sun,” nearly always have an international dimension. Could you comment?\n\n\tThe “wider picture ” is probably the red thread in most concepts and stories we choose to engage with, develop and bring to the screens. No matter the genre. We look for the ripple on the water – how a local  event or action can carry wider ramifications. It’s the butterfly effect. Globalization began in the 19th century, and today we are inescapably interconnected. Crime has no boundaries, and geopolitics or ideologies now impact every individual on the planet. Whether the story takes place in the Swedish Arctic or the streets of Paris, that tension between the isolated locale and the global stage is what we explore. It is the ultimate fuel for larger-than-life storytelling and high-stakes escapism. \n\t\n\n\t“Becker & Kempe” is an crime actioner, which you’ve made before as in the case of “Agent Hamilton.” It comes at a time when action movie and series, or titles with a strong action edge, account for a large percentage of big hits on platforms. Again, could you comment? \n\n\tAction, thriller, adventure are evergreen genres because they fulfill the critical promise of escapism, especially in troubled times. And by escapism I don’t mean that it’s necessarily lighthearted entertainment. To me, the beauty and the true power of the action edge lies in its versatility. When you infuse it as an ingredient into complex or darker narratives and genres like crime or espionage, it adds that high-octane layer that heightens the stakes. So it’s no coincidence that action, in its many iterations and shapes, currently dominates global top 10s. It offers a universal language.\n\n\tWould you see “Made in Sweden” as a sequel to “Whiskey on the Rocks”\n\n\tWhile not a sequel, “Made in Sweden” is a thematic cousin to “Whiskey on the Rocks,” and we aim to reunite the same creative team. Once again, we inhabit the Cold War universe, inspired by an infamous true story, but viewed through a different lens. Our take remains satirical, but we’re also leaning into a heist-driven dramedic thriller. Another thematic cousin would be Apple’s “Tetris” – high-stakes and fast-paced, blending tension with wit. We are exploring that rigid historical era through a genre-bending narrative and compelling characters.\n\n\tYou say you are co-developing “Becker & Kempe” with a streaming service but that you’re looking for an additional local partner. Do you see this mixed financing model as one way forward for higher-end series?\n\n\tThe new normal is that fixed models no longer exist; the marketplace evolves daily, and today’s setup may be obsolete tomorrow. However, for specific high-end series, partnerships between international streamers and local broadcasters offer a great path forward. We kind of pioneered this in the Nordics with “Whiskey on the Rocks,” a co-production between SVT and Disney+. Properly engineered, these ‘windowing’ collaborations are a win-win: they facilitate higher production values and shared risk for ambitious projects. Last but not least, this model also allows producers to retain their IP – which is a fundamental shift from the “fully streamer-funded and owned” model. \n\t\n\n\tTwo further hallmarks of your series are their combo of top creative talent, with hits under their belts as novelists or directors, and IP, be that a historical event or a bestseller. Again, could you comment?\n\n\tThis is a deliberate strategy and positioning on our end. As a boutique focused on scalable, distinctive tentpole drama, pairing top-tier talent with powerful and unique IP provides the crucial edge to cut through the noise of a saturated market, offering partners and viewers the reassurance of high-end quality. \n\n\tWhiskey on the Rocks\n\n\tA fun true-event nuclear crisis chronicle, part warm period comedy and part LOL political satire “Whiskey on the Rocks” won the 2025 Prix Italia, organized by RAI and backed by some 100 public and private broadcasters. It also scooped best TV drama at Sweden’s Kristallen TV Awards and best Nordic series at the Aarhus Series Awards in Denmark, as well as being nominated for a Rose d’Or.\n\n\tOn Swedish pubcaster SVT, the show hit record-breaking heights, with the first episode, which aired on Christmas Day 2024, securing a linear rating of approximately 1.2 million viewers. With catch-up and non-linear viewing on SVT Play, the total reach for the series averaged roughly 1.8 million viewers per episode, nearly 1 in 6 Swedes watched the series. Completion rate was 93%.\n\n\tDisney+’s first Nordic Original series to premiere in select countries, plus Hulu in the U.S, “Whiskey on the Rocks” begins in 1981 with the crew of a Soviet U-137 “Whiskey”-class submarine changing course as it heads home. But it is too drunk to set the new coordinates correctly. The sub grounds on rocks within sight of the Sweden’s coast, deep in its territorial waters, and near to its biggest naval base. It could well be carrying nuclear warheads.\n\n\tThe series’ sympathies lie with the ordinary folk on land in Sweden and in the Russian sub plus Sweden’s seemingly plodding premier who turns out to the a source of sanity, rather than the short-fused military chiefs in the U.S., Sweden and Russia, just itching for military action. \n\n\t“Whiskey and the Rocks” also packs memorable scenes such an phone conversation between Ronald Reagan and dementia-wracked Leonard Brezhnev, saved by their translators’ sensible diplomacy who avoid a nuclear conflagration. “Leonard, you son of a motherless goat, it’s Ronald here,” Reagan greets Breshnev in jocular fashion, translated as “It’s a great honor for me to steal a moment of your precious time.” “You should go hang yourself,” answers Brezhnev, rendered as “Greetings, honored President. To what do I owe this pleasure?” \n\t\n\n\t“We have three surveillance planes over your goddamn submarine and we need to know if  it is carrying any nuclear missiles,” Reagan barks when Brezhnev’s translator says the crisis is just a Russia-Sweden affair. But Brezhnev, by this time, has fallen asleep.   \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhiskey on the Rocks\n\t\n\n\n",

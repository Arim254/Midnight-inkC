    "body": "\n\tWhen Paddington first waddles on stage during the new West End musical based on the beloved bear, the audience at the Savoy Theatre can hardly contain their excitement. Exclamations of “aww,” loud chuckles and enthusiastic yelps ring out from the crowd as Paddington sings, dances and crinkles his furry face to convey happiness, sadness and confusion — it’s truly like watching the bear come to life.\n\n\tBut how exactly did the team behind “Paddington the Musical” translate the Peruvian cub’s likeness to the stage? The answer is one expertly crafted bear suit and two very talented performers: James Hameed and Arti Shah.\n\t\n\n\tHameed, whose credits include “Gaddafi: A Living Myth” and “Just for One Day — The Live Aid Musical,” is the voice of Paddington and remotely puppeteers the bear’s facial movements. Meanwhile, “Star Wars,” “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Harry Potter” alum Arti Shah is inside the suit, embodying Paddington’s physicality on stage for most of the musical’s two-hour-and-40-minute runtime. Both performers have been with the show through several workshops for the past three years, working together to perfect Paddington’s every word, note and move. \n\n\n\tDirected by Luke Sheppard with music and lyrics by Tom Fletcher, “Paddington the Musical” officially opens on Sunday night at the Savoy. Below, Hameed and Shah give Variety insight into the work that has gone into bringing Paddington to life, what it was like meeting Prince William and Kate Middleton and the message they hope the audience takes away from the show.\n\t\n\t\tWhat were your respective relationships with the character of Paddington before joining the production?\t\n\n\tArti Shah: Being 7 or 8 years old and watching “Paddington” on TV after school with my older brother, that is my first memory. And then obviously, we have the films in 2014. And when my young son was born, he was gifted the “Paddington” books by his aunt. So we were reading them to him as well, and we’ve loved the films as a family. But also, two years ago, I was recommended to work on “Paddington in Peru,” doing a lot of the physical work on the second unit. So Paddington has been in my life throughout childhood and in my adult years, not just family but work as well.\n\t\n\n\tJames Hameed: I’m from a mixed heritage, and my mum, being very, very British, had obviously a very different relationship to Paddington than my father, who came over in the ’70s. For my mum, he represented all the best things about Britain — manners, politeness, tea. And for my father, he represented leaving a home to find a new home, for whatever reason, and not being welcomed at first and that challenge of coming to a place that has a totally different culture. I think there’s such a duality with Paddington that both exist at the same time — this idea that everyone has such an individual relationship and all of them are valid, all of them are true. I think that’s probably one of the reasons why he’s so special. He kind of encompasses everything. No matter your political or religious perspective, he just can represent an aspect of you that is so true and vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTeddy Kempner and James Hameed in “Paddington the Musical.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohan Persson\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCertainly, one of the main messages I walked away with from the musical was the importance of kindness, especially with everything happening in the current political climate.\t\n\n\tShah: That’s one thing that we all seem to forget, it’s about kindness and it’s free and it’s simple and we all have it within us. It’s just a gentle reminder that we can all be kind, and this is what the world really needs right now.\n\n\tHameed: It’s a good lens to teach that to not only children, but to adults as well. I think it strips away any preconceptions anyone might have, and makes it the most vulnerable version of that story and I think that’s what allows it to be told without any resistance.\n\t\n\t\tHow exactly do you work together to bring Paddington to life?\t\n\n\tHameed: On my side, I start off as a separate character called the Young Man. He arrives with his own story and in order to tell his story, he sort of gifts his voice to Paddington Bear. The Young Man then disappears and Paddington tells his story with his own lens, his own physicalities, but with the voice of the Young Man, which is essentially Paddington’s voice.\n\n\tI also remotely puppeteer Paddington’s facial expressions. In the very early days, there were initially three people behind Paddington. We had the voice, the physical presence and then the remote puppeteer. And we did a test here at the Savoy in early ’23 I think, but what we soon found was there was always just going to be a slight delay. With this kind of puppeteering, it needs to be as true and as connected as possible, and if you’ve got three different people trying to achieve the same thing, it’s a little harder than if you had two. We got Phill Woodfine, who has been coaching me on remote puppetry, who is a legend in his field. They just were like, “Well, James, do you want to try to make the mouth move to what you’re saying and let’s see what that looks like?” It’s meant that we’re able to blend really well and there’s no delays between what we’re doing. That’s as much as I’m allowed to give without giving away everything else, but I think that we do enough that you will believe you’re seeing Paddington in the room.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tArti, you’re in the bear suit, bringing physicality to Paddington. What’s it like in there and how do you stay cool on stage?\t\n\n\tShah: It keeps me nice and warm. I take my job very seriously, and before we started rehearsals I sat in a sauna fully clothed every day for a week, just to mentally prepare myself. The mind is a powerful tool. I wear a lot of padding and then the lovely suit, which makes me stand in a certain way and brings the physicality to life. But I also touch on a form of Method acting, drawing on my own emotions because it’s not just about being the bear, you have to show the emotions. But I’ve had a lot of experience in the film industry working on things like “Star Wars” and “Guardians of the Galaxy.” The heaviest suit I have ever worn was on “Attack the Block,” it was half my body weight and I was running on all fours with arm extensions. I don’t think I would do that now because I’m a lot older, but it’s not as tough as doing that. So, it’s bearable. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Paddington the Musical.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohan Persson\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPaddington is dancing and running around the stage for much of the show — Arti, what is that like for you? What is your vision like in the suit?\t\n\n\tShah: I don’t know what I’m allowed to say…\n\n\tHameed: Maybe I can say it, so you don’t get in trouble. Essentially, Arti’s vision is extremely limited in the suit and that’s where her plethora of previous work really comes into play. Between us, we try to work out ways to get as much vision as possible, but there are times where Arti has literally none. And that really just speaks volumes for her line of work and anyone who does that line of work, because I could not do that. There were times when I would go home and try to reenact the blocking with my eyes closed because I wanted to see what you were experiencing, and I was like, this is terrifying. It gave me a whole new line of empathy for what you were going through. So part of my job is to try and make sure that whoever is performing physical Paddington is safe — that’s always my priority above everything else.\n\t\n\t\tI saw that Paddington got to meet Prince William and Kate Middleton a couple of weeks ago. What was that like?\t\n\n\tShah: Paddington did very well. He minded his manners, he tried to share his marmalade sandwich and he tipped his hat. He was very, very impressed. However, Prince William was trying to ask Paddington a lot of questions as in, “Does he get hot?” I think he was asking me, but Tom Fletcher did really well and said, “Paddington’s from Peru, he’s used to the heat!” I think Paddington was very excited but very calm at the same time. He’s a professional.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tObviously, “Paddington the Musical” is just opening in London, but is there hope for the show to travel other places — maybe New York?\t\n\n\tHameed: I will say that Paddington is well traveled and beloved by all, so I think he would work in any setting across the world. Let’s get through London first, but he’s been very well received so far.\n\n\tShah: He’s very adaptable. And he’ll always have his suitcase packed with marmalade.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe company of “Paddington the Musical.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohan Persson\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesia’s cinema market is experiencing significant volatility in 2025, with box office numbers fluctuating despite breakthrough successes, according to industry leaders speaking at the JAFF Market panel “Expert Witnesses: Indonesia’s Box Office Transformation as Seen From Home and Abroad.”\n\n\tAngga Dwimas Sasongko, filmmaker and founder and group CEO of Visinema, revealed that while animated feature “Jumbo,” produced by the company, achieved nearly 11 million admissions this year to become the country’s all-time box office champion, other months saw ticket sales drop below 3 million. The film’s seven-year production journey represents a strategic shift for Indonesian producers seeking sustainable growth beyond domestic theatrical revenue.\n\t\n\n\t“We always succeed when we try to be different,” Sasongko said, noting that Visinema’s counter-programming strategy has consistently delivered results. However, he emphasized the need for industry restructuring, suggesting a potential cap of 160 films annually to address market oversaturation.\n\n\n\tThe panel featuring producer Todd Brown highlighted Indonesia’s persistent exhibition challenges. Despite growing from one major cinema chain 15 years ago to three today, the country remains significantly under-screened. Average ticket prices below $3 compared to Thailand’s $8-plus make large-scale infrastructure investment difficult.\n\n\tBrown, former head of international acquisitions at XYZ Films, observed that while Indonesia’s baseline production quality has risen substantially, the ceiling for international breakthrough talent remains unchanged. “We’re still talking about the same people” from 15 years ago, he noted, calling for better knowledge-sharing between established and emerging filmmakers.\n\t\n\n\tThe market’s ban on dubbing foreign films and generous 50-50 revenue-sharing structure with exhibitors have created an unusually direct producer-to-cinema distribution model, making traditional distributors largely irrelevant in the current ecosystem.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesia’s Mandela Pictures and Korea-L.A.-based Desert Bloom Pictures have forged a four-film development slate, with the pact unveiled at the JAFF Market in Yogyakarta.\n\n\tThe partnership establishes a pipeline of projects designed to bridge Indonesia, Korea and Hollywood markets, combining Desert Bloom’s track record in Korean blockbusters with Mandela’s intellectual property and positioning in Southeast Asia’s largest theatrical market.\n\t\n\n\tDesert Bloom is headed by executives Jennice Lee, Hugh Cha and Park Hyoungjin, whose combined credits include Korean box office hits “Exhuma” and “Along With the Gods,” along with experience at Studio Dragon, Dexter Studios and Lotte Cultureworks. The Seoul-L.A. operation develops cross-cultural content targeting Asian and American audiences.\n\n\n\tMandela Pictures, run by the Samtani brothers — Manoj, Deepak and Lavesh — operates from Jakarta and is expanding its slate of genre and commercial titles, building on its film library and theatrical and streaming presence in Indonesia.\n\n\tThe initial slate comprises four projects. “Ugly Duckling” (working title) is being developed as an Indonesia-Korea co-production, described as a dramedy examining themes of image, identity and reinvention in the social media age, aimed at Indonesian audiences. Two additional Indonesia-set features will adapt U.S. or Korean IP for local viewers, reimagining existing properties with Indonesian settings and cultural elements. An untitled Korean horror feature, based on a title from Mandela’s newly launched genre label BN13, is being developed primarily for Korean theatrical release and international genre buyers.\n\t\n\n\t“We didn’t want a one-off co-production — we wanted a real slate,” said Mandela Pictures COO Lavesh Samtani. “Starting with ‘Ugly Duckling’ and a key horror title from our genre label, the goal is to grow Indonesian-rooted stories that feel at home in Jakarta, Seoul, and Los Angeles.”\n\n\t“Indonesia is one of the most exciting growth markets in the region,” added Desert Bloom Pictures CEO Jennice Lee. “By pairing Mandela’s IP and local insight with our Korean and Hollywood IPs and networks, we see the opportunity to build a long-term, cross-border studio ecosystem together.”\n\n\tThe partnership includes a talent exchange component, with plans to bring Korean writers, directors and creative executives to collaborate with Indonesian teams in writers’ rooms and on set, while creating opportunities for Indonesian talent to work on Korean and hybrid productions.\n\n\tCreative attachments, casting and production timelines for the projects will be revealed as they advance through development.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

The lineup also includes Man Lim Chung’s documentary “Keep Rolling,” which chronicles Hui’s creative process.\n\n\tAdditional features include Tommy Kai Chung Ng’s “Another World,” winner of the 2025 Golden Horse Award for best animated feature; Robin Lee’s documentary “Four Trails,” which won best new director at the 2025 Hong Kong Film Awards; John Woo’s action classic “The Killer”; crime thriller “Sons of the Neon Night”; and drama “The Remnant.”\n\t\n\n\tThe short film compilation features two works by Ivan Cheung, a participant in the AFAA International Film Camp: “The Apple of My Eye” and “Tomatoes Are Poisonous.”\n\n\tLee, Mandrew Kwan Man Hin, Quist Tsang and Cheung will participate in Q&A sessions following their screenings. The filmmakers will also speak at the JAFF Community Forum alongside production designer Man Lim Chung.\n\n\t“Led by the legendary Ann Hui, we are honored to have the support from a group of Hong Kong directors and film professionals to JAFF20,” said Josie Lin, AFAA executive director. “Their presence reflects the craft, discipline and leadership that define the art of directing.”\n\n\tThe program receives financial support from Hong Kong’s Creative Cultural Industries Development Agency and the Film Development Fund, with additional backing from the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Jakarta.\n\n\tThe festival’s market component, the JAFF Market, runs through Dec. 1.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Angga Dwimas Sasongko lit up JAFF Market 2025 with the first major public reveal of his new action-fantasy feature “Queen of Malacca” (“Ratu Malaka”), presenting an ensemble cast and giving audiences a candid look at the project’s creative evolution and world-building.\n\n\tThe project was first revealed by Variety at the Cannes Film Market. \n\n\tAt JAFF Market, Sasongko confirmed the film’s ensemble through a rapid-fire onstage presentation, revealing stylized character boards for lead Claresta Taufan, currently enjoying acclaim for “Pangku,” Faris Fadjar, Lutesha, Ganindra Bimo, Dion Wiyoko, Jihane Almira, and Wulan Guritno, along with producer Kori Adyanning and veteran Hong Kong stunt coordinator Chan Man-ching, whose arrival drew loud applause.\n\t\n\n\tSasongko positioned “Queen of Malacca” as a contemporary Southeast Asia-inspired fantasy world with its own mythology, languages and cultural logic. “This is not a period film. It’s modern, it’s contemporary. We built a fantasy world inspired by Southeast Asia — its belief systems, philosophy, even its writing and heirlooms,” he said. \n\n\tHe also outlined the film’s hybrid action language. “We’re combining silat, which is deeply rooted in Indonesian cinema, with influences from Hong Kong action films,” he said. To achieve that mix, he has paired rising Indonesian choreographer and actor Reza Hilman with Chan and his Hong Kong team. \n\n\tChan — described by Sasongko as someone who has worked “from Hong Kong to mainland China to Hollywood, including years with Jackie Chan” — told the audience: “I want to create a new style. I want to combine different people and different characters. Something new for this film.” \n\t\n\n\tCast members spoke about the physical intensity of the project. Jihane Almira said the role allowed her to break from her traditionally elegant public image: “It’s something very different from who I am on social media. I finally get the chance to channel another side of myself,” she said. \n\n\tDion Wiyoko, returning to action after 16 years, said: “Every day brought a new challenge. Training with Man Ching required total focus so that when we shoot, our bodies are already conditioned.” \n\n\tFaris Fadjar, who appeared as a child actor in Sasongko’s “Wiro Sableng,” added: “It’s a big chance for me to show who I am — not in the shadow of anyone else.” \n\n\tSasongko emphasized that each performer’s action design was built around their individual physical vocabulary. “Man-ching and Reza assessed every actor’s physical capability and movement. What audiences will see is the best potential of each character,” he said. \n\n\tTo close the presentation, Sasongko screened a “test reveal” — a one-day camera and texture test featuring no footage that will appear in the final film. “If this is just 20%, imagine what the full film will look like,” he teased. \n\n\tSasongko heads Indonesian studio Visinema. After spending two years focused on leading Visinema’s corporate transformation and shepherding “Jumbo” — Indonesia’s most successful animated film to date — Sasongko is back in the director’s chair.\n\n\tProduced by Visinema, “Queen of Malacca” marks one of Sasongko’s most ambitious genre undertakings, following “Wiro Sableng,” “13 Bombs” and “Heartbreak Motel.” JAFF Market 2025 served as the film’s most detailed public rollout yet.\n\n\tPrincipal photography commences Dec. 3. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMagma Entertainment and Bumilangit Entertainment have unveiled “Si Buta dari Gua Hantu: Mata Malaikat” (The Blind Warrior From the Phantom Cave: Angel Eyes), a new feature adaptation of the legendary Indonesian martial arts comic hero who remains the country’s most adapted character, with nine films and 86 TV episodes to date.\n\n\tThe project was revealed at the JAFF Market, with Charles Gozali set to direct and production slated to begin in 2026 ahead of a planned 2027 release.\n\t\n\n\tHit action-horror movies “Qodrat” (2022) and “Qodrat 2” (2025) were directed by Gozali and produced by Magma Entertainment, with “Qodrat 3” in the works. \n\n\n\t“Having [the IP acquired] was like a dream come true for us. We’ve tried to pitch for a different comic adaptation 12 years ago, so this is very special,” Gozali told Variety. The period comic book adaptation brings in a new chapter for Magma Entertainment. “Staying true to the books, the adaptation is trying to keep the original story’s breath. There is no local comic series that’s as well known as ‘Si Buta dari Gua Hantu.’ We’re very humbled to be collaborating with Bumilangit,” he added. \n\n\t“This film production is an honor for us to be able to adapt such a legendary character IP for Indonesia into a feature film and is looking forward to producing a film that will excite the Indonesian cinema audience and inspire national pride,” added Bismarka Kurniawan, founder and CEO of Bumilangit.\n\n\t“I began this journey as a director, action director, and even a stuntman on TV series before stepping into feature films and introducing the trend of horror-action with ‘Qodrat,'” Gozali, who serves as CEO of Magma Entertainment, said. “Today, Magma Entertainment and I are very proud to stand here side by side with Bumilangit to resurrect one of the biggest and most iconic IPs Indonesia has to offer. To us, this is not just a film, this is part of our dream to preserve, celebrate, and introduce our legacy of stories to generations to come.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent appearance on the “So True with Caleb Hearon” podcast, co-director Lilly Wachowski was asked about certain right-wing groups attaching their ideologies to her 1999 sci-fi masterpiece “The Matrix.” Wachowski said she’s unbothered by conservative misinterpretations and knows how to separate herself from her films once they’re released to the public.\n\n\t“You have to let go of your work. People are gonna interpret it however they interpret it,” Wachowski said. “I look at all of the crazy, mutant theories around ‘The Matrix’ films and the crazy ideologies that those films helped create and I just go, ‘What are you doing? No! That’s wrong!’ But I have to let it go to some extent … You’re never gonna be able to make absolutely every person believe what you initially intended.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Matrix,” specifically the iconic “blue pill or red pill” scene, is the most famous example of the film being appropriated by the right. In the scene, Keanu Reeves’ Neo must take the red pill in order to be freed from the Matrix. In the political context, “red pilled” is a term for someone who has “woken up” to the truth about society and often aligns with radical far-right ideology.\n\n\n\tWachowski has previously explained that the “original intention” of “The Matrix” was to be a transgender allegory. Even so, she said she’s unsurprised the right has latched on to the film since “right-wing ideology appropriates absolutely everything.”\n\n\tShe added, “They appropriate left-wing points of view and they mutate them for their own propaganda, for their own to obfuscate what the real message is. This is what fascism does. And so, of course, that’s going to happen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKanya Iwana, an Indonesian multidisciplinary artist making her feature directorial debut, has “Ibu” selected for the JAFF Future Project, about three generations of women wrestling with inherited identity in 2011 Yogyakarta.\n\n\tThe Indonesia-U.S. co-production, directed by Iwana and produced by Zack Rice through production company Feed You Films, is among 10 titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. \n\t\n\n\t“Ibu” follows Maya, a formidable Javanese woman who once dreamed of becoming a writer but subsumed her ambitions under obligation and tradition. Now a widow, she parents through manipulation disguised as protection, resenting her daughters for chasing freedoms she was taught she could never claim.\n\n\n\tHer eldest daughter Tash fled to Los Angeles years ago, juggling single motherhood with an uncertain creative career. When Maya’s husband Arief dies, Tash returns home to face not only her domineering mother but her commanding grandmother Dewi and half-sister Inez, a 16-year-old navigating the same emotional minefield Tash fled. Everything ruptures during Arief’s Seventh-Day Prayer Ceremony when Maya publicly unravels, confessing fears she has never voiced.\n\n\t“I’ve always been so interested in exploring the atlas of family dynamics, whether it is a traditional Indonesian family (often inspired by my own upbringing) or a tenuously liberal American family,” Iwana says. “As I become a parent myself and have to do a lot of inward thinking, I’ve become more inspired to explore narratives that surround the complications of parenting — to break generational curses while maintaining valuable customs.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director is inspired not just as a mother, but also as a daughter. “At 16, I moved away from home and has been away ever since,” she says. “This story mirrors so much of my feelings towards that part of my life and my experiences of homecoming: from grief to pride. Writing such strong and complex female characters as the core of ‘Ibu’ has become somewhat of a beautiful, nostalgic, and healing process.”\n\n\t“‘Ibu’ illustrates the nuances of how loss, traditions, and stigma can lead to generational trauma,” Iwana says. “It explores the consequences violent secrets can have as they are kept from each other in a family unit. ‘Ibu’ zeroes in on our protagonist, Tash, as she works towards escaping that trauma — although it catches up to her.”\n\n\tBreaking the cycle isn’t always smooth and perfect. “Her desperation to break that cycle actually puts her in the position she wants to avoid, which is a flawed but relatable human experience,” she says. “Breaking the cycle isn’t always smooth and perfect, but the journey to giving yourself grace is a beautiful one. At the end of the day, ‘Ibu’ showcases an array of different textures that spotlight the same thing: the desire to be loved.”\n\n\tProducer Rice adds, “I launched Feed You Films with my producing partner, Christine Woods, to champion debut features from experienced directors who have the craft and vision — but haven’t yet been given the support or resources to make their first feature. Kanya Iwana is exactly the filmmaker we built this company for.”\n\n\tRice was first introduced to Iwana through her work as a photographer and commercial director. “She demonstrated a singular aesthetic and a cinematic eye that touches your soul,” he says. “But it wasn’t until I read her screenplay for ‘Ibu’ that I truly understood the scope of her talent. The honesty and emotional precision in her writing floored me.”\n\n\tTo validate the vision, Feed You Films produced a proof-of-concept short titled “Home.” “Kanya once again exceeded every expectation,” Rice says. “She arrived prepared, intentional, and completely in command of her set — capturing every shot she needed without wasting time or resources on unneeded coverage. She led a mostly female crew with sensitivity, kindness, and total clarity, and everyone on set rallied behind her vision.”\n\t\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the team’s top priority is securing remaining production equity to greenlight the film. “The JAFF Future Project program is uniquely positioned to connect filmmakers with investors who understand Southeast Asian stories and want to champion bold new voices,” the filmmakers say.\n\n\tThey’re also seeking distribution and sales partners who understand both the Indonesian market and international art-house space. “As the only U.S.-based filmmakers selected for the Future Project program this year, joining the Indonesian film community is essential to us,” they say. “This film can only succeed as a true cross-cultural collaboration.”\n\n\tJAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPark Ki-yong, who stepped down as chair of the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) last year and directed “Motel Cactus,” which won the New Currents Award at the 1998 Busan International Film Festival, has a new project selected for the JAFF Future Project with “Ghost Island,” a supernatural thriller about parallel Cold War massacres in Korea and Indonesia.\n\n\tThe South Korea-Malaysia-Indonesia co-production, directed and produced by Park alongside Malaysian producer Ho Yuhang through production company Paperheart Sdn Bhd, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“Ghost Island” follows Ayu, an Indonesian woman who arrives on snow-covered Jeju Island to search for her missing husband Herman, who vanished during their honeymoon. She partners with Inho, a Korean ex-marine turned investigator, as their search leads them through motels, ferry terminals and labor agencies. Herman appears in CCTV footage, yet remains blurred and indistinct, as if the camera itself cannot capture him.\n\n\n\tWhen Inho’s grandmother relives the Jeju 4.3 massacre during a shaman ritual, Ayu feels a chilling connection between Herman’s disappearance and the island’s suppressed violence. Returning to Bali, she discovers Herman left no evidence of existence — no school records, no real family. A fortune-teller confirms her deepest fear: Herman died many years ago.\n\n\tThe devastating truth emerges: Ayu’s grandfather commanded a military garrison during the 1965-66 Bali mass killings and betrayed Herman’s village. Herman, a seven-year-old victim whose spirit has lingered for decades, seeks a descendant of the perpetrators who will finally witness the truth. Guided by shamans and fragmented memories, Ayu travels to a hidden cave where Herman’s village was slaughtered, kneeling before bones and children’s bracelets tangled in dust.\n\t\n\n\t“My interest in the Jeju April 3rd Massacre started many years ago, when discussing it was still discouraged,” Park says. “Later, I learned about the mass executions of civilians in Indonesia during 1965–66, especially in Bali. I was deeply moved by how two islands, now renowned as idyllic paradises, share nearly identical histories of violence — yet perceive and interpret it in vastly different ways.”\n\n\tWhat moved Park most was the contrast in how memories are honored. “Jeju’s wounds have finally begun to be recognized, studied, and mourned. Bali’s remain largely unspoken, hidden in fear, denial, and inherited silence,” he says. “‘Ghost Island’ emerged from that silence. I wanted to listen to what history tried to erase, and to craft a story where the unseen and the unspoken could finally surface — through love, through memory, and through the courage to witness what others felt compelled to forget.”\n\n\t“‘Ghost Island’ examines the persistence of memory and the unseen link between two haunted islands with parallel histories — Jeju in 1948 and Bali in 1965,” Park adds. “Both are idyllic landscapes scarred by state violence and silence. The film becomes a spiritual detective story where history itself is the ghost.”“The film is neither a traditional horror nor a historical drama,” he says. “It is a work of poetic realism, where landscapes evoke memories, technology uncovers remembrance, and the dead seek acknowledgment rather than revenge.”\n\n\tThe producers emphasized the project’s global significance. “The story explores two of Asia’s most silenced historical traumas — the Jeju 4.3 massacre and the 1965–66 Bali killings — without sensationalizing them,” Park and Ho say. “Instead, it turns hidden histories into a deeply human mystery about love, memory, and responsibility.”\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the team hopes to establish the project’s identity and secure meaningful partnerships. “By debuting at JAFF, we emphasize that ‘Ghost Island’ is rooted in Asian history, culture, and cross-border storytelling,” the filmmakers say. “Our goal is to connect with partners who can enhance the project — creatively, culturally, and financially — and who share our vision of a film that honors these histories while resonating with global audiences.”\n\t\n\n\tPark served as chair of the Korean Film Council from January 2022 until stepping down last year. He previously directed “Motel Cactus,” co-scripted with Bong Joon Ho, which won the New Currents Award at the 1998 Busan International Film Festival, and “Camel(s),” which won the Regard d’Or at the 2002 Fribourg International Film Festival.\n\n\tJAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJosh Brolin remembers Donald Trump before he was elected president of the United States.\n\n\tDuring a recent interview with The Independent, Brolin said he understands Trump in a different light, having “been a friend” of his before he was president. This understanding makes Brolin confident that Trump won’t try to serve a third term, a possibility that circulates in some political spheres and is occasionally elevated by Trump himself.\n\n\n\t“I’m not scared of Trump, because even though he says he’s staying forever, it’s just not going to happen,” Brolin said. “And if it does, then I’ll deal with that moment. But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”\n\t\n\n\tThe “No Country for Old Men” star met Trump around the production of “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” Oliver Stone’s 2010 financial drama. Trump was set to appear in the film but was ultimately cut out.\n\n\tBrolin later said he found Trump’s past entrepreneurial interests “interesting,” noting his move to build major developments “in the middle of a cesspool city during the late ’70s.” However, watching him now as president, he sees his authority as “power unmitigated.”\n\n\tBrolin still had some praise for Trump, adding, “There is no greater genius than him in marketing – he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it. And that’s why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him. I think it’s much less about Trump than it is about the general population and their need for validation.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBobby J. Brown, a character actor best known for his portrayal of Officer Bobby Brown on the HBO drama “The Wire,” died Tuesday after a barn fire in Maryland. He was 62.\n\n\tThe Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner told TMZ Brown died from diffuse thermal injury and smoke inhalation. His death was ruled an accident.\n\n\tAccording to family members, Brown entered a barn to jump-start a vehicle when a fire broke out. He later called a relative seeking a fire extinguisher, but by the time help arrived, the barn was already engulfed in flames. Brown’s wife suffered severe burns while attempting to rescue him.\n\t\n\n\tBrown was part of the ensemble cast of “The Wire,” the critically acclaimed series that examined policing, politics and street life in Baltimore. He later appeared in “Law & Order: SVU” and portrayed Sgt. Thomas Allers in the HBO miniseries “We Own This City.” His additional television credits included appearances on “Homicide: Life on the Street,” “The Corner” and “Veep.”\n\n\tHis screen credits extend to feature films including “Love the Hard Way,” “My One and Only” and “From Within.” He also directed documentaries about pit bulls and about Parliament Funkadelic.\n\n\tBorn in Washington, D.C., he started out as professional boxer, then turned to acting after watching Mickey Rourke film “Homeboy.”\n\n\tHis agent, Albert Bramante, told TMZ, “I am upset and saddened. He was such a good actor and person. He was totally dedicated to the craft of acting and was a joy to work with.” Family members added that Brown was a devout Jehovah’s Witness. Funeral arrangements are pending.\n\t\n\n\tBrown is survived by his wife and children.\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Bridgerton” Season 4, Part 2, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\t“Bridgerton” Season 4 ended with a wedd",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Bridgerton” Season 4, Part 2, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\t“Bridgerton” Season 4 ended with a wedding — as long as you didn’t stop it before that post-credits scene rolled. If you did, we will wait here for you, gentle viewer, while you go see the happily ever after ending to Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson) and Sophie Baek (Yerin Ha), who marry at their cottage estate following a season of forbidden upstairs/downstairs love.\n\n\tShonda Rhimes’ Netflix period romance has skipped a wedding before — Kate and Anthony’s in Season 2 — to focus on a different intimate moment, but in this case, “Bridgerton” Season 4 showrunner Jess Brownell explained the fairytale twist of Sophie and Benedict kissing in the gazebo where they first met at the masquerade ball, now unmasked and engaged, deserved to be the official end of their love story.\n\n\t“So the wedding was not initially a post-credits scene,” Brownell told Variety. “Well, that’s not true. In past seasons, we’ve done this thing where we fade to black and then we very quickly come up for a tag of the season. And that’s how we initially had it. But when Shonda and I got into post, we both felt like the ending of the season pre-tag was so magical and full of so much romance that it felt like we just wanted a moment to breathe and let it settle before one more romantic gift. It almost felt like a hat on a hat. But we really wanted to keep in this beautiful wedding that we shot. We also thought it would be fun for the die-hard fans who really stick around and talk about the show to get that Easter egg, and then to tell their friends who maybe didn’t stick around, and that it could create some some fun chatter.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton, Yerin Ha as Sophie Baek\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSophie and Benedict will be able to live out their lives in society together because Araminta (facing embezzlement accusations, and played by Katie Leung) has agreed to keep her mouth shut about Sophie’s illegitimate status and go along with the story that she is an extended member of her father’s noble family.\n\n\n\tElsewhere in the Season 4 finale, Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) has been allowed to retire from her role as Lady Whistledown (though someone else has mysteriously taken up the task), Alice Mondrich (Emma Naomi) is the new lady-in-waiting to the Queen (Golda Rosheuvel) and Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) is headed on a much needed vacation, Francesca (Hannah Dodd) is mourning John (Victor Alli) alone now that Michaela (Masali Baduza) has abandoned her, Violet (Ruth Gemmell)has decided to be single over marrying Marcus (Daniel Francis), Cressida (Jessica Madsen) returned to the ton and arrived at some peace with Eloise (Claudia Jessie), Kate (Simone Ashley) and Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) returned from India with their baby boy Edmund to straight everyone out, and it’s still made completely clear who will be the lead of Season 5.\n\n\tBelow, Brownell breaks down Variety‘s biggest burning questions from “Bridgerton” Season 4 and tease the next chapter of the drama based on Julia Quinn’s novels.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSimone Ashley as Kate Sharma\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWe’re gonna start where I love to start, which is with the babies. Have you see the reaction to the casting of Baby Edmund and the comparisons between that baby’s expression and Kate and Anthony’s iconic shared eyebrow scrunch?\t\n\n\tI saw the side by side of Kate’s beautiful eyes looking at Anthony with love compared to the baby. And, yeah, it’s a genius casting. They really nailed it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe honoring of Edmund, how did you all decide that’s what you were going to go with for Kate and Anthony’s first child’s name?\t\n\n\tYes, Edmund is Violet’s deceased husband. So obviously, Anthony, the firstborn boy, honoring his father makes a lot of sense.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s interesting to see so far Daphne has been the only Bridgerton sibling to honor the ABC naming convention her parents picked.\t\n\n\tYes, yes. Her story, it was the first season we were introducing that conceit — and following what Julia Quinn laid out as well.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek, Ruth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWith the closing of this chapter, how much will Benedict and Sophie be in the next season? Sophie’s just finally gotten a taste for this life and been able to come into the light and be part of all of this. Are they just going to go live in the country?\t\n\n\tThe book does this really clever thing, which is Julia Quinn puts Araminta in this position where if she doesn’t want to basically go to jail for embezzlement of Sophie’s dowry, she’s forced to agree to this lie or slight fudging of the truth that Sophie is a noble cousin. And that allows Sophie and Benedict to live in society.\n\n\tI think it was really important for us that Benedict chose Sophie before she was allowed in society. But letting Sophie save herself and give herself that win at the end was also really fun for us. So Benedict and Sophie are in society next season. I think they’re probably spending time at My Cottage when they want to, but they have the choice now to spend time in society when they’d like to, as well.\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of Benedict making that choice before he knew Sophie could find a way to live in society — Violet made it too. She gave her blessing for him to be with Sophie despite all of the conditions of the family having to let him. How did you decide on that for Violet as well?\t\n\n\tI think Violet is a woman of the time period, but she’s always on the side of true love, and I think it was important for us to get her to that place, especially after the death of John. That’s a moment that for all of our characters, they stop thinking about the mundane rules, banal rules of society, and start thinking about what really matters. And in real life, when you go through a loss in your family, or you see someone you love lose their love, it really puts things in perspective. So I think that was really helpful for us to get Violet to the place where she could embrace Sophie and Benedict being together.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichelle Mao as Rosamund Li, Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gun, Isabella Wei as Posy Li\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow believably mean did you want to make the TV version of Araminta in her evil stepmother role by hiding Sophie’s father’s will and getting her arrested versus how far she goes in the book?\t\n\n\tIt was important for us not to shy away from Araminta being a villain. But at the same time, I think on our show, you have to understand why people do the things they do. I don’t need for people to be rooting for Araminta, or to feel like, “Oh yeah, a great decision,” but I want them to see how she got to the place she got, so that she feels more human and more three dimensional.\n\n\tI really just adore the way Katie Leung plays that very last look at the end in her last scene with Sophie in Episode 408. It’s a look that is both like self-righteous and apologetic at the same time, which I think speaks to the fact that she knows she’s done wrong, but she also feels, perhaps rightly, that she was put in a really terrible situation by Sophie’s dad. So I hope that people see the gray in Araminta, rather than seeing her in black and white.\n\t\n\t\tIs Araminta still going to live next door?\t\n\n\tI think it would be too difficult for Araminta to live next door as she watches Sophie live the best life ever. So I think it’s safe to say that Araminta is probably leaving London next season.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHugh Sachs as Brimsley, Golda Rosheuvel as Queen Charlotte, Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSophie and Benedict get Queen Charlotte’s blessing to marry at the end, first because her new lady in waiting Alice Mondrich makes a compelling speech to the Queen about the case for a maid loving a lord being like the Queen’s outsider marriage to the king — and then because of the Bridgertons’ lie that Sophie is a noble extended family member of Sophie’s father’s family. How much of the Queen’s choice to bless the union was because she believed this version of events, and how much was done for Alice and respect for Lady Danbury, who put Alice forward as her replacement? And with Lady Danbury having the Queen’s permission to go on a journey to her homeland, will she be back next season or still away on her travels?\t\n\n\tDanbury is absolutely a part of the story moving forward. She’s quite a big part of Season 5, in fact. But I think we wanted to shake up the dynamic. She had been the Queen’s side, at her beck and call for four seasons and I think going forward, the Queen is seeing Danbury more as her peer, going forward — in many ways, as her true friend. And now the two of them are able to be true friends, and Alice can be in more of the service role that Lady Danbury sometimes had to fulfill. So that’s the answer to that.\n\n\tIn terms of the way everything goes down with Sophie and Alice and Araminta, it’s not in the books that the Queen is involved in sanctioning the lie, but I think it’s part of the language of our show that the Queen is somehow involved in blessing the union every season. And it felt like a nice cap on the Lady Danbury story, after the Queen has spent a season requiring Danbury to be in service to her, for the Queen to honor the personhood and humanity of a maid within a love match. That felt like a beautiful button on that story and like a gift to Danbury, in a way. And she’s giving her girl, the girl Danbury put forward, meaning Alice, a win. It’s really more about the Queen doing it for Danbury than anything.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLuke Newton as Colin Bridgerton, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Queen has also allowed Penelope to step down as Whistledown. We know how much Whistledown has damaged things, and also what she’s given the Ton. So how did you and the writers arrive at Penelope giving it all up, and then also choose to replace her with a mysterious new character who has decided to take over Whistledown?\t\n\n\tWe knew from the moment we started talking about Season 3. It’s in the books that Penelope comes out as Whistledown and then eventually gives it up. And we knew once Penelope came out as Whistledown, we were losing some of the tension and stakes from that storyline, because she didn’t have a secret to keep anymore. And we got to have a little fun with her being a public Whistledown this season, but we didn’t want to drag it out for too long. And it also just felt really fun in our world for someone new to take it over, because it allows us to create a real mystery about who is Whistledown. Whereas everyone kind of knew it was Penelope from Season 1, even before we revealed it — it’s from the books — now we get to really build a secret that hopefully will keep fans guessing for seasons to come.\n\t\n\t\tAm I crazy, or was Julie Andrews narrating with a slightly different Whistledown voice at the end there?\t\n\n\tYes! Good catch. Tom Verica, who’s our producing director, worked with Julie on finding just like a slightly different inflection for this new version of Whistledown. And we have some ideas about what the new voice of Whistledown is that you’ll hear a lot more about in Season 5. And the hope was that Julie’s performance kind of tips the hand a little bit about this Whistledown being slightly different than the last one. It’s not just going to be a rehash of the way Penelope did the column.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Francis as Lord Anderson, Ruth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI really thought Violet and Marcus were going to get married. How much you can say about where you want to take her from here now that she’s decided she’s not ready for a second marriage?\t\n\n\tSo we all love the chemistry between Marcus and Violet, and it was a tough decision to make. But a lot of us felt like this is the first person Violet has ever dated since her husband died, and it felt a little too early for her to settle back down. It’s that thing of, sometimes you meet the right person at the wrong time and there’s tragedy and pathos and beauty in that. I think that we do really want to see Violet start putting herself first a little bit more before she ties herself down in a marriage — if she does ever decide to get into another marriage. I think in many ways, because Edmund was such a great love for her, maybe what she’s realizing is, in fact, a second marriage isn’t the right path for her. So that’s something we’ll continue exploring in future seasons.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton, Masali Baduza as Michaela \n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAmong the other big shocks we get at the very end of the season is that Michaela has left after promising Francesca she would stay. What are you trying to signal with that after everything that they’ve been through this season?\t\n\n\tI think fans will read into it if they know the book. But I think that the way we’ve tried to portray it is a little bit of a mystery. You may notice that we’ve mostly stayed out of Michaela’s POV. We get to know her a bit through John and a bit through Francesca, but we haven’t really allowed ourselves to go into her POV all the way, and I think we are saving that for when we eventually get to her season. And so why she left is something that will be explored more fully in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton, Victor Alli as John Stirling, Masali Baduza as Michaela \n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tExploring the loss of John, how did you decide this was the right time for the character to die at this point in the show, as opposed to happening in Julia Quinn’s fifth out of the eight “Bridgerton” books?\t\n\n\tI think we knew that it was going to be later in this season. We wanted to focus as much as we could on Benedict and Sophie before we got the loss of John, because we knew it was going to be really important to actually spend some time with his loss. And I do think Episode 7 really becomes about Francesca, in a way, and it enormously impacts Benedict and Sophie’s story. We wouldn’t have had John die this season if we didn’t feel like it was thematically and narratively really interesting — in a very heartbreaking way — for Sophie and Benedict’s story.\n\n\tAs I talked about, I think loss like that really puts everything in perspective. And that felt like an important push in a season in which there’s such a giant obstacle to the romance, meaning Sophie and Benedict coming from a different class. But we also didn’t want to end the season with the death, because we want to get to a place of joy and of happily ever after by the end of every season. So Episode 7 kind of felt like the sweet spot.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFrancesca’s book dives into her desires for motherhood and her fertility issues. I know one of the things that’s been discussed throughout the book fandom following the reveal of a gender switch for Francesca’s post-John love interest, Michael, now Michaela, was how that could continue as a storyline. This season introduced a lot of that already with John’s death and Francesca having thought that she was pregnant and going through a traumatizing examination where she finds out she is not. For fans who are wondering how this would be incorporated, is there more to come on the fertility storyline, or is this how you wanted to position it at the end of John’s time with her?\t\n\n\tThere’s more to come. I think we’re absolutely interested in telling — and we have told — a story of Francesca dealing with infertility this season. But if anyone thinks that women who end up with women don’t deal with infertility, I think they have a lot to learn.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRuth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton, Luke Newton as Colin Bridgerton, Hannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton, Masali Baduza as Michaela Stirling, Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAsking more about Francesca’s storyline, how did you decide how dark and deep to go with it, given that it is still balanced with Benedict and Sophie’s love story and this joyfulness in Season 4? And how much are you also reserving for whatever will eventually be Francesca’s season?\t\n\n\tIt was a tricky balance. We talked a lot in the room about the fact that, other than Penelope’s dad — who we didn’t really know that well, or frankly, care about that deeply — this was the first time we were losing a character, watching a character die. \n\n\tIt was really important the way we treated the death. We tried to be thoughtful — like, we’re not interested in seeing John’s dead body, for example. We wanted to give a lot of space to the reaction, to the grief and the way it lands on, not only Francesca, but the entire family, and give John his due. He’s a beloved character, has become a beloved character in the series. He’s a character we all love a lot, and he will continue to mean a lot in Francesca’s life going forward.\n\t\n\n\tIn terms of balancing the darkness, those who know the book will remember that Francesca has a miscarriage soon after John dies. And it was something we talked about in the room, and obviously it does play into her fertility storyline. But ultimately we decided that it was too dark and that we felt we had given service to the fertility storyline, and we will continue to give service to Francesca’s desire for children. But ultimately we felt like losing a husband and a baby on screen has a weight that would be too devastating,\n\t\n\t\tBased on the signals we get from John in his conversations with Francesca, is it safe to assume that he knew Michaela’s sexuality before he died?\t\n\n\tThat’s something to be explored in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBack to Sophie and Benedict, I wanted to ask about crafting their two sex scenes in Part 2. In the first one they have penetrative sex and in the second, a bathtub scene from the book, they do not. What was the difference between the two scenes and what you wanted to show with both of them?\t\n\n\tIn the Episode 5 scene, which was brilliantly, I think, choreographed by our intimacy coordinator Lizzy Talbot and our director, Rayne Harris, that scene was all about urgency and about two people being really, really caught up in the moment. Because in order for Sophie to give herself sexually to Benedict, knowing she has this hang up about being an illegitimate child, understandably, she had to be really swept up in the moment. So that’s all about urgency, whereas the bathtub scene is more about intimacy, and it’s about two people being in a place where they understand each other much more deeply. Chiefly, Benedict understanding Sophie more deeply; understanding what her boundaries are and why.  So his thoughtfulness about not having penetrative sex with her there is because he’s finally at a place where he really understands what Sophie deserves, and how she deserves to be treated, and how she doesn’t deserve to be treated. But it’s also a moment in which the roles are flipped, and Benedict is caretaking for Sophie. He’s washing her hair, he’s pleasuring her and focusing on her, and hopefully it shows like a nice growth arc for Benedict, within the intimacy.\n\t\n\t\tAs they become more intimate and they start to have real conversations about what their future could be, Benedict discloses to Sophie not only that he’s had sex before, but that he’s had sex with men and he’s had sex with women. How did you craft that conversation? Obviously, that’s a deviation from the book, because Benedict’s bisexuality is a deviation from the book. So how did you want to approach that him telling her at all, and how she would respond to it?\t\n\n\tIt felt very important to us that Benedict is owning every part of himself and that he’s being accepted for every part of himself. When we talked about that conversation, it wasn’t from a perspective of this needing to be something that he disclosed so much as him wanting to disclose it because it’s a part of who he is. And in the same way that Sophie is reaching a place where she’s brave enough to be fully honest about her backstory and what she’s been through. It felt like the right time for Benedict to say, “OK, I see your vulnerability and I offer you mine.” And it’s going to allow these two to move forward in a way where they’re fully loved and accepted for every piece of themselves.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPart 2 sees the big return of Kate and Anthony. Anthony believes what is going on between Benedict and Sophie is the same as Anthony’s relationship with the opera singer Sienna in Season 1, but by Benedict’s wedding is admitting Benedict should never have listened to him. How did you decide what role Anthony would take in this, and why he would at first believe his brother’s feelings for Sophie weren’t the same as his own for Kate? \t\n\n\tObviously, Anthony went through a giant journey in his season where he went from being the guy who was maybe overly controlling with Daphne on the marriage mart to finding true love even in a tricky situation. So he’s chilled out, but he’s still the head of the household, and he still has to keep in mind that his younger sisters are unmarried, and that everything that Benedict does potentially reflects on them. He’s been away at Aubrey Hall and previously India with Kate and the baby, so I think he wasn’t around to really know the depth of feeling between Benedict and Sophie, but it was important to bring in someone who could be the voice of society in that time period, and he really is speaking to very valid society concerns. But it was also quite nice to see him coming around in the end.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGemmell, Dodd, Ashley, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Bridgerton, Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton, Will Tilston as Gregory Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBy the end of the season, my personal belief is that more has been set up to make Francesca the lead of Season 5 than Eloise. What would you say to that?\t\n\n\tCan you just put “laughs”? \n\t\n\t\tI can do that.\t\n\n\tNo, no! Interesting theory. It’s always interesting seeing the way people react to the end of the season. We felt like at the end of Season 3 we set up Benedict really, really clearly and there was still some uncertainty. This season, there are reasons to believe it could be either Eloise or Francesca. And so I’m curious.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJessica Madsen as Cressida Cowper \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCressida returns this season as the new Lady Penwood. Why bring her back after what she did to the Bridgertons, and have her share a scene of some reconciliation with Eloise?\t\n\n\tIn the book, the Penwood heir after Sophie’s father dies is a distant male relative. It felt like fertile territory to imagine who the new Araminta would be. We knew we wanted to give Cressida a proper ending, and it felt perfect for Araminta who always wears black to be replaced by the Queen of Pink. I love seeing the ways in which Cressida has grown after going through her trials in life, and more importantly seeing the way her reappearance gives Eloise a growth moment. This feels like a close to Cressida’s chapter for now, but I wouldn’t rule out seeing more of her in the world in the future. \n\t\n\t\tI know we talk every time about characters who leave and characters who come back, but I’ve seen more people asking this time around — and I feel like it’ll come up even more with John’s funeral — that it seems weird Daphne and Simon aren’t involved. So in a case like that, have you talked at all about recasting Daphne and Simon for future seasons? For Daphne to not be there for Francesca, while we understand from a logistical standpoint, is hard from a narrative standpoint.\t\n\n\tWe are not interested in recasting the characters. I think it would feel like a disservice to everything Regé and Phoebe set up in Season 1, and all the beautiful work they put into those characters. We would love to potentially have them back at some point, but I think, logistically, we want to make sure we bring them back when we have something really meaty for them. And to have them come back to say a line at a funeral and just prove that they were there, it wouldn’t feel right for many reasons. So I think in my mind, the camera doesn’t capture everything. They’re hypothetically there; it’s television. But we would love to find a time to bring everyone back at some point in the future.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of what else might have happened off camera, did Benedict meet Baby Edmund off camera? Because I thought we were building for that, and they never were on camera together.\t\n\n\tYes, I think Benedict absolutely had his good uncle moment and met his nephew, for sure.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Writers Guild of America issued its opening salvo the 2026 studio negotiations on Thursday, even as its own staff continues to walk a picket line outside union headquarters.\n\n\tThe union is preparing to sit down with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on March 16. In a bulletin to members on Thursday, WGA leadership offered an update on the “state of the industry,” arguing that profits are rebounding and studios can afford to make a “fair deal.”\n\t\n\n\t“Every three years during MBA negotiations, the companies will point to some part of their business that is not performing well to claim they couldn’t possibly meet writers’ needs,” the union told its members. “This cycle is no different.”\n\n\n\tThe WGA has said that negotiations will go on as usual, even if the staff remains on strike. The Writers Guild Staff Union, which represents about two-thirds of all WGA West employees, walked out on Feb. 17, alleging that WGA West leadership had failed to bargain in good faith on issues like wage scales and just cause for discipline. The union has warned that the Writers Guild Awards, scheduled for March 8, could be canceled if a deal is not reached soon.\n\n\tThe WGA has long issued state-of-the-industry reports at the beginning of an AMPTP negotiating cycle. The 2017 report touted “unprecedented prosperity”; the 2023 report argued that the fundamentals of the business remained strong despite a decline in profits.\n\n\tThe primary concern in this round of negotiations is the WGA health plan, which lost $122 million in the just two years according to its tax returns. The plan is suffering both due to a decline in contributions — owing to a downturn in employment — and an increase in health care costs.\n\t\n\n\tThe AMPTP issued a report in December highlighting the high costs of the health plans of the WGA, SAG-AFTRA and the Directors Guild of America, compared to other multi-employer plans.\n\n\t“These health plans offer top-tier benefits, including zero or low participant premiums, minimal cost-sharing, low dependent costs, comprehensive prescription coverage, and early retiree eligibility,” the studio group stated. “AMPTP Member Companies remain committed to partnering with the Guilds to ensure their health plans are properly structured and funded.”\n\n\tThe WGA contract is set to expire on May 1. The studios are expected to make a significant contribution toward the health fund as part of any deal. A key question is whether the WGA would be open to any curtailment of benefits, potentially in the form of higher premiums and deductibles.\n\n\tThe WGA report did not touch on health care.\n\n\t“As streaming continues its upward ascent, the media companies can afford to negotiate a fair deal with writers,” the union stated.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWall Street seems thrilled that Netflix is walking away from its deal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\tShares of the streaming giant were up nearly 10% in after-hours trading, at more than $92, after Netflix declined to increase its offer for the film and media giant after the company’s board declared Paramount Skydance’s new bid was a “superior proposal.” Netflix’s stock had closed Thursday at $84.59.\n\n\n\tIn December, Netflix outmaneuvered Paramount to secure a deal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming businesses for $27.75 per share. This week, Paramount sweetened its offer to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its struggling cable business, increasing it from $30 per share to $31 per share.\n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. controls the rights to the DC Comics library of superheroes, “Harry Potter” film and television rights, as well as HBO, still the preeminent brand in television. However, investors had been skeptical about the wisdom of Netflix’s plans to buy the studio and its streaming arm, both because of its high cost and because it involved getting into areas like theatrical distribution that wasn’t part of its core business. Shares of Netflix have fallen sharply since it announced the deal.\n\n\t“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s chiefs added, “This transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJim Carrey got the creme de la creme of French cinema on their feet at the 51st edition of France’s Cesar Awards, where he received this year’s honorary award and delivered an emotional speech entirely in French.\n\n\tCarrey, star of “The Mask” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” was honored with the award that is traditionally given to an international star, such as last year’s Julia Roberts.\n\n\n\tHe was introduced on stage by Michel Gondry, who directed him in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” 22 years ago. Carrey said in French, with a thick American accent, “As an actor, each character you play is like clay in the sculptor’s hands, which you shape to your heart’s desire. How fortunate I have been to share this art with so many people who have truly opened their hearts to me.” He then revealed that “about 300 years ago, (his) great, great, great, great, great, great-grandfather, Marc-François Carré, yes, Carré, was born in France, in Saint Malo” and emigrated to Canada. “Tonight with this magnificent honor, this square (carré in French) has come full circle,” said the actor, who attended the event with his daughter Jane, grandson Jackson and girlfriend Mina.\n\t\n\n\t“Thank you to my wonderful family, my daughter Jane, and my grandson Jackson. I love you now and forever. Thank you to my sublime companion, Mina. I love you, Mina. And finally, thank you to the funniest man I have ever known: my father. Percy Joseph Carrey who taught me the value of love, generosity, and laughter.”\n\n\n\tAt the end of his speech, he asked the audience, “So, how was my French? Almost mediocre, right? Forgive me, I didn’t speak French, but I’m just learning it. My tongue is tired.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the video below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump‘s 2026 State of the Union address brought in an estimated 32.6 million viewers on Tuesday, according to Nielsen’s Big Data + Panel ratings. \n\n\tThat was down from last year’s address to Congress (which took place on March 4, 2005, about a month and a half after Trump started his second term as president), which averaged 36.6 million viewers. It’s also down from former President Joe Biden’s second-year State of the Union, which averaged 38.2 million viewers in 2022.\n\t\n\n\tNielsen tallied 15 networks that aired the address from 9:12 p.m. to 10:59 p.m. ET, including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Estrella TV, Telemundo, Univision, PBS, CNN, CNN en Español, Fox Business Network, Fox News Channel, MS Now, Newsmax and Newsnation.\n\n\n\tIn demos, the 2026 State of the Union attracted a 2.8 rating (2 million viewers) in adults 18-34 and a 7.1 rating with persons 35-54 (6 million viewers). The majority of viewers were over 55, a demo that averaged a 23.1 rating (23.6 million).\n\n\tDuring his first term in office, Trump’s 2017 address reached 47.7 million viewers, followed by 45.6 million in 2018, 46.8 in 2019 and 37.2 million in 2020.\n\n\tAs Variety wrote earlier this week, Trump touted his economic achievements, attacked immigrants and Democrats, and criticized the Supreme Court in the divisive State of the Union address. “These people are crazy,” he said. “Democrats are destroying our country, but we’ve stopped it in the nick of time,” he said, adding later, ““A short while ago, we were a dead country,” Trump said. “Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world. The hottest.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery said Thursday it has determined that the latest offer from Paramount Skydance is a “superior proposal” to its existing merger pact with Netflix. The move sets off a four-day clock for Netflix to make a counteroffer to the nearly $83 billion deal that it reached with WBD in early December.\n\n\tNetflix has four business days, or Wednesday, March 4 at 11:59 p.m. ET, to come up with a new proposal to salvage the deal. \n\t\n\n\tIn a statement Thursday, WBD said, “Following the conclusion of this period, if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, that, after considering any revisions to the terms of the Netflix merger agreement proposed by Netflix, the PSKY proposal continues to constitute a ‘company superior proposal,’ WBD would be entitled to terminate the Netflix merger agreement.”\n\n\tAs it stands, Warner Bros. Discovery’s Netflix agreement remains in effect, and the WBD board says it is continuing to recommend in favor of that deal, which is up for a vote on March 20. \n\n\tParamount Skydance chief David Ellison issued a statement Thursday in response to WBD’s announcement, saying: “We are pleased WBD’s Board has unanimously affirmed the superior value of our offer, which delivers to WBD shareholders superior value, certainty and speed to closing.”\n\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is believed to be in Washington, D.C. today in an effort to lobby Trump administration officials on the deal. Amid the fractious national political environment, the Netflix-WBD deal has become a lightning rod for critics. The Justice Department has embarked on a regulatory review that promises to probe all aspects of Netflix’s business, exposing the streaming giant to more scrutiny in D.C. that it has ever faced before.\n\t\n\n\tIn its statement, Warner Bros. listed the elements of the revised Paramount Skydance bid that turned the tables:\n\n\nIncreased the purchase price to $31 a share in cash; \nAccelerated timing of the daily “ticking fee” of $0.25 per quarter to begin after September 30, 2026, until the consummation of the Paramount transaction, rather than starting in January.\nIncreased the regulatory breakup fee to $7 billion in the event the transaction does not close due to regulatory matters;\nReaffirmed it will pay the $2.8 billion termination fee which WBD would be required to pay to Netflix to terminate its existing Netflix merger agreement,\nReaffirmed it will eliminate WBD’s potential $1.5 billion financing cost associated with its debt exchange offer,\nAgreed to an obligation to contribute additional equity funding to the extent needed to support the solvency certificate required by PSKY’s lending banks, and \nAgreed to a “Company Material Adverse Effect” definition that means the price won’t be dropped if WBD’s linear networks decline faster than expected before the deal closes.\n\n\n\n\tThe Netflix deal, which includes buying Warner Bros. and HBO Max, is valued at nearly $83 billion. Paramount’s latest bid was a $108 billion all-cash offer for the entirety of WBD, including its linear cable channels. With the addition of $1 to the per-share price to reach $31 per share, the Paramount proposal submitted Feb. 24 amounts to approximately a $111 billion bid, including the $33 billion in debt that WBD is currently shouldering on its books.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance is poised to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety after a whirlwind afternoon in which Netflix dropped out of the hunt despite having reached an agreement in December to acquire most of WBD.\n\n\tNetflix on Thursday afternoon formally declined to increase its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery after the WBD’s declared Paramount Skydance’s latest bid a “superior proposal” to the agreement it already had in hand with Netflix. \n\t\n\n\tThe swift decision by Netflix to walk away will certainly come as a shock to the industry because the streamer had four business days, or until Wednesday, March 4 at 11:59 p.m. ET, to come up with a new proposal to salvage its WBD deal. Adding to this surprise is the fact Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was in Washington, D.C. earlier Thursday in an effort to lobby Trump administration officials on the deal, which Netflix had a merger agreement in place for, amid Paramount’s new $31 per share offer.\n\n\n\t“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement issued Thursday, less than two hours after Warner Bros. Discovery revealed its board’s new decision. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid. Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process. We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”\n\t\n\n\tThe statement continued: “Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program. We will continue to do what we’ve done for more than 20 years as a public company: delight our members, profitably grow our business, and drive long-term shareholder value.”\n\n\tThe now-dead Netflix deal, which included buying Warner Bros. and HBO Max, was valued at nearly $83 billion. Paramount’s latest bid, submitted Feb. 24, was an approximately $111 billion bid for the entirety of WBD, including its linear cable channels.\n\n\tIn a statement, WBD CEO David Zaslav tried to put a positive spin on the extraordinary turn of events, citing Netflix co-CEOs Sarandos and Greg Peters and chief financial officer Spencer Neumann.\n\n\t“Netflix is a great company and throughout this process Ted, Greg, Spence and everyone there have been extraordinary partners to us. We wish them well in the future,” Zaslav said. “Once our Board votes to adopt the Paramount merger agreement, it will create tremendous value for our shareholders. We are excited about the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can’t wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world.”\n\n\tSamuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors added, “I am extremely proud of the rigorous process this Board has run over the past five and a half months that has led us to the cusp of combining these two storied companies and the excitement it will bring to audiences for many years to come.”\n\n\tAmong the parts of Paramount’s new bid that the Warner Bros. Discovery board says it found more favorable to Netflix’s offer were the increased purchase price to $31 a share in cash; increasing the regulatory breakup fee to $7 billion in the event the transaction does not close due to regulatory matters and Paramount reaffirming it will pay the $2.8 billion termination fee which WBD would be required to pay to Netflix to terminate the existing Netflix merger agreement.\n\t\n\n\tHollywood insiders were left reeling by the swift about-face in Netflix’s plan to become even more deeply ingrained in the traditional film and TV business. Now, the reality that one of Hollywood’s foundational studios, the mighty Warner Bros., and the pioneering brand of pay-TV, HBO, are about to be absorbed by another legacy studio is sinking in. Given the significant overlap of operations in film and TV production and programming, the industry is bracing for another big round of job losses. \n\n\tThere are many unknowns about how Warner Bros. Discovery will operate under Paramount’s ownership. Paramount’s triumph in the bidding process almost certainly means that WBD will no longer spin off its linear cable channels into a separate company that would have been called Discovery Global. It was WBD’s plan to spin off the cable channels that ignited the auction process around the studio last fall. WBD’s intention to shed its linear channels was the factor that spurred Netflix to get serious about buying Warner Bros. and HBO.\n\n\tNow, WBD’s significant collection of cablers — including CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, Food Network and HGTV — will presumably be folded into the existing Paramount linear channels group headed by George Cheeks, who also oversees CBS.\n\n\tIndustry insiders are still shocked that Paramount Skydance was able to turn around what appeared to be an embarrassing defeat for CEO David Ellison. After making multiple unsolicited overtures to WBD last fall, the WBD board was forced to begin a sale process that played out in late October and November. The fact that Netflix was a contender in the process, along with Paramount and Comcast, came as something of a surprise given that the streamer has followed a non-traditional path to building a world-beating pay-TV outfit with unprecedented global reach.\n\n\tNetflix was able to secure its agreement with WBD by Dec. 5. That deal, which did not include the cable channels, was valued at $27.75 deal a share, or $82.7 billion. Paramount’s all cash, $30 a share offer for the entirety of the company was rejected by the WBD board without any substantial back and forth. But when Paramount upped the ante to $31 a share, or about $111 billion in total, WBD had no choice but to engage.\n\t\n\n\tThe first formal negotiations between Paramount leaders and the WBD board came last week during the seven-day period that ended on the night of Feb. 23.\n\n\tThe Netflix-WBD deal was always going to face incredible scrutiny from federal regulators and the Justice Department given Netflix’s presence and stature in the subscription streaming marketplace and WBD’s own size and scope. But the situation became entangled with the bare-knuckles and openly partisan politicking that dominates all discourse in Washington, D.C. in the Trump era. David Ellison is the son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison, who is using his personal fortune to guarantee most of the financing behind the all-cash transaction. Larry Ellison has been a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump. His son was not shy at all about touting that connection as a key advantage for Paramount in the regulatory review process.\n\n\tDavid Ellison also traveled to Europe to lobby against Netflix-WBD with key regulators in the U.K. and the European Union who would have had to sign off on the deal given Netflix’s market share in their territories. In past media mega-mergers, companies were able to agree to concessions or divest certain assets that might have stood in the way of winning approval for a deal. In Netflix’s case, its international reach is part of the DNA of its platform, meaning there would likely be no simple divestiture solutions.\n\n\tThe fact that Sarandos met with the Trump administration officials hours before Netflix bowed out of the chase for WBD spurred immediate speculation that the co-CEO was warned of a hellacious regulatory battle. Already, the Justice Department had initiated the toughest form of antitrust review, probing whether the combination would give Netflix monopoly power over the market for streaming services as well as film and TV production activity.\n\n\tSarandos and others scoffed at the notion that it would be anywhere close to monopoly power even with Netflix and HBO Max brought under the same roof. But the harsh reality of the cut-throat and deeply partisan landscape in D.C. — as evidenced by President Trump’s recent outbursts related to the deal — may have simply proven too daunting for Netflix amid the threat of zealous Justice Department officials ready to probe all aspects of its business in a process that could take well over a year.\n\t\n\n\tThe specter of the Ellisons’ currying favor with the administration to win support for WBD drew a sharp rebuke from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Warren is generally opposed to big business mergers given the potential harm to consumers. But in this case, Warren called out the politics surrounding the key players.\n\n\t“A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. merger is an antitrust disaster threatening higher prices and fewer choices for American families. What did Trump officials tell the Netflix CEO today at the White House? A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want. With the cloud of corruption looming over Trump’s Department of Justice, it’ll be up to the American people to speak up and state attorneys general to enforce the law,” Warren said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrincipal photography is set to get underway March 1 on “Chheledhora,” a Bengali-language thriller from writer-director Shieladitya Moulik. \n\n\tThe Indo-American co-production, starring Swastika Mukherjee, will film across locations in Itanagar and Ziro in the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.\n\n\tMoulik, whose previous work includes the “Sweater” and “Surjo,” centers the film on Brishti, a divorced woman – flawed, wounded and largely misread by those around her – who impulsively “steals” her daughter for a birthday celebration, only to find the child genuinely abducted. An unexpected discovery sets off a volatile chain of events that sends Brishti on a life-altering journey. The film weaves together family drama, thriller elements and dark humor, with a morally complex female protagonist at its center, and is aimed at the international festival circuit.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Chheledhora’ is a story about broken parents discovering the courage and selflessness they didn’t know they possessed,” said Moulik. “I’m deeply interested in flawed people who are still capable of love. This film may unfold like a road journey with unexpected twists and turns, but at its heart, it’s about healing – about how children, often unknowingly, become the moral compass for adults. It’s a very intimate story about second chances and rediscovering one’s humanity.”\n\n\n\tMukherjee brings a wide range of character work to the role, with credits spanning Dibakar Banerjee’s “Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!” for Yash Raj Films, Buddhadeb Dasgupta’s Telluride and Toronto title “Janala,” Prime Video series “Paatal Lok,” Netflix’s “Qala,” and most recently a gangster turn in “Kaali Potka” for ZEE5.\n\t\n\n\t“Brishti is not an easy woman to like, and that’s what moved me,” said Mukherjee. “She is impulsive, wounded and deeply flawed, but her love for her daughter is instinctive and fierce. I was drawn to the vulnerability in her – the way this unexpected journey forces her to confront herself. At its heart, this is a very tender story about motherhood, forgiveness and finding strength in the most fragile moments.”\n\n\tThe film is co-produced by India’s Handyyman and Sita22 Films, which operates across India and the U.S. Handyyman’s previous credits include the streaming show “Hawa Badle Hassu” and the Indo-Italian-Swiss co-production “Interdependence.” Sita22 Films is a new production company founded by Anindita (Ann) Mukherjee, who spent four decades as a corporate executive at global companies.\n\n\t“Shieladitya and I go back to our early advertising days, including our first NFDC Film Bazaar in 2014 with ‘Mrs Scooter,’ his first feature – which built a strong creative shorthand between us,” said Protiqe Mojoomdar of Handyyman. “When I read ‘Chheledhora,’ I had this urgent instinct to come on board because the script had emotional depth and commercial energy, and with Swastika attached early, we knew we had a winner.”\n\n\tAdded Ann Mukherjee: “Throughout my four decades as a corporate executive at global companies including PepsiCo, S.C. Johnson and Pernod Ricard, I’ve seen how creativity is the oxygen to growth. ‘Chheledhora’ drew me in because it places women and children at its emotional core – portraying both their vulnerability and resilience. Funding and co-producing this film reflects the kind of socially-conscious, emotionally-layered stories I want my new production company to champion, in order to give voice to those who are innocent and voiceless.”\n\n\tItalian cinematographer Vincenzo Condorelli, whose credits include “Cobalt Blue” and “Songs of Paradise,” will lens the film amid the dramatic terrain of Ziro Valley. The crew includes line producer Suven Kumar Das (“Chitrangada”), creative producer Jitin Hingorani (“Call Me Dancer”), production designer Somanwita Bhattacharya (“The Hunt: The Rajiv Gandhi Assassination Case”) and costume designer Ajopa Mukherjee (“Fish, Sweets, & More”). Production is expected to run through the end of March, with additional casting still to be unveiled.\n",

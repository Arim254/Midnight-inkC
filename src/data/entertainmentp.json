    "body": "\n\tThere are performances that remind us of what we already know, and then there are performances that shatter our assumptions entirely, forcing us to reckon with a talent we’d somehow managed to underestimate. \n\n\tKate Hudson’s turn as Claire Sardinia aka “Thunder” in Craig Brewer’s “Song Sung Blue” belongs emphatically in the latter category. It’s a revelatory piece of acting that announces itself, just like the full-throated power of a Neil Diamond chorus — an impossibly tender and ferocious piece that feels evidently alive.\n\t\n\n\tHaving its world premiere at the AFI Film Festival on Sunday, something palpable could be in the air. There’s a collective realization that we might be witnessing the beginning moments of a viable Oscar contender. Hudson channels the raw vulnerability of Reese Witherspoon walking the line in Johnny Cash’s shadow, the physical transformation of Hilary Swank becoming a boxer, the lived-in authenticity of Frances McDormand navigating Fargo’s frozen moral landscape and the star-wattage commitment of Renée Zellweger becoming Roxie Hart. Oh, and with a sprinkle of Lady Gaga’s Ally realizing that she is, in fact, a star that is born. It is, without qualification, the finest work of her career.\n\n\n\tFocus Features’ Christmas Day release tells the true story of two struggling musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band — a premise that, in lesser hands, might read as quirky at best. But Brewer, the Memphis-born filmmaker who gave us the Oscar-winning “Hustle & Flow” and launched Da’Vine Joy Randolph’s trajectory toward her “Holdovers” statuette with “Dolemite Is My Name,” understands something essential about American dreamers on the margins. He knows that dignity lives in the details and that redemption often wears sequins.\n\t\n\n\tWhat makes Hudson’s performance so potent is its refusal to condescend. She’s playing a woman navigating her dreams, only for them to be upended by unexpected tragedy. The Academy has long recognized portrayals of people facing adversity and disabilities — Eddie Redmayne’s Stephen Hawking, Julianne Moore’s Dr. Alice Howland, Daniel Day-Lewis’s Christy Brown — but too often these performances, however skilled, can feel like theatrical exercises. Hudson does something rarer: there’s no distance between actress and character, no visible seams in the construction. It’s the kind of organic inhabitation that makes you forget you’re watching capital-A Acting at all.\n\n\tThe Academy’s love for musicians is well-documented — from “Walk the Line” to “Ray” to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Their response to stories of disability with particular recognition is equally clear. But “Song Sung Blue” synthesizes these elements into something genuinely crowd-pleasing — the kind of film that can resonate with the Academy’s broader, older demographic while still feeling vital and contemporary. This is the sweet spot where artistry meets accessibility.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Focus Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHudson’s submission through the Golden Globes’ comedy/musical category is strategically sound. That race has become Oscar’s unofficial launchpad in the past few years, propelling Emma Stone (“Poor Things”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) to the big prize. Even when the Globe goes in a different direction, as it did with Demi Moore over eventual Oscar winner Mikey Madison last year, the nom itself provides crucial visibility. Though the material is hardly “comedic,” the flexibility of the Globes’ genre categories gives Hudson an edge, and could create a tight race between her and expected competition Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked: For Good”) and Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”).\n\n\tIt has been 25 years since Hudson earned a supporting actress nod as the golden-haired Penny Lane for “Almost Famous,” a role that should have heralded a career of such moments. Instead, it led to a decade-plus of romantic comedies that, while financially successful, never quite demanded we take her “seriously” as an actress (Though those paying attention saw glimpses — her work in “Nine” and her scene-stealing turn in “Glass Onion” hinted at deeper reserves). Should she land this nom, Hudson would join the rarefied company of actors with fairly long gaps between Oscar nods: Julie Christie, Sally Field, Angela Bassett — a pantheon of women whose talent the industry periodically forgot, then remembered again.\n\t\n\n\tWith Brewer as the architect of this showcase, it actually matters to the overall narrative. A white director who has spent his career as a genuine ally — not the performative kind, but one who learned at the feet of the late, great John Singleton. It was Singleton who saw something essential in Brewer’s Memphis-set debut and helped him secure financing for “Hustle & Flow.” Singleton, who became the first Black director nominated for an Oscar with “Boyz n the Hood,” recognized in Brewer a collaborator who understood that authentic representation isn’t about who tells the story, but how — with care and specificity.\n\n\tBrewer’s subsequent work — helming 11 episodes of “Empire,” launching the careers of Black performers and consistently choosing projects that center marginalized voices — represents the kind of Hollywood allyship that actually moves the needle. His work speaks louder than any press release or studio statement.\n\n\tWhether Brewer himself lands a nom remains uncertain in an overstuffed director’s race, though his adapted screenplay could find traction in a category that has historically embraced populist choices (i.e., “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Logan”). My initial assessment is that this isn’t a “critical darling” but I’ll always remind you of the No. 1 rule in predicting the Oscars: critics aren’t voters.\n\n\tNotably, if Focus Features manages to land nominations for Hudson alongside her fellow studio counterparts — Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) and Emma Stone (“Bugonia”) — they’ll achieve something not seen since Miramax’s astonishing 2002 trifecta of Salma Hayek, Renée Zellweger and eventual winner Nicole Kidman.\n\n\tWhile Hudson may be the centerpiece, “Song Sung Blue” is also helped by the ensemble that surrounds her. Hugh Jackman, an Oscar nominee for “Les Misérables,” delivers a bold and affecting performance. As a washed-up musician clinging to faded dreams and fractured pride, Jackman dials down the showmanship and taps into his signature vulnerability. \n\n\tThe supporting cast also shines, most notably Jim Belushi, who continues his recent critical renaissance with another standout turn following his standout role in Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut “The Chronology of Water.” And then there’s the young Ella Anderson, recently named one of Variety’s 10 Actors to Watch for 2025, who brings startling depth and emotional clarity to her role as Rachel, Claire’s daughter. It’s a breakout performance that suggests a significant career ahead.\n\t\n\n\tAs “Song Sung Blue” prepares for its Dec. 25 release, the greatest gift we’re receiving this year is the reminder that after all these years, Hudson still very much has it. The Oscars could think so, too.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the China box office over Oct. 24–26, “Row to Win” stayed in first place for a second straight weekend with RMB27.6 million ($3.9 million), according to consultancy Artisan Gateway. \n\n\tThe PMF Pictures release has now earned $51.4 million since its late-September release. The comedy-drama directed by Ma Lin and starring Huang Bo, Fan Chengcheng, Yin Tao and Li Jiaqi, follows a coastal-town family – led by a once-tough patriarch – who rally together in hard times and push for a comeback. \n\t\n\n\tJapanese animated feature “Colorful Stage! The Movie,” released by Shochiku, debuted in second place with $2.8 million. Based on the rhythm-game franchise “Project Sekai,” the film follows a group of virtual singers and their human collaborators as they navigate creativity, friendship and performance anxiety across multiple digital worlds.\n\n\n\tIn third, China Film Group’s “The Volunteers: Peace at Last” collected $2.3 million to bring its cumulative total to $84.6 million.  The film, which commemorates the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army entering the Korean War, stars Wu Jing and Zhang Ziyi and marks the third chapter in Chen Kaige’s “The Volunteers” trilogy.\n\n\tWarner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” placed fourth with $1.6 million for a cume of $5.3 million.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, Huace Pictures’ “A Writer’s Odyssey 2” added $1.3 million, lifting its total to $52.4 million. The sequel to Lu Yang’s 2021 fantasy action hit continues the meta-narrative of intertwining fiction and reality, with Lei Jiayin reprising his role alongside Dong Zijian and Yang Mi. \n\t\n\n\tWeekend box office totaled a sluggish $19.4 million, bringing China’s 2025 year-to-date gross to $6.262 billion, up 17.1% from the same period last year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn 1878, the age of the samurai has ended. Swords are banned, the class system has crumbled, and Japan’s warriors have become relics of a vanished era. Into this world steps “Last Samurai Standing,” Netflix Japan’s most ambitious historical series to date — a sweeping survival epic where 292 former samurai are drawn into a lethal contest for a JPY100 billion prize and the chance to reclaim their honor.\n\n\tLeading the project is Okada Junichi, who serves as star, producer and action choreographer. “It was extremely difficult,” he tells Variety. “As an actor, you should be selfish. As a producer, you think about budgets and logistics — it uses a completely different part of your brain. But when I read this script, I knew right away: this is the one.”\n\t\n\n\tOkada’s character, Shujiro Saga, is a once-feared assassin who joins the brutal tournament known as Kodoku to save his ailing wife and child. The story opens at Kyoto’s Tenryu-ji Temple, where 292 participants gather for the first battle — a vast, night-long melee staged without digital enhancement. “Every person on that battlefield was a cast member or part of the action team,” Okada says. “We filmed through the night for days — it was exhausting but unforgettable.”\n\n\n\tAdapted from Naoki Prize-winning author Imamura Shogo’s novel “Ikusagami,” the series reunites Okada with director Fujii Michihito after their collaboration on “Hard Days.” Fujii, known for his Japan Academy Prize-winning “Shoutai (Faceless),” brings grounded realism and emotional intensity to the large-scale action. “We believed that by infusing the story and action with the spirit and aesthetics unique to us as Japanese, we could resonate with viewers around the world,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tThe show arrives at a time when global audiences are embracing ambitious Asian epics such as “Shogun” and “Squid Game.” While Netflix Japan content head Sakamoto Kaata invoked those titles when unveiling the slate, Okada stresses that this project stands on its own. “I like both shows, and we’re pleased to be compared with such successful works,” he says. “But what’s overwhelmingly different this time is that what we’re making is an action drama set against the backdrop of Japanese period storytelling.”\n\n\tFujii sees the Meiji-era collapse of the samurai as a metaphor for identity in transition. “Tradition survives through innovation,” he explains. “Our generation wanted to reinterpret the legacy of period drama with respect, but also with the energy to say, this is cool.” Okada adds, “I’ve always wondered why period dramas ended up as something only older generations watch. Over time, they became more about tradition than entertainment. Finding a human story that connects past and present was the real challenge.”\n\n\tProduction designer Miyamori Yui introduced a recurring leaf-vein motif symbolizing fate and fragility, appearing throughout the series from ceremonial backdrops to costume textures. The ensemble cast includes Ito Hideaki, Ninomiya Kazunari, Yoshioka Riho, Kiyohara Kaya and rising newcomer Fujisaki Yumia. Acclaimed actor Hiroshi Abe (“Trick,” “I Wish,” “Godzilla 2000: Millennium”) joins the lineup as Gentosai Okabe — a towering, enigmatic figure with long white hair and an unsettling presence. Feared as a “monster” by other participants, Okabe disrupts the game’s fragile balance even further.\n\n\tShot on an unprecedented scale for a Japanese series, “Last Samurai Standing” combines visceral sword-fighting realism with emotional storytelling. As Okada reflects: “When my character finally broke through Tenryu-ji, I felt that our long journey — both in the story and as filmmakers — had just begun.”\n\n\t“Last Samurai Standing” premieres worldwide on Netflix on Nov. 13.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKorean sales powerhouse Finecut has closed multiple international deals for local hit “Boss,” the action-comedy that has pulled in over 2.3 million admissions in its home territory and ranks as the fifth highest-grossing Korean film of 2025.\n\n\tThe gang-themed comedy has been snapped up by distributors across Asia and beyond, including Abnormal Studios for Cambodia, Star Entertainment for the Indian subcontinent, and Clover Films for Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Japan’s KDDI, Mongolia’s Izagur Media, and Vietnam’s Khang Media have also acquired the film.\n\t\n\n\tIn North America, 213 Pictures & Media picked up rights, while Cai Chang International secured Taiwan. Encore Inflight nabbed inflight rights. The deals were inked following the film’s screening in the Korean Cinema Today Special Premiere section at Busan International Film Festival.\n\n\n\t“Boss” centers on an ironic power struggle within a gangster organization, where two men are reluctant to assume leadership while a third desperately craves the position that nobody wants him to have. The ensemble cast features Jo Woo-jin (“Harbin,” “Hard Hit”), Jung Kyung-ho (“Men of Plastic,” “Hospital Playlist”), Park Ji-hwan (the “Roundup” franchise), Lee Kyoo-hyung (“Prison Playbook”), and Lee Sung-min (“No Other Choice,” “Handsome Guys”).\n\n\tThe film already rolled out theatrically in North America on Oct. 17 and Mongolia on Oct. 24, with Indonesia slated for a Nov. 5 bow and Taiwan set for Nov. 21. \n\n\tDirector Ra Hee-chan made the rounds at Hawaii International Film Festival to promote the film, engaging directly with audiences to boost the film’s international profile.\n\t\n\n\tThe comedy is produced by Hive Media Corp, the outfit behind “12.12: The Day,” “Handsome Guys” and “Harbin,” and presented by Hive Media Corp and Mindmark.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Sheridan is poised to make NBCUniversal his TV and film production home under a lucrative long-term deal starting in three years after he will have spent a decade with Paramount Television.\n\n\tSheridan has emerged as a prolific series creator and busy showrunner who has delivered a string of series for Paramount and its platforms: “Yellowstone” and its spinoffs, as well as “Tulsa King,” “Lioness,” “Landman” and “Mayor of Kingstown,” among others.\n\t\n\n\tNews that Sheridan is closing a megabucks deal with NBCUniversal, as courted by entertainment chief Donna Langley, was first reported Sunday by Puck. NBCUniversal declined comment as did Paramount. It’s believed that the film component of the deal will take effect next year. The television component will follow after Sheridan’s contractual obligations to Paramount are fulfilled in 2028.\n\n\n\tIt was no secret that Sheridan’s representatives at CAA were testing the waters for a new overall deal arrangement for the producer. Sheridan has blazed his own trail in the streaming era, with a fast-paced production process that he steers with a strong hand. He’s even invested in two ranches in Texas for filming locations and other production assets that are used in his shows. \n\n\tSheridan found a niche at Paramount Television with the success of the “Dallas”-esque Western soap “Yellowstone.” That show debuted as a linear series on the Paramount Network cabler in 2018. Most of the Sheridan canon is in the streaming realm, where the series protocols are a fit with his auteur-ish working habits. Sheridan does have a high-profile “Yellowstone”-adjacent drama series poised to bow on CBS next spring, “Y: Marshals.”\n\t\n\n\tParamount has undergone massive transformation since August when the studio was acquired by David Ellison’s Skydance Media. The core team of executives that helped shepherd Sheridan’s rise have mostly exited the company.\n\n\tSheridan and Paramount have a long runway ahead on the bank of TV shows that he has amassed, with many more in the hopper for 2026 and beyond.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the series premiere of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe first episode of “It: Welcome to Derry” kicks off not just one, but three prospective seasons of television focusing on the eponymous Maine town and the origins of its harrowing clown-curse, series co-creators Andy and Barbara Muschietti tell Variety. “Our big story arc involves three seasons, mainly based on the three critical cycles of Pennywise, which are 1962, 1935 and 1908,” Andy says.\n\t\n\n\tAs the first episode reveals, Season 1 takes place primarily in 1962, 25 years preceding the events of “It: Chapter One.” As a direct prequel to the Andy Muschietti-directed 2017 film, it explores the previous generation of kids and adults in Derry, combating and unpacking the origins of franchise antagonist Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård).\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile Muschietti’s two “It” films followed the main storylines of Stephen King’s 1986 novel, “Welcome to Derry” explores the deeper lore alluded to throughout the book. “I went into the book and looked at the interludes,” Andy says. “I realized there was a hidden story there, and that Stephen King was leaving crumbs that could guide is somewhere. It’s a story told backwards.”\n\n\tThe Muschiettis were reluctant to share details about the series’ long term future, though the book provides hints about what happened in Derry during Pennywise’s previous cycles. The town’s origins are bizarre, involving a celestial object crashing into Derry and a divine turtle-like being named Maturin. Eagle-eyed viewers will notice moments in which turtles appear on-screen in the “It” films as well as “Welcome to Derry.” “They’re a lot of Easter eggs,” Andy says with a laugh, “And over the course of these three seasons, we’re gonna probably get closer to the meaning of the turtle, how it affects the behavior of our characters and the mythological backstory.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAlso featured in the book and expanded upon in the show’s first episode is Derry’s dark history of racism. The premiere sees Major Leroy Hanlon (Jovan Adepo) arrive in the predominantly white Derry to swiftly encounter disrespect and racist attacks. The book also ties Pennywise’s origins to Derry’s original Native American population in a colonial allegory. “Stephen King is a writer who is very sensitive to social injustice,” says Andy, “He speaks about the evil of a clown, but he’s mainly talking about the evil things that we do to each other as human beings. Most of the horrible things that happen in Derry are man made.”\n\n\tWhile this social commentary was present in the subtext of the “It” films, it rises to the surface in the show. The emphasis reflects the cultural and political shifts that have taken place since the movies came out in 2017 and 2019. Barbara — who executive produced both films as well as the series — says: “A lot of us are in a state of alarm. There is more awareness and reception to all of these matters because the perils that we thought were gone are back. It blatantly hits home.”\n\n\tThe show’s intellectual horrors in no way dilute the on-screen gore, though. The first episode, which Andy directed, features three special effects-heavy sequences of monstrous incarnations attacking children. The first comes in the show’s shocking cold open, in which a mother gives birth to a demonic baby that subsequently attacks an 11-year-old boy.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It was very clear to Andy and I that we had to start the show with something very strong,” Barbara says. “Because that’s the way we had set the tone in the movies, both with the Georgie [Jackson Robert Scott] scene and the Adrian Mellon [Xavier Dolan] scene. So we had to get to something very intense.”\n\n\tThe episode’s final scene is similarly graphic, and adds a harrowing plot twist. The episode introduces an ensemble of young characters who the audience assumes will be the show’s main heroes. However, in the final scene, the mutant baby returns to kill off half of them in a brutal sequence. As Andy puts it, the twist communicates that “nobody is safe in this world.” \n\n\t“It’s not a cliffhanger in the classic sense,” he continues. “You’re left with nothing. You’re asking, ‘Now what?'”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It was important for us to tell a very unpredictable story, because we couldn’t repeat the movies,” Barbara says. “We needed the kids, because there’s no ‘It’ without kids, and we needed them to become friends and fight this monster together. But we needed to subvert the story somehow.”\n\n\tWith seven more episodes to come, each airing Sunday nights on HBO, and two more seasons on the horizon, more twists are bound to come. Given the first episode’s fatal climax, the story’s future is nebulous and opaque. Only one thing is certain: Nobody is safe in Derry.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the series premiere of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tIt doesn’t take long for “It: Welcome to Derry” to remind audiences that they’re back in Stephen King’s eponymous cursed town. The first episode alone features enough blood, guts and gore to rival either of the Andy Muschietti-directed “It” films — and much of that pours out within the first 10 minutes.\n\n\tThe HBO series opens with an 11-year-old boy named Mattie (Miles Ekhardt) hitchhiking his way out of the Maine town circa 1962. He’s picked up by a family — a bespectacled father (Mark MacRae), pregnant mother (Zoë Barrett-Wood), teenaged daughter (Audrey Wellington) and boyish son (Lochlan Ray Miller). At first they seem safe and friendly, but such descriptors are always cause for caution in Derry.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe family says that they’re heading the Portland, but as they continually pass the “Welcome to Derry” sign, Mattie becomes suspicious that they’re driving in circles. Meanwhile, the son who’s going through a phase of spelling out words starts to spell out increasingly dark terms like “kidnapping,” “maggots,” “cadaver,” and “strangulation,” at his mother’s request. Mattie’s pleas that they pull over fall on deaf ears and all doors are locked.\n\n\tThen, the mother starts going into labor. The family join their son in a euphoric chant of “O-U-T! O-U-T!” as the woman’s belly begins to move and blood and guts ooze from between her legs. A bloody head soon emerges and a deformed, fetal infant is pushed out onto the car floor.\n\n\tShrouded in darkness beneath the dashboard, the baby emerges as a two-headed, bat-winged demon, flying around the car like a feral animal leashed only by his mother’s still-attached umbilical cord. Things calm down only when the entire family, including the newborn, pause to set their sights on Mattie. The baby then lunges at Mattie as we cut to the window shattering, presumably signaling the boy’s brutal demise.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Welcome to Derry” serves as a prequel to the two “It” films: 2017’s “It: Chapter One” and 2019’s “It: Chapter Two.” It chronicles the origins of Pennywise the Clown and the previous generation’s encounters with the town’s haunting curse.\n\n\tLike its cinematic predecessors, the show creates its harrowing sequences with a blend of modern visual effects and old school prosthetics. What are practical effects and which are digital ones is sometimes hard to distinguish, as they seamlessly mix to terrifying, yet visually spectacular effect. The cold open, for example, made use of an LED sound stage and a digital model of the demon baby alongside prosthetic legs for the mother and a practical puppet waved around on a stick.\n\n\n\tTo learn more about how “Welcome to Derry” pulled off the shocking sequence, Variety interviewed Daryl Sawchuk and Sean Sansom for an exclusive conversation. Sawchuk served as the series’ VFX supervisor, while Sansom served as the head of the prosthetics department after previously working in the makeup department on both “It” films.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you both find yourselves working on “Welcome to Derry”?\t\n\n\tSean Sansom: For me, it was the previous relationship with Andy and Barbara Muschietti, having worked on the first two films and a few other projects. Andy likes to have his team together, and — because the show is in the same universe as the films — he wanted it to have the same style and look.\n\n\n\tDaryl Sawchuk: When Andy was finishing “The Flash” for Warner Bros., the visual effects supervisor on that film, John Des Jardin, is actually kind of a mentor of mine — someone that I’d done a bunch of films with over the years. When they were looking for a visual effects supervisor, John gave me a really nice, flattering review, and then I had a conversation with Andy and we hit it off really well. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tGiven your respective titles and departments, tell us how you both worked together to bring the show to life?\t\n\n\tSawchuk: My responsibility on it from pre-production, through production, all the way through post was both working out some of the previz and early ideas with other department heads, including Sean, for visual effects sequences on the show. I was in charge of being there on set to make sure that we were getting all of the reference passes, all of the material that we needed to add visual affects into later and then carry through to post-production.\n\n\tSansom: I looked after all of the builds. All through pre-production I held concept meetings, meeting with other department heads and figuring out what we were going to build physically for set. I was also assisting Daryl with what he needed in regards to physical references, which they would either scan or use as a basis to build their [digital] models around. And then I was on set for all the filming as well.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen you both read the script for the first episode, and you immediately see this gruesome cold open birthing scene, what goes through your minds knowing that it will require a lot of heavy effects and prosthetic work?\t\n\n\tSawchuk: For me, you’re obviously shocked by what you’re reading on the page. You’re just like “Holy shit. I realize this is for HBO, but man, this is going to be a really dark, gruesome and gritty opening and very shocking.” Then the storyboards start. Andy starts drawing some himself, and he’s got a storyboard artist that he works with, and you realize some of the angles that he’s asking for are quite graphic. We started with some previz early on, just to help facilitate blocking things out in terms of action, so we can understand what angles we needed to shoot. \n\t\n\n\tThen, we were able to hand it off and work with guys like Sean and our costumes team to figure out what we needed to build practically. We realized that we were really going for it. My approach to visual effects is always to try to get as much practical stuff as possible, and it was great that Andy and Sean feel the same. So we built a lot of practical reference for us to scan and shoot for the baby that comes out, but Sean’s team also built the woman’s fake legs and the birthing rig. We had a lot of fantastic practical goo and blood and all sorts of stuff that we used as a starting point and then expanded upon when we got into post.\n\n\tSansom: In regards to the script, reading any project of Andy’s, I immediately know that it’s not going to be easy. It’s always going to be a challenge. Like Daryl said, you don’t anticipate seeing everything that is described in the script, because you think that they’re going to tone it down a bit for TV, but not with Andy. Then, there are all of the complications involved with the shots, like how it takes place in a car. Normally, it’s fine to build stuff, like the actress had a fake belly and legs so that we could push the baby out from behind, but now she’s also sitting in a car seat, and the car seat is part of a car from the late 1950s, and they’ve only got two of them. So, they have to make a fake seat to mimic the car seat. The art department gets involved and it’s a large group effort. This all comes out of the concept meetings, where we try to figure out who’s going to look after what and what’s the crossover. Of course, we have a lot of crossover with Daryl’s team for the creatures and everything. Andy wanted a practical baby too, so we built a baby.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow did you use the practical baby? Is it in any of the final shots, or was it just a reference?\t\n\n\tSansom: We had two of them. We made one that was for Daryl to use for reference, which had the arms and wings outspread, and we put that on a stick to fly from this person to that person and all over the place inside the car. But we also had one that was all folded up in the fetal position, and that one was actually pushed out of the belly and used for the beginning of that scene.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you make the legs and belly for the birthing shots?\t\n\n\tSansom: It’s like the old magician’s trick with the body cut in half. The actress was actually kneeling upright. Her arms and her shoulders and her head and neck were sticking out from the car seat, and then we had a full fake body from the collarbone down, with rods going through the bottoms of the feet, through the hole in the floor of the car so that we could manipulate the legs from underneath.\n\n\tSawchuk: I think Sean is also understating the constraints of the physical space a little bit. We shot this on a volume wall, so we had interactive light. We could have done this on a bench with no seat and maybe just a dashboard, and Sean probably would have had a lot more room to move around and do all of his puppeteering. And he would have been in every shot and we would have had to paint him out. As is, I think maybe there was one shot where we had to remove an arm or something, but because we wanted to use the volume wall for lighting purposes, we tried to keep the car in as fixed a state as possible. Doors were shut all the time, so Sean had to come in from behind or underneath the seat. We had to figure out a way for him to get through that way, but it allowed for those first few shots where the baby comes out to be entirely practical. We added some additional blood and guts to the scene, but the baby coming out is all Sean. It was real lighting, viscous goo and goop and all of that stuff. And it looks great, kind of an homage to old school horror and traditional techniques, with the benefits of some new technology.\n\t\n\t\tHow was using the puppet on set with the actors?\t\n\n\tSawchuk: Sean’s team is fantastic. Like, we’re always looking for real lighting reference, and he built out a baby. I can’t remember if we had designed something or maybe provided a 3D sculpt that he then took and made a mold of and did all the painting and stuff, but we had something that was great for lighting reference, so that we could see how the light was interacting with it. We would puppeteer the creature on a stick through the scene. We would see how the light changed as it traveled from the front to the back of the car. It was also good sometimes for actor reference. We’d actually get a real reaction. We’d do a rehearsal take, and Andy would also dive in there. If we had to have something smush up against one of the actors faces, we could use this baby on a stick in order to do that. I think we also had some softer, smaller parts like just the head for interactivity. It gave Andy an opportunity to direct an actual performance out of the actors, so they’re responding to something real. It just helps give you a more believable performance.\n\t\n\n\tSansom: Andy had a concept artist come up with all these ideas that fits his style. He’ll design a lot of things himself too. He’ll draw it out in the concept meetings on the white board to explain what he’s looking for, which is great for us. He provided some of these concept designs, which then I used to sculpt the baby and the head.\n\t\n\t\tHow was it working with such a young cast in this first episode and throughout the series?\t\n\n\tSawchuk: It’s always interesting working with kids. Some child actors have had more experience than others. Matilda Lawlor I worked with seven years ago, and that was her first time she worked with puppeteering and holding on to gray, stuffy objects that were later replaced with CGI. So she had some experience, which was really neat, but not everyone did. So I think it’s another reason why it’s great to have some practical references and set pieces from Sean’s team, so that they can kind of understand “That’s the thing I have to react to” and they find the fun with all of it.\n\n\tSansom: Yeah, the kids are great. It was a lot like “It: Chapter 1.” The kids get really into it because they’re dealing with make believe and it’s like Halloween every day on set when they’re dealing with creatures and blood and goo. They’re having a blast.\n\t\n\t\tLastly, what’s something on the show that people might assume is a digital effect, but is actually practical — or vice versa?\t\n\n\tSawchuk: Well, there’s the opening. I think everybody assumes that things are mostly digital nowadays, but this was really and homage to previous fantastic makeup and prosthetic effects and we were really tried to preserve that and just add on top of it.\n\t\n\n\tSansom: It’s tricky, because pretty much everything we’ve done on the show is a crossover, where we’re both involved in the scene. There’s a little bit of practical and a little bit of digital. It’s hard to tell. I’m not even sure that I could tell who did what — not in the first episode anyway.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat does it say that a Warren Zevon tribute concert Friday night featured more than 30 songs, was performed by well over 50 musicians, and stretched nearly to four hours in the end … and still felt skimpy? It says that some of us are just a little too greedy, 22 years after the honoree’s death, to hear as many of the rock genius’s greatest songs performed as possible, even if that really would entail playing it all night long. Given that no one involved could really wait till they’re dead to sleep, anyway, the Wild Honey organization put on the most complete tribute imaginable, squeezing a catalog full of wicked humor and warmth for all the tearjerking and titter-prompting it was worth.\n\t\n\n\tThe Wild Honey Foundation typically puts on one of these tribute shows a year to benefit autism causes, and usually, apart from the honored artist himself (if he’s alive and kicking), it’s a one-song-per-frontman affair. Things were just a little different Friday at the United Theater in downtown L.A. (the first time one of these shows has taken place in that movie palace, after a long run at the smaller Alex in Glendale). A handful of family members or associates got to play a few more numbers each than the standard one-and-done, including Jackson Browne, who produced Zevon’s first two albums and has remained an enthusiastic champion ever since; Jorge Calderón, who collaborated as a writer and/or performer on all of Zevon’s albums except one; and Jordan Zevon, his son. Although he never met Zevon, Shooter Jennings also got the special privilege of playing two songs instead of just one, and he’d earned it: the guy has done repeated Zevon tribute concerts on his own and even released a live album of Zevon covers. \n\t\n\n\tApart from these artists with obviously deep connections, the lineup was led by Dwight Yoakam, who did a highly regarded cover of “Carmelita” back in the early ’90s (in collaboration at the time with Flaco Jimenez), and such artists as Steve Wynn, the semi-reunited Fountains of Wayne, Chris Stills, John Wesley Hardig, Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie and other guest from the east coast as well as Warren’s favored west.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDwight Yoakam at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt was “Jordan Strikes Up the Band” as the son rose to kick off the long evening with a vocally familiar-sounding rendition of the “Johnny” song that started off “Excitable Boy,” the 1978 album that was Dad’s commercial peak. Soon following was a singer with another connection to Zevon Sr., Matt Carsonis, who played with the honoree on the final dates he did in 2002, just prior to learning he had only months to live; his contribution was to dip into the all-too-truncated 21st century portion of Zevon’s with “Dirty Life and Times.” (Carsonis is involved in the forthcoming release of a live album that will present Zevon’s final concert on disc for the first time, for Record Store Day Black Friday .)\n\n\t“Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner,” possibly Zevon’s most violent song, as a Sam Peckinpah/Ichabod Crane hybrid, was a ladies’ choice selection, with Living Sisters Inara George and Eleni Mandell cheerfully facing each other down as they sang “…talkin’ about the man.” The rural-dystopia number “Play It All Night Long,” meanwhile, had Dream Syndicator Steve Wynn reprising the song of Zevon’s that invokes the most bodily fluids… besides blood. (But also blood.) “Anybody who could write ‘Little old lady got mutilated late last night’…,” praised Wynn. “But I’m not doing that one. I decided to do the song where he says brucellosis.”\n\n\tThe most obscure songs of the night came midway through the first act, with two selections recorded and/or written by Zevon in the 1960s, roughly a decade before his solo career as a major-label artist took off. (For a few rocking minutes, the audience could well have been back at the “Nuggets” show Wild Honey put on in 2023.) First up in that extremely retro vein were Steve Stanley and Kristi Callan, covering “Follow Me,” a folk-psych-rock song Zevon cut as a member of the high-school duo Lyme & Cybelle. It hit No. 65 on the Hot 100 in 1966. Who knew? Well, probably a sizable portion of the cult. Then followed “Outside Chance,” a number Zevon co-wrote for his labelmates the Turtles that same year, described by the evening’s host, Chris Morris, as “a Byrds-style ripper.” This one was done by the Smithereens’ Dennis Diken, with support from Scott McCaughey and, on guitar, the Beach Boys’ David Marks. While you couldn’t exactly say that Zevon’s writing style was fully in bloom by 1966, there was an early foreshadowing of his wit, as Diken bellowed: “You don’t stand an outside chance… BUT YOU CAN TRY!”\n\t\n\n\tLow Cut Connie mainstay Adam Weiner proved a great choice for the tribute, as one of the few frontmen in rock after Zevon whose main instrument is an enthusiastically pounded piano. “I call him the piano fighter… I’ll be singing the truth right now,” Weiner promised, launching into a latter-day Zevon favorite, the short, not-so-sweet “My Shit’s Fucked Up.”\n\n\tFountains of Wayne, recently relaunched by Chris Collingwood, and augmented here by both perennial members and ringers, got the keys to Zevon’s most covered tune, “Poor Poor Pitiful Me.” (The appearance was all too short for those of us who have clamored to see this summer’s very short reunion tour extend to the west coast; no sign of that yet, so let’s hope this was not the last local performance under the FoW name.) \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJordan Summers and Jorge Calderon perform at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tZevon creative BFF Jorge Calderón followed, saying, “As you may well know, me and Warren were very close friends for a long time and partners in many a crime, and the best crimes were our song collaborations” — going into the first three of four co-writes with Zevon he would do during the evening. He told a similar story about co-authoring the Woodrow Wilson-era anti-imperialist lament “Veracruz” as he told to Variety earlier in the week (check out that concert preview story here). Calderón has said the best attribute he and Zevon shared as writers was a penchant for as much economy in lyrics as possible., Yet the exception to that was the late-period “Mr. Bad Example,” which in a fit of hysteria in their writing den (seated together on the “Couch of Pain”) ultimately resulted for once in as many verses possible, all of them, by Calderón’s own account, “ridiculous.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShooter Jennings performs at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOPYRIGHT         STEVO ROOD\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShooter Jennings knows how to do roughhouse rock — as well as being, like Weiner, another piano man — and he was just the man for the gleeful psychosis of “Excitable Boy” and the no-sleep-till-Valhalla anthem “I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead.” He was followed by the closer for Act 1, Yoakam, tipping his hat to “Carmelita” with a reprise of his Cali-Tex-Mex cover, and ensuring that heroin abuse never sounded any more winsome (or Pioneer Chicken any sweeter, for that matter).\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJackson Browne performs at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAct 2 began with Browne’s first of two appearances, singing the unduly prophetic “Don’t Let Us Get Sick,” Zevon’s moving prayer to a possibly unhearing deity for health of every physical and mental kind. The ensemble’s substantial string section handled the potentially rough segue from that to the rowdier next song with one of three “Interludes” they played over the course of the night, lifted from the appearances of interstitial orchestration on the “Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School” album. And then came the jammiest number of the program, “Nighttime in the Switching Yard,” a funk-rock exercise that allowed plenty of room for Chris Stills to not just sing but play guitar hero.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBilly Valentine performs at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs a personal aside, I’d spent the entire show thus far worried about who the Wild Honey gods would deem worthy of handling “Accidentally Like a Martyr,” the “Excitable Boy” ballad that is my favorite piece out of the entire Zevon oeuvre, and, if you’ll indulge just a little possible exaggeration, maybe the saddest song ever written. (Suffice it to say that this song, a recent breakup or loss and razor blades should not be allowed within 50 yards of one another.) My anxiety could not have been more unfounded. It went to Billy Valentine, who performed with a sibling as the Valentine Brothers in the late ’70s and ’80s, and who has enjoyed a recent renaissance with fresh solo material. He nailed “Martyr” with a full soul vocal that some attendees may remember for the rest of their lives. Music directors Jordan Summers and Nick Vincent did a classic song that passes too quickly on record a great service by extending it by a few choruses, giving Valentine a chance to wring the emotion out of it that was only inherent in Zevon’s necessarily simpler delivery. They also handing him a key change that was not on the record to turn it into a true power ballad. (Turning the piano part between verses into an orchestral part also ramped up the drama.) Over the course of four hours, the full house at the United was pacing itself by pretty much enjoying the show from the comfort of the seats… but for Valentine’s act of generosity, everyone was on their feet. Not-so-accidentally like a show-stopper, etc.\n\t\n\n\t“Somebody had to follow Billy Valentine,” said Phil Cody, who was up next with what at least counted as another sad one, “Splendid Isolation.” “I guess the way to counter that,” he said, “is ‘We’ll bring the hillbilly stoner.'” Part of his way of taking it yokel — besides bringing in Foo Fighter Rami Jaffee  on accordion and Willie Aron blowing harmonica — was to add a previously unheard yodel to the chorus. (Although Zevon himself was not above a yodel; see “The Hula Hula Boys,” the number I was sorriest to see not make the setlist, with the possible exception of “Hasten Down the Wind.”)\n\n\tSusan Cowsill was introduced by Morris as someone who could rival Linda Ronstadt, and in fact it turned out that she released a cover of “Mohammed’s Radio” in 1976, more than two years before Ronstadt famously did it, although no one is holding Linda’s tardiness there against her. Just shy of 50 years later, she was still up to it. McCaughey, rather than Browne, took the rare Zevon/Browne co-write “Tenderness on the Block,” a reminder that Zevon could be a sentimental fool before he was exploring sentimental hygiene.\n\n\tThe most curious departure of the night — and a rewarding one — came when Jordan Zevon introduced an odd hybrid version of “Monkey Wash, Donkey Rinse” by suggesting that he was going to finally right a sort of sin committed by his father. He spoke about how he encouraged his dad to employ more organic-sounding arrangements later in his career, when the legend was favoring rough electronics in the late ’80s and ’90s, not to everyone’s enjoyment. “I used to kind of complain that they were almost demo-sounding, with lots of synthesizers, which ’70s kids, myself and Jordan Summers, rejected. … I tell ‘Dad, ‘You know, I got friends that would die to play with you.’ ‘You know, Johnny, I can’t afford a band.’ ‘Afford? They’ll play with you (for free!)’ ‘Johnny, maybe we should move on.’ I’m sure it was because he was his kid. He didn’t trust — he’d seen Jordan and I play at Madame Wong’s when we were 16, and we were not awful, but giving it our best…”\n\n\tBut now, stretching hands across the grave, Jordan was determined to have his pals pick up acoustic instruments — including fiddle and washboard — and give one of his synth-y songs from 1995’s “Mutineer” an organic arrangement at last. “We’re gonna do a little posthumous ‘I told you so.’ And hopefully in the afterlife, I’ll be all right,” Jordan quipped, before the band launched into a nearly zydeco-sounding rendition of “Monkey Wash, Donkey Rinse” — with Warren’s own lead vocal piped in over it on the PA. It was a bold move, but a jubilant one, and lightning did not strike the United Theater.\n\t\n\n\tThat, frankly, could have served as the sentimental finale of the night, but there was more to come in the 11:00 hour from two returning performers. Browne sang the irreverent but pointed “Life’ll Kill Ya” and what many aficionados consider to be Zevon’s true signature song, “Desperados Under the Eaves.” The orchestra was at full blast and the full vocal chorus was wailing “Look away, down Gower Avenue,” as if this were L.A.’s own “Dixie,” which of course it is.\n\n\tThat could have been the finale, but among soloists, at least, that slot was reserved for Calderón, who closed out the pre-group-sing portion of the show with Zevon’s biggest weeper, “Keep Me in Your Heart.” Calderón again told the story of his close and thorough collaboration with the legend on his final album, “The Wind,” which they actually started and finished right after Zevon’s diagnosis that he had only a few months to go — he actually made it for a year — and how the process of record-making, in his view, gave Zevon a little extra time on earth. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom there, there was only one place to go: up, and to the drawing of blood. The full cast assembled for “Werewolves of London” and “Lawyers, Guns and Money,” with ongoing Wild Honey producer mainstays Paul Rock, David Jenkins and Michael Ackerman able to join in amid what seemed more like a cast of hundreds than mere dozens. \n\n\tAfter this, Zevon’s actual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction down the street in a couple of weeks may seem anticlimactic to anyone who was at the United for the more epic experience. With any luck, the short tribute the starry cast is able to squeeze into that long Hall of Fame program will do him and his most famous songs justice, even if it inevitably can’t offer the same gratifying sense of how fucked up his shit was.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJordan Summers, Jordan Zevon and Jackson Browne perform at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSetlist for “Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.” concert at the United Theater, Oct. 24, 2025:\n\n\tSet 1Johnny Strikes Up the Band — Jordan ZevonJoin Me in L.A. — All Day SuckerDirty Life and Times — Matt CarsonisReconsider Me — John Wesley Harding (with Nelson Bragg)Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner — Inara George and Eleni Mandell(Interlude 1 — strings)Play It All Night Long — Steve WynnMutineer — Leslie MendelsonFollow Me — Steve Stanley and Kristi CallanOutside Chance — Dennis Diken (with Scott McCaughey and David Marks)My Shit’s Fucked Up — Adam WeinerPoor Poor Pitiful Me — Fountains of WayneVeracruz — Jorge CalderónMr. Bad Example — Jorge CalderónDisorder in the House — Jorge CalderónExcitable Boy — Shooter JenningsI’ll Sleep When I’m Dead — Shooter JenningsCarmelita — Dwight Yoakam\n\t\n\n\tSet 2Don’t Let Us Get Sick — Jackson Browne(Interlude 3 — strings)Nighttime in the Switching Yard — Chris StillsStudebaker — Jordan ZevonSentimental Hygiene — Marshall CrenshawAccidentally Like a Martyr — Billy ValentineSplendid Isolation — Phil Cody(Interlude 2 — strings)Mohammed’s Radio — Susan CowsillTenderness on the Block — Scott McCaugheyMonkey Wash, Donkey Rinse — Warren Zevon vocal track over live bandLife’ll Kill Ya — Jackson BrowneDesperados Under the Eaves — Jackson BrowneKeep Me in Your Heart — Jorge CalderónWerewolves of London — full castLawyers, Guns and Money — full cast\n",

    "description": "\n\tOut of the many thousands — surely tens of thousands — of albums I’ve listened to in my time, I can’t recall one that had me on the edge of my seat ",
    "body": "\n\tOut of the many thousands — surely tens of thousands — of albums I’ve listened to in my time, I can’t recall one that had me on the edge of my seat from the first moments to the last on first listen the way Lily Allen’s new “West End Girl” did, almost as if it were a suspense movie. The tension doesn’t come in wondering about where the record’s narrative is ultimately headed; as you may have heard, this is a divorce record with a capital D. My inability to sit back in my chair came from just savoring every confessional line and wondering what the hell she was going to tell us in the next one to top it. It’s the pleasure of listening to a master storyteller who makes your jaw drop by seeming to have spilled all the tea almost at the outset, and then the tea just keeps on coming. Not since Boston in 1773, maybe, has anyone dumped it this massively, or this fulfillingly.\n\t\n\n\tIf that sounds a little hyperbolic, well, sure. But “West End Girl” is the kind of record that can inspire crazy superlatives. It’s not solely about the candor — although if all Allen did was read like-minded passages of her diary aloud, you’d still have to give the album some points. It’s not just what she says from moment to moment but how she says it that keeps you riveted. And that applies on fifth, sixth and seventh listen, too, however well you’ve absorbed the story beats. The level of pop craftsmanship remains superb throughout, too, in 14 songs that somehow manage to keep the emotions feeling utterly raw at every turn, even as the music itself is anything but.\n\t\n\n\tSo: Come for the shock value, and stay for the high level of craftsmanship. Then stay even longer for how cannily the album sustains its mix of droll delivery and pure heartbreak. It’s a place you’ll probably want to linger.\n\n\tThere have been a lot of powerful divorce albums in recent years: Already in 2025, we had Jason Isbell’s and Amanda Shires’ both-sides-now releases, plus Maren Morris’ roman-a-clef set. Going back further, we’ve had Adele’s “30,” Kacey Musgraves’ “Star Crossed” and the Chicks’ “Gaslighter,” and the divorce-court near-miss that was Beyonce’s “Lemonade,” not to mention non-marital laments like Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department.” What all those albums had in common was how those artists offered at least occasional time-outs from the trauma. Usually the artist will feel obligated to give the audience a breather with at least a couple songs that deal with something other than the central rupture, or which flash forward to assure everyone that the singer is doing all right and healing up, thank you, post-split.\n\n\tBut there will be no such commercial breaks or reassurances about time’s healing power for Allen. These 14 songs never offer the slightest relief from the intense emotionality of the breakdown of her relationship. But they’re so uniformly good, the fact that she doesn’t stray for a second from the subject of straying and its effects, but holds onto it like a dog with a bone, is… well, it’s a relief, actually. Allen has been working as a stage actress lately, on London’s West End (hence the title), and listening to the album one fell swoop at a time is like immersing yourself in a terrific one-woman show, where she’s running through the demise of a dream marriage in something that feels like real time. If you’re not riveted by all of this, you may not even be rivet-able.\n\n\tReleased with only a few days’ warning, “West End Girl” has already prompted scores of headlines in the U.K., where Allen remains a paparazzi-attracting A-lister, and just a few less in the U.S., where she is revered by most of the pop intellgentsia but has been known to walk down the street unaccosted. It doesn’t hurt, as far as intense public curiosity goes, that she was just divorced from “Stranger Things” actor David Harbour, after five years of marriage that apparently started as a fairy-tale romance for her and ended in the devastation strewn throughout every track on the album. We say “apparently” because Allen did suggest in a British Vogue interview that there’s at least a little fiction mixed in with the blatant autobiography. But every lyrical detail is so vividly delineated — in a “she probably wouldn’t make this up” way — that, rightly or wrongly, you’re likely to walk away thinking that possibly the only thing fabricated from whole cloth is the pseudonym she came up with for the story’s principal mistress (“Madeline”).\n\t\n\n\tThe album gets off to a blithe enough start… for a couple of verses. The title track is styled initially as a kind of samba, with Allen breathlessly reeling off how she and her husband moved to a brownstone in New York: “Found ourselves a good mortgage / Billy Cotton got sorted.” (Cotton is the designer who made the couple’s new digs worthy of a much-talked-about home-tour profile in Architectural Digest in 2023.) All is bliss until Allen tells her husband in the tune that she had just landed a leading role in a London play, presumably referencing her award-nominated breakout role in “2:22 – A Ghost Story.” (She subsequently starred on the West End again this year, in “Hedda.”) “That’s when your demeanour started to change,” she sings. “You said I’d have to audition / I said, ‘You’re deranged’ / And I thought that that was quite strange.” And there, two minutes in, with 42 left to go, end the sum total of the album’s sunny moments. Halfway through this title track, the music suddenly changes, turning to a creepily underwater-sounding version of that electro-samba, as the backdrop to a phone call we hear only Allen’s side of, in which her partner delivers some unknown bad news from the other side of the pond. It’s up to the listener to imagine what’s being said on the other end of the line: Is he telling her he’s moving out for good? Or just moving to another state, or getting his own flat in town (all of which will factor in in songs that come later)? All she can think of to say back is a dumbstuck “It makes me really sad but… I’m fine, I just want you to be happy… I love you.” And with that, the dream is over. Even though the album is just getting started.\n\n\tShe saves the discovery of infidelity for track 2, “Ruminating” (and practically every track thereafter). This one is a delectable slice of hyperpop, paced to keep up with the racing thoughts that keep our heroine awake at 4 a.m.: “I’m not hateful but you make me hate her / She gets to sleep next to my medicator… / And I can’t shake the image of her naked / On top of you, and I’m disassociated.” She repeats a statement of her partner’s — “If it (casual sex) has to happen, baby, do you want to know?” —answering back, ad nauseum, “What a fucking line, line, line,” repeated endlessly in a lovely, profane, Autotune-enhanced vocal cascade.\n\t\n\n\t“Sleepwalking” brings some sweetness back to the album, but only in the ironic music, which uses the cadences of a sweet girl-group ballad from the ‘50s or early ‘60s top underscore a bitter lyric that says: “Who said romance isn’t dead? / Been no romance since we wed / ‘Why aren’t we fucking baby?’ / Yeah, that’s what you said / But you let me think it was me in my head / And nothing to do with them girls in your bed.” Allen says she’s become the madonna in her marriage when she’d eagerly play whore, if only. (Freud’s interpolation there goes uncredited.)\n\n\tIn “Tennis,” deceptively cheerful couplets that are divided up by light banging on a single piano key, she sings about how his abrupt grabbing back of his phone caused her to take a look at his texts, revealing that he’s been exchanging volleys on the court with a mystery woman, which in her mind may count as the more unforgivable infidelity: “If it was just sex, I wouldn’t be jealous / (But) you won’t play with me,” she sings — and then the music drops out for a blunt spoken-word inquiry: “And who’s Madeline?” (Soon to be drolly repeated and amended as: “Who the fuck is Madeline?”) In one of the great segues of our time, the next number is actually titled “Madeline,” and it’s there that Allen gathers the moxy to text the pseudonymous woman — and, for our listening pleasure, recites the answers that get texted back to her in an amusinglyu authentic American accent. (Whether she’s quoting real-life texts verbatim or paraphrasing for comedic effect is hard to know, but the end result is a dialogue that feels satirical and real at the same time.)\n\n\tIt’s so easy to become wrapped up in what’s actually being sung and said in “Madeline” that you might miss what’s happening musically, on first listen. The instrumental bed for this track focuses on a kind of acoustic guitar strumming that feels faintly redolent of a Marty Robbins ballad about Western gunslingers in a showdown — and yeah, that does become a bit more obvious when a couple of actual gunshot sound effects are eventually thrown into the mix.\n\n\tIt’s not the only time stylistic pastiche is employed for humor. It happens again, for instance, in “Dallas Major,” a song about Allen reentering the dating scene against her better judgment. That one brings in a light R&B groove that is meant to confer a surface sexiness, even as Allen warns a possible suitor, “I’m almost nearly 40 / I’m just shy of five-foot-two / I’m a mum to teenage children / Does that sound like fun to you?” Well, it does, kind of, but only because primary producer Blue May and his cohorts are adding bits of funk guitar, ‘70s-style keyboards and even some ‘80s-style scratching, while Allen conversely laments, over and over: “I hate it here.” If you don’t notice all these fairly subtle arrangement touchs on the first couple of listens, it’s understandable — you are busy being hit by a 2-by-4, which is to say, the accumulative effect of Allen’s jaw-dropper divulgements.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Madeline,” the “it’s complicated” part of the story really starts to take effect. There we learn the rules of the game of the marriage: It’s an open one, but Allen posits that she’s only agreeing to that to keep the embers of her former fairy-tale union alive. It’s here that she may lose some listeners who would otherwise be down to empathize with a straightforward divorce album: If you agreed to an open marriage, why are you so outraged he had sex with other women? The singer establishes there were boundaries set: “We had an arrangement / Be discreet, and don’t be blatant / There had to be payment / It had to be with strangers… [Dramatic pause.] But you’re not a stranger, Madeline.”\n\n\tThe magnitude of the extramarital exploits is stressed in an unforgettable sing-along that soon follows, “Pussy Palace.” In this one, the narrator goes to drop off medication at the West Village apartment her husband is keeping on his own, to discover a shoebox of love letters from serial lovers and a “Duane Reade bag with the handles tied / Sex toys, butt plugs, lube inside / Hundreds of Trojans, you’re so fucking broken / How’d I get caught up in your double life?” If that sounds stressful, know that the chorus is actually the kind of earworm you may spend the fall singing out loud — “I didn’t know it was your pussy palace (x4) / I always thought it was a dojo (x3) / So am I looking at a sex addict (x4)?” (It’s pretty much guaranteed, by the way, that with this album Merriam-Webster look-ups on dojo just went up 10,000%.)\n\n\tThe musical dynamics of the record are fairly spectacular. At its tenderest, there is “Just Enough,” a ballad with finger-picking guitar and orchestra that has Allen caught up in seeing herself as a hag: “Look at my reflection / I feel so drawn, so old / I booked myself a facelift / Wondering how long it might hold / I gave you all my power / How I’m seen through your eyes…” It’s one of the few songs on the album that is universal enough that many women will presumably relate — although, again, she can’t resist bringing it home to some triggering specifics when she asks aloud: “Why are we here talking about vasectomies?”\n\n\tContrast that with the wildly up-tempo tune that immediately precedes it, “Nonmonogamummy.” (Best tongue-twister of a title for a great pop song since “Femininomenon.”) In this one, Allen has reluctantly given in to keeping her side of the marriage open and is working the apps herself, in frustration. Her date for the evening is a British DJ named Specialist Moss, who raps, “I look at your eyes, you say your heart is broken,” while Allen can’t stop thinking about her husband: “I don’t want to fuck with anyone else / I know that’s all you want to do / I’m so committed that I’d lose myself / Because I don’t want to lose you.” The date goes badly, but the song goes spectacularly. An irresistible electric guitar line and an unbeatably furious beat help Allen and Blue May make “Nonmonogamummy” into what may be the most brilliant banger of the year.\n\t\n\n\tMuch respect, also, for “Relapse,” in which Allen, who is apparently about five years sober, writes about how the breakdown of her personal life and dreams is driving her to want to drink, or drug — but expresses this hunger not as some kind of slog but as a delicious piece of dubstep.\n\n\tFor an album that proceeds quite deliberately as a narrative, “West End Girl” doesn’t have a terribly definitive wrap-up. In the finale, “Fruityloop” (seemingly named for her ex’s choice of cereal, as well as the snare-drum loop that underlies the track), Allen brings the fatal attraction down to unresolved parental-neglect issues: “You’re just a little boy, looking for his mummy… / Playing with his toys, he just wants attention / He can’t really do attachment, scared he’s gonna be abandoned.” For herself, “I’m just a little girl, looking for a daddy / Thought that we could break the cycle.” If that sounds like pretty reasonable, even high-minded after all that has preceded it, rest assured that Allen is not quite done with the tough talk yet. “You’re a mess, I’m a bitch,” she proclaims. Magnanimous, sort of, but then she can’t help finally quoting the sage that was Lily Allen, circa 2008: “It’s not me, it’s you.”\n\n\tIf her deep woundedness comes as a bit of a surprise on this album, it may be because cockier older songs like “F— You” gave her the image of a tough broad, or because she already had one divorce album, 2017’s “No Shame,” in which she seemed to take a lot of responsibility for her first marriage’s failure. So among the many things that feel shocking here is just how submissive she seems to her mate’s will and wishes, up to a breaking point. The picture painted is of a wife who’s a true lovestruck romantic, and maybe even,  aspirationally, a tradwife. There’s an interesting contrast here, between the Allen who might be seen by some as a ball-buster for how candidly she’s laying out her anger for the world to see here, and the Lily who is — like a globetrotting woman before her — just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. (Even for a while after she’s learned what minefields his phone and his Duane Reade bag are.) For all of the avenging spirit that animates a good part of this album, it’s tremendously touching, when she’s not turning up the pyro. Or even when she is.\n\t\n\n\tFor now, it’s enough that we have her back with an album-of-the-year contender. (Extra kudos to Blue May, who is not really a famous name among producers yet, but is probably about to become one, based on this.) But is this the beginning of a renaissance — a Lily-sance? — after she spent eight years off the recording scene? It’s not as if whole generations of women haven’t followed in the footsteps she set down more than 20 years ago, yet it still feels like we need her now more than ever. \n\n\tAllen has said she was indeed recording prolifically in the lead-up to the domestic drama detailed here, but not releasing those tracks because she felt she was writing too impersonally, putting down her thoughts about the internet and stuff like that. You’d hate to think it would take this much trauma for her to follow up with another great album. (Here’s betting those unreleased songs about the worldwide web are not as bad as she thinks they are, right?) Anyway, we are just a world, standing in front of a girl, asking her to make more records.\n",

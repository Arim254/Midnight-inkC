    "body": "\n\t“Heartbeats,” the bestselling memoir of tennis legend Björn Borg, is set for a stylish adaptation with popular Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund on board to direct. \n\n\tBanijay Entertainment labels Jarowskij/Yellow Bird and Mastiff Sweden are co-developing the scripted project with Åkerlund, who’s best known for his groundbreaking music videos for Madonna, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and The Rolling Stones, as well as films such as “Polar,” “Spun,” “Lord of Chaos” and the Netflix series “Clark.”\n\t\n\n\tCurrently in development, the screen adaptation will chart Borg’s meteoric rise to tennis stardom, including his unprecedented five consecutive Wimbledon titles, and his shocking decision to retire at just 26 years old. Published by Norstedts under its original title, Hjärtslag, the memoir delves into Borg’s life beyond the tennis court, starting from his childhood and shedding light on years of financial collapse, media scrutiny and ultimately, his personal reinvention.\n\n\n\t“I’ve spent my entire life in matches – both on and off the court,” Borg said. “Jonas wants to explore both sides, and I feel the time is right for that. He has the eye, the energy, and the courage to tell my story in his own way,” he continued. \n\n\tÅkerlund, meanwhile, said, “Everyone knows Björn Borg for his legendary moments on the court, for his fierce, unparalleled power as an athlete and icon.” \n\n\t“With his book, we finally dipped a toe into his enigmatic mind. But with this project, we’re canon-balling into the deep end,” Åkerlund continued. \n\n\tThe ambitious project reflects Banijay Entertainment’s growing expansion in sport storytelling, following the launch of Banijay Sports. \n\t\n\n\tMattias Olsson, Mastiff Sweden’s head of creative, and Elin Kvist, Jarowskij/Yellow Bird’s CEO, said “We are incredibly proud to have been entrusted with this unique story, about one of the greatest sports heroes of all time, Björn Borg,” they said in a statement. “There’s only one person who can tell it, and that’s the cultural force of Jonas Åkerlund. This is going to be a memorable biopic that must be seen.”\n\n\tBorg was previously the subject of a 2017 film by Janus Metz which explored his rivalry with John McEnroe. Borg was played by Sverrir Gudnason while McEnroe was played by Shia LaBeouf.\n\n\tMastiff Sweden’s roster of ambitious formats includes the recently announced TV4 culinary showdown “100 Knives,” co-developed with Banijay Americas label Bunim/Murray Productions, as well as a long running local version of “Survivor,” and “Love is Blind Sweden,” serving as the production partner for multiple Netflix adaptations.\n\n\tJarowskij/Yellow Bird, meanwhile, has delivered hit scripted productions like “Diary of a Ditched Girl,” “A Nearly Normal Family,” “Millennium,” The Restaurant, and is working on the reboot of “Wallander.”\n\n\tBanijay Entertainment is home to over 60 labels, producing more than 110 titles annually, including “House of Guinness,” “Half Man” and the “Culpa” trilogy. The Nordic slate includes“Fallen,” “My Brother,” “Billionaire’s Island,” “Still Breathing,” “Supporting Actor” and “Murderin Hanko.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tI’ve never been wild about the term “faith-based movie” — or, at least, the idea that it should only be applied to PG-rated calamity-meets-redemption Sunday-school soap operas micro-targeted to Evangelicals. “Song Sung Blue,” in almost every way, is a faith-based movie, though this one is rooted in the holly holy dream of devotion to the church of Neil Diamond. It’s based on the true story of Mike and Claire Sarina (played by Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson), who in the late ’80s and ’90s formed a Neil Diamond tribute band, performing as Lightning & Thunder (he’s Lightning, she’s Thunder). At first, the movie may strike you as a parable of more kitsch than faith.\n\t\n\n\tThe two meet at a performance at a scuzzy casino in their hometown of Milwaukee, where assorted semi-amateurs get up to impersonate dead legends like Elvis and Buddy Holly. She’s dressed as Patsy Cline and does a pretty good rendition of “After Midnight.” He’s supposed to go on as Don Ho and sing the 1966 novelty hit “Tiny Bubbles,” but he’s so tired of singing it that he quits on the spot. As we learn pretty quickly, Mike and Claire are both broken-down middle-aged Middle Americans toting around a private load of sorrow.\n\n\n\tEach is divorced with kids. He’s a Vietnam veteran and 20-years-sober alcoholic who works odd jobs as a mechanic and plays in just about any band that will have him. She’s a hairdresser and struggling single mother who isn’t so much thriving as surviving. Together, they hatch an idea: What it they formed a band and sang Neil Diamond songs, not just doing the same old wax-museum versions of old rock stars but tapping into what the people really want?\n\t\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” was written and directed by Craig Brewer, who has made one amazing movie (“Hustle & Flow”), one good one (“Dolemite Is My Name”), and a few middling ones (“Footloose,” “Coming 2 America”), and the first thing you notice about the film, which Brewer based on a 2009 documentary of the same title, is how unironically it celebrates Karaoke Culture. By that, I don’t just mean what transpires in karaoke bars (though the movie has a number of scenes set in them). I’m talking about the impulse that started in karaoke and carried over to “American Idol” and to something larger: the whole religious dream about pop music that someone who was a nobody could stand up and sing a song made famous by a somebody, and if they did it with enough skill and passion they could channel what was great about that star in a way that turned the very act of channeling into its own sublime expression. Brewer navigates this terrain like a jukebox Jonathan Demme.\n\n\tMike worships Neil Diamond, to the point that when he sings, he’s no mere impersonator — he’s closer to a Neil Diamond avatar, coaxing out and dramatizing Diamond’s essence. Hugh Jackman is, of course, a marvelous singer in his own right, and while the film makes the point that Mike isn’t trying to sound exactly like his idol, in “Song Sung Blue” Jackman’s musical performances are transcendent in their ability to signify what we love about Neil Diamond: the low command of his voice, the smooth articulation, the crackling rosiness of it all.\n\n\tWe might look at Mike, in his overcoat of blue glitter, with his long hair cut and styled into a neatly parted Diamond pageboy, and Claire, in her spangled red dress with the gold piping, providing her cascading harmonies, and assume, for a moment, that the movie wants us to see them as some played-straight version of the Culps on “SNL.” But there’s nothing jokey or tacky about their presence, and the actors’ performances do nothing so much as bring the love.\n\n\tJackman, with his scuffed fortitude, and Hudson, radiating a stubborn wholesomeness, have an easy-listening camaraderie, to the point that when Mike and Claire fall in love and get married, it feels both casual and inevitable. With a booker (Jim Belushi) who has casino connections all over the Midwest, they start to work the circuit and develop a following. Their ascent becomes complete when they’re in their living room and Mike gets a call from Eddie Vedder, who he’s never heard of (he wonders if Pearl Jam is a fruit preserve). It’s the early ’90s, and grunge hipsters have embraced the pop legends of their youth. When Lightning & Thunder end up opening for Pearl Jam in Milwaukee, and Eddie comes out onstage to sing along with them, they’ve basically just gone to karaoke heaven.\n\t\n\n\tThe adversity comes out of nowhere. Literally, as in a bad dream. Claire is standing on her front lawn, and suddenly…a life upended, a body and soul severed, a reality redefined. This is where “Song Sung Blue” flirts, and not so lightly, with becoming that other kind of faith-based movie. I raise the issue because I actually think it has demographic meaning; this is the rare film that feels like it could exert a blue-state-meets-red-state appeal. Or, given how over a certain age Neil Diamond’s nostalgic fan base is, the whole thing could wind up slipping between the cracks. After the calamity occurs, the movie, for a while, loses its pace. Yet Hudson’s anguished performance holds it together. This is let-it-rip acting with the fussiness burned off. And Hudson and Jackman don’t just have chemistry; they have an emotional synergy that grows more moving as Mike and Claire bond together — and fuse, once again, with the power of Neil — to heal themselves.\n\n\tMike has physical problems of his own (he keeps having what look like mini-heart attacks, which he ignores since he’s too poor to have health insurance), and on the day of their big reunion show, which is supposed to end with them meeting Neil Diamond at an ice-cream stand, Mike tries to heal a gaping head wound with nail glue. You know he’s in for a hot August night.\n\n\tAs the movie recognizes, there are two kinds of Neil Diamond fans: those who, like Mike, hear the beautiful depths in dozens of his songs (“Cherry, Cherry,” “Brother Love’s Travelling Salvation Show,” “Cracklin’ Rosie”), and the bom bom bom people — the ones Mike can’t stand, who at a Neil Diamond concert experience an epiphany when they pump their fists in the air and sing-shout “bom! bom! bom!” in the middle of the chorus of “Sweet Caroline,” even though it’s not even a lyric. They’re singing along with the trumpet. These are the people who have to enhance the line “Good times never seemed so good!” (“So good! So good! So good!”) until it becomes an existential declaration of the miracle of life.\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” is certainly a movie for the bom bom bom crowd. Mostly, though, it’s for the Neil Diamond fans who will listen to Mike and Claire, in their solo show at the Ritz Theater in Milwaukee, in a state of slow-burn bliss. When Mike starts to sing the Arabic chant of “Soolaimon,” Diamond’s single from 1970, it sounds eerie and mysterious, but when the groove kicks in it’s so ecstatic you want to revel in its majesty, the same way Mike does: as a Diamond shining through the darkness.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Sheridan is poised to make NBCUniversal his TV and film production home under a lucrative long-term deal starting in three years after he will have spent a decade with Paramount Television.\n\n\tSheridan has emerged as a prolific series creator and busy showrunner who has delivered a string of series for Paramount and its platforms: “Yellowstone” and its spinoffs, as well as “Tulsa King,” “Lioness,” “Landman” and “Mayor of Kingstown,” among others.\n\t\n\n\tNews that Sheridan is closing a megabucks deal with NBCUniversal, as courted by entertainment chief Donna Langley, was first reported Sunday by Puck. NBCUniversal declined comment as did Paramount. It’s believed that the film component of the deal will take effect next year. The television component will follow after Sheridan’s contractual obligations to Paramount are fulfilled in 2028.\n\n\n\tIt was no secret that Sheridan’s representatives at CAA were testing the waters for a new overall deal arrangement for the producer. Sheridan has blazed his own trail in the streaming era, with a fast-paced production process that he steers with a strong hand. He’s even invested in two ranches in Texas for filming locations and other production assets that are used in his shows. \n\n\tSheridan found a niche at Paramount Television with the success of the “Dallas”-esque Western soap “Yellowstone.” That show debuted as a linear series on the Paramount Network cabler in 2018. Most of the Sheridan canon is in the streaming realm, where the series protocols are a fit with his auteur-ish working habits. Sheridan does have a high-profile “Yellowstone”-adjacent drama series poised to bow on CBS next spring, “Y: Marshals.”\n\t\n\n\tParamount has undergone massive transformation since August when the studio was acquired by David Ellison’s Skydance Media. The core team of executives that helped shepherd Sheridan’s rise have mostly exited the company.\n\n\tSheridan and Paramount have a long runway ahead on the bank of TV shows that he has amassed, with many more in the hopper for 2026 and beyond.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the China box office over Oct. 24–26, “Row to Win” stayed in first place for a second straight weekend with RMB27.6 million ($3.9 million), according to consultancy Artisan Gateway. \n\n\tThe PMF Pictures release has now earned $51.4 million since its late-September release. The comedy-drama directed by Ma Lin and starring Huang Bo, Fan Chengcheng, Yin Tao and Li Jiaqi, follows a coastal-town family – led by a once-tough patriarch – who rally together in hard times and push for a comeback. \n\t\n\n\tJapanese animated feature “Colorful Stage! The Movie,” released by Shochiku, debuted in second place with $2.8 million. Based on the rhythm-game franchise “Project Sekai,” the film follows a group of virtual singers and their human collaborators as they navigate creativity, friendship and performance anxiety across multiple digital worlds.\n\n\n\tIn third, China Film Group’s “The Volunteers: Peace at Last” collected $2.3 million to bring its cumulative total to $84.6 million.  The film, which commemorates the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army entering the Korean War, stars Wu Jing and Zhang Ziyi and marks the third chapter in Chen Kaige’s “The Volunteers” trilogy.\n\n\tWarner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” placed fourth with $1.6 million for a cume of $5.3 million.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, Huace Pictures’ “A Writer’s Odyssey 2” added $1.3 million, lifting its total to $52.4 million. The sequel to Lu Yang’s 2021 fantasy action hit continues the meta-narrative of intertwining fiction and reality, with Lei Jiayin reprising his role alongside Dong Zijian and Yang Mi. \n\t\n\n\tWeekend box office totaled a sluggish $19.4 million, bringing China’s 2025 year-to-date gross to $6.262 billion, up 17.1% from the same period last year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian National Film Award-winning actor Parvathy Thiruvothu is set to spearhead Don Palathara‘s next directorial venture, co-starring the acclaimed filmmaker-actor Dileesh Pothan. \n\n\tThiruvothu, whose performance in “Take Off” (2017) earned her a National Film Award and best actor at the International Film Festival of India, brings a stellar track record to the project. The actor has delivered acclaimed performances in films including “Bangalore Days” (2014), “Ennu Ninte Moideen” (2015), “Charlie” (2015), “Uyare” (2019) and “Virus” (2019). She made her Bollywood debut opposite Irrfan Khan in “Qarib Qarib Singlle” (2017) and is also a founding member of the Women in Cinema Collective.\n\t\n\n\tThe project marks Thiruvothu’s first collaboration with both Palathara and Pothan, two of the most respected creative voices in Malayalam-language cinema – India’s flagship film industry in terms of innovative content – today. Though details about the storyline are currently under wraps, the film is touted to be an emotionally power-packed drama that will be shot extensively across the southern Indian state of Kerala and is set to commence principal photography imminently.\n\n\n\t“Don Palathara’s movies hold up a mirror to how we live and love, often without judgment or noise. To step into that kind of world as an actor is very liberating,” Thiruvothu said. “His films have a powerfully meditative quality. He invites us to actively engage in reflecting on how we live. As an actor, I find that kind of space exhilarating because it demands that you unlearn performance and simply be. This is also incredibly challenging.”\n\t\n\n\tThe actor added: “Working with him has been on my wishlist for a while and I’m thrilled that this project came my way. And to share the screen with Dileesh, someone whose creative sensitivity I’ve admired for years, feels like an opportunity to be a student again.”\n\n\tPalathara’s cinema is known for its subtle emotional layers and exploration of human relationships. His previous work includes “Family,” which had its world premiere at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2023, as well as “Everything Is Cinema” (2021), “Joyful Mystery” (2021), “1956, Central Travancore” (2019), “Vith” (2017) and debut feature “Shavam” (2015). His films often tackle complex social realities with a meditative approach that eschews judgment.\n\n\tPothan, meanwhile, stands as one of Malayalam cinema’s most formidable forces. As a director, his debut “Maheshinte Prathikaaram” (2016) won the best feature film in Malayalam Award at the National Film Awards, as did his follow-up “Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum” (2017). Both films, starring Fahadh Faasil, set new benchmarks for storytelling in Malayalam cinema. As an actor, Pothan is praised for his restrained yet impactful screen presence across more than 60 films.\n\n\tThiruvothu is also in “Storm,” Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan’s debut production for Prime Video. The high-stakes thriller series, created and directed by Ajitpal Singh (“Tabbar,” “Fire in the Mountains”), features an ensemble cast of strong women protagonists and is produced by Roshan’s HRX Films. Production on “Storm” is scheduled to begin imminently.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are performances that remind us of what we already know, and then there are performances that shatter our assumptions entirely, forcing us to reckon with a talent we’d somehow managed to underestimate. \n\n\tKate Hudson’s turn as Claire Sardinia aka “Thunder” in Craig Brewer’s “Song Sung Blue” belongs emphatically in the latter category. It’s a revelatory piece of acting that announces itself, just like the full-throated power of a Neil Diamond chorus — an impossibly tender and ferocious piece that feels evidently alive.\n\t\n\n\tHaving its world premiere at the AFI Film Festival on Sunday, something palpable could be in the air. There’s a collective realization that we might be witnessing the beginning moments of a viable Oscar contender. Hudson channels the raw vulnerability of Reese Witherspoon walking the line in Johnny Cash’s shadow, the physical transformation of Hilary Swank becoming a boxer, the lived-in authenticity of Frances McDormand navigating Fargo’s frozen moral landscape and the star-wattage commitment of Renée Zellweger becoming Roxie Hart. Oh, and with a sprinkle of Lady Gaga’s Ally realizing that she is, in fact, a star that is born. It is, without qualification, the finest work of her career.\n\n\n\tFocus Features’ Christmas Day release tells the true story of two struggling musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band — a premise that, in lesser hands, might read as quirky at best. But Brewer, the Memphis-born filmmaker who gave us the Oscar-winning “Hustle & Flow” and launched Da’Vine Joy Randolph’s trajectory toward her “Holdovers” statuette with “Dolemite Is My Name,” understands something essential about American dreamers on the margins. He knows that dignity lives in the details and that redemption often wears sequins.\n\t\n\n\tWhat makes Hudson’s performance so potent is its refusal to condescend. She’s playing a woman navigating her dreams, only for them to be upended by unexpected tragedy. The Academy has long recognized portrayals of people facing adversity and disabilities — Eddie Redmayne’s Stephen Hawking, Julianne Moore’s Dr. Alice Howland, Daniel Day-Lewis’s Christy Brown — but too often these performances, however skilled, can feel like theatrical exercises. Hudson does something rarer: there’s no distance between actress and character, no visible seams in the construction. It’s the kind of organic inhabitation that makes you forget you’re watching capital-A Acting at all.\n\n\tThe Academy’s love for musicians is well-documented — from “Walk the Line” to “Ray” to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Their response to stories of disability with particular recognition is equally clear. But “Song Sung Blue” synthesizes these elements into something genuinely crowd-pleasing — the kind of film that can resonate with the Academy’s broader, older demographic while still feeling vital and contemporary. This is the sweet spot where artistry meets accessibility.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Focus Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHudson’s submission through the Golden Globes’ comedy/musical category is strategically sound. That race has become Oscar’s unofficial launchpad in the past few years, propelling Emma Stone (“Poor Things”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) to the big prize. Even when the Globe goes in a different direction, as it did with Demi Moore over eventual Oscar winner Mikey Madison last year, the nom itself provides crucial visibility. Though the material is hardly “comedic,” the flexibility of the Globes’ genre categories gives Hudson an edge, and could create a tight race between her and expected competition Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked: For Good”) and Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”).\n\n\tIt has been 25 years since Hudson earned a supporting actress nod as the golden-haired Penny Lane for “Almost Famous,” a role that should have heralded a career of such moments. Instead, it led to a decade-plus of romantic comedies that, while financially successful, never quite demanded we take her “seriously” as an actress (Though those paying attention saw glimpses — her work in “Nine” and her scene-stealing turn in “Glass Onion” hinted at deeper reserves). Should she land this nom, Hudson would join the rarefied company of actors with fairly long gaps between Oscar nods: Julie Christie, Sally Field, Angela Bassett — a pantheon of women whose talent the industry periodically forgot, then remembered again.\n\t\n\n\tWith Brewer as the architect of this showcase, it actually matters to the overall narrative. A white director who has spent his career as a genuine ally — not the performative kind, but one who learned at the feet of the late, great John Singleton. It was Singleton who saw something essential in Brewer’s Memphis-set debut and helped him secure financing for “Hustle & Flow.” Singleton, who became the first Black director nominated for an Oscar with “Boyz n the Hood,” recognized in Brewer a collaborator who understood that authentic representation isn’t about who tells the story, but how — with care and specificity.\n\n\tBrewer’s subsequent work — helming 11 episodes of “Empire,” launching the careers of Black performers and consistently choosing projects that center marginalized voices — represents the kind of Hollywood allyship that actually moves the needle. His work speaks louder than any press release or studio statement.\n\n\tWhether Brewer himself lands a nom remains uncertain in an overstuffed director’s race, though his adapted screenplay could find traction in a category that has historically embraced populist choices (i.e., “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Logan”). My initial assessment is that this isn’t a “critical darling” but I’ll always remind you of the No. 1 rule in predicting the Oscars: critics aren’t voters.\n\n\tNotably, if Focus Features manages to land nominations for Hudson alongside her fellow studio counterparts — Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) and Emma Stone (“Bugonia”) — they’ll achieve something not seen since Miramax’s astonishing 2002 trifecta of Salma Hayek, Renée Zellweger and eventual winner Nicole Kidman.\n\n\tWhile Hudson may be the centerpiece, “Song Sung Blue” is also helped by the ensemble that surrounds her. Hugh Jackman, an Oscar nominee for “Les Misérables,” delivers a bold and affecting performance. As a washed-up musician clinging to faded dreams and fractured pride, Jackman dials down the showmanship and taps into his signature vulnerability. \n\n\tThe supporting cast also shines, most notably Jim Belushi, who continues his recent critical renaissance with another standout turn following his standout role in Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut “The Chronology of Water.” And then there’s the young Ella Anderson, recently named one of Variety’s 10 Actors to Watch for 2025, who brings startling depth and emotional clarity to her role as Rachel, Claire’s daughter. It’s a breakout performance that suggests a significant career ahead.\n\t\n\n\tAs “Song Sung Blue” prepares for its Dec. 25 release, the greatest gift we’re receiving this year is the reminder that after all these years, Hudson still very much has it. The Oscars could think so, too.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn 1878, the age of the samurai has ended. Swords are banned, the class system has crumbled, and Japan’s warriors have become relics of a vanished era. Into this world steps “Last Samurai Standing,” Netflix Japan’s most ambitious historical series to date — a sweeping survival epic where 292 former samurai are drawn into a lethal contest for a JPY100 billion prize and the chance to reclaim their honor.\n\n\tLeading the project is Okada Junichi, who serves as star, producer and action choreographer. “It was extremely difficult,” he tells Variety. “As an actor, you should be selfish. As a producer, you think about budgets and logistics — it uses a completely different part of your brain. But when I read this script, I knew right away: this is the one.”\n\t\n\n\tOkada’s character, Shujiro Saga, is a once-feared assassin who joins the brutal tournament known as Kodoku to save his ailing wife and child. The story opens at Kyoto’s Tenryu-ji Temple, where 292 participants gather for the first battle — a vast, night-long melee staged without digital enhancement. “Every person on that battlefield was a cast member or part of the action team,” Okada says. “We filmed through the night for days — it was exhausting but unforgettable.”\n\n\n\tAdapted from Naoki Prize-winning author Imamura Shogo’s novel “Ikusagami,” the series reunites Okada with director Fujii Michihito after their collaboration on “Hard Days.” Fujii, known for his Japan Academy Prize-winning “Shoutai (Faceless),” brings grounded realism and emotional intensity to the large-scale action. “We believed that by infusing the story and action with the spirit and aesthetics unique to us as Japanese, we could resonate with viewers around the world,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tThe show arrives at a time when global audiences are embracing ambitious Asian epics such as “Shogun” and “Squid Game.” While Netflix Japan content head Sakamoto Kaata invoked those titles when unveiling the slate, Okada stresses that this project stands on its own. “I like both shows, and we’re pleased to be compared with such successful works,” he says. “But what’s overwhelmingly different this time is that what we’re making is an action drama set against the backdrop of Japanese period storytelling.”\n\n\tFujii sees the Meiji-era collapse of the samurai as a metaphor for identity in transition. “Tradition survives through innovation,” he explains. “Our generation wanted to reinterpret the legacy of period drama with respect, but also with the energy to say, this is cool.” Okada adds, “I’ve always wondered why period dramas ended up as something only older generations watch. Over time, they became more about tradition than entertainment. Finding a human story that connects past and present was the real challenge.”\n\n\tProduction designer Miyamori Yui introduced a recurring leaf-vein motif symbolizing fate and fragility, appearing throughout the series from ceremonial backdrops to costume textures. The ensemble cast includes Ito Hideaki, Ninomiya Kazunari, Yoshioka Riho, Kiyohara Kaya and rising newcomer Fujisaki Yumia. Acclaimed actor Hiroshi Abe (“Trick,” “I Wish,” “Godzilla 2000: Millennium”) joins the lineup as Gentosai Okabe — a towering, enigmatic figure with long white hair and an unsettling presence. Feared as a “monster” by other participants, Okabe disrupts the game’s fragile balance even further.\n\n\tShot on an unprecedented scale for a Japanese series, “Last Samurai Standing” combines visceral sword-fighting realism with emotional storytelling. As Okada reflects: “When my character finally broke through Tenryu-ji, I felt that our long journey — both in the story and as filmmakers — had just begun.”\n\n\t“Last Samurai Standing” premieres worldwide on Netflix on Nov. 13.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat does it say that a Warren Zevon tribute concert Friday night featured more than 30 songs, was performed by well over 50 musicians, and stretched nearly to four hours in the end … and still felt skimpy? It says that some of us are just a little too greedy, 22 years after the honoree’s death, to hear as many of the rock genius’s greatest songs performed as possible, even if that really would entail playing it all night long. Given that no one involved could really wait till they’re dead to sleep, anyway, the Wild Honey organization put on the most complete tribute imaginable, squeezing a catalog full of wicked humor and warmth for all the tearjerking and titter-prompting it was worth.\n\t\n\n\tThe Wild Honey Foundation typically puts on one of these tribute shows a year to benefit autism causes, and usually, apart from the honored artist himself (if he’s alive and kicking), it’s a one-song-per-frontman affair. Things were just a little different Friday at the United Theater in downtown L.A. (the first time one of these shows has taken place in that movie palace, after a long run at the smaller Alex in Glendale). A handful of family members or associates got to play a few more numbers each than the standard one-and-done, including Jackson Browne, who produced Zevon’s first two albums and has remained an enthusiastic champion ever since; Jorge Calderón, who collaborated as a writer and/or performer on all of Zevon’s albums except one; and Jordan Zevon, his son. Although he never met Zevon, Shooter Jennings also got the special privilege of playing two songs instead of just one, and he’d earned it: the guy has done repeated Zevon tribute concerts on his own and even released a live album of Zevon covers. \n\t\n\n\tApart from these artists with obviously deep connections, the lineup was led by Dwight Yoakam, who did a highly regarded cover of “Carmelita” back in the early ’90s (in collaboration at the time with Flaco Jimenez), and such artists as Steve Wynn, the semi-reunited Fountains of Wayne, Chris Stills, John Wesley Harding, Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie and other guest from the east coast as well as Warren’s favored west.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDwight Yoakam at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt was “Jordan Strikes Up the Band” as the son rose to kick off the long evening with a vocally familiar-sounding rendition of the “Johnny” song that started off “Excitable Boy,” the 1978 album that was Dad’s commercial peak. Soon following was a singer with another connection to Zevon Sr., Matt Carsonis, who played with the honoree on the final dates he did in 2002, just prior to learning he had only months to live; his contribution was to dip into the all-too-truncated 21st century portion of Zevon’s with “Dirty Life and Times.” (Carsonis is involved in the forthcoming release of a live album that will present Zevon’s final concert on disc for the first time, for Record Store Day Black Friday .)\n\n\t“Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner,” possibly Zevon’s most violent song, as a Sam Peckinpah/Ichabod Crane hybrid, was a ladies’ choice selection, with Living Sisters Inara George and Eleni Mandell cheerfully facing each other down as they sang “…talkin’ about the man.” The rural-dystopia number “Play It All Night Long,” meanwhile, had Dream Syndicator Steve Wynn reprising the song of Zevon’s that invokes the most bodily fluids… besides blood. (But also blood.) “Anybody who could write ‘Little old lady got mutilated late last night’…,” praised Wynn. “But I’m not doing that one. I decided to do the song where he says brucellosis.”\n\n\tThe most obscure songs of the night came midway through the first act, with two selections recorded and/or written by Zevon in the 1960s, roughly a decade before his solo career as a major-label artist took off. (For a few rocking minutes, the audience could well have been back at the “Nuggets” show Wild Honey put on in 2023.) First up in that extremely retro vein were Steve Stanley and Kristi Callan, covering “Follow Me,” a folk-psych-rock song Zevon cut as a member of the high-school duo Lyme & Cybelle. It hit No. 65 on the Hot 100 in 1966. Who knew? Well, probably a sizable portion of the cult. Then followed “Outside Chance,” a number Zevon co-wrote for his labelmates the Turtles that same year, described by the evening’s host, Chris Morris, as “a Byrds-style ripper.” This one was done by the Smithereens’ Dennis Diken, with support from Scott McCaughey and, on guitar, the Beach Boys’ David Marks. While you couldn’t exactly say that Zevon’s writing style was fully in bloom by 1966, there was an early foreshadowing of his wit, as Diken bellowed: “You don’t stand an outside chance… BUT YOU CAN TRY!”\n\t\n\n\tLow Cut Connie mainstay Adam Weiner proved a great choice for the tribute, as one of the few frontmen in rock after Zevon whose main instrument is an enthusiastically pounded piano. “I call him the piano fighter… I’ll be singing the truth right now,” Weiner promised, launching into a latter-day Zevon favorite, the short, not-so-sweet “My Shit’s Fucked Up.”\n\n\tFountains of Wayne, recently relaunched by Chris Collingwood, and augmented here by both perennial members and ringers, got the keys to Zevon’s most covered tune, “Poor Poor Pitiful Me.” (The appearance was all too short for those of us who have clamored to see this summer’s very short reunion tour extend to the west coast; no sign of that yet, so let’s hope this was not the last local performance under the FoW name.) \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJordan Summers and Jorge Calderon perform at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tZevon creative BFF Jorge Calderón followed, saying, “As you may well know, me and Warren were very close friends for a long time and partners in many a crime, and the best crimes were our song collaborations” — going into the first three of four co-writes with Zevon he would do during the evening. He told a similar story about co-authoring the Woodrow Wilson-era anti-imperialist lament “Veracruz” as he told to Variety earlier in the week (check out that concert preview story here). Calderón has said the best attribute he and Zevon shared as writers was a penchant for as much economy in lyrics as possible., Yet the exception to that was the late-period “Mr. Bad Example,” which in a fit of hysteria in their writing den (seated together on the “Couch of Pain”) ultimately resulted for once in as many verses possible, all of them, by Calderón’s own account, “ridiculous.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShooter Jennings performs at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOPYRIGHT         STEVO ROOD\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShooter Jennings knows how to do roughhouse rock — as well as being, like Weiner, another piano man — and he was just the man for the gleeful psychosis of “Excitable Boy” and the no-sleep-till-Valhalla anthem “I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead.” He was followed by the closer for Act 1, Yoakam, tipping his hat to “Carmelita” with a reprise of his Cali-Tex-Mex cover, and ensuring that heroin abuse never sounded any more winsome (or Pioneer Chicken any sweeter, for that matter).\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJackson Browne performs at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAct 2 began with Browne’s first of two appearances, singing the unduly prophetic “Don’t Let Us Get Sick,” Zevon’s moving prayer to a possibly unhearing deity for health of every physical and mental kind. The ensemble’s substantial string section handled the potentially rough segue from that to the rowdier next song with one of three “Interludes” they played over the course of the night, lifted from the appearances of interstitial orchestration on the “Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School” album. And then came the jammiest number of the program, “Nighttime in the Switching Yard,” a funk-rock exercise that allowed plenty of room for Chris Stills to not just sing but play guitar hero.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBilly Valentine performs at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs a personal aside, I’d spent the entire show thus far worried about who the Wild Honey gods would deem worthy of handling “Accidentally Like a Martyr,” the “Excitable Boy” ballad that is my favorite piece out of the entire Zevon oeuvre, and, if you’ll indulge just a little possible exaggeration, maybe the saddest song ever written. (Suffice it to say that this song, a recent breakup or loss and razor blades should not be allowed within 50 yards of one another.) My anxiety could not have been more unfounded. It went to Billy Valentine, who performed with a sibling as the Valentine Brothers in the late ’70s and ’80s, and who has enjoyed a recent renaissance with fresh solo material. He nailed “Martyr” with a full soul vocal that some attendees may remember for the rest of their lives. Music directors Jordan Summers and Nick Vincent did a classic song that passes too quickly on record a great service by extending it by a few choruses, giving Valentine a chance to wring the emotion out of it that was only inherent in Zevon’s necessarily simpler delivery. They also handing him a key change that was not on the record to turn it into a true power ballad. (Turning the piano part between verses into an orchestral part also ramped up the drama.) Over the course of four hours, the full house at the United was pacing itself by pretty much enjoying the show from the comfort of the seats… but for Valentine’s act of generosity, everyone was on their feet. Not-so-accidentally like a show-stopper, etc.\n\t\n\n\t“Somebody had to follow Billy Valentine,” said Phil Cody, who was up next with what at least counted as another sad one, “Splendid Isolation.” “I guess the way to counter that,” he said, “is ‘We’ll bring the hillbilly stoner.'” Part of his way of taking it yokel — besides bringing in Foo Fighter Rami Jaffee  on accordion and Willie Aron blowing harmonica — was to add a previously unheard yodel to the chorus. (Although Zevon himself was not above a yodel; see “The Hula Hula Boys,” the number I was sorriest to see not make the setlist, with the possible exception of “Hasten Down the Wind.”)\n\n\tSusan Cowsill was introduced by Morris as someone who could rival Linda Ronstadt, and in fact it turned out that she released a cover of “Mohammed’s Radio” in 1976, more than two years before Ronstadt famously did it, although no one is holding Linda’s tardiness there against her. Just shy of 50 years later, she was still up to it. McCaughey, rather than Browne, took the rare Zevon/Browne co-write “Tenderness on the Block,” a reminder that Zevon could be a sentimental fool before he was exploring sentimental hygiene.\n\n\tThe most curious departure of the night — and a rewarding one — came when Jordan Zevon introduced an odd hybrid version of “Monkey Wash, Donkey Rinse” by suggesting that he was going to finally right a sort of sin committed by his father. He spoke about how he encouraged his dad to employ more organic-sounding arrangements later in his career, when the legend was favoring rough electronics in the late ’80s and ’90s, not to everyone’s enjoyment. “I used to kind of complain that they were almost demo-sounding, with lots of synthesizers, which ’70s kids, myself and Jordan Summers, rejected. … I tell ‘Dad, ‘You know, I got friends that would die to play with you.’ ‘You know, Johnny, I can’t afford a band.’ ‘Afford? They’ll play with you (for free!)’ ‘Johnny, maybe we should move on.’ I’m sure it was because he was his kid. He didn’t trust — he’d seen Jordan and I play at Madame Wong’s when we were 16, and we were not awful, but giving it our best…”\n\n\tBut now, stretching hands across the grave, Jordan was determined to have his pals pick up acoustic instruments — including fiddle and washboard — and give one of his synth-y songs from 1995’s “Mutineer” an organic arrangement at last. “We’re gonna do a little posthumous ‘I told you so.’ And hopefully in the afterlife, I’ll be all right,” Jordan quipped, before the band launched into a nearly zydeco-sounding rendition of “Monkey Wash, Donkey Rinse” — with Warren’s own lead vocal piped in over it on the PA. It was a bold move, but a jubilant one, and lightning did not strike the United Theater.\n\t\n\n\tThat, frankly, could have served as the sentimental finale of the night, but there was more to come in the 11:00 hour from two returning performers. Browne sang the irreverent but pointed “Life’ll Kill Ya” and what many aficionados consider to be Zevon’s true signature song, “Desperados Under the Eaves.” The orchestra was at full blast and the full vocal chorus was wailing “Look away, down Gower Avenue,” as if this were L.A.’s own “Dixie,” which of course it is.\n\n\tThat could have been the finale, but among soloists, at least, that slot was reserved for Calderón, who closed out the pre-group-sing portion of the show with Zevon’s biggest weeper, “Keep Me in Your Heart.” Calderón again told the story of his close and thorough collaboration with the legend on his final album, “The Wind,” which they actually started and finished right after Zevon’s diagnosis that he had only a few months to go — he actually made it for a year — and how the process of record-making, in his view, gave Zevon a little extra time on earth. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom there, there was only one place to go: up, and to the drawing of blood. The full cast assembled for “Werewolves of London” and “Lawyers, Guns and Money,” with ongoing Wild Honey founders Paul Rock, David Jenkins, Michael Ackerman and Andrew Sandoval able to join in amid what seemed more like a cast of hundreds than mere dozens.\n\n\tAfter this, Zevon’s actual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction down the street in a couple of weeks may seem anticlimactic to anyone who was at the United for the more epic experience. With any luck, the short tribute the starry cast is able to squeeze into that long Hall of Fame program will do him and his most famous songs justice, even if it inevitably can’t offer the same gratifying sense of how fucked up his shit was.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJordan Summers, Jordan Zevon and Jackson Browne perform at ‘Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStevo Rood aroodphoto.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSetlist for “Warren Zevon: Join Me in L.A.” concert at the United Theater, Oct. 24, 2025:\n\n\tSet 1Johnny Strikes Up the Band — Jordan ZevonJoin Me in L.A. — All Day SuckerDirty Life and Times — Matt CarsonisReconsider Me — John Wesley Harding (with Nelson Bragg)Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner — Inara George and Eleni Mandell(Interlude 1 — strings)Play It All Night Long — Steve WynnMutineer — Leslie MendelsonFollow Me — Steve Stanley and Kristi CallanOutside Chance — Dennis Diken (with Scott McCaughey and David Marks)My Shit’s Fucked Up — Adam WeinerPoor Poor Pitiful Me — Fountains of WayneVeracruz — Jorge CalderónMr. Bad Example — Jorge CalderónDisorder in the House — Jorge CalderónExcitable Boy — Shooter JenningsI’ll Sleep When I’m Dead — Shooter JenningsCarmelita — Dwight Yoakam\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tSet 2Don’t Let Us Get Sick — Jackson Browne(Interlude 3 — strings)Nighttime in the Switching Yard — Chris StillsStudebaker — Jordan ZevonSentimental Hygiene — Marshall CrenshawAccidentally Like a Martyr — Billy ValentineSplendid Isolation — Phil Cody(Interlude 2 — strings)Mohammed’s Radio — Susan CowsillTenderness on the Block — Scott McCaugheyMonkey Wash, Donkey Rinse — Warren Zevon vocal track over live bandLife’ll Kill Ya — Jackson BrowneDesperados Under the Eaves — Jackson BrowneKeep Me in Your Heart — Jorge CalderónWerewolves of London — full castLawyers, Guns and Money — full cast\n",

The film, which debuted at the Busan International Film Festival, centers on gang underlings who, oddly, compete to avoid becoming the boss while pursuing personal ambitions.\n\n\tStop-motion classic “Coraline” followed with $412,856 (58,134 admissions), bringing its re-release cume to $1.5 million. Park Chan-wook’s “No Other Choice” was fifth with $327,571 (47,604 admissions) for a $19.6 million total. Lee Byung-hun plays Man-su, a laid-off paper manufacturing specialist who resorts to serial murder to eliminate his competitors for a single job opening, only to discover the position exists to supervise AI testing.\n\t\n\n\tIn sixth, Japanese hit “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” added $316,549 (41,857 admissions) to reach $41.7 million.\n\n\t“Jujutsu Kaisen: Hidden Inventory / Premature Death – The Movie” placed seventh with $235,455 (33,813 admissions; $1.3 million cume). “One Battle After Another” was eighth with $191,265 (24,938 admissions; $3.68 million cume). \n\n\tAcclaimed Korean drama “The World of Love” debuted ninth with $148,882 (21,876 admissions). Directed by Yoon Ga-eun, known for “The World of Us” (Berlinale 2016) and “The House of Us” (BFI London 2019), the drama centers on 17-year-old Lee Jooin (Seo Su-bin), an unpredictable high school student whose angry outburst creates ripple effects throughout her world. The film world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and took home both the Roberto Rossellini Awards Jury Prize and the People’s Choice Award in the Pingyao International Film Festival‘s Crouching Tigers section.\n\n\t“Weapons” rounded out the top ten with $69,110 (9,428 admissions; $532,008 total).\n\n\tContinuing its spiralling trajectory, the top 10 titles collectively earned $4.7 million over the Oct. 24–26 frame, down from $5.06 million the previous week. \n",

    "body": "Vogue World took over the Paramount Studios lot in Los Angeles on Sunday night.\nThe magazine’s fashion show extravaganza — officially titled Vogue World: Hollywood 2025 — featured designer looks inspired by some of Hollywood’s most celebrated costume designers.\nMcQueen, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, ALAÏA, Marc Jacobs, Valentino and Balmain teamed up with costume designers Colleen Atwood, Milena Canonero, Ruth E. Carter, Catherine Martin, Arianne Phillips, Sandy Powell, Jacqueline West and Shirley Kurata for the star-studded runway show.\nThe fashion show was a pseudo film shoot being directed by Baz Luhrmann with Nicole Kidman opening the show by owning the runway in a sleek black gown.\nOther celebrity models included Ayo Edebiri, Greta Lee, Jeff Goldblum, sombr, Julia Garner, Jeremy Pope and Tyriq Withers. The 30-minute show was capped off by Angela Bassett reprising Queen Ramonda, her role in the “Black Panther” franchise, wearing one of the gowns she wore in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”\n“That was too much beauty in one blip of time,” Hilary Duff told me after the show wrapped. “I couldn’t get over how much fun it was. I was embarrassed taking so many photos and videos. It was gorgeous and light and fun. I was like, ‘I wanna get up there and walk!’”\nGracie Abrams and Doja Cat performed for a guest list that included Miley Cyrus, Cynthia Erivo, Hailey Bieber, Tracee Ellis Ross, Lizzo, Henry Golding, mgk, Demi Lovato, Kathryn Hahn, Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, Taika Waititi, Rita Ora, Olivia Munn, Camila Cabello, Jennifer Hudson, Camila Mendes, Chloe Fineman, Mandy Moore and Juliette Lewis.\nBenito Skinner and Rachel Sennott were practically bouncing off the walls of the storied studio lot with excitement after the show. “It was electrifying. I loved it. I was right there with Gracie Abrams,” Skinner said. “It was fantastic.”\nSennott said she “freaked” when she saw Edebiri walking in the show. “I screamed, but I was afraid to yell and distract,” she said. “Then I started yelling for each person and was like, ‘Someone will tell me if I have to be quiet.’”\n\nCheck out Vogue World: Hollywood 2025 photos below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNicole Kidman walks the runway during Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDakota Johnson\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDakota Johnson attends Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCamila Cabello and Benito Skinner\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCamila Cabello and Benito Skinner attend Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKathryn Hahan\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKathryn Hahn attends Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMiley Cyrus\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMiley Cyrus attends Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTracee Ellis Ross\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTracee Ellis Ross attends Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAngela Bassett\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAngela Bassett walks the runway during Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHenry Golding\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHenry Golding attends Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLizzo and Tyler Perry\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLizzo and Tyler Perry attend Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHilary Duff and Camila Cabello\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHilary Duff and Camila Cabello attend Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGracie Abrams\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGracie Abrams performs during Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJennifer Hudson\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJennifer Hudson attends Vogue World: Hollywood 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGavin Newsom and Anna Wintour\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Vogue\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCalifornia Gov.

The legal limit in the state is .08.\n      \n    \n          Peterson's a legendary NFL player ... appearing for seven teams across 15 seasons -- though he's best remembered for his incredible tenure with the Vikings.\n      \n    \n          Adrian was born in Palestine, TX ... a small town about three hours north of Sugar Land.\n      \n    \n          Story developing ...\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Adrian Peterson\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Drugs & Alcohol\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Football\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

The match sparked a heated rivalry that later led his wife to file a lawsuit and a restraining order against the MMA fighter, claiming he was incessantly bullying and trolling her.\n      \n    \n          The 40-year-old said Jake Paul is now the boxer in the family ... and it's hard to deny. He's been more active and holds the better pro record -- 12-1 compared to Logan's 0-1.\n      \n    \n          Speaking of Jake, he's been going viral online, but not for something he did.\n      \n    \n          Tons of AI-generated videos featuring Jake have been popping up ... and people are shocked by how real they look -- including Mike.\n      \n    \n          \"They're gonna create A.I. freaking celebrity interactions,\" he said ... joking our interaction with him could be chalked up as an edit, too.\n      \n    \n          You can't beat the real thing, Mike!!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jake Paul\n              \n                          \n                Logan Paul\n              \n                          \n                Nina Agdal\n              \n                          \n                Dillon Danis\n              \n                          \n                Boxing\n              \n                          \n                Fights\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                YouTube\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tSXSW Sydney has canceled its 2026 edition and announced that the event will “conclude its run” in the Australian city. \n\n\tA statement shared by TEG said that the decision “reflects a changing global environment that is impacting major events, festivals and cultural programs worldwide”.\n\n\t“SXSW Sydney worked closely with the NSW Government and SXSW’s global owners, Penske Media Corporation to explore potential pathways forward for the event, however, prevailing market conditions mean the Sydney edition will not be going ahead at this time,” the statement added. \n\t\n\n\t“Between 2023 and 2025, SXSW Sydney generated an estimated $276 million in total economic impact. The event attracted more than 63,000 out-of-region attendees and recorded a 35% year-on-year growth in international visitation between 2024 and 2025. In 2025 alone, the event attracted a total attendance of more than 345,000, representing a 15% year-on-year increase.”\n\n\n\tSimon Cahill and Jono Whyman, SXSW Sydney co-managing directors, said in a joint statement: “SXSW Sydney would not have been possible without our partners, Destination NSW and SXSW, as well as those who contributed to the event – our speakers, sponsors, volunteers and attendees. SXSW Sydney was an unforgettable three-year journey, and we owe a debt of gratitude to the people who joined us for it.\n\n\tCahill and Whyman added, “We are especially grateful to the SXSW Sydney team for their dedication and hard work in bringing this event to life and establishing a platform that showcased Australia and the Asia-Pacific as pioneers in global culture.”\n\t\n\n\tOver its three-year run, SXSW Sydney attracted an array of high-profile talent, including Chance the Rapper, Nicole Kidman, Teddy Swims, The Kid LAROI and Paul Feig. \n",

    "body": "\n\tVirgil Films and IndieCan Entertainment have acquired North American rights to “She Was Here,” a feature documentary examining the life of Heather O’Rourke, the child actor who starred in the “Poltergeist” trilogy before her death at age 12.\n\n\tThe film will launch on VOD and digital platforms Feb. 24, with Kino Lorber handling DVD distribution the same day. The documentary arrives in what would have been O’Rourke’s 50th year.\n\n\n\tDirected by Brian Pocrass and Nick Bailey, the project was developed with complete participation from O’Rourke’s family members, who appear throughout the film. Producers are Reese Eveneshen and Avi Federgreen.\n\t\n\n\tO’Rourke gained fame at age five after Steven Spielberg cast her in “Poltergeist,” where she delivered the memorable line “They’re here…” Her tragic passing has been the subject of longstanding rumors about a “Poltergeist curse.”\n\n\tThe documentary aims to counter decades of internet speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding O’Rourke’s death by presenting an authorized account from those who knew her. The filmmakers secured access to the family’s private collection of diaries, letters, photographs and previously unseen home videos.\n\n\tThe film includes interviews with O’Rourke’s sisters Kathleen and Tammy O’Rourke, along with industry figures including Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Zach Galligan, Gary Sherman and Chris Alexander. Several participants are speaking publicly about O’Rourke for the first time.\n\n\tA trailer and poster for the documentary are being released to coincide with the anniversary milestone. Virgil Films will distribute in the U.S., with IndieCan Entertainment handling Canadian territories.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHBO’s new “Game of Thrones” spinoff series “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” has launched a tie-in with Zynga mobile game “Game of Thrones: Legends” featuring leading characters Ser Duncan the Tall and Egg.\n\n\tThe new additions to the Zynga game, licensed by Warner Bros. Interactive on behalf of HBO, come amid the Sunday premiere of “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” the latest “Game of Thrones” TV spinoff. \n\n\n\tThe RPG puzzle game will feature Duncan and Egg as two new “champion” options in the game, which already boasts a lineup including “GoT” fan-favorites like Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen and Rhaenyra Targaryen. \n\t\n\n\tIn the game, players build and lead their own Westeros house, honing their tactics and skills as they strategically assemble a team of champions, equip weapons and gear, and face formidable foes from the “Game of Thrones” universe in puzzle battles.\n\n\tSer Duncan will be available beginning Wednesday, while Egg will join the game Feb. 11 as “as a healer, best paired with his protector, Ser Duncan, for bonus healing and shield capabilities.”\n\n\tPer Zynga, “Ser Duncan the Tall joins as a Legendary Protector, who can be a key anchor for a player’s battle team. His skill allows him to retaliate against enemy attacks when the team’s weakest member is struck, and his passive ability can block incoming attacks from reaching their intended victims. He buys time for his allies, soaking up damage, to allow his allies to stack damage over time or to build effects like fire.”\n\n\tOn Feb. 4, “Legends” will launch a jousting mini-game as part of the “Tourney of Ashford Meadow” in-game event inspired by “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.”\n\t\n\n\t“In the upcoming Tourney at Ashford Meadow event, players will face off against rival knights in a joust. They will choose one of three virtues to leverage against their opponent–Speed, Power, or Aim–and compete against the rival knight’s own chosen virtue,” Zynga’s description reads. “Once the joust begins, the player will either win and proceed to another joust and greater rewards or lose everything they’ve won thus far. The fast-paced experience presents players with a series of high-risk, high-reward decisions, forcing them to choose between continuing to pursue greater glory or walking away with their winnings.”\n\n\t“As the ‘Game of Thrones’ universe continues to expand, so does the world we are building within ‘Game of Thrones: Legends’ by bringing new characters, storylines, and gameplay features to our loyal house of players,” Zynga mobile games executive producer Yaron Leyvand said. “Incorporating ‘A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms’ brings the number of in-game champions to over 150, allowing players to strategically build their ideal house to battle other dedicated fans in real-time, and to experience an authentic personalized story based on ‘Game of Thrones’ lore.”\n\n\tZynga’s mobile game “Game of Thrones: Slots” will also launch a tie-in for “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.” Dubbed “Tourney at Dusk,” the month-long takeover event will run throughout January, allowing players “the opportunity to engage with new themed content, rewards, and special quests focused on Ser Duncun as he begins his adventure within the Game of Thrones universe.”\n\n\tSee the reveal video for the “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” tie-in with “Game of Thrones: Legends” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAndreea Gleeson, CEO of the digital music distributor TuneCore, will be stepping down from her post, she announced Wednesday in an internal memo obtained by Variety. \n\n\tThe company’s leadership will be overseen by Romain Vivien, the France-based parent company Believe’s global head of music, with senior executives including chief revenue officer Brian Miller and chief technology and product officer Luxi Huang. A rep for the company tells Variety that Gleeson’s role will not be filled, although she will continue indefinitely as a strategic advisor for Believe.\n\t\n\n\tWhile TuneCore announced last year that independent artists have earned more than $5 billion through the company, in November 2024 it was hit with a $500 million copyright-infringement lawsuit from multiple labels, including Universal Music Group, Concord Music Group and ABKCO Music that claims Believe and TuneCore knowingly distributed infringing copies of sound recordings from artists including Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and others; the rep had no comment on the status of the lawsuit.\n\n\n\tIn 2023, TuneCore and Believe united with CD Baby and its parent company Downtown, DistroKid, UnitedMasters, Symphonic, Empire, and Vydia, along with digital service providers Spotify and Amazon Music, to create Music Fights Fraud, which was described as an industry-wide anti-fraud initiative. \n\n\tThat same year, the company commissioned a study on gender-based inequalities in music called “Be the Change.” \n\n\tGleeson joined the company as chief marketing officer in 2015 after stints at the retail giants Lord & Taylor and Hudson’s Bay, and was promoted to co-head and chief revenue officer in 2020, rising to CEO the following year. She was among the honorees at Variety‘s 2022 Power of Women: New York celebration. \n\t\n\n\tGleeson’s note, and one from Believe founder-CEO Denis Ladegaillerie, follow in full.\n\n\tAs I write this, I’m filled with pride, gratitude, and a deep sense of connection to all of you.\n\n\tAfter ten years at TuneCore, and with the company well-positioned for continued success, Believe and I have mutually agreed that the time is right for me to transition. Effective immediately, I’ll be moving from my role as CEO of TuneCore into a Strategic Advisor position for Believe.\n\n\tAs TuneCore enters this next phase from a position of strength, its mission remains: empower independent artists to succeed on their own terms, moving them from “access to success” through an efficient, automated platform. Moving forward, TuneCore will prioritize harnessing more fully the capabilities of Believe, to help artists grow globally. \n\n\tBelieve and I looked at what the future requires and agreed the best path is for me to support Believe’s executive team in an advisory capacity to continue building where I can have the greatest impact.\n\n\tLeading TuneCore has been one of the most meaningful chapters of my career. Together, we’ve transformed this company, expanding our global footprint, strengthening and modernizing the platform, and pivoting from just distribution to artist development by launching programs like TuneCore Accelerator to give artists deeper support, education, and access to real career-building opportunities. Through it all, we stayed true to what matters most: an artist-first mission and a belief in independence.\n\n\tNone of this happened because of one person. It happened because of all of you. Your creativity, resilience, ambition, and care for artists shaped TuneCore into what it is today. I’ve been continually inspired by the way this team shows up for each other and for the creators who trust us with their careers.\n\n\tTuneCore’s success has also been deeply connected to the Believe Group’s long-term vision and global scale, which allowed us to grow with purpose while serving independent artists at every stage of their journey. This planned transition reflects my confidence in the strength of this team and in TuneCore’s next phase of growth within the Believe ecosystem.\n\n\tWhile my role is changing, my belief in this company and in all of you is unwavering. Thank you for the trust, the hard work, the laughter, the late nights, and the shared wins. TuneCore will always be a part of who I am and I can’t wait to see what you build next.\n\t\n\n\tWith gratitude, Andreea\n\n\tDenis Ladegaillerie, Founder and CEO, Believe statement:\n\n\tWe are grateful to Andreea for her leadership of TuneCore and the lasting impact she has had on the business. Over the course of her tenure, TuneCore strengthened its platform, expanded its global reach, and deepened its commitment to artist success. Her work co-founding the Music Fights Fraud Alliance and advancing gender equity in the music industry reflects values that are at the heart of Believe and areas we will continue to prioritize.\n\n\tAs part of an evolution aligned with TuneCore’s next phase of growth and Believe’s long-term strategy, Andreea will transition into a Strategic Advisor role for Believe, where her experience and perspective will continue to support the Group at a strategic level.\n\n\tTuneCore leadership will continue to be overseen by Romain Vivien, Believe’s Global Head of Music, with senior executives including Chief Revenue Officer Brian Miller and Chief Technology and Product Officer Luxi Huang, to build on TuneCore’s strong momentum as we continue to invest in its future.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPlayboi Carti, YoungBoy Never Broke Again and Don Toliver will headline Rolling Loud, which has become arguably the world’s biggest hip-hop festival. While it traditionally has as many as three U.S. dates per year, in 2026 will make just one stop in the country: a three-day festival May 8–10, 2026 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. Tickets are available now.\n\n\tAdditional performers include EsDeeKid, Chief Keef, Sexyy Red, Fakemink, Destroy Lonely, BossMan Dlow, OsamaSon, Nettspend, PlaqueBoyMax, and 70-odd others.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Rolling Loud 2026 represents a new chapter for us,” says Rolling Loud co-founder Matt Zingler. “Orlando felt like the right place to evolve the festival. It’s a new city, a new venue, and a lineup that truly reflects where hip-hop is today. From the headliners to the rising artists, this year is about celebrating the full spectrum of the culture while delivering an unmatched experience for fans at a price that keeps Rolling Loud accessible.”\n\n\t“This lineup is a statement,” says Rolling Loud co-founder Tariq Cherif. “Playboi Carti, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, and Don Toliver each represent different forces shaping hip-hop right now, and bringing them together for our only U.S. festival of 2026 felt intentional. Eleven years in, Rolling Loud is still about putting the culture first and creating moments, elevating new voices, and building something that fans can feel proud to be part of.”\n\n\tGA passes start at $279 and VIP passes at $599.\n\n\tThe Rolling Loud World Tour is making its next stops in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia on March 7-8, 2026 with headliners Gunna and Ken Carson, plus Sexyy Red, Swae Lee, Tyga, Ski Mask The Slump God, Ian, Osamason and more.

    "body": "\n\tCan “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” claw to the top of the domestic box office, or will James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” rule for the fifth consecutive weekend?\n\n\t“The Bone Temple,” the fourth installment in Sony’s dystopian “28 Days Later” franchise, is aiming for $20 million to $22 million in its four-day domestic debut over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The film arrives about six months after its predecessor, “28 Years Later,” which opened last June to $30 million over the traditional three-day weekend. “28 Years Later” ended its run with a tidy $70 million in North America and $150 million globally against a $60 million budget. This zombie sequel carries a slightly higher $63 million price tag. \n\t\n\n\tDirected by Nia DaCosta and written by series creator Alex Garland, “The Bone Temple” takes place after the previous film and brings back Ralph Fiennes, Jack O’Connell and Alfie Williams as they continue to grapple with a Rage Virus that’s ravaging a post-apocalyptic Britain. The film could benefit from a dearth of competition as well as positive reviews. “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” currently holds a 94% Rotten Tomatoes average, with Variety’s chief film critic Peter Debruge writing that “it’s bold, mind-bending work which satisfies that so-often-frustrated craving for a zombie movie with brains.”\n\n\n\tElsewhere, Chloe Zhao’s Shakespearean tragedy “Hamnet” is expanding to 688 theaters after several weekends in limited release. The film, which just won the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama as well as a best actress trophy for star Jessie Buckley, has earned an impressive $13 million domestically during its platform rollout. \n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile the reigning box office champ “Avatar: Fire and Ash” is looking to add $12 million to $14 million over the four-day frame. Although a theatrical juggernaut with $1.23 billion globally, the third “Avatar” is running out of steam faster than its predecessors. To wit, the first two films were No. 1 at the box office for seven consecutive weekends, while the domination of “Fire and Ash” might end after five. Of course, Hollywood’s expectations for “Avatar 3” are stratospheric because the prior films, 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” stand as two of the biggest movies in history with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. (The director has joked that after assessing the financial results of the third installment, he’ll hold a press conference to determine whether he’ll proceed with “Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5.”) \n\n\tJanuary tends to be slower for movie theaters, at least compared to the summer months and holiday season. Hollywood has set a few potential hits in the first month of the year, however, including Amazon MGM’s sci-fi adventure “Mercy” with Chris Pratt, Sam Raimi’s survival horror film “Send Help” and the Jason Statham-led “Shelter.”\n\n\t“Patience we will be a virtue as we await some of the bigger openers on the way,” notes Comscore’s head of marketplace trends Paul Dergarabedian.\n",

    "body": "\n\tListen up: iHeartMedia announced nominations for the 2026 iHeartPodcast Awards in partnership with South by Southwest, to be hosted by comedian and podcaster Ego Nwodim.\n\n\tFor the second straight year, the iHeartPodcast Awards will be presented at ACL Live at the Moody Theater in Austin, Texas, at SXSW on Monday, March 16, starting at 7 p.m. CT.

    "body": "\n\tItalian director Alice Rohrwacher, known for highly original works “The Wonders,” “Happy as Lazzaro” and “La Chimera” — all of which competed at Cannes Film Festival — is taking her exploration of cinematic language to a bold new level by shooting a silent movie.\n\n\tRohrwacher, 44, who will be honored on Saturday in Berlin at the European Film Awards with the European Achievement in World Cinema prize, revealed this distinctive aspect of her next project to Variety during a wide-ranging interview. Reflecting on her illustrious career thus far, Rohrwacher says she has been “trying to understand why, in this world that is so battered with images, it’s still so necessary to rely on an image in order to deconstruct the images that surround us.”\n\t\n\n\tRohrwacher’s silent movie, which she is currently prepping — but is staying mum about in terms of details — will be “a great opportunity to really delve deeply into images” and “to find their power through subtraction,” she says. Below, Rohrwacher speaks more about receiving an EFA honor, the importance of her collaborators and what’s next.\n\n\t\n\t\tHow does it feel to get such an important honor after making just four features? \t\n\n\tWell, even though there are only four feature films, it’s been a long journey of discovery. Partly because between one film and the next, there have been shorts and various types of documentaries. But also because our approach is so curated, I’d say so deep, that it actually feels like I haven’t stopped for a moment. When they called and told me they were awarding me this prize, at first I thought there was a mistake. In the sense that, yes, it’s been a long journey. But that there’s still a very, very long journey to come. And this journey really has to do with trying to understand why in this world that is so battered with images, it’s still so necessary to rely on an image in order to deconstruct the images that surround us. But I thought, I’m lucky that they are giving me this award now, because this way I can be free to make even crazier and more wrong-headed films. I’ve already received this important and prestigious award. So now, even more so, it seems to me like a call to dare even more, to search even further.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn its motivation for the prize the EFA writes, “With a careful eye for the realities of a teenager’s life and a big heart for the countryside, she creates a unique universe for each of her films.” Do these words reflect your vision?\t\n\n\tIt’s a beautiful and moving motivation. The gaze of those who look at us always reveal things to us that perhaps we can’t yet understand from within. I believe that for me the word “teenager” isn’t really about a specific age, meaning it’s not about adolescence per se, but about an inner adolescence. Because if I think about the protagonists of my films, they’re not just teenagers — except, perhaps, the first two. Maybe they are instead all teenagers in the sense that they potentially haven’t yet figured out where they belong. This state of adolescence of the soul seems important to me. Because if I think about the world, as it is defined today, I can’t see myself in it.\n\n\tAnd the countryside?\n\n\tThe countryside, which is always a border land, a marginal place, is what attracts me most. Perhaps because it’s precisely at the borders that things can change, where there’s still potential for development and imagination. In some ways, largely populated cities have become fossilized in an old form. A form that was necessary in another era. Outside the cities I find potential for change. I find a world that my characters can inhabit.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve made all your features working with the great cinematographer Hélène Louvart. How is this collaboration an integral part of your work?\t\n\n\tWhat unites us with Hélène is, first and foremost, a spirit of adventure and exploration that begins before the film begins. What unites are questions about what we’re doing and how to do it. I feel a great desire to work with her, precisely because we’ve now established such a strong relationship that’s also a relationship of great freedom to dare and try. And perhaps make mistakes, and then discover something else. So, beyond just working with one of the greatest cinematographers whom I believe exist on the planet, it’s about working with someone who has both the wisdom and the recklessness to find diversity each time she approaches a film as something new. And I like this, because both in the relationship with the crew and in the relationship with the film, there’s always a sense of novelty and exploration.\n\t\n\n\tAll of your works are shot using different kinds of film stock but always on celluloid. Why?\n\n\tIt’s not so much the [visual] result that makes us choose film. Because we know full well that the analog effect can now be achieved with digital. But it’s a question of method. Film requires us to be much more careful and thoughtful about how to use it, because it’s limited. And where we’re faced with a limited resource, we develop creativity and imagination more. At least, that’s my feeling. Let’s hope the laboratories survive, because cinema is certainly not just a result, but also a process and a method. And it’s no coincidence that cinema was born with film.\n\t\n\t\tTell me about working with Carlo Cresto-Dina and his Tempesta company, which has shepherded all your films to date.\t\n\n\t[He] gave me the opportunity, and believed in what I could do before anyone else. He did this in a very instinctive way, without much basis to go on. Because when I made my first feature, I’d never made a short. I’d never worked with a crew. And so he was certainly very courageous, and that deserves recognition. I think this shows in the fact that this relationship has lasted so long, that somehow courage is something that unites us.\n\t\n\t\tCan you tell me what your next project is? \t\n\n\tI am working at more than one at the same time. My next project will be a silent movie, precisely in order to have this great opportunity to really delve deeply into images, to find their power through subtraction. Because of my great desire to use the image, the actor, and try to strip away everything that’s superfluous in the story and to see what we can still do [with that] today. I think that in any case silent cinema, and especially European silent cinema — the work of the great European masters — isn’t merely something that came before talking cinema. It’s a completely different medium of expression. And so I hope to be able to experiment with it.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

Sabula admitted to The Washington Post to being the individual who shouted at the prez.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Sabula told the Washington Post ... \"I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity. And today I think I did that.\"\n      \n    \n          It's unclear if his suspension is paid ... the union tells TMZ they are exploring next steps.\n      \n\n          Sabula feels no remorse about the scene he caused, telling WP ... \"As far as calling him out, definitely no regrets whatsoever.\" However, he is concerned about his job and future employment, telling the Post he feels he was \"targeted for political retribution\" for \"embarrassing Trump in front of his friends.\"\n      \n    \n                    \n                          \n                                  \n      \n        \n    \n          He told the Washington Post he was yelling specifically about the Epstein Files.\n      \n    \n          We showed you the video -- a man yelled out at Trump as he was walking through the factory ... and it clearly got under his skin. In response, the 47th President of the United States mouthed \"F*** you\" to the man before flipping him off.\n      \n    \n          Just like Sabula has no regrets about the ideal, Trump didn't either. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung justified his reaction, telling TMZ ... \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"\n      \n    \n          There is now not one but 2 GoFundMe pages created for Sabula, with one just passing the $200,000 mark and the other sitting just above $50,000.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",
